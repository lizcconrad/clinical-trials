    <textblock>
      Apnea test (AT) is the most important clinical test performed usually at the end of brain
      death (BD) diagnosis procedure. Traditional insufflation apnea test (I-AT) cannot be
      completed in patients with extremely compromised lung function due to rapid blood
      desaturation and circulatory disturbances. Therefore the investigators decided to verify
      alternative AT options such as continuous positive airway pressure apnea test (CPAP-AT) in
      patients with good and poor baseline oxygenation, before implementing them in currently
      reviewed Polish BD criteria.

      Apnea test (AT) is one of the most important examination during the diagnosis of brain death.
      It is usually performed at the end of each series of clinical examinations during diagnostic
      process. The most popular standard insufflation apnea test (I-AT) may be potentially harmful.
      It may cause some serious complications including pneumothorax, severe hypoxemia, hemodynamic
      instability and even cardiac arrest. Therefore, the investigators decided to analyze apnea
      test in CPAP option (CPAP-AT) as a new tool. For safety of the study the investigators
      analyzed a method after BD diagnosis.

      Methods:

      I-AT and hypoventilation with 100 % oxygen (if needed) were performed according to Polish
      guidelines. Two hours after BD diagnosis was performed extra apnea test in CPAP option
      (CPAP-AT). Before CPAP-AT the patients were ventilated 100% oxygen. After then the ventilator
      settings were changed to CPAP mode with PEEP 10 cm H2O, PS 0 cm H2O, FiO2 1,0, flow 6L/min.
      Emergency apnea ventilation was turned off. At the beginning of CPAP mode and 10 minutes
      after, blood samples for arterial blood gases (ABG) were collected. If were observed rapid
      desaturation defined as a decline in O2 saturation below 85%, CPAP-AT was aborted and study
      was finished.

      During routine diagnosis of brain death, pupillary dilation after a neck flexion was observed
      in one case. Therefore, the investigators decided to use a pupillometer during brain death
      examination to find out how pupils react after a neck flexion and how often it happens.

      Pupil measurements were taken immediately after the diagnosis of brain death. The
      measurements of pupil diameter were taken twice: A - before neck flexion; B - after neck
      flexion. We used pupillometer: AlgiScan (Equip Medkey BV).

    <description>After 2 hours from I-AT was performed the alternative AT by CPAP ventilation mode. Before CPAP-AT the patients were ventilated 100% oxygen. After then the ventilator parameters were modified to: 0 H2O of pressure support (PS), 10 cm H2O of PEEP, 6l/min of O2 flow and 0.2 l/min of sensitivity. Before the test and 10 minutes after then was taken blood probe to ABG and type of ventilation change to pretest settings. The test is considered valid if there is no respiratory activity despite the rise of PaCO2 above 60mmHg and over 20mmHg above the baseline. If the investigators observe rapid desaturation defined as a decline in O2 saturation below 85%, CPAP-AT was aborterd.</description>
