  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to get a better understanding of the impact of the skin condition,
      Hidradenitis Suppurativa, on quality of life function of patients with this condition.
      Patients with HS will be asked questions about demographics including gender, age, and
      ethnicity. They will also be asked to complete questionnaires to determine how their skin
      condition affects their life. Study participation will last for 1 day, with potential for
      follow-up in the future.We hope this information will help us improve our treatment for this
      skin condition.

      The goal of this study is to get a better understanding of the impact of the skin condition,
      Hidradenitis Suppurativa, on quality of life function of patients with this condition.
      Patients with HS will be asked questions about demographics including gender, age, and
      ethnicity. They will also be asked to complete questionnaires to determine how their skin
      condition affects their life. The questionnaires include Beck Depression Inventory form,
      which gives us information how you feel about your skin condition and how it changes your
      mood; Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), which gives us information about how your skin
      condition affects your quality of life; Skindex, which gives us more specific information
      about how your skin condition affects your quality of life; SF-36 health survey, which gives
      us information about your general health status; the Quality of Life Enjoyment and
      Satisfaction Questionnaire- short form (Q-LES-Q-SF), which gives us information on your
      enjoyment and satisfaction of your life; and the Employment/Productivity Health Economic
      Questionnaire, which will give us more information on your work and school status as well as
      household income. Study participation will last for 1 day, with potential for follow-up in
      the future. Through potential follow up visits we hope to determine the longitudinal effect
      of treatment modalities on QoL through future survey performance of the patient cohort. We
      hope this information will help us improve our treatment for this skin condition.
