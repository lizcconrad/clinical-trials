  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 76-week, 3-part Phase 1b/2 study is intended to evaluate the pharmacological properties
      (pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics), safety, tolerability and preliminary effectiveness
      of TOFA administrated to young adults (18-30 years) with moderately to severely active
      SLE-CL. Subjects will be studied at the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC)
      and recruited locally.

      Cohort 1 (n=10, weight &gt; 40kg and age &gt; 18 years and ≤ 30 years ) will undergo intense
      PK-sampling to determine exposures following TOFA dosed at 5 mg BID. TOFA dose escalation
      will not be considered for inadequate response of SLE-CL.

      Cohort 2 (n=10, weight &gt; 40kg and age &gt; 18 years and ≤ 30 years) will be treated with the
      same dose as Cohort 1. No PK sampling will occur for Cohort 2. Enrollment of Cohort 2 will
      only start once Cohort 1 has completed 8 weeks of TOFA and results of PK analyses from Cohort
      1 are available.

        -  Part A (up to week 8) requires stable background medications;

        -  Part B (up to week 24) allows for tapering of corticosteroids (CS) in the setting of
           significant clinical improvement of SLE-CL as defined by a decrease in Cutaneous Lupus
           Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index (CLASI) activity score by &gt;50% from
           baseline , and

        -  Part C (until week 76) permits tapering of other background medications in subjects with
           clinical remission of SLE- CL (CLASI activity score=0). TOFA dosing is kept stable
           during Part C.
