  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, open label, controlled, parallel group study to investigate difference between
      regional standard procedure and a novel modified procedure (using an additional novel device
      to facilitate gel installation) for changing long-term indwelling urinary catheters.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open label, controlled, parallel group study, which comprises one visit
      that includes: assessment for eligibility, randomization to one of two treatment
      alternatives, followed by the actual intervention and evaluation of outcomes.

      The interventions are either change of catheter according to the regional standard procedure
      (the comparator group) or change of catheter with the additional use of the novel device to
      facilitate gel instillation and a slightly modified procedure (the experimental group).
