  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis is a chronic autoimmune, inflammatory neurological disease of the central
      nervous system. It is the most common disabling neurologic disease of young people. This
      study is planned for the evaluation of efficacy, safety and tolerability of neuropeptide
      combination of metenkefalin and tridecactide (EK-12) as compared to INF beta-1a (REBIF®) in
      patients with RRMS. The primary objective of this study is to prove the superiority of
      efficacy of neuropeptide combination of metenkefalin and tridecactide (EK-12) compared to INF
      beta-1a (REBIF®) in patients with RRMS on the basis of annualized protocol defined relapse
      rate by 144 weeks.

    <masking_description>A blinded examining neurologist/assessor will conduct neurological examinations, relapse and EDSS evaluations at each site. Treating investigators will not be blinded to the study treatment. Additionally, blinded evaluation of MRI scans will be performed at a central reading facility in which, anonymized and standardized images of patient with RRMS will be read by a treatment blinded assessor and data will be implemented in a post-hoc analysis for selected time-points.</masking_description>

               3. A Central Nervous System (CNS) disorder other than MS that may jeopardize the
                  patient's participation in the study, including such disorders that are
                  demonstrated at the baseline MRI scan.
