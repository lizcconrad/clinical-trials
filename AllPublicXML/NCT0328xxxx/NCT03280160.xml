  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on the promising results obtained with ibrutinib as single agent, the results obtained
      with ibrutinib in combination with ofatumumab in a previous phase I/IIb study (Jaglowski
      2015), and since data from in vitro studies do not support a synergistic effect of the
      combination of ibrutinib and anti-CD20 mAbs, we propose a chemotherapy-free combined strategy
      based on ibrutinib monotherapy as front line treatment for patients with CLL, with the
      addition of a consolidation phase with ofatumumab in patients not attaining CR under
      ibrutinib in order to improve the quality of their response. Since median time to CR with
      ibrutinib was nearly 12 months, patients will be evaluated at this time point, and those
      patients not in CR will add consolidated treatment with Ofatumumab. Thus, this multi-center,
      non-randomized phase 2 study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ibrutinib
      alone or in combination with Ofatumumab in patients no attaining CR under ibrutinib as
      front-line therapy for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

      Multicenter, non- randomized, open-label, double agent, phase II study of the Spanish Group
      of CLL (GELLC).

      Patients with untreated CLL/SLL. Ibrutinib will be administered orally 420 mg (3 x 140 mg
      capsules) once daily on a continuous schedule on an outpatient basis until disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After 12 cycles of ibrutinib, patients that do not achieve a complete response (CR) will be
      treated with the combination of ibrutinib and ofatumumab. Patients in CR after 12 cycles of
      ibrutinib will continue with ibrutinib alone.

      Ofatumumab will be administered by IV infusion, 300mg on Day 1 and 1,000 mg on Day 8 of cycle
      13, followed by 5 monthly infusions of 1,000 mg (Day 1 of subsequent 28-day cycles for cycles
      C14, C15, C16, C17, and C18).

      A treatment cycle will be defined as lasting 28 days. Patients will be treated with
      ibrutinib, within the study frame, until progression, unacceptable toxicity or cycle C42 of
      treatment).

      All patients still on study treatment at the time of cycle C42, or if the study is stopped
      early, will be transitioned to prescribed ibrutinib.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patients with previously untreated CLL or SLL defined following IWCLL criteria
             (Hallek, 2008).

          -  Must understand and voluntarily sign an informed consent form.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years at the time of signing the informed consent form and must be able to
             adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements.

          -  Must have a documented diagnosis of CLL or SLL [IWCLL guidelines for diagnosis and
             treatment of CLL (Hallek, 2008)] meeting at least one of the following criteria:

        Evidence of progressive marrow failure as manifested by the development of, or worsening
        of, anemia and/or thrombocytopenia.

        Massive (i.e. &gt; 6 cm below the left costal margin) or progressive or symptomatic
        splenomegaly.

        Massive nodes (i.e. &gt; 10 cm in longest diameter) or progressive or symptomatic
        lymphadenopathy.

        Progressive lymphocytosis with an increase of &gt; 50% over a 2-month period, or lymphocyte
        doubling time (LDT) of less than 6 months.

        A minimum of any one of the following disease-related symptoms: unintentional weight loss ≥
        10% within the previous 6 months, significant fatigue (i.e., ECOG PS 2; cannot work or
        unable to perform usual activities), fevers of greater than 38.0° C or 100.5F for 2 or more
        weeks without other evidence of infection, or night sweats for more than 1 month without
        evidence of infection

          -  Physically fit patients defined as CIRS &lt; 6 (CIRS Scale, Appendix E).

          -  Must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of ≤2.

          -  All sexually active subjects with the capacity to reproduce (male and female) must use
             high-efficacy contraceptive methods during the course of the study. These restrictions
             apply for 12 months after the last dose of ofatumumab or 3 months after the last dose
             of ibrutinib, whichever happens later. High-efficacy contraceptive methods include:

        Total abstinence when consistent with the subject's typical and preferred lifestyle
        (periodic abstinence [e.g. calendar methods, ovulation, symptothermal and post-ovulation
        methods] and the withdrawal method are not acceptable contraceptive methods).

        Female sterilisation defined as surgical hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or tubal
        ligation at least six weeks prior to the study treatment (a simple oophorectomy does not
        meet the definition of female sterilisation).

        Male sterilisation (at least six months before screening). A man who has undergone a
        vasectomy must be the only partner who is a study subject.

        Combination of two of the following methods (a+b or a+c or b+c):

          1. Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal contraceptives, or other hormonal
             contraceptive methods that have a comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt; 1%), for
             example, hormonal vaginal ring or transdermal hormonal contraceptive. If an oral
             contraceptive is used, women must use the same pill for a minimum of three months
             before taking the study treatment.

          2. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or an intrauterine system (IUS).

          3. Barrier contraceptive methods: condom or cervical cap (cervical/vault diaphragm or
             cap) with foam/gel/film/spermicidal cream/vaginal suppository.

               -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at
                  screening. Females of child bearing potential are defined as sexually mature
                  women without prior hysterectomy or who have had any evidence of menses in the
                  past 12 months. However, women who have been amenorrheic for 12 or more months
                  are still considered to be of childbearing potential if the amenorrhea is
                  possibly due to other causes, including prior chemotherapy, anti-estrogens, or
                  ovarian suppression

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior treatment for CLL or SLL.

          -  Any serious medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that
             would prevent the patient from signing the informed consent form.

          -  Systemic infection that has not resolved prior to initiating study treatment in spite
             of adequate anti-infective therapy.

          -  Pregnant or lactating females.

          -  Participation in any clinical study or having taken any investigational therapy within
             28 days prior to initiating study therapy.

          -  Central nervous system (CNS) involvement as documented by spinal fluid cytology or
             imaging.

          -  Prior history of malignancies, other than CLL, unless the patient has been free of the
             disease for ≥ 3 years.

        Exceptions include the following:

        Basal cell carcinoma of the skin Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin Carcinoma in situ of
        the cervix Carcinoma in situ of the breast Incidental histologic finding of prostate cancer
        (TNM stage of T1a or T1b)

          -  Known Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) and/or Hepatitis C
             Virus (HCV) infection.

        glutamic-oxaloacetictransaminase (SGOT) or alanine transaminase (ALT)/serum glutamate
        pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) &gt;3 x upper limit of normal (ULN).

        Serum total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x ULN, except in cases of Gilbert's syndrome.

          -  Presence of autoimmune haemolytic anemia or autoimmune thrombocytopenia.

          -  Disease transformation [i.e. Richter's Syndrome (lymphomas) or prolymphocytic

             antagonists within 28 days of first dose of study drug.

          -  Any life-threatening illness, medical condition, or organ system dysfunction which, in
             the investigator's opinion, could compromise the subject's safety, interfere with the
             absorption or metabolism of ibrutinib capsules, or put the study outcomes at undue
             risk.
