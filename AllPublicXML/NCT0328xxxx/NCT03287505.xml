      This study assess pharmacokinetics and safety of single-administration of Aripiprazole IM
      Depot formulation at doses of 300 and 400mg in patients with schizophrenia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, a single-center, single-dose, single-administration trial will be carried out
      in patients with schizophrenia diagnosed pursuant to The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
      Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR), to evaluate pharmacokinetics and safety of
      single-administration aripiprazole IM Depot (300/400 mg) after its administration in 24
      patients with oral tolerance of this drug.

      In this study, the washout period before administration is designed as a 35-day duration
      before administration of the investigational drug (aripiprazoleIM Depot), screening period a
      4-week duration (28 days) before administration of the investigational drug, observation
      period after administration a 20-week duration after administration of the investigational
      drug and hospital stay a minimum 35-day duration after administration of the investigational
      drug.
