      This study is a prospective,single-center,single arm,Ⅱ exploratory study.To explore the
      clinical study of the efficacy and safety of the treatment of vegfr-2 high expression by
      apatinib mesilate.The main research object for first-line treatment failure Ⅲ/Ⅳ integration
      of a period of esophageal or gastric esophagus cancer patients.The main purpose of the study
      was to evaluate apatinib for the median PFS of the esophageal and esophageal gastric junction
      carcinoma of the esophagus with high expression of VEGFR-2. The objective of secondary
      research is to evaluate the safety of apatinib for second-line treatment of esophageal and
      esophageal gastric junction cancer Objective Response Rate (CR + PR) and median OS and
      explore the relationship between VEGFR-2 high expression and apatinib efficacy and related
      prognostic factors. Thirty patients were enrolled in the study group. The group was expected
      to be enrolled in the group for 24 months, followed by 6 months of follow-up and 6 months of
      data statistics. The drug regimen was a single drug apatinib 500mg qd Po.Please refer to the
      CRF table for details.
