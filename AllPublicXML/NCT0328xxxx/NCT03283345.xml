  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is aimed to evaluate pathophysiology of systemic responses to trauma via using interleukin
      (IL) -1 and IL-6 levels and determining timing of surgery through phases of menstrual cycle.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      89 female breast cancer patient who underwent modified radical mastectomy included into
      study. Menstrual history and hormone levels were used to determine menstrual phase: luteal,
      follicular, and other. IL-1β and IL-6 levels, which are related to severeness of
      inflammation, were measured one day before and one day after surgery. Those are statistically
      analysed to show effect of timing of breast surgery on responses to trauma in postmenopausal
      and premenopausal women during different phases of their menstrual cycles
