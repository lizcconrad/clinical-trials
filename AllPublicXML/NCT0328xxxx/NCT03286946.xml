    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the incidence of intravascular injection during cervical transforaminal
      epidural block using blunt needle, compared to the sharp needle. The investigators will
      performed cervical transforaminal epidural block using blunt-type block needle in half of
      participants or sharp-type block needle in the other half.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cervical transforaminal epidural block is an effective treatment option of radiating pain.
      There are potential risks associated with transforaminal epidural block such as infection,
      dural puncture, bleeding, and intravascular injection. Although the risk is low,
      intravascular injection should be carefully monitored because intravascular injection of
      particulate steroids can cause fatal neurologic deficits such as spinal infarction and
      cerebral infarction.

      The incidence of intravascular injection during transforaminal epidural block with real time
      fluoroscopy guidance depends on spinal level. The previous studies using real time
      fluoroscopy demonstrated that the incidence of intravascular injection of cervical
      transforaminal epidural block is higher than that of lumbosacral transforaminal epidural
      block.

      In this study, therefore, the investigators investigate the incidence of intravascular
      injection during cervical transforaminal epidural block using blunt needle, compared to the
      sharp needle.

    <description>Intravascular injection was defined as contrast media spreading out through the vascular channel during injection of contrast media under real time fluoroscopy. The investigators observed the intravascular injection during the procedure. The intravascular injection rate was calculated based on the total number of treated levels.</description>
