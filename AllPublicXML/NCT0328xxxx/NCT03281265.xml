    <textblock>
      The definition and diagnostic criteria of Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) has been well
      established by EASL CANONIC study. However, patients with high risk to develop ACLF has not
      been determined, yet. The aim of current study is to establish a preliminary pre-ACLF
      definition, and to demonstrate the corresponding risk factors.
