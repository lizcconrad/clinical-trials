  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) represents a major problem in intensive care unit (ICU)
      patients. Despite the use of recommended pharmacological prophylaxis with low molecular
      weight heparin (LMWH), the incidence of DVT during ICU stay has been reported between 5 and
      15 %. The incidence may vary due to many factors, for example the type of ICU population, the
      type of protocol of pharmacological prophylaxis and also the type of diagnostic approach.
      Before formerly planned clinical study targeted to lower DVT incidence by individualizing the
      dose of LMWH, the investigators decided to evaluate the real DVT incidence in the
      investigated ICU. The prevalence and incidence will be assessed by ultrasound testing in
      general ICU patients. on the sample of 200 patients. The investigators hypothesize DVT
      incidence of 5 %. The compliance to the local DVT prophylaxis protocol will be also
      evaluated.

      Type of the study: Observational prospective cohort study. Hypothesis: Despite appropriate
      prophylaxis of deep venous thrombosis in general ICU patients in accordance with the current
      guidelines, the incidence of deep venous thrombosis is 5 - 10%.

      Sample size: 200 consecutive general ICU patients. Inclusion and exclusion criteria: defined
      in the Eligibility section. Protocol description: All patients admitted to ICU with expected
      period of the stay longer than 72 hours will be evaluated for the presence of deep venous
      thrombosis by ultrasound testing during the first 48 hours of ICU stay. Thereafter, each
      participant will be examined by ultrasound testing twice a week until the discharge from ICU.
      All patients will receive deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis following the current
      guidelines. All patients with positive finding of deep venous thrombosis will be managed in
      accordance with the current guidelines.

      Ultrasound examination for deep venous thrombosis: Ultrasound compression test at the
      following locations: common femoral vein at the groin, deep femoral vein, popliteal vein,
      both extremities.

    <description>No intervention is associated with inclusion to the study (observational study). Included will be all patients admitted to general ICU with ICU stay &gt;72 hours, having deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis appropriate to clinical setting and following the recent guidelines. All study participants will undergo repeated noninvasive ultrasound testing for deep venous thrombosis, which is normal part of the routine care in our ICU.</description>
