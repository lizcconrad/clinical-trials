  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Difficulties enrolling patients in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have long been
      recognized as a major barrier to successful evaluation of medical interventions. This is
      particularly problematic among intensive care unit (ICU) trials, of which more than one-third
      do not reach target enrollment. Under-enrollment and selective enrollment reduce RCTs'
      abilities to answer the research questions, thereby degrading the trials' scientific value
      and ethics.

      Current evidence suggests that financial incentives can ethically increase study enrollment,
      but this approach can pose large up-front costs to researchers. However, several nonmonetary
      behavioral interventions, or nudges, may offer novel and easily scalable approaches to
      increase enrollment in RCTs.

      The investigation team propose a 3-arm RCT in 5 ICUs at Penn to test the relative
      effectiveness of 2 different nudges on enrollment rates. Investigators hypothesize that a
      bundle of nudges during recruitment will increase enrollment rates compared to usual
      recruitment procedures, and that requiring participants to make a choice to participate or
      not, with enhanced information about each option, will increase enrollment.

      Investigators will enroll 273 critically ill patients' surrogate decision
      makers(participants) to engage in recruitment procedures for a simulated RCT comparing two
      oxygen saturation targets among mechanically ventilated patients. Investigators will also
      measure participants' assessment of risk of the simulated trial after the informed consent
      process. This work will provide the first empirical evidence regarding the efficacy of two
      inexpensive, scalable nudges to potentially augment enrollment and reduce costs of future
      clinical trials.

    <measure>Risk Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 96 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Secondarily we will quantitatively assess the participant's assessment of the risk of participating in the simulated RCT. The risk assessment tool has been previously used in the assessment of risk perception of RCT participation in the setting of behavioral economic nudges. The risk assessment will be used to evaluate participants' impressions of the risk of participating in the RCT using a Likert scale ranging from 1 (Not risky at all) to 7 (very risky), as well as 9 comparative questions, each of which asks whether a study procedure was riskier than another risky activity, such as talking on one's cell phone while driving.</description>

    <description>Arm 1 will be administered a novel pre-consent nudge bundle which incorporates several behavioral economic interventions within a brief survey. Participants will subsequently be asked by the same research personnel to participate in a simulated randomized control trial (RCT) comparing two oxygen saturation targets among mechanically ventilated patients. Participants will receive the standard consent form followed by a risk assessment and demographic survey.</description>

    <description>Participants in arm 2 will be approached by the research personnel to participate in a simulated RCT comparing two oxygen saturation targets among mechanically ventilated patients. Participants will receive a consent form which includes enhanced active choice. The enhanced active choice form includes a nudge whereby the available options for participating in the RCT, YES or NO, highlight the costs and benefits of participating versus not participating, Following the consent process participants will conduct the same risk assessment survey and demographic survey.</description>

    <description>Arm 3 will serve as the control arm. Participants will be approached by the research personnel to participate in a simulated RCT comparing two oxygen saturation targets among mechanically ventilated patients. Participants will receive a standard consent form as detailed in the Study Instruments section. Following the consent process participants will conduct the same risk assessment survey and demographic survey.</description>

    <intervention_name>Pre-Consent Nudge Bundle</intervention_name>
    <description>The pre-consent nudge bundle survey was developed by the study team and incorporates several behavioral interventions into a bundle of 5 types of nudges: (i) injunctive norms; (ii) descriptive norms; (iii) duty of reciprocity; (iv) self-prophecy; and (v) foot-in-the-door. Injunctive norms involve the perception of what behavior is acceptable, while descriptive norms highlight what behaviors others are engaging in. The duty of reciprocity is the sense that one should repeat pro-social behavior for which they have benefited from. The foot-in-the-door nudge involves asking a participant to perform a small request which has a high consent rate followed by a larger request. The bundle consists of six questions and one statement.</description>

    <description>The enhanced active choice consent includes a nudge whereby the available options for participating in the RCT, YES or NO, highlight the costs and benefits of participating versus not participating, respectively, and participants are required to make an active decision to participate or not by having to sign and date the form next to their choice.</description>
