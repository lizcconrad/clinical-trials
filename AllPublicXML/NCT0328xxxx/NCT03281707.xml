  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the association between near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and indexed
      oxygen delivery (DO2i) and their possible correlation with postoperative organ failure.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Literature evidences show that levels of DO2i under 262-272 mL/min/m2 during cardiopulmonary
      by-pass (CPB) are associated with an increased incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI).

      Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that keeping a NIRS of 75-80% compared to the basal
      value reduces the risk of perioperative morbidity. On the other hand, a NIRS &lt; 50% of basal
      value seems to be predictive of an increase in morbidity.

      All of those studies had been performed during CPB and knowledge lacks in management of DO2i
      and NIRS before and after CPB.
