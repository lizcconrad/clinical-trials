      Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of
      H.P. Acthar Gel 80 U/ml in subjects with a documented clinical diagnosis of dry eye disease.

      Study Population: The study population will consist of subjects diagnosed with dry eye
      disease.

      Number of Subjects: Approximately 12 subjects

      Investigational Product: H.P. Acthar Gel 80 U/ml sufficient for the duration of the study
      will be supplied by Mallinkrodt to the enrolled subjects

      Route and Duration of Administration: Product will be injected subcutaneously weekly by
      subjects for approximately 12 weeks.

      Study Design: This is a Phase 4, single center single arm study designed to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of H.P. Achthar Gel in subjects with dry eye disease.

      Approximately 25 subjects will be screened and 12 subjects enrolled at one center in the
      United States.

      Subjects will be given 80 international units of study medication subcutaneously depending on
      the severity of the disease as determined by the primary investigator.

      The study will include 3 study visits over 12 weeks. At Visit 1 Screening (14 +/- 1 days
      prior to Day 1), subjects meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria will begin investigational
      drug use. Subjects will return for evaluations at Visit 2 (Day 42+/-3 days) and Visit 3 (Day
      84 +/-5 days). Subjects will be released from the study at the end of Visit 3 (Day 84+/- 5
      days.)

    <description>Subjects will be asked to subjectively rate their eye dryness at Visit 1,2 and 3. Subjects will be instructed to rate eye dryness using the scale below. The total length of the line from &quot;no dryness&quot; to &quot;maximal dryness&quot; is 100 mm. The length of the line between the &quot;no dryness&quot; starting point and the first point at which the subject mark crosses the line will be measured in mm. This assessment is a general assessment of both eyes.</description>
