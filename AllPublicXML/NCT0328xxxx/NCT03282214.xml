  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to examine a 12-week self-management energy conservation
      program (ECAM)'s effects on fatigue, and secondarily on sleep, physical activity, anxiety and
      depression, self-efficacy, and beliefs about fatigue in a group of Thai women with breast
      cancer who are undergoing chemotherapy. We will also evaluate how well women like the
      intervention, how easy it is to use and whether women will do the activities.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer-related fatigue is a distressing and multidimensional symptom. Research in the US has
      explored the efficacy of energy conservation interventions for fatigue and related symptoms
      but no previous ECAM programs have been tested in Thailand.

    <measure>Acceptability</measure>
    <time_frame>at 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Open-ended questions will be used to ask about the most positive and negative aspects of the intervention, what modules did they use the most, what were barriers to using the intervention, what would they like to see added or deleted in future modules, and any suggestions on how the program could be improved.</description>

    <measure>Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>at 12 weeks</time_frame>

    <measure>Physical Activity (subjective measure)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline GSLTPAG scores at 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Godin Leisure-Time Physical Activity Questionnaire (GSLTPAQ): A 4-item self-administered questionnaire asking information about the number of times one engages in mild, moderate, and strenuous leisure-time physical activity bouts of at least 15 minutes duration in a week, and also asking how often participants typically engage in any regular activity until sweating or a racing heart on a scale of often, sometimes, never or rarely.</description>

    <measure>Physical Activity (objective measure)</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline steps per day at 12 weeks</time_frame>

    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline HADS scores at 12 weeks</time_frame>

    <time_frame>Change from baseline SEMCDS scores at 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This 6-item scale contain items will be used to measures self-reported current level of confidence to manage control the patient's symptoms, role function, emotional functioning, and communicating with physicians.</description>

    <description>The participants will be given two pamphlets (general issues about breast cancer and self-care activities for patients receiving chemotherapy) provided by the health care team at the study sites. The participants in the control group will be encouraged to maintain their current daily activities during the 12-week period The participants will wear a pedometer to record the number of steps which is one of the activity outcomes.</description>

    <description>The experimental group will receive four sessions approximately every three weeks with the PI. These sessions will correspond to the cycles of chemotherapy they will receive, with the first two sessions being during cycle 1, and sessions 3 and 4 being during cycles 2 and 3 of chemotherapy, respectively. The women will be instructed on how to assess their activity patterns by making a list prioritizing their usual activities. The journal and priority list (a &quot;to do&quot; list) provide the basis for the second session. In this session, the participant will learn to create a plan for managing valued activities to minimize the amount of energy used, to report the fatigue experienced during and after an activity done in the journal and will learn strategies to manage fatigue and optimize activity. In the third session, the participant will evaluate and revise their individualized plan. In addition, the participant will be instructed to wear a pedometer to record objective physical activity.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Thai women are age 18 or older; are diagnosed with stage I-III breast cancer; are
             scheduled to receive at least four cycles of chemotherapy given in 21-day-intervals;
             report at least 4 out of 10 or higher on a fatigue scale in the past month; are able
             to read and write in Thai and can be contacted by telephone.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Thai women have a history of severe psychiatric illness, or have other illnesses that
             could be responsible for the fatigue other than cancer such as iron deficiency anemia,
             multiple sclerosis, congestive heart failure, chronic fatigue syndrome or
             fibromyalgia. With regard to anemia, women must have a certain hemoglobin in the
             normal range at baseline. They also cannot have acute or chronic bone, joint, or
             muscular abnormalities that would increase the risk of falls and injury. Women
             scheduled to receive concurrent radiation therapy are not eligible.
