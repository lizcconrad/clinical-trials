      This study compares peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) and exercise efficiency in upper-body poling
      versus arm crank ergometry in trained able-bodied and paraplegic participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) and exercise efficiency are key factors for endurance
      performance. In persons who are primarily able to use their upper-body during exercise, such
      as many Paralympic athletes, the mode most commonly used in assessing VO2peak and efficiency
      is arm crank ergometry (ACE). However, sport-specificity of the test mode has been suggested
      to be of importance for achieving VO2peak and exercise efficiency that are reflective of the
      aerobic capacity in the respective sport. For ice sledge hockey players, cross-country sit
      skiers and sitting biathletes, upper-body poling (UP) is the most sport-specific test mode.
      However, it has not yet been investigated whether VO2peak and efficiency differ between ACE
      and UP. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare VO2peak and exercise efficiency in
      upper-body poling versus arm crank ergometry in trained able-bodied and paraplegic
      participants. Participants performed four 5-min submaximal stages at increasing effort and an
      incremental peak test to exhaustion in both ACE and UP.
