    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a histological diagnosis of advanced STS (by local pathology review), for which
             treatment with doxorubicin, ifosfamide and mesna is deemed appropriate by the
             investigator.

          -  Have measurable or nonmeasurable but evaluable disease as defined by the Response
             Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1).

          -  Have adequate hematologic, organ and coagulation function within 2 weeks (14 days)
             prior to enrollment.

          -  Have a performance status of 0 to 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scale.

          -  Have received no prior lines of systemic therapy and are suitable to receive
             doxorubicin, ifosfamide and mesna. All previous anticancer treatments must have
             completed ≥3 weeks (21 days) prior to the first dose of study treatment.

          -  Have left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥50% assessed within 28 days prior to
             enrollment.

          -  Have resolution of Adverse Events (AEs), with the exception of alopecia, and of all
             clinically significant toxic effects of prior locoregional therapy, surgery or
             radiotherapy to ≤Grade 1, by National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for
             Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) Version 4.0.

          -  Have sufficient available material from archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
             tumor tissue for biomarker-related studies. If such tissue is not available, a newly
             obtained core or excisional biopsy of a tumor lesion must be performed.

          -  If male, must be sterile or agree to use an effective method of contraception or a
             highly effective method of contraception during the study and for at least 12 weeks
             following the last dose of study treatment.

          -  If female and of child-bearing potential, must:

               1. have a negative serum pregnancy test at the time of enrollment,

               2. have a negative urine pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to the first dose of
                  study treatment, and

               3. agree to use a highly effective method of contraception during the study and for
                  3 months following the last dose of study treatment.

          -  Have a life expectancy of at least 3 months, in the opinion of the investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Are currently enrolled in a clinical trial involving an investigational product or any
             other type of medical research judged not to be scientifically or medically compatible
             with this study.

          -  Have participated within the past 30 days in a clinical trial involving an
             investigational product. If the previous investigational product has a long half-life,
             3 months or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) should have passed.

          -  Have previously completed or withdrawn from any study investigating olaratumab.

          -  Have received prior treatment with olaratumab, doxorubicin, or ifosfamide, or have
             participated in other trials investigating olaratumab.

          -  Have received prior radiotherapy of the mediastinal/pericardial area or whole pelvis
             radiation.

          -  Have known urinary outflow obstruction, or inflammation of the urinary bladder
             (cystitis).

          -  Are diagnosed with gastrointestinal stromal tumor or Kaposi sarcoma.

          -  Have active central nervous system (CNS) or leptomeningeal metastasis (brain
             metastasis) at the time of enrollment. Participants with a history of CNS metastasis
             (previously treated with curative intent [for example, stereotactic radiation or
             surgery]) that has not progressed on follow-up imaging, have been asymptomatic for at
             least 60 days, and are not receiving systemic corticosteroids and/or anticonvulsants
             are eligible. Participants with signs or symptoms of neurological compromise should
             have appropriate radiographic imaging performed before enrollment to rule out brain
             metastasis.

          -  Have a history of another primary malignancy, with the exception of:

               1. curatively treated non-melanomatous skin cancer

               2. curatively treated cervical carcinoma in situ

          -  Have an active fungal, bacterial and/or known viral infection including human
             immunodeficiency virus or viral (A, B, or C) hepatitis (screening is not required).

          -  Have Grade 3 or 4 peripheral neuropathy per NCI-CTCAE Version 4.0.

          -  Have a serious cardiac condition.

          -  Have a resting heart rate of &gt;100 beats per minute (bpm).

          -  Have a Fridericia's QT corrected interval (QTcF) interval of &gt;450 milliseconds (msec)
             for males and &gt;470 msec for females on screening electrocardiogram (ECG) utilizing
             Fridericia's correction.

          -  Have uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, an
             ongoing/active infection requiring parenteral antibiotics.

          -  Have a psychiatric illness/social situation that would limit compliance with study
             requirements.

          -  Have electively planned or will require major surgery during the course of the study.

          -  Are females who are pregnant or breastfeeding.
