  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a monocentric, prospective cohort study evaluating the feasibility of a perioperative
      e-follow-up protocol in patients with ambulatory surgery for breast cancer.

      This protocol will be based on:

        -  A coordinated ambulatory follow-up performed by a dedicated nurse

        -  An electronic follow-up tool used in pre- and post-surgery

      Patients will be followed 8 days before the surgery until 30 days after the surgery of breast
      cancer.
