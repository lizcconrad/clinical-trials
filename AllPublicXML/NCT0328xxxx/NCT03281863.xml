      Acute rheumatic fever,an auto immune response to Group A streptococcus infection of the upper
      respiratory tract,may result in carditis.when the inflammation leads to permenant damage of
      the valves the individual has rheumatic heart disease.

      Recurrences of rheumatic fever are likely in the absence of preventive measures and may cause
      further cardiac valve and muscle damage,leading to heart failure,stroke and premature
      death.bacterial endocarditis is also a complication.
