  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators wish to determine how suture spacing (5 mm vs. 10 mm) affects cosmetic
      outcome and development of &quot;train tracking&quot; in wounds. Linear wounds with sutures spaced
      closer together may not be as cosmetically appealing when compared to those that have larger
      spacing between sutures. Suturing closer together constricts blood flow and increases tension
      that ultimately results in more tissue necrosis and a less appealing outcome. The
      investigators also aim to conclude if 5 mm or 10 mm suture spacing results in less
      complications.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in cosmetic outcome of 5 mm versus 10 mm suture spacing on wound healing</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The wound was divided in half by placing a single 4-0 Polysorb suture in the midpoint of the wound based on ruler measurement. Simple interrupted nylon sutures were spaced approximately 5mm or 10mm apart depending on side. The sutures were then removed at 2-week follow-up appointment. The Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) was then performed by both patient and physician. The observer scale consists of six items (vascularity, pigmentation, thickness, relief, pliability and surface area), and all items were scored on a scale from 1 ('like normal skin') to 10 ('worst scar imaginable'). The patient scale also includes six items (color, itch, pain, thickness, stiffness, and irregularity) and all items were scored on a similar scale from 1 ('like normal skin') to 10 ('worst scar imaginable').</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in wound complications of 5 mm versus 10 mm suture spacing on wound healing</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Wounds were also assessed for complications. Difficulty removing sutures was assessed by presence of either one of the following: unable to directly visualize suture knot or need to probe into wound to remove suture. Wound dehiscence was defined as at least a 1mm separation of the wound edge for at least 50% of the length of the wound closure. Edge necrosis was defined as eschar and necrosis of the wound edge for at least 50% of the wound closure. Infection was defined as any wound that had redness, pain and exudate.</description>
