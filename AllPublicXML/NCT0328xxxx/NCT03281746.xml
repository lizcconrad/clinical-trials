  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot clinical trial studies how well preventive education works in
      decreasing caries formation in pediatric patients with leukemia. Prevention education may
      have an effect on factors important in causing cavities in pediatric patients with leukemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients treated for leukemia at Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center in the
      department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology are currently receiving oral hygiene
      instruction at diagnosis. In this study, patients will be randomized into two groups at
      diagnosis: one receiving current prevention education and the other group receiving
      one-on‚Äêone prevention education and counseling with the physician and pediatric dental
      resident. Physician and pediatric dental resident will use motivational interviewing informed
      techniques during counseling. A caries risk assessment will be performed for each patient at
      diagnosis. Caries incidence, plaque scores, mutans streptococci levels, salivary flow rate,
      and salivary pH will be assessed at week one (diagnosis), week 16 or start of interim
      maintenance therapy whichever comes second, week 32 or beginning of maintenance therapy
      whichever is later for all patients enrolled in the study. Data will be collected through a
      clinical intraoral examination and salivary sample. Data collected will be used to assess the
      effect of increased prevention education on factors of importance in caries formation.

    <description>Patients undergo dental examination at baseline and then receive standard prevention education at diagnosis discussing the effects of prolonged neutropenia on oral hygiene, importance of a regular oral hygiene regimen, and the long term clinical outcomes of oncologic patients. Patients also receive fliers with pictograms describing proper brushing, use of mouth wash, and common oral complications during therapy, as well as a bottle and prescription for chlorhexidine gluconate 0.12% rinse.</description>
