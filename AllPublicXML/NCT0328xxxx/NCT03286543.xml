  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if electrical stimulation (small levels of
      electricity) in addition to the standard of care can safely and effectively reduce pain
      following total knee replacement more than the standard of care, alone. This study involves a
      device called the SPRINT Beta System. The SPRINT Beta System delivers mild electrical
      stimulation to nerves in the leg that received the knee replacement. The SPRINT Beta System
      includes a small wire (called a &quot;lead&quot;) that is placed through the skin in the upper leg. It
      also includes a device worn on the body that delivers stimulation (called the SPRINT Beta
      Stimulator). About half the subjects in this study will receive the SPRINT Beta system
      (treatment group) and half will not (control group). Both groups will receive the standard of
      care.

    <intervention_model_description>Half of the subjects enrolled will be randomized (like flipping a coin) to the treatment group and half will be randomized to the control group. Both groups will receive the standard of care for pain management following total knee replacement surgery. Subjects in the treatment group will receive SPR's SPRINT Beta Peripheral Nerve Stimulation (PNS) System in addition to standard of care.</intervention_model_description>
