  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In western countries, the number of cancer survivors increases, and current cancer care seems
      insufficient with both patients' experiences of lack of help in transitions and up to 60 % of
      the patients having psychological problems after treatment. Further, Denmark shall have new
      hospitals, where researchers and healthcare professionals are expected to merge tasks and
      reach a higher patient experienced quality of care, without additional costs, so a better way
      to provide cancer care, which benefits the patients and supports the ideas within the new
      hospitals in Denmark, is needed.

      In a randomized controlled trial, the organizational structure of the healthcare system is
      challenged and the impact of a coherent nurse navigation practice compared to the currently
      existing department-specific care coordination is tested. The primary data are changes in
      patients' self-reported cancer-related self-efficacy from inclusion till one week after
      receipt of the information that they have reached the end of treatment, or in case of
      prolonged treatment, till not later than one year after inclusion.

      Patients can participate if they are 18 years of age or older, speak and understand Danish,
      and have a proven lesion suspected of cancer in the colon or rectum after colonoscopy or
      sigmoidoscopy at the Danish endoscopy centers at Odense University Hospital (the cities:
      Nyborg, Svendborg and Odense) or at Slagelse Hospital. Furthermore, participants must not be
      mentally retarded, they must not suffer from a constant life-threatening disease, and they
      must not suffer from, or be in the diagnostic phase of, dementia or severe psychiatric
      disease.

      Participants are allocated to support from nurse navigation or to current care coordination,
      and fill in four questionnaires during their cancer trajectory: 1) At inclusion, 2) Three
      days before treatment start, 3) One week after receipt of information about treatment end or
      not later than one year after inclusion, and 4) Six weeks after measure point 3. Data is
      analyzed using suitable statistical models.

      With positive results, participants in nurse navigation are better helped during their cancer
      trajectory and have a better psychological start on the rest of their lives after cancer
      treatment. Focus will be on colon and rectum cancer care, but the results will be
      transferable to similar settings. Furthermore, positive results will support changes in the
      onset of rehabilitation initiatives.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary hypothesis in this study is:

      Nurse navigation, as a specific, defined concept of coherent help through cancer
      trajectories, will prove superior to current care coordination with regard to patients'
      self-evaluated self-efficacy for cancer from inclusion to one week after receipt of
      information about treatment end or not later than one year after inclusion.

      Allocation The randomization will be stratified by age and gender. The rational is that age
      and gender is differently associated with benefit by a given care.

      Data collection Participants fill in questionnaires at four measurements, and supplements to
      sociodemographic information as well as information for an economic evaluation is collected
      from provider side.

      The questionnaires for participants are available in paper and electronically, and
      participants are allowed to discuss the individual questions with a person whom they trust
      before filling in their answers. If a participant is blind or dyslexic and has no one to help
      them fill in the questionnaires, a trained study nurse will read out loud the questions and
      fill in the participant's answers, and eventually in this process, listen to the
      participant's pros and cons, acknowledge that they are heard, ask for an answer and read out
      loud the question again. All data are stored in Research Electronic Data Capture (RedCap).

      Blinding The trial is not blinded but all participants are told, there is no favorite group.
      The statistician is blinded to randomization group and this blinding will be unveiled after
      the data is analyzed.

      Statistics Data are analyzed following the modified intention-to-treat principle, which is
      carried out by a senior statistician in close collaboration with the research group. Usual
      descriptive statistics will be used to summarize baseline and subject characteristics. The
      analyses of the primary endpoint, i.e. change in self-evaluated self-efficacy for cancer from
      inclusion (measurement 1) to end of treatment (measurement 3), and the secondary outcomes are
      done using analysis of covariance of the measure at measurement 3 with randomization group as
      a factor and measure at measurement 1 as covariate. In secondary analyses for all endpoints
      (measurement 1-4), the change over time will be investigated by mixed effects repeated
      measures analysis with randomization group as factor and random effects for subjects. These
      analyses are repeated within the subgroup of all cancer patients and the subgroup of cancer
      patients treated with curative aim. In the subgroup analyses, the influence of relevant
      subject-level confounders such as age, disease-stage, treatment, etc. will be explored, and
      appropriate adjustment will be performed. An economic evaluation will be performed for each
      randomized group and compared.
