  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of implementing a Compassion
      Cultivation Training (CCT) program for oncology nurses at Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer
      Center. The goal of CCT is to provide a structured and systematic way of cultivating
      daily-life skills needed to strengthen qualities of compassion, empathy, and kindness for
      oneself and others. CCT typically includes (i) eight weekly 2-hour classes and (ii) daily
      practice. The in-class activities include pedagogical instruction and active group
      discussion, guided meditation, interactive practical exercises, and sharing of inspiring
      readings/stories to prime feelings of open-heartedness or connection to others.

      The Compassion Cultivation Training (CCT) protocol is a secular course that was developed by
      the Center for Compassion &amp; Altruism Research and Education (CCARE) at Stanford University,
      School of Medicine (Jinpa, 2013). The course was developed by Thupten Jinpa, PhD, in
      collaboration with contemplative scholars, psychologists, and scientist at Stanford. The goal
      of CCT is to provide a structured and systematic way of cultivating daily-life skills needed
      to strengthen qualities of compassion, empathy, and kindness for oneself and others. CCT
      typically includes (i) eight weekly 2-hour classes and (ii) daily practice. The in-class
      activities include pedagogical instruction and active group discussion, guided meditation,
      interactive practical exercises, and sharing of inspiring readings/stories to prime feelings
      of open-heartedness or connection to others. The daily practice includes both formal and
      informal practices. Participants are provided with formal guided meditations that are 15 to
      30 minutes long in the form of MP3 or cds. Participants may receive practices and
      instructions via email with a link to the location of the MP3. They will be provided with
      practice logs to report their amount of practice as well as some basic observations to the
      research team. In the present study, we will follow the official CCT manual. The training is
      composed of 8 sessions, which can be delivered in 7-10 weeks.
