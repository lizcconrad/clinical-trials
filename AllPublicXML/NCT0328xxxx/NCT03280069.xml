      This protocol will evaluate THERMIeyes® for its ability to treat periorbital skin laxity and
      wrinkles and monitor ocular surface changes and their effect on evaporative dry eye
      associated with MGD.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with skin laxity and evaporative dry eye will be recruited for enrollment in this
      study. Subjects must present with subjective and objective indicators for periorbital skin
      laxity and wrinkle grade of 2 or greater out of a 4 point scale. To qualify, subjects must
      present with high symptoms score on subjective Ocular Surface Disease Index© (OSDI©)
      Questionnaires (scores≥ 15); Rapid Tear Break up (&lt; 5 seconds) and Grade ≥ 1 of Flourescein
      Staining in one area of the cornea. Each of these parameters are to be assessed prior to
      treatment and at each follow up visit. Treatment is to be performed on periorbital skin only
      around one eye of the subject using the THERMIeyes® standard protocol. This may result in
      some redness of the periorbital skin. Subjects are to be seen and treated 2-3 weeks apart for
      a total of 3 treatments. Subjects will be followed at 6 and 12 weeks after the final
      treatment. A Validated Grading Scale for Crow's Feet will be used to evaluate changes in skin
      wrinkles and dry eye signs and symptoms scores will be compared with pre-treatment findings.

    <description>The masked evaluating physician will be blinded as to which eye is treated. The evaluation on all visits will be performed on both eyes by the masked physician who will not know which eye has been treated with the THERMIeyes® 20 RF System. The treating technician will be aware of the treated eye so as to ensure all treatments are performed to the same eye.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must be 40-70 Inclusive; Male or Female

          -  Subjects must demonstrate subjective and objective indicators for periorbital skin
             laxity and wrinkle grade of 2 or greater out of a 4 point scale

          -  Subjects must have an OSDI© score of ≥ 15,

          -  Subjects must have a Grade 1 or higher staining pattern with fluorescein stain in any
             area of the cornea.

          -  The subjects may continue their current treatment for dry eye including the use of
             artificial tears, gels or ointments. They are to continue any topical medications for
             dry eye such as Cyclosporin or Lifitegrast. Subjects may continue to take chronic
             medications systemically including anti-inflammatory medications (aspirin, NSAIDS,
             Prednisone) as long as the dose and frequency is not changed throughout the study.

          -  Subjects may be included if they have punctual plugs present in any tear duct. If a
             plug comes out during the study it may be re-inserted so that the Subject is returned
             to their pre-treatment baseline state.

          -  Women of childbearing years should have pregnancy testing performed to ensure that
             pregnancy has not occurred during the study. Urine pregnancy screening will be
             performed prior to any treatment and on follow up visits until the study is completed

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject must meet the inclusion criteria as listed

          -  During the study they cannot have any new medications started that are
             anti-inflammatory in nature. This includes topical steroids, Lifitegrast, cyclosporine
             or systemic medications such as steroids, NSAIDS, aspirin, Doxycyline or other
             Macrolid antibiotics.

          -  Subjects cannot have a punctual plug inserted into a tear duct that has not had a plug
             present prior to the start of the study.

          -  Participation in other clinical trials during the course of this study is not
             permitted.

          -  Women who are pregnant or nursing.
