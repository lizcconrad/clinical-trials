  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inhibition of acetylcholinesterase has been a effective treatment for Alzheimer's disease.
      Octohydroaminoacridine, a new acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, is a potential treatment for
      Alzheimer's disease. The investigators conducted a 26 weeks, randomized, double-blind,
      double-dummy, placebo- and positive- parallel controlled and extended single arm to 54 weeks
      multicentre phase III clinical trial to investigate the effects of octohydroaminoacridine in
      patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. Patients were randomized to receive
      placebo thrice daily, or octohydroaminoacridine 4 mg/TID or ARICEPT 5mg/QD.
