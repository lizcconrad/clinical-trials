  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will perform this study to prospectively compare the clinical outcome after
      percutaneous microwave ablation(MWA) and cryoablation of benign and malignant breast lesion
      under ultrasound (US) guidance.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of more than 200 patients diagnosed with benign breast lesions and 50 patients with
      malignant breast lesions in two centers of China will be recruited in this study and
      underwent US-guided percutaneous MWA and cryoablation treatment. Information for each patient
      includes demographics; longest diameters of tumors; tumor numbers; tumor pathological type;
      location of tumor according to whether adjacent to skin, pectoralis, areola and papilla.
      Ablation variables including session, puncture, time, and power; complete ablation,
      complications; reduction in volume, palpability, pain and cosmetic satisfying
      outcomes,recurrence,survival will be compared and analyzed.

    <description>Microwave ablation（MWA）refers to all electromagnetic methods of inducing tumor destruction by using devices with frequencies greater than or equal to 900MHz. The rotation of dipole molecules accounts for most of the heat generated during MWA. Water molecules as dipoles attempt to continuously reorient at the same rate in microwave's oscillating electric field. As a result of microwave transmission, the water molecules flip back and forth billions of times a second. The vigorous movement of water molecules produce friction and heat, thus inducing cellular death via coagulation necrosis. The microwave unit (KY-2000, Kangyou Medical, Nanjing, China) is capable of producing 100 Watts of power at 2450 MHz.The needle antenna has a diameter of 1.6 mm (16G) and a length of 10 cm. The active tip length is 3mm and 5mm.</description>

    <description>Clinically, cryosurgery is accomplished by placing a cryoprobe(up to 3.5 mm) through a stab incision into the tumor under ultrasound guidance.Liquid nitrogen is utilized under low operating pressure as cryogen which is controlled by the computer modulated cryogen regulator. The cryoprobe achieves rapid freezing by means of an active freeze zone at its distal tip.</description>
