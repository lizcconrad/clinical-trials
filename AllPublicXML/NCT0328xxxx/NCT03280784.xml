  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      this protocol aides to evaluate:( 1)whether upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (UGE) is used
      appropriately according to the Guideline on pediatric GI endoscopy [1] commissioned by the
      European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition(ESPGHAN) and the
      European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy(ESGE). In our hospital setting and(2) whether
      there is any relationship between appropriateness of gastrointestinal endoscopy and the
      presence of lesions detected by endoscopy.

    <textblock>
      gastrointestinal endoscopy is a safe and effective procedure. However,complications do exist
      and procedure-related costs are significant The rapid escalation of the cost of medical care,
      in the face of limited resources, is making the appropriateness of indications more and more
      essential to the rational utilization of such resources.Upper Gastrointestinal (UGI)
      endoscopy in the pediatric population has evolved during the last 30 years with an increasing
      number of diagnostic and therapeutic applications.

      years with an increasing number of diagnostic and therapeutic Technological improvements and
      endoscopic devices have contributed to the evolution This prospective study is to determine
      whether upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is used appropriately in our hospital setting
      according to, the Guideline on pediatric GI endoscopy [1] commissioned by the European
      Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) and the European
      Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE). and whether the appropriateness of use Predicts
      the probability of detecting significant lesions by endoscopy
