  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic skull base surgery is a relatively new procedure that is now a standard of care
      for surgeries at the base of the skull; however there are no studies that examine the healing
      process of the nasal lining with the use of silastic (silicone) stents (or splints) that
      might be placed at the time of surgery. While there is some evidence to suggest that the use
      of stents improves wound healing, the decision to use a stent or not is currently up to the
      preference of the surgeon. To investigate the impact of stents on post-surgical healing, the
      investigators at Vancouver General Hospital will compare patients undergoing trans-sphenoidal
      pituitary surgeries with septal flap reconstruction with the use of silastic stents to line
      the septal donor site, and compare their recovery to those who did not receive stents. The
      investigators hypothesize that the use of silastic stents in endonasal surgery increases the
      rate of mucosal healing, and better quality mucosal regeneration, and with no effect on the
      patients experience after surgery. In this randomized control trial the investigators aim to
      recruit 26 (13 in each arm) study participants. The primary outcome is to determine the
      effect of silastic stunting on healing of the naso-septal flap donor site. This objective
      will be achieved by assessment of endoscopic photographs of healing tissue and histologic
      assessment of healing tissues. The secondary outcome involves questionnaires that measure the
      patient's subjective nasal symptoms prior to and following endoscopic skull based surgery.
      Total time commitment for the study participant is about 4 months across 4 study visits (all
      of which are part of standard of care): the assessment visit, surgery, 4 weeks post-operative
      follow up visit and 12 week post-operative follow up visit.
