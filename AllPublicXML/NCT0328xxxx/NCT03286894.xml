  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The AQUA© questionnaire developed in 2008 is a validated tools for the screening of allergic
      diseases in adult athletes. The objective of the present study is to develop and validate a
      modified version of the AQUA© questionnaire to be used in childhood. In this phase, the
      validation is intended to assess the reliability of the information collected through the
      AQUA© modified version: question difficulty and response patterns with respect to children
      characteristics (in particular age, sex and physical activity). In particular, the focus will
      be on the &quot;core questions&quot;, i.e. the indicators of allergic disorders. This is a
      cross-sectional study on 248 healthy schoolchildren aged 8 to 14 years.
