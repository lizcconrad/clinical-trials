  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of the present study is to examine eye-tracking based markers for social
      processing deficits in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). To this end a battery of
      five eye-tracking paradigms will be administered to young children with ASD and typically
      developing children. To additionally evaluate the specificity of the eye-tracking markers a
      group of children with disorders of delayed development other than ASD will be included.

      During an initial screening session all participants will undergo the Autism Diagnostic
      Observation Schedule (ADOS). ASD-related symptomatology and levels of impairments will be
      further characterized using the Social Responsibilities Scale 2 (SRS 2), Caregiver Strain
      Questionnaire (CSQ), Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC), Social Communication Questionnaire
      (SCQ), and Repetitive Behaviour Scale Revised (RBS-R).

      Subsequently all participants will be administered the following eye-tracking paradigms: (1)
      dynamic social and non-social visual preference paradigm during which dynamic geometric
      images (DGI) and dynamic social images (DSI) will be presented, (2) non-biological versus
      biological motion paradigm, (3) social attention and sharing of enjoyment paradigm, (4)
      preference for real versus schematic emotional face stimuli paradigm during which photographs
      of human faces and emoticons will be presented, (5) shared social attention and gaze
      direction paradigm.
