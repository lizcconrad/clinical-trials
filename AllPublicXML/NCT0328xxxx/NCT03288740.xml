  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of the trial is to assess the pharmacokinetics of semaglutide (i.e. the way
      the drug is distributed in the body over a period of time) following once-weekly
      administration of semaglutide in healthy Chinese subjects. Different dose levels (0.5 and 1.0
      mg) will be investigated in this trial. Participants will be administered semaglutide or
      placebo once-weekly by subcutaneous injection (under the skin fold of the abdominal wall)
      using a pen injector with a very small, thin needle by the trial doctor at the trial site for
      13 weeks. The trial consists of 23 visits in total, including visit for screening and safety
      tests, visit for dose administration and blood sample collection. The total time of
      participation will be approximately 18-22 weeks depending on participant's individual visit
      schedule.
