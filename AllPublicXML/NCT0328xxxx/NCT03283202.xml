  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is Phase 1/2 study of CC-122 in combination with rituximab, cyclophosphamide,
      doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) chemotherapy, for first-line treatment of
      patients with Diffuse B-Cell Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) that has poor risk factors.
      Approximately 40% of patients diagnosed with DLBCL are not cured with R-CHOP alone and would
      need additional treatment for DLBCL in the future. The addition of the experimental drug
      CC-122 with R-CHOP could help in controlling DLBCL in this patient population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is for patients who have been newly diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell
      lymphoma DLBCL and are receiving treatment for the first time.

      This study will be conducted in two phases. Phase 1 will test the safety of increasing dose
      levels of CC-122 when given in combination with R-CHOP-21 therapy to identify an appropriate
      dose and schedule for further evaluation in Phase 2. Phase 2 will evaluate the rate of
      complete response when adding CC-122 to the R-CHOP-21 regimen in first-line treatment of
      patients with poor risk DLBCL.

      This study is separated into three periods: the Screening period, the Treatment period and
      the Follow-up period. Before the patient can receive the drug the doctor will perform test to
      find out whether he/she can participate in the study. This is done during the Screening
      period. If the patient and the treating physician determine that the patient is eligible to
      participate in the study, the patient will be registered in the study and receive CC-122
      combined with R-CHOP.

      In the Treatment period the patient will receive treatment for up to 6 treatment cycles. Each
      treatment cycle is 21 days long. The full length of the treatment period will be
      approximately 4 months.

      The follow-up period begins when the patient has completed treatment or is discontinued for
      any reason. During the follow-up period the patient will have fewer exams, test and visits.
      The first follow-up visit will be 28 days after treatment is completed or discontinued. After
      that, the follow-up visits will be every 3 months during the first year, then every 6 months
      until the study is closed.

          5. Subject has poor-risk disease defined as International Prognostic Index (IPI) score ≥
             3 (high-intermediate or high-risk classification).

        lymphoma, rapidly progressing adenopathies, or worsening performance status, pre-phase
        treatment with up to 100 mg/day prednisone, or equivalent, for a maximum of 10 days is
        permitted prior to beginning the treatment period, at the discretion of the Investigator. A
        washout period is not required, however, the Screening positron emission tomography (PET),
        CT, tumor biopsy (if needed), and bone marrow biopsy (if needed) should be completed before
        initiating corticosteroids.

        8. Subject's central laboratory values must fulfill the following requirements during
        Screening: Blood product transfusions and hematopoietic growth factors may not be used to

             unilateral bone marrow core biopsy performed during Screening or within 3 months prior
             to signing the ICF. In the case of documented extensive bone marrow involvement an ANC
             ≥ 1,000 cells/mm3 (1.0 x 109/L) is required.

             involvement by lymphoma (ie, ≥ 50%) as demonstrated by unilateral bone marrow core
             biopsy performed during Screening or within 3 months prior to signing the ICF. In the
             case of documented extensive bone marrow involvement, a platelet count of ≥ 75,000/
             mm3 (75 x 109/L) is required.

          3. Serum aspartate transaminase (AST/SGOT) or alanine transaminase (ALT/SGPT) ≤ 3.0 x
