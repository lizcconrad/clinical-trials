      The purpose of the study is to determine the efficacy of FP-101 versus placebo for the
      treatment of hot flashes in postmenopausal women.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vasomotor symptoms, commonly known as hot flashes or hot flushes, are the most common
      symptoms experienced by women who are perimenopausal or postmenopausal. FP-101 is postulated
      to mediate one of the mechanisms thought to drive hot flashes in post-menopausal women. This
      study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of FP-101 for the treatment of hot flashes in
      post-menopausal women.

             50 to 60 hot flashes per week for at least 30 days prior to the Screening Visit of
             sufficient severity to cause desire for therapeutic intervention.

          -  Subject exhibits evidence of impaired liver function upon entry into the study (values
             ≥2 times the upper limit of normal for aspartate transaminase and/or alanine
             transaminase, or serum bilirubin ≥1.3 mg/dL) or, in the Investigator's opinion,
             exhibits liver function impairment to the extent that the subject should not
             participate in the study.

          -  Subject has clinically unstable cardiac disease, including unstable atrial
             fibrillation, symptomatic bradycardia, unstable congestive heart failure, or active
             myocardial ischemia.

          -  Subject has biliary tract disease, adrenal cortical insufficiency, or any other
             medical condition that, in the Investigator's opinion, is inadequately treated and
             precludes entry into the study.
