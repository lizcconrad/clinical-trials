      The aim of this study is to provide comprehensive documentation of the relevant results and
      operational implications of this new model using Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC) as the
      single anthropometric criterion for admission, monitoring and exit of non- complicated in
      Niger.

      This is a first operational experiment using Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC) as the single
      anthropometric criterion for the admission, monitoring and exit of the management of
      uncomplicated SAM (Severe Acute Malnutrition) in Niger, specific data as well as data from
      routine program will be collected to allow comprehensive documentation of all relevant
      results and operational implications of this new model. The experiment based on the use of
      the single anthropometric threshold for admission of a Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC)&lt;120
      mm, which includes both children currently classified as having SAM (currently with PB &lt;115
      mm) and acute malnutrition moderate (MAM, currently with a Mid-Upper Arm Circumference
      (MUAC)&lt;125 mm), as well as a follow-up of children with a Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC)≥
      120 mm, will identify how children respond to treatment and benefit of the spectrum of acute
      malnutrition.

    <description>At the CRENAS, MUAC as unique anthropometric criteria for admission, monitoring, and care for the SAM output will be used.
The criteria for admission include:
MUAC &lt;120 mm
Bilateral edema of grade + or ++
The criteria for release of care include:
MUAC ≥ 125 mm at 2 consecutive visits
Minimum stay 3 weeks in the program

    <description>Regular screenings in the communities on children between 6 and 59 months of age. Children with MUAC&lt;125 mm will be referred to Nutrition Centers for admission.
The criteria for admission include:

Z score &lt;-3 and /or
Bilateral edema of grade + or ++
The criteria for release of care include:
