    <textblock>
      Study AG120-C-012 is a Phase 1, open-label, single-dose study designed to evaluate the PK,
      safety, and tolerability of a single 500 mg AG-120 (Ivosidenib) dose in subjects with mild or
      moderate hepatic impairment (HI) compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. The study
      will be conducted at 2 US centers.

             surgically sterile, practice total abstinence from sexual intercourse as the preferred
             lifestyle or agree to use an appropriate method of birth control consistently
             throughout the study, from screening until 90 days after study drug administration.

          -  Male subjects with a partner of child bearing potential must either be sterile,
             practice total abstinence from sexual intercourse as the preferred life style or agree
             to use an appropriate method of birth control consistently throughout the study, from
             screening until 90 days after study drug administration.

        Subjects with hepatic impairment (Cohorts 1a, 2a)

             hepatic insufficiency, with a Child-Pugh classification score in the mild or moderate
             range.

          -  Hepatic insufficiency may be of any etiology associated with an unambiguous medical
             history (such as evidence of portal hypertension).

          -  Other than hepatic insufficiency with features of cirrhosis, subjects are in good
             health based on medical history, physical exam, ECG, clinical laboratory tests, and

        • Have normal hepatic function and considered by the Investigator to be in good health,
        based on medical and surgical history review, physical exam, ECG, clinical laboratory
        tests, and Investigator's assessment.

          -  Significant history or clinical manifestation of any significant metabolic/endocrine,

             gastrointestinal, genitourinary, neurologic, or psychiatric disorder, as determined by
             the Investigator and/or Sponsor's medical monitor (MM) to be clinically significant
             (CS.)

          -  Any evidence of progressive liver disease (within the last 4 weeks prior to dosing)

          -  Severe or uncontrolled medical conditions within 4 weeks prior to AG-120 dosing, with
