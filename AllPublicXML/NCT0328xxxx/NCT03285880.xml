  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific objective of the proposed research is to examine whether naps contribute to
      immediate and delayed benefits on multiple forms of learning in young children (3-5 yrs). By
      probing recall prior to and following mid-day nap or wake intervals, the overarching
      hypothesis is that recent memories are actively processed (as opposed to passively protected)
      by a nap, conferring immediate or delayed (24-hrs) benefits on declarative (Aim 1),
      procedural (Aim 2), and emotional (Aim 3) memories. In two conditions, children will either
      be nap-promoted or wake-promoted midday. Subsequently, performance will be reassessed that
      day as well as the following day.

      The proposed research examines whether naps contribute to immediate and delayed benefits on
      multiple forms of learning in preschool-aged children (3-5 yrs). By probing recall prior to
      and following mid-day nap or wake intervals, we will examine immediate memory performance and
      how it is changed by an interval with a nap compared to if that interval was spent awake.
      There are three arm, separately assessing declarative (using a storybook learning task),
      procedural (using a mirror tracing task), and emotional (using an emotional storybook task).
      All children will participate in a nap and wake condition. On the experimental day, children
      will learn the task, then be nap or wake promoted (within subject, conditions counterbalanced
      and separated by 1 week). Subsequently, performance will be reassessed that day as well as
      the following day. Children will wear an actigraph watch for a 16-day interval surrounding
      the experimental days in order to access habitual sleep patterns (e.g., nap frequency). A
      subset of children will complete the experimental days in the sleep laboratory. For these
      children, sleep will be measured using polysomnography, a montage of electroencepholography,
      electromyography, and electrooculography electrodes.
