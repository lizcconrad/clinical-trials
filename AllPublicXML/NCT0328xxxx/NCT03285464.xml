  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Does a rotary based triplanar exercise intervention that utilizes the trunk as a proximal
      lever, strengthen the hip and alter dynamic LE alignment in running females?
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current hip-focused programs fail to alter hip adduction angles in females while performing
      higher speed and more complex maneuvers such as running.

      (Willy, et al., 2011) - 10 female runners, underwent 6 wk. hip focused intervention, change
      in SLS but NO change in hip adduction angle while running.

      A different intervention strategy that includes utilizing the trunk as the proximal lever to
      strengthen the hip, could potentially alter biomechanical outcomes such as hip adduction
      angles in female runners.

      This study will apply a new intervention model and then measure running, single leg squat and
      hip strength to determine if a newly informed intervention can alter LE kinematics in females
      while running and make improvements in hip strength following the intervention Inclusion
      Criteria

        -  18 years old or greater

        -  Female Exclusion Criteria

        -  Injury of the lumbar spine, hips, knees or foot/ankle in the last 6mos that required
           medical attention

        -  any surgery of the lower back or the pelvis or lower extremities any time in the
           subjects life

    <description>Subject squats on single leg and qualitative scoring is administered to determine the subjective amount of contralateral pelvic drop and femoral adduction to be described as dynamic knee valgus. The qualitative values will be binary in nature, whereas DKV is present or not.</description>

    <description>2/3D analysis of running gait following intervention; Utilizing both 3D/2D methods the measure of contralateral pelvic drop and the bisection of the patella will determine the amount of femoral adduction noted during running. The change in the femoral adduction angle after a 6 week intervention is the specific outcome measure to be obtained.</description>
