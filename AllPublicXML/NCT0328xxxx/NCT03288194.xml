  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study has been designed to test the efficacy of telephone-delivered
      Problem-Solving Treatment (PST) for improving the quality of life (QoL) in outpatients with
      stable heart failure (HF).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) is the end stage of all cardiovascular diseases, and it imposes a huge
      burden in the United States in terms of morbidity, mortality, and economic cost. Although
      disease management programs have been developed to curb these costs and address the
      complexities of HF management, evaluations of these programs have yielded equivocal results.

      With this study the Investigators plan to: (1) to determine the feasibility of telephone
      delivered PST for outpatients with HF and reduced QoL by obtaining estimates of yield,
      retention, patient acceptance, and patient satisfaction; (2) to determine whether
      telephone-delivered PST is associated with greater improvements in QoL than
      telephone-delivered Time Management over 8 weeks; and (3) to determine whether
      telephone-delivered PST is associated with greater reductions in depressive symptoms and/or
      greater improvements in self-efficacy or objectively assessed daily physical activity than
      telephone-delivered Time Management over 8 weeks.
