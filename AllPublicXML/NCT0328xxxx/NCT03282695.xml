      The main objective of this study is to estimate the cost-effectiveness of ozone therapy in
      patients on the waiting list for surgery due to disc herniation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A cohort study (patients on the waiting list for surgery due to herniated disc) will be
      carried out, to which the treatment with ozone will be offered, without giving up the planned
      surgical intervention.

      The main objective of this prospective, post-authorization follow-up study is to estimate the
      cost-effectiveness of ozone therapy (compared to standard care) in patients with disc
      herniation waiting for surgery (by microdiscectomy). Besides utilities of patients with disc
      herniation on a waiting list for surgery will be estimated, social/economic burden of disc
      herniation will be quantified and a decision aid will be developed and applied.

      The main outcome measures are &quot;Direct hospital cost&quot;, &quot;Percentage of executed surgeries&quot; and
      &quot;Change in sciatic pain&quot;. In addition, data on health-related quality of life and resource
      utilization will be collected which will permit to estimate the incremental
      cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), comparing incremental costs and quality adjusted life years
      (QALY).

      The variables will be collected at the beginning, on the day of treatment and at 1, 3, 6, 12
      and 24 months. The enrollment period will be 24 months. The follow-up period will be 24
      months.

      The results of the study will allow a better understanding of the value of ozone therapy in
      the management of patients on the waiting list for herniated disc surgery. In addition, it
      will contribute to the development of a more patient-centered health system.

        surgery waiting list by the Neurosurgery Department, 3) who meet criteria for potential
        benefit with ozone therapy and 4) who accept participating in the study by

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosed with a herniated and not calcified lumbar disc that presents as: not
             migrated protrusion and/or extrusion.

          -  Evaluated and diagnosed by the Neurosurgery Department, having been chosen as an
             appropriate candidate for surgery consisting in discectomy or microdiscectomy, after
             meeting the following two criteria: 1) Sciatic pain, with a visual analogue scale
             (VAS) intensity ≥ 5, despite 6 weeks of conservative management, wether it exists
             lumbar pain or not and 2) Radiating pain that matches the MRI image showing one or
             more herniated discs (not to be considered those patients with two herniated discs and
             symptoms attributable to only one of the herniated discs).

          -  Included in the surgery waiting list for a discectomy or microdiscectomy.

          -  Patients who have signed and dated the study ʼs specific informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who do not meet all the inclusion criteria.

          -  Calcified and/or migrated herniated disc, and/or with a severe neurological deficits
             (cauda equine syndrome).

          -  Herniated disc with surgical indication of laminectomy and/or arthrodesis (massive
             extrusion, sign of instability or other conditions under the neurosurgeon judgment).

          -  Relevant clinical paresis that does not improve despite 6 weeks of full conservative
             management (patients with severe pain and mild paresis that only shows up in the
             physical exam are not to be excluded, but those who present with paresis as the main
             symptom -&quot;clinically relevant&quot;- must be).

          -  Simultaneous symptomatic cervical or dorsal herniated discs.

          -  Previous lumbar spine surgery.

          -  Concomitant spine conditions that may be causing symptoms or have indication for
             surgery (such as fractures or tumors).

          -  Known allergy to ozone.

          -  Those who are uncapable to fill in the scales used to measure variables in the study,
             like the visual analogue scale (VAS), Roland-Morris and SF-12 questionnaires.

          -  Those who are unable or do not wish to fulfill the study ʼs protocol (answer questions
             to collect the data).
