    <textblock>
      In this study, submental ultrasound during awake and simultaneous under Drug-induced sleep
      endoscopy is applied in the diagnostic workup of obstructive sleep apnea patients. The aim is
      to assess the tongue base thickness during awake and sleep with different head positions. By
      correlation with Drug-induced sleep endoscopy findings, more parameters could be used for
      evaluation and management of upper airway collapse in obstructive sleep apnea patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a syndrome characterized by recurrent episodes of apnea and
      hypopnea during sleep that are caused by repetitive upper airway (UA) collapse and often
      result in decreased blood oxygen levels and arousal from sleep. Successful treatment lies in
      precise mapping the site of airway narrowing.

      Drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) is a well described modality to mimic the dynamic change
      of UA in OSA patients during natural sleep. Nevertheless, the tongue base thickness (TBT),
      one of the important anatomic factors in OSA, is hard to evaluate under this method.
      Recently, submental ultrasound (US), the noninvasive and convenient tool, has been widely
      applied to measure the TBT in awake OSA patients, so as to predict the severity and
      relationship with UA collapse. However, few evidence has addressed the relationship between
      UA collapse and the TBT in different head positions, awake and sleep period In this study,
      submental US during awake and drug induced sleep period is applied in the diagnostic workup
      of OSA patients. By correlation with DISE findings, more parameters could be used for
      evaluation and management of upper airway collapse in OSA patients.
