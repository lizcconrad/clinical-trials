  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe haemophilia A and B (SHA, SHB) are X - linked inherited bleeding disorders,
      characterised by factor VIII and IX levels of &lt;1 IU/dL respectively. The mainstay of
      treatment in SHA and SHB is replacement therapy with intravenous infusions of factor VIII and
      IX. However, there is significant variability in the bleeding phenotype within severe
      haemophiliacs with some presenting with minimal bleeding episodes even on less intensive
      treatment regimens. A significant contributor to inter-individual variability in the bleeding
      phenotype is the coagulation phenotype, but there are no established assays in routine
      clinical practice that can be used to quantify this. This study aims to study novel assays
      and characterise the observed phenotypic heterogeneity.
