    <description>Sylc is a dry powder (calcium sodium phosphosilicate), based on NovaMin powder. Bottle of small and coarse particles will be used for the treatment.
Steps:
Isolation: D.M. will make proper isolation for the teeth using cotton rolls.
Hand piece: NSK Prophymate Neo will be used to deliver the powder particles on the sensitive areas. Air stream adjusted at 40-46 psi.
Application: The hand piece will be held at constant distance (3-4mm) away from the tooth surface, with 60-80 degrees on the buccal surfaces. The powder will be applied for 5-10 seconds per tooth in a circular movement.
Suction: High volume suction will be used on lingual side of the teeth to suck any particles, and avoid patient from swallowing it.</description>

    <arm_group_label>fluoride varnish (Bifluorid 10)</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>fluoride varnish Bifluorid 10(by VOCO) will be used. It is a rapid- drying suspension of equal amounts of sodium fluoride and calcium fluoride.
The single dose form will be used, to make sure the amount of fluoride varnish used is standardized.
Steps:
Preparation: The tooth will be properly cleaned, and the surface will be air-dried.
Dispensing: The foil will be pierced using a micro- tim, the opening will be enlarged, the brush will be wet in a circular movement.
Application: Thin coat will be applied on the tooth surface. The varnish will be left from 10-20 seconds then air dried.
Concerning the storage of the Bifluoride 10, it will be stored in refrigerator at the operative clinic to avoid exposure to high temperature or sunlight.</description>
