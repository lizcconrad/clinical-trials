  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Cardiac resynchronization
      therapy (CRT) is a well-established treatment for patients with symptomatic heart failure in
      spite of optimised medical treatment (OMT), reduced left ventricular pump function with left
      ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 35% and prolonged activation of the ventricles (bundle
      branch block: BBB). CRT is established by implanting an advanced pacemaker system with three
      leads in the right atrium, right ventricle, and in the coronary sinus (CS) for pacing the
      left ventricle (LV), and often is combined with an implantable defibrillator (ICD) function.
      On average, CRT treatment improves longevity, quality of life and functional class, and
      reduces heart failure symptoms. Thus, at present, CRT is indicated for heart failure patients
      on OMT with BBB or chronic right ventricular (RV) pacing.

      It is, however, a significant problem that 30-40% of CRT patients do not benefit measurably -
      showing symptomatic improvement or improved cardiac pump function - from this therapy
      (socalled non-responders). LV lead placement is one of the major determinants of beneficial
      effect from CRT.

      Observational studies and three randomised trials with small sample sizes indicate that
      targeted placement of the LV lead towards a late activated segment of the LV may be
      associated with improved outcome. Based on this literature, some physicians already search
      for late activation when positioning the LV lead. However, such a strategy was never tested
      in a controlled trial with a sample size sufficient to investigate important clinical
      outcomes. Detailed mapping for a late activation may increase operating times and infection
      risk, result in use of more electrodes and wires, thereby increasing costs, and increase
      radiation exposure for patient and staff. Placement of the LV lead in late activated areas
      close to myocardial scar may even result in higher risk of arrhythmia and death.

      At present, it is completely unsettled whether targeted positioning of the LV lead to the
      latest electrically activated area of LV is superior to contemporary standard CRT with regard
      to improving prognosis for patients with heart failure and BBB.

      The present study aims to test whether targeting the placement of the LV lead towards the
      latest electrically activated segment in the coronary sinus branches improves outcome as
      compared with standard LV lead implant in a patient population with heart failure and CRT
      indication.
