  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate this new technology available at the University of
      Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center in the setting of head and neck cancer radiation treatment
      planning. This study will also provide preliminary data critical to the development of
      multi-parametric, multi-modality quantitative imaging biomarkers and data analysis models for
      prediction of outcome in both tumors and normal tissue, which are essential for
      patient-specific adaptive therapy.

      All participants will undergo a diagnostic PET/CT and a Radiation Treatment Planning CT per
      SOC procedures. In addition, all participants will undergo an additional imaging set
      consisting of a PET/MRI. It is anticipated that most patients will undergo the PET/MRI on the
      same day as their PET/CT negating the need for a second injection of the FDG radioisotope
      used for SOC PET imaging. All patients will receive gadolinium contrast per SOC dosing
      guidelines for the MRI portion of the PET/MRI. Both SOC MMRI pulse sequences and
      investigational sequences will be utilized in this study.

Both SOC MMRI pulse sequences and investigational sequences will be utilized in this study.
If a second dose of the radioisotope is need to complete the PET/MRI (unable to perform both PET scans on the same day) only a 50% dose of FDG will be administered due to the increased sensitivity the PET/MRI scanner.</description>

        The planned enrollment of 40 participants includes 4-12 patients in each of the 5 anatomic
        subgroups. This will allow flexibility in enrollment to reflect the frequency pattern of
        case presentation and any early findings that may suggest one or more sub-sites are
        particularly well suited to disclose valuable tumor data using PET/MRI scans.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants with tumors of the head and neck region (nasal cavity, oral cavity,
             pharynx, larynx, sinuses, salivary glands, and head and neck skin) who are candidates
             for radiation treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Contraindications for MRI: All patients will be screened with standard UWHC MRI
             screening procedures:

          -  Any person with the following will be excluded: cardiac pacemaker, metal fragments in
             or around the eye, venous umbrella, permanent eyeliner or permanent artificial
             eyebrows.

        Patents with the following potentially non-MRI compatible devices will undergo screening
        using the standard UWHC MRI screening protocol by trained UWHC personnel: cardiac
        pacemaker, heart valve replacement, intracranial aneurysm clips, middle ear, eye, joint, or
        penile implants, joint replacements, implantable hearing aids, neurostimulator devices,
        insulin pumps, shunts/stents, metal mesh/coil implants; metal plate/pin/screws/wires, or
        any other metallic implants. Also patients with anatomical constraints limiting the
        feasibility of MRI will be excluded.

        - Issue of pregnancy: We will exclude all known pregnant females from the study to avoid
        the potential risk of fetal injury upon exposure to the PET scan. Determination of
        pregnancy will be based upon the standard screening procedures in place for radiation
        therapy.

          -  Persons who are not fluent in English

          -  Anyone who can not provide written informed consent
