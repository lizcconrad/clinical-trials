  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objective :

      To demonstrate diagnostic performances of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) as compared to
      Computed Tomography (CT) as a second intention imaging modality in young women with acute non
      traumatic abdominopelvic pain and non contributive ultrasonography.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Methods :

      Consecutive women aged 18-40 years old with acute abdominopelvic pain referred to CT by the
      emergency Physician or gynaecologist after a non contributive ultrasonography will be
      included.

      After obtaining informed consent, all patients will undergo standard CT followed by an
      additional MRI examination, performed using a short MRI protocol and within 6 hour from CT.

      The gold standard or reference diagnosis will be established in consensus by an expert panel
      at 3 months follow up using a standardized diagnosis form.

      A retrospective reading will be performed independently for CT and MRI by radiologists
      blinded to the reference diagnosis, using the same standardized diagnosis form.

      CT and MRI accuracies will be compared.
