  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High-throughput whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is bringing new opportunities in the diagnosis
      of rare diseases. It will more frequently lead to a primary diagnosis (aim of the genetic
      consultation), but it may also lead to the discovery of mutations not related to the
      patient's disease. These findings are called &quot;incidental findings&quot; (IF) and may give rise to
      preventive or curative interventions in a personalised medicine approach.

      The question of proposing to patients access to all or part of these findings is a matter of
      debate in France and elsewhere. This question has given rise to new challenges and new needs
      that professionals must respond to by implementing appropriate management and new skills. It
      raises specific ethical issues, which require precise understanding of the expectations and
      experiences of patients. Patients' diagnostic trajectories must also meet criteria for
      efficacy and financial and organisational sustainability for the healthcare establishments
      and, for the healthcare system. Our project aims to assess the expectations of
      patients/parents with regard to this opportunity, and to determine how information should be
      provided to patients and how they should be accompanied to ensure efficient and appropriate
      management.
