  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the dose-dependent effects of TAK-954 on gastric
      emptying time of solids in participants with diabetic or idiopathic gastroparesis assessed by
      scintigraphy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-954. TAK-954 is a 5 HT4 receptor agonist
      and is being tested to treat people who have diabetic or idiopathic gastroparesis and who
      previously reported delay in stomach emptying. This study will look at the gastric emptying
      time of solids in people who take TAK-954 or placebo.

      The study will enroll approximately 48 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by
      chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the four treatment groups-which will remain
      undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent
      medical need):

        -  TAK-954 0.1 mg

        -  TAK-954 0.3 mg

        -  TAK-954 1 mg

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive solution) - this is a solution that looks like the study drug
           but has no active ingredient.

      During the study, participants will complete a daily diary to record their bowel habits and
      determine the severity of their gastroparesis symptoms using the Gastroparesis Cardinal
      Symptom Index (GCSI).

      This single center trial will be conducted in the United States. The duration of treatment is
      3 days and the overall period of evaluation is up to 28 days. The participants will be
      contacted by telephone (Days 10 to 14) for follow-up assessment. There will be another
      follow-up phone call for women of childbearing potential (Days 38 to 43).

    <measure>Half time (T1/2) of Gastric Emptying of Solids</measure>
    <time_frame>Multiple time-points post-radio-labelled meal (up to 8 hours) on Day 2</time_frame>
    <description>Scintigraphy assessment is used to evaluate the gastric emptying of solids following a radio-labelled meal. Half time (t1/2) of gastric emptying (GE) of solids is the time for half of the ingested solids or liquids to leave the stomach.</description>
  </primary_outcome>

    <measure>Colonic Geometric Center at 4, 24, and 48 Hours</measure>
    <time_frame>4, 24, and 48 hours post-radiolabel meal</time_frame>
    <description>The scintigraphic method is used to measure colonic transit. An isotope is adsorbed on activated charcoal particles and delivered to the colon in a delayed release capsule. Anterior and posterior gamma images are taken hourly. The geometric center (GC) is the weighted average of counts in the different colonic regions. The scale ranges from 1 to 5; a high GC implies faster colonic transit, a GC of 1 implies all isotope is in the ascending colon, and a GC of 5 implies all isotope is in the stool.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants who Experience at least one Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 up to Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>
