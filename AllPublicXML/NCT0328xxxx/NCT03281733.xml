  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: As described in detail in the literature, patients identified with malnutrition
      are at increased risk of poor clinical outcomes. Despite this knowledge, malnourished
      patients do not always get optimal nutritional management while admitted into a hospital due
      to what we describe as gaps in care over the course of their admission.

      Objective: We hypothesized that the three main gaps in care were poor RDN/MD communication,
      excessive time spent NPO for procedures/testing, and/or inaccurate/incomplete dietary
      discharge instructions. The objectives of this study were to determine and to characterize
      gaps in nutritional care after a malnutrition diagnosis.

      Design: This retrospective study involved post-discharge chart reviews of malnourished adult
      medicine patients admitted to an acute care facility from September 1- November 30, 2014
      (n=242).

      To assess the prevalence of gaps in care among malnourished adult medicine patients, we
      conducted a retrospective study of all adult patients (&gt;18 years old) admitted to a medicine
      unit at NewYork-Presbyterian- Weill Cornell Medical Center from September 1- November 30,
      2014 and diagnosed with malnutrition during that admission. Two independent researchers
      reviewed the medical charts of 242 patients identified through Humedica with either severe or
      non-severe malnutrition ICD9 codes (262 or 263.0). Each admission/readmission was counted as
      a separate episode of care. Readmission was defined as those patients readmitted within 3
      months of initial admission. Note, we considered defining readmission to be within 30 days of
      the initial admit date, but the number of participants meeting this criterion in our sample
      was too small. Patients were excluded if they were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU)
      at any point during their stay. Two RDNs reviewed the first 43 charts and inter-reliability
      was calculated as well as the individual Cohen's kappa for all questions. Reviewers discussed
      questions with lower agreement in order to avoid future discrepancies.

      A gap in communication with medical team was defined as a delay in the approval or
      implementation of an appropriate nutritional recommendation made by the RDN (i.e.
      recommendations or pending orders were not verified/ordered within 48 hours).
      Procedures/testing gap was defined as when a feeding was held in preparation for or related
      to procedures or testing (i.e. operating room, imaging, swallowing evaluation, etc.).
      Discharge gap was defined as when the diet order in the discharge instructions given to
      patients was not consistent with the RDN's recommendations (i.e. RDN recommends an ONS to
      continue post discharge but discharge orders do not include it).

      Fisher's exact and chi-square tests were used to evaluate the following categorical
      variables: gender, severe versus non-severe malnutrition and malnutrition context. All
      statistical analysis was performed with Stata/MP 14.1. This study had Institutional Review
      Board approval.

    <description>The specific count of gaps in care will be obtained from expert review by two registered dietitians from the charts of 242 malnourished patients. Gaps that met the predetermined study definitions for gaps in care were counted in our analysis. Gaps in care were subcategorized as communication, testing/procedure, and discharge related.Statistical analyses used chi-square and fisher's exact tests to determine statistical differences between the types of gaps in care and to assess if any demographic information led to a higher frequency of gaps in care.</description>
