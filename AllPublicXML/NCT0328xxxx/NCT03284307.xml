      This study will be a single-site, controlled, unblinded study at the University of Wisconsin
      to examine changes in the electroencephalogram during anesthesia and waking.

      * 20 subjects will be recruited per drug, and subjects can be recruited to undergo multiple
      sedation protocols.

      Screening:

      Subjects will respond to the volunteer posts for the study by calling into a study specific
      phone number. They will complete a phone screening to determine basic eligibility for the
      study. At the beginning of the sedation session, participants will affirm that in the
      interval since their baseline visit, they have not acquired any of the cited exclusion
      criteria that would preclude participation. A review of these exclusion criteria will be
      completed by the Anesthesiologist. A standard pre-anesthetic assessment will be performed,
      including confirmation of NPO status, and documented using the standard Department of
      Anesthesiology pre-operative evaluation form.

      The first sedative will be dexmedetomidine followed by ketamine, propofol and then
      sevoflurane (dependent on the availability of the drugs). Total enrollment in the study will
      be up to 80 subjects. Each sedation experiment will occur on separate days at least 28 days
      apart, if the subject chooses to participate in more than one session.
