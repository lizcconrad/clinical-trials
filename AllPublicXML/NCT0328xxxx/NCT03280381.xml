  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will establish an evidence base for the Nifty Feeding Cup by evaluating its
      effectiveness and caregiver satisfaction. The investigators will conduct a randomized
      crossover trial that compares the Nifty Feeding Cup to a standardized, generic medicine cup
      used to feed preterm infants with breastfeeding difficulties at Komfo Anokye Teaching
      Hospital (KATH) in Kumasi, Ghana.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to compare the Nifty Feeding Cup to a standardized, generic cup in up
      to 200 preterm infants. The aim and hypotheses were selected based on the most informative
      outcomes given the scope of the funding. The investigators will test the hypotheses that
      Nifty Feeding Cup feeding compared to generic cup feeding will result in:

        1. Less spillage

        2. Greater caregiver satisfaction

        3. Shorter duration of feeds

    <intervention_model_description>Investigators will conduct a randomized crossover trial in mothers/caregivers with a preterm infant in the mother-baby unit at Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH) in Kumasi, Ghana. Each caregiver/infant pair will use the Nifty Feeding Cup for two feeds and the standardized generic cup for two feeds. Cross-over means each caregiver/infant pair will use both cups, with the order of the cup used first and second randomized.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Spillage</measure>
    <time_frame>24-36 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Spillage will be reported as a percent with the amount of milk in grams spilled/mopped up divided by the total amount of milk weighed in grams less the total amount of milk not used. Each caregiver-infant pair will be provided with a bib cloth for each observed feeding. The bib cloth will be weighed before and after each feed and the weights recorded on the Feeding Assessment form. The difference between the pre and post weights will be used as the measure of the amount spilled. A digital scale will be used to measure the milk weight, which will be recorded in grams.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Caregiver satisfaction [immediate]</measure>
    <time_frame>24-36 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Caregiver's satisfaction will be the cup she prefers and rated satisfaction, which will be recorded in the In-Hospital Preference Survey completed after the caregiver has finished the feeding portion of the study.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of feed</measure>
    <time_frame>24-36 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of feed will be collected in minutes and seconds with a digital timer. The timer will begin at the time the cup first touches the infant's lip and stop when the cup last leaves the infant's mouth. If there are stops and starts in the feeding (e.g. mother needs to express more milk), we will also record this information.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Intake</measure>
    <time_frame>24-36 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Measure of milk in grams in the cup before and after the feeding. If the cup is refilled, milk will be measured in grams before and after the refill. A digital scale will be used to measure grams. Intake will be estimated based on the baseline measure subtracting out spillage and adding in refills that occurred during the feed.</description>

    <description>The 40 mL Nifty Feeding Cup features an extended reservoir off the lip of the cup that holds a small bolus of milk, ensuring efficient delivery of milk, is made of a durable, soft, silicone material that protects the infant's mouth from injury, has embossed measurements help with tracking volume and intake of milk, is ergonomically designed for frequent use and to enhance finger and wrist control of milk flow and is made from a quick-drying, ultraviolet radiation-resistant, durable, affordable silicone that can be boiled for sterilization. Mothers can directly express into the cup, reducing possible cross-contamination from other containers.</description>

    <description>The generic cup that will be used in this study is a small medicine cup 30 ml in size.Small medicine cups are manufactured by a variety of manufacturers and are commonly used in health facilities to feed breastmilk to infants who are having breastfeeding difficulties. The cups are generally translucent, calibrated with a variety of measurements including 2.5-30 mL.</description>
