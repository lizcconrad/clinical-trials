      The study assesses whether adding a behavioral intervention, known as the Adolescent
      Community Reinforcement Approach (A-CRA), to the treatment of individuals already receiving
      buprenorphine/naloxone can improve treatment success and retention rates in young adults with
      severe opioid use disorder.

    <textblock>
      Buprenorphine is one of the medication assisted treatments approved by the FDA for opioid use
      disorders. Treatment with buprenorphine/naloxone may reduce the risk of opioid overdose and
      lower the occurrence of further conditions associated with injection drug use such as
      psychiatric disorders, hepatitis C infection, HIV, and high-risk sexual and criminal
      behaviors. The study assesses whether adding a behavioral intervention, known as the
      Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach (A-CRA), to the treatment of individuals already
      receiving buprenorphine/naloxone can improve treatment success and retention rates in young
      adults with severe opioid use disorder.

    <intervention_model_description>This 12 to 14-week randomized controlled pilot trial will begin by an induction on sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone for all participants who would usually receive buprenorphine based treatment in the clinic. After the two-week induction phase, participants will be randomized into two groups. While continuing buprenorphine/naloxone the experimental group will receive a 12 to 14-week course of A-CRA, while the control group will be provided limited counseling by the prescriber. Limited counseling is the standard treatment approach for prescribing buprenorphine and covers medication adherence, side effects to the medication, assessment of withdrawal/cravings and dose adjustment as indicated. After completion of the 12 to 14-week A-CRA intervention, all individuals will receive weekly limited counseling until week 24 (6 month follow up).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Qualitative urine test for opiates (+/-) will be performed. All presumptive positive assays will be confirmed by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry. The concentration value must be greater than or equal to the cutoff to be reported as positive. The opiates test results (positive/negative) will be documented. Proportion of opiates-negative urine drug screens over the total number of urine drug screens at each stage will be reported.</description>

    <description>To investigate any difference in opioid use in the experimental group compared to the control group.
The GAIN-Q3 Standard is a brief clinician administered screener used to identify and address a wide range of psychosocial problems in clinical and general populations. Average administration time for the GAIN Q3 Standard is 25-35 minutes with a length of 26 pages. The assessment categories include background, school problems, work problems, physical health, sources of stress, risk behaviors and infectious diseases, mental health, substance use, and crime and violence. The severity of problems and recent treatment participation in each life area are represented. Substance use categories document self-reported frequency of substance use within the past 90 days for each substance endorsed (alcohol, opioids, marijuana, and other illicit psychoactive drugs). Individuals are able to say that they do not know, or refuse to answer any questions that they do not want to answer.</description>

    <description>The A-CRA is a modified version of the Community Reinforcement Approach (CRA) for adolescents and transitional age youth . The A-CRA treatment protocol consists of nineteen procedures designed to promote positive behavior change directed towards prosocial activities and engagement in the individual's community. A community can include but is not limited to: social and peer activities, family interaction, and work or school environments. Some of the highlighted procedures include relapse prevention, sobriety sampling, problem solving, and communication skills. There are also combined parent/and or couples relationship sessions with the young adult. Treatment duration can vary from 12 to 14-weeks depending on the level of family involvement and attendance in joint sessions.</description>

    <description>Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at mu-opioid receptor, an antagonist at kappa-opioid receptor, and is a Schedule III narcotic. Naloxone is an antagonist at the mu-opioid receptor. Buprenorphine/naloxone requires the use of an induction to avoid the risk of withdrawal. Participants are instructed not to use opioids for at least 10 hours prior to first dose. Once symptoms of withdrawal score a minimum of 7 on the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS), the first dose is administered. If a patient has gone through withdrawal prior to arrival in clinic and further withdrawal symptoms are not expected, the clinician will do induction as with COWS score of 0. A 4/1 mg dose will be given. Participants will be monitored for an hour. An additional 4/1 mg dose can be provided to a dose that suppresses withdrawal effects. The physician then provides a prescription for 8/2-16/4 mg for Day 2. Doses can be adjusted with a maximum of total 24/6 mg/day. The target daily dose is 16/4 mg.</description>
