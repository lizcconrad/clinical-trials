  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of curcumin in reducing the
      number of aberrant crypt foci (ACF) in the colon.

      Laboratory studies have indicated that this agent, which is derived from plants and found in
      foods we eat, has anti-inflammatory properties and prevents colon cancer in animal studies.
      ACFs are small abnormalities in the lining of the colon that with time may grow into
      colorectal adenomas (also called polyps, growths or small masses of tissue on the lining of
      the colon or rectum which have the potential to become cancerous) which can then grow into
      adenocarcinomas (cancer) in the colon or rectum.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must be eligible for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening/surveillance by
             current criteria.

          -  Subjects must have at least 5 ACF on eligibility chromosigmoidoscopy examination.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects must not have:

          -  Alcohol consumption of greater than 2 glasses of wine or beer per day or illicit
             recreational drug use

          -  Platelet or coagulation abnormalities, or personal history of a bleeding disorder,
             including individuals taking warfarin.

          -  High risk for developing endocarditis (history of endocarditis or rheumatic fever,
             cardiac valve prostheses, or mitral valve prolapse that requires antibiotic
             prophylaxis).

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension, diabetes, or chronic congestive heart failure.

          -  Renal insufficiency defined as a serum creatinine &gt; 2.5 mg/dl

          -  History of colorectal surgery with removal of the distal 60 cm of colon or rectum.

          -  History of other gastrointestinal mucosal epithelial diseases (such as Barrett's
             esophagus, chronic or recurrent peptic ulcer disease, celiac sprue or other disorders
             of nutrient absorption).
