      This study is designed to ablate an aberrant immune system and then, similar to the use of
      marrow transplants for immunodeficient patients, reconstitute a new immune system with
      lymphocyte depleted stem cells. Subsequent disease activity will be followed by (1) Crohn's
      disease activity index (CDAI), (2) quality of life instrument (IBDQ), (3) type and amount of
      therapy for CD, and (4) flow cytometry of peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets. In addition,
      the subjects will undergo periodic absorption function testing, to assess small intestinal
      function. We anticipate that this study will also form the basis to clarify further the role
      of the immune system in Crohn's disease.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Less than physiologic age 60 at time of pretransplant evaluation.

          -  An established clinical diagnosis of severe CD that has failed therapy with
             prednisone, azathioprine, 5 ASA products and metronidazole, and has failed to have a
             sustained decrement of 70 points in the CDAI after one course of anti-TNF alpha,
             Infliximad. The patient is being considered for therapy with cyclosporin A (CSA) or
             surgical resection. The CDAI (appendix A) is 250-400.

          -  Pre-study peripheral blood counts must include a platelet count greater than
             100,000/ul and an absolute neutrophil count greater than 1500/ul.

          -  Stem cell harvest greater than 1.4 x 106 CD34 cells/kg after CD34+ selection (to
             continue to transplant.)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  HIV positive

          -  History of coronary artery disease, or congestive heart failure.

          -  Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, or any other illness that in the opinion of the
             investigators would jeopardize the ability of the patient to tolerate aggressive
             chemotherapy

          -  Prior history of malignancy except localized basal cell or squamous skin cancer. Other
             malignancies for which the patient is judged to be cured by local surgical therapy,
             such as head and neck cancer, or stage I breast cancer will be considered on an
             individual basis.

          -  Positive pregnancy test, lactation, inability or unwillingness to pursue effective
             means of birth control, failure to accept or comprehend irreversible sterility as a
             side effect of therapy.

          -  Psychiatric illness or mental deficiency making compliance with treatment or informed
             consent impossible.

          -  FEV I/FVC &lt; 50% of predicted, DLCO &lt; 50% of predicted.

          -  Resting LVEF &lt; 40%

          -  Bilirubin &gt; 2.0 mg/dl, transferase (AST) &gt; 2x upper limit of normal, unless the
             abnormalities are secondary to Crohn's disease.

          -  Serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dl.

          -  Platelet count less than 100,000/ul, ANC less than 1500/ul.

          -  Patients presenting with intestinal perforation or toxic megacolon, or a suppurative
             problem that will require urgent surgery. In addition, the patient may not have any
             active infection. The presence of intestinal stomas does not exclude the patient from
             study.
