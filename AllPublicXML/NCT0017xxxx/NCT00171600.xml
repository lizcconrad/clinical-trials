      Title: Antialbuminuric effect of valsartan, lisinopril and valsartan versus lisinopril in
      non-diabetic and diabetic renal disease: a randomized (3:3:1), open label, parallel group, 20
      weeks follow-up.

      Objective: To evaluate the antialbuminuric effect of high doses of valsartan vs lisinopril vs
      combo treatment in non-diabetic and diabetic patients.

      Hypothesis: Combo treatment reduces microalbuminuria and the albumin/creatinine ratio more
      than monotherapies..

      Design: Multicentric, randomized, open label, parallel group, active controlled.

      Dose / regimen: Valsartan 320 vs Lisinopril 40 vs Valsartan/lisinopril 160/20

      Primary Endpoint: Antialbuminuric effect of valsartan 320 mg, lisinopril and valsartan versus
      lisinopril 40 mg in non-diabetic and diabetic renal disease following 5 months of follow-up.
      Description % of change in albuminuria from baseline at 20 weeks.

      Secondary Endpoint : To investigate the effect of 5 months treatment with
      valsartan,lisinopril and valsartan versus lisinopril in GFR (Cl creatinine), also to
      investigate the effect of 5 months treatment with valsartan, lisinopril and valsartan plus
      lisinopril on blood pressure and the effect on left ventricular mass index using
      electrocardiogram and Cornell-Sokolow method.
