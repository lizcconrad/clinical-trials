  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of the chemistry of depression in people who are taking an antidepressant but
      it is not working well. The changes in brain chemicals that occur when an SSRI type
      antidepressant is supplemented with risperidone (RisperdalÂ®) will be studied. Spinal fluid is
      used to measure chemical levels of dopamine, serotonin, and other chemicals thought to be
      involved in depression. The study has potential to help understand and treat depression.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Treatment-resistant unipolar depression (previous diagnosis of MDD by SCID-P or
             DSM-IV) as defined by inadequate or waning response to adequate SRI treatment for at
             least 4 weeks

          -  HRSD (17-item) score greater than or equal to 15 while taking an SRI with no past
             suicide attempts for one year and no current ideation, intent, or plan. Repeat HRSD
             scores should remain greater than or equal to 15 for two consecutive weeks after
             initial screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Adverse extrapyramidal or other response to dopamine antagonist effects in the past.

          -  Any adverse response to risperidone in the past.

          -  Residence beyond 30 miles from Vanderbilt University.

          -  Inability to comply with study requirements.

          -  Psychotic hallucinations

          -  Past diagnosis of Bipolar, Dissociative, or Psychotic Disorders.

          -  Substance or alcohol abuse, other psychotropic, or any investigational or herbal
             preparation within 3 months or Substance dependency within 6 months prior to initial
             screening (by SCID-P).

          -  History of impulsive suicidal gestures or attempts within 2 years (must have no
             suicidal ideation, intent or plan for a period of one year).

          -  Primary diagnosis of Cluster B or C personality disorder, or significant comorbidity
             due to Borderline, Antisocial, Schizoid, or Schizotypal Personality Disorder (by
             SCID-II).

          -  Seasonal affective syndromes, including Seasonal Affective Disorder (because the
             duration of the study is long enough to expect &quot;spontaneous&quot; [natural] remissions.)

          -  Chronic (daily) benzodiazepine use in the past month or any use 1 week prior to
             sampling.

          -  Regular analgesic use. No antipyretic medication is allowed in the pre- through
             post-sampling period, leaving difficulty with pain management for pain-prone patients.

          -  Medication use deemed by the investigator unacceptable for study protocol.

          -  Pregnancy or inability to cooperate with effective contraceptive method (double
             barrier).

          -  Physical condition or significant medical history of any illness that presents risk
             with lumbar catheterization.

          -  Lactation.

          -  Blood donation within 90 days prior to or planned 90 days following the study.

          -  Severe migraine history.

          -  Daily tobacco use (absolute abstinence is required during the entire study.)
