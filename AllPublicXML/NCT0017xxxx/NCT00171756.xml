        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female, aged between 18 - 75 years of age inclusively.

          -  Mild to moderate hypertension (MSDBP &gt;= 95 and &gt;= 110 mmHg and / or MSSBP &gt;140mm Hg)
             at visit 1, requiring pharmacological intervention. For newly diagnosed patients,
             hypertensive blood pressure values must be noted on at least two successive
             examinations prior to entry into the study. In addition, patients must require therapy
             despite having been following dietary &amp; lifestyle advice for at least 3 months.

          -  Written informed consent to participate in the study, prior to any study procedures.

          -  Ability to communicate and comply with all study requirements

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  o Uncontrolled hypertension defined as seated blood pressure of either systolic BP
             &gt;180 mmHg and/or diastolic BP &gt;110mmHg.

               -  Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities that may interfere with the
                  assessment of safety and/or efficacy of the study drug

               -  Patients with severe medical condition(s) that in the view of the investigator
                  may prohibit participation in the study

               -  Renal artery stenosis

               -  Diabetes Mellitus

               -  Any condition resulting from or leading to platelet or clotting abnormalities
                  (eg. hemophilia, von Willebrand's disease).

               -  History of a vascular event or intervention (e.g. MI, PTCA or CABG) within 6
                  months preceding the study.

               -  History of clinically significant angina, LVH, transient ischemic attack, stroke,
                  intermittent claudication, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism or
                  peripheral vascular disease.

               -  Uncontrolled atrial fibrillation (&gt;100 b.p.m. at rest) or other conditions which
                  may require anti-aggregant or anti-vitamin K therapies.

               -  Clinical evidence of congestive heart failure.

               -  Evidence of second or third degree heart block or sick sinus syndrome.
