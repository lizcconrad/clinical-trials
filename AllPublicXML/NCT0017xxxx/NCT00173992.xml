  <brief_summary>

      The specific aims of this research are delineated as the following:

      Aim 1: To investigate the neuromuscular and biomechanical mechanisms of the emerging
      processes of proactive and reactive balance control during sitting and standing in patients
      with stroke at different stages of the recovery course.

      Aim 2: To determine the relationships between brain lesion sites and the recovery patterns of
      reactive and proactive balance control mechanisms in patients with stroke.

      Aim 3: To determine the relationships between the impairments in reactive and proactive
      balance control mechanisms and functional outcome as well as fall incidence in patients
      following stroke.

      Aim 4: To investigate the efficacy of different training regimens in improving reactive and
      proactive balance control strategies and in preventing falls in stroke patients with
      different brain lesion sites.

      Principally, three hypotheses are to be tested:

      Hypothesis 1:The emerging processes and recovery patternes of proactive and reactive balance
      control may be different among stroke patients with different brain lesion locations.

      Hypothesis 2:There are positive correlations between the level of impairments in reactive and
      proactive balance control mechanisms and functional outcome as well as fall incidence in
      patients following stroke.

      Hypothesis 3:Training regimens that could best facilitate the emergence or improvement in
      reactive and proactive balance control strategies are different.

      Stroke is one of the leading causes of chronic disability in the world. Falls are one of the
      primary complications after stroke. The incidence of falls ranges from 25% to 75% among
      stroke patients residing in different settings, with greater incidence of falls occurring
      after discharge home. Postural instability has been suggested as one of the main causes
      leading to falls in this population. The recovery of the ability to maintain balance during
      activities of daily living, therefore, is essential for functional independence and safety of
      these patients. In the following paragraphs, the knowledge gaps taht we are proposing to
      bridge in this study and the revelant literature that leads us to identify these gaps are
      discussed.
