  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, active control, 8-week, flexible dose study of sertraline
      vs. venlafaxine Extended Release in the acute treatment of Major Depression in male and
      female outpatient sites that will recruit 15-20 patients each. Subjects will be randomized in
      a 1:1 ratio to receive either sertraline or venlafaxine XR based on a computer-generated
      randomized list.

      This is a randomized, double-blind, active control, 8-week, flexible dose study of sertraline
      vs. venlafaxine XR in the acute treatment of Major Depression in male and female outpatient
      sites that will recruit 15-20 patients each. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to
      receive either sertraline or venlafaxine XR based on a computer-generated randomized list.

      The primary objectives of the study are: to assess the comparative safety and tolerability of
      sertraline and venlafaxine XR and to assess number and severity of discontinuation symptoms
      and time to termination of taper at the end of acute treatment with sertraline vs.
      venlafaxine XR.
