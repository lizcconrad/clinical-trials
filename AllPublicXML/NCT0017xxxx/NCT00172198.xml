    <textblock>
      1. A prospective, controlled, randomized, study evaluating the clinical efficacy, including
           nutritional status, immune function and safety of Omegaven (ω-3 fish oil) supplemented
           parenteral nutrition in subjects of SICU.

        2. Study patients are the critical ill patients in SICU of NTUH and the enrolled patients
           will be 30 subjects ,including 15 in each treatment group.

        3. During parenteral nutrition, fat emulsions will be given separately from amino acid and
           glucose solutions. Infusion pump must be used.The recommended infusion duration of the
           daily lipid emulsion is 16 hours (0.0625 g fat/kg B.W./hour) from 8:00 am to 12:00 pm.

        4. During the study the assessments of safety and efficacy are to be performed according to
           case report form. The assessment for safety variables including blood pressure、heat rate
           、body temperature、liver function、renal function、coagulation、WBC、lipid profile etc. In
           addition，the assessments for efficacy variables including
           lymphocytes、cytokines(IL-1、IL-2、IL-6、IL-8、IL-11、IL-18、OX40
           ligand、G-CSF、FN-γ、TGF-β1、TNF-α etc)、incidence of infections、 length of ICU and hospital
           stay、mortality etc.
