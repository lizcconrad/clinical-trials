  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among several markers of inflammation and sepsis, procalcitonin (PCT) markers is being
      studied to investigate their accuracy for the diagnosis of bacterial infections. PCT is the
      prehormone of calcitonin, which is normally secreted by the C cells of the thyroid in
      response to hypercalcemia; under these normal conditions, negligible serumPCT concentrations
      are detected. The mechanism proposed for PCT production after inflammation and its role are
      still not completely known. It is believed that PCT is produced by the liver and peripheral
      blood mononuclear cells, modulated by lipopolysaccharides and sepsis-related cytokines. It
      binds to polysaccharides in pathogens, activating the classical complement pathway. The
      reported diagnostic accuracy of PCT for the diagnosis of bacterial infections has varied
      across studies.
