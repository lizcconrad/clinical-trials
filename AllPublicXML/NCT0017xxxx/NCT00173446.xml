  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dopamine (DA) is one of the main catecholamines in mammals. Its major role as a brain
      neurotransmitter is well known as well as its contribution to the development of pathologies,
      mainly arterial hypertension. Traditionally, dopamine receptors are divided into two families
      according to the stimulation or inhibition they may produce at the adenyl cyclase level. Five
      dopamine receptors have been identified: D1 (D1a) and D5 (D1b) exist in the D1 family. D2s,
      D2l, D3 and D4 belong to the D2 family. Formerly, less than 1% of patients with hypertension
      were believed to have primary hyperaldosteronism; however, recent studies have suggested that
      primary aldosteronism affects 5-13% of patients with hypertension and aldosteronomas are a
      more common cause of hypertension than previously thought. At least 2% of patients with
      hypertension may have an aldosteronoma. The investigators' previous clinical observation
      found two subtypes of aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA), which were defined according to
      their responses to metoclopramide during salt manipulation. On a high-salt diet (HS), the
      nonsuppressible subjects, with less dopaminergic inhibition of aldosterone secretion, had
      less urinary DA excretion and greater blood pressure (BP) elevation [Wu KD et al. 2002]. The
      investigators' recent study of six patients with an APA found that the expression of the D2
      receptor in APA was not universal. The amounts of D2 receptor messenger ribonucleic acid
      (mRNA) were more variant in either APA or their remnant adrenal glands. Only two cases of APA
      expressed the D2 receptors with much weaker signals compared with those in their respective
      remnant adrenals [Wu KD et al. 2001]. The investigators' current work demonstrates that the
      D2 receptor negatively regulates AII-stimulated aldosterone secretion and aldosterone
      synthase mRNA expression in NCI-H295R cells. On the other hand, the D4 receptor counteracts
      with the effect of the D2 receptor. In a future study, the investigators wish to quantify D2
      and D4 receptor mRNA and protein expression in APA and their remnant adrenal glands and
      correlate them to their clinical metoclopramide test results. The investigators also wish to
      know whether the difference between the D2 and D4 receptor expression reflect the different
      effects of dopamine inhibition on AII-stimulated aldosterone secretion and aldosterone
      synthase transcription. Finally, the investigators will explore the role of D2 and D4
      receptors on AII-stimulated adrenal cell proliferation.
