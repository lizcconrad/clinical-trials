  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to examine the role of paroxetine, an antidepressant medication, in
      the acute and continuation treatment of insomnia. Primary insomnia is a type of insomnia not
      directly resulting from general medical, chemical, or psychiatric conditions.

      The primary aim of this study is to demonstrate the role of paroxetine in the acute treatment
      of chronic primary insomnia. Paroxetine taken on a nightly basis in combination with sleep
      hygiene therapy will produce a greater number of diagnostic responders in acute treatment,
      compared to a placebo and sleep hygiene control condition, in a randomized, double-blinded,
      six-week acute treatment trial. EEG sleep, sleep quality, and daytime well-being, and daytime
      functioning will also show superior treatment effects during acute treatment with paroxetine
      plus sleep hygiene, as compared with the placebo control condition.

      A total of 66 patients with primary insomnia, as defined by DSM-IV criteria, will be
      randomized (1:1) to receive paroxetine plus sleep hygiene therapy (P+SH-a) or placebo plus
      sleep hygiene therapy (PL+SH-a) in weekly acute treatment sessions evolving over a six-week
      interval in a double-blinded, parallel group design.
