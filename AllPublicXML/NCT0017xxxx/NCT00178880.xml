      The purpose of the study is to identify and understand patterns of brain activity when people
      are depressed. The study will use an imaging method called Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
      which does not involve any exposure to radioactivity or radioactive substances.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  WEIGHT: less than or at 20% over ideal weight, as specified in the 1983 Metropolitan
             Height and Weight Tables. Patients who deviate from these ranges may be reviewed on an
             individual basis by the Investigator. This criterion is necessary because of
             mechanical limitations in fitting overweight individuals into the scanner, and the
             risk of excessive claustrophobic responses if tightly constricted.

          -  HEALTH: healthy, ambulatory normal or depressed adults

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of aneurysm clips, cardiac pacemakers, cochlear implants, metal in the eyes,
             and implanted insulin pumps.

          -  Evidence of significant hepatic, gastrointestinal, renal, respiratory, endocrine,
             hematologic, neurologic, psychiatric, or cardiovascular system abnormalities.

          -  Pregnancy.

          -  Patients with a known or suspected history of alcohol or drug misuse and/or a positive
             urine drug screen.

          -  Patients who are unwilling or unable to abide by the requirements of the study or who
             violate the prohibitions and restrictions of the study.

          -  Any condition which would make the patient, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             unsuitable for the study.

          -  Patients on antidepressants may not be taking any other medication, except at the
             discretion of the investigator. Untreated depressed or healthy subjects must be free
             of all medications except as approved by the investigator.

          -  Patients with serious medical illness, history or signs/symptoms of lumbar spine/disc
             disease or significant laboratory findings.

          -  Patients who present significant suicide risk, e.g. with a history of highly impulsive
             suicide attempts.
