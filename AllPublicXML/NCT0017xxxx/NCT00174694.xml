      Primary objective:

        -  To demonstrate that the clinical efficacy of telithromycin (800 mg od for 5 days) is
           non-inferior to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (875/125 mg bid for 10 days) at the
           test-of-cure (TOC) visit (Day 17-21) in subjects with acute bacterial sinusitis (ABS).

      Secondary objective(s):

        -  To assess the time to resolution of signs and symptoms between the baseline (Day 1) and
           TOC (Day 17-21) visits,

        -  To assess the rate of clinical relapse at the follow-up visit (Day 41-49),

        -  To assess health economic outcome until follow-up visit (Day 41-49),

        -  To assess quality of life up to the follow-up visit (Day 41-49),

        -  To compare the safety of telithromycin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid,

        -  To compare the bacteriologic outcome of both treatments as observed at TOC (Day 17-21)
           and at follow-up visit (Day 41-49),in subjects with ABS.
