      BACKGROUND: Primary screening with sigmoidoscopy would miss a substantial proportion of
      advanced proximal neoplasia (APN), but screening with universal colonoscopy is costly. The
      aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of mixed strategy which uses sigmoidoscopy for
      younger patients and colonoscopy for older patients.

      MATERIALS and METHODS: We analyzed an established database containing consecutive
      average-risk adults aged 50 or older who underwent screening colonoscopy as part of health
      check-up. We assessed the efficacy of mixed screening strategy using colonoscopy for persons
      aged at and above a certain cut-off age and sigmoidoscopy for persons aged below that age.
      Those who underwent sigmoidoscopy initially would be referred for subsequent colonoscopy if
      distal sentinel lesion was detected.

      Because the prevalence of proximal colon cancer and APN was higher in older patients15, a
      greater proportion of advanced colonic neoplasia or cancer would be missed if colonoscopy was
      not performed for older patients. So if we develop a mixed strategy to offer sigmoidoscopy
      for younger patients and reserve colonoscopy for older patients, we might be able to detect
      more APN with fewer colonoscopic procedures. We aimed to determine an optimal cut-off age and
      choose an appropriate distal sentinel lesion for subsequent colonoscopy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Only asymptomatic ethnic Chinese subjects aged 50 years or older who underwent total
             colonoscopy were included in this study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Persons with symptoms indicative of colorectal cancer, such as hematochezia, body
             weight loss, development of persistent abdominal pain or rectal pain, and a change in
             bowel habit, were excluded from this study. Other exclusion criteria were: (1) past
             history of CRC, colon polyps, or inflammatory bowel disease; (2) a history of
             screening tests, including FOBT, sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy, or barium studies within
             5 years; (3) any first degree relative(s) with colon cancer; (4) criteria for
             hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, familial adenomatous polyposis, or other
             polyposis syndrome; (5) obvious anemia with hemoglobin level less than 10g/dl; (6)
             incomplete examination of entire colon, including poor colon preparation and failure
             to reach cecum.
