    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate carotid artery stenting (CAS) with and
      without cerebral protection (CP) to determine if CP improves safety and effectiveness of CAS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single center, prospective, randomized trial evaluating the safety and
      effectiveness of CAS with and without CP. The study population will be comprised of subjects
      with atherosclerotic, post endarterectomy restenotic or other obstructive lesions in native
      carotid arteries. Other carotid artery pathology not amenable to surgical repair (for example
      carotid artery dissection) will also be considered. Subjects at high risk for complications
      from standard CEA will be the target population for this study. High risk status will be
      confirmed by two physicians, one of whom is a vascular surgeon. Both symptomatic and
      asymptomatic subjects will be enrolled. This will ensure that the proportion of symptomatic
      subjects is the same in the two arms of the study. &quot;Symptomatic&quot; is defined in the exclusion
      criteria. The expected duration of this clinical trial is 3 years.

      In this study there are there are two arms that a subject may be randomized to:

      Group1: CAS with the use of the RX ACCUNET Group 2: CAS without the use of the RX ACCUNET
      This study has been designed to test whether the addition of CP enhances the safety and
      effectiveness of CAS.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  To participate in this study, the subject MUST have all of the following for inclusion
             in the study:

             • The subject (male or non-pregnant female) must be &gt; 18 years of age.

             • The subject should have a stenosis in the common or internal carotid artery of at
             least 70% determined by one of the modalities listed below.

             • The subject should be considered a relatively high risk for carotid endarterectomy.
             This determination has to be made and documented by two physicians, at least one of
             who must be a vascular surgeon acting as an investigator on this trial. High risk
             considerations should include at least one of the following:

               1. Cardiac dysfunction. NYHA class III or above, compensated or active congestive
                  heart failure (CHF), incomplete coronary revascularization, ejection fraction of
                  &lt;35%, pulmonary hypertension, or recommendation of a cardiologist against open
                  CEA.

               2. Pulmonary dysfunction, history of respiratory failure, severe chronic obstructive
                  pulmonary Disease (COPD) on bronchodilators or recommendation of a pulmonary
                  specialist against open CEA.

               3. Multi-system dysfunction, defined as any combination of medical problems in three
                  distinct systems.

               4. Anatomic issues: previous CEA or neck dissection, neck irradiation, inaccessible
                  lesions, neck fusion or other anatomic considerations increasing the risk of CEA.

               5. Age &gt;80 AND symptomatic (defined below)

               6. General debilitation documented by the subject's primary physician.

               7. Increased anesthetic risk as documented by an anesthesiologist.

                    -  Subjects can be either clinically symptomatic or asymptomatic (less than 80
                       years of age). Symptomatic subjects will have experienced an event within
                       the previous 120 days in the ipsilateral carotid artery distribution. The
                       event will be classified as either 1) one or more TIAs, characterized by
                       distinct focal neurologic dysfunction or monocular blindness with clearing
                       of signs and symptoms within 24 hours, or 2) one or more completed strokes
                       (as defined by this protocol) with persistence of symptoms or signs for more
                       than 24 hours (the most recent event is used as the qualifying event).

                       **Patients with major non-hemorrhagic strokes will be included if their
                       clinical status has been stable for 5 days (based on an exam performed by a
                       neurologist participating as a Co-Investigator in this trial).

                    -  If an angiogram is performed to qualify the subject, it should be as recent
                       as feasible and will not be acceptable if done &gt; 120 days from study entry.
                       Angiograms from other institutions will be acceptable.

                    -  Other non-invasive qualifying imaging modalities include:

               1. Duplex ultrasound (DU) performed at UPMC Presbyterian or Shadyside hospitals.

               2. Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) performed at UPMC Presbyterian or Shadyside
                  hospitals.

               3. Computed Tomographic Angiography (CTA) performed at UPMC Presbyterian or
                  Shadyside hospitals.

                    -  The degree of stenosis from these non-invasive studies has to be confirmed
                       on the pre-deployment diagnostic angiography prior to proceeding with stent
                       deployment.

                    -  However, if two of the non-invasive studies listed above report a stenosis
                       of &gt;70%, AND the pre-deployment angiogram reveals a 50 -70% stenosis, the
                       patient will be randomized and entered into the trial as the angiogram can
                       on occasion underestimate the stenosis.

                         -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a documented
                            negative pregnancy test during the index hospitalization.

                         -  The subject must sign a written informed consent, prior to the
                            procedure, using a form that is approved by the local Institutional
                            Review Board or Medical Ethics Committee.

                         -  If a patient's creatinine is 3.5 or greater, their nephrologist must
                            clear them to participate in the trial.

                  Exclusion Criteria:

          -  To participate in this study, the subject may NOT HAVE any of the following at
             enrollment to the study:

               -  The subject has had an intracranial hemorrhage, hemorrhagic stroke, or any stroke
                  with mass effect demonstrated on CT scan or MRI within 30 days of the index
                  procedure.

               -  The subject has a persisting ischemic stroke (defined as either a score &gt; 15 on
                  the NIH stroke scale, a Rankin score &gt; 3 or a Barthel score &lt; 60 measured within
                  one week prior to study entry).

               -  The subject has an intracranial mass lesion (i.e., abscess, tumor, or other
                  infection).

               -  The subject has known allergies to heparin, to both ticlopidine and clopidogrel
                  or to metals used in stents.

               -  There is any visual angiographic evidence of intraluminal thrombus thought to
                  increase the risk of plaque fragmentation and distal embolization.

               -  The subject has peripheral vascular, supra-aortic or internal carotid artery
                  tortuosity precluding use of catheter-based techniques required for successful
                  results.

               -  The subject, if female, has a positive pregnancy test.

               -  The subject has an arterio-venous malformation in the territory of the target
                  carotid artery.

               -  Subjects with highly calcified lesions resistant to predilation by PTA

               -  The subject has unstable angina (defined as Class IV or at rest), evolving MI or
                  recent MI (within 14 days).

               -  The subject has any condition that precludes adequate local hemostasis.

               -  Patients who are not candidates for MRI scanning (pacemaker, etc).
