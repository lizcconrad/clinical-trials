  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pregnenolone is a &quot;neurosteroid&quot; and possesses intrinsic behavioral and brain effects in
      animals, affecting the GABA(A) and other receptors. Pregnenolone is serves as the precursor
      for dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfate ester (DHEAS). There is evidence of
      efficacy of DHEA augmentation in schizophrenia, we therefore sought to examine the efficacy
      of augmentation of antipsychotic treatment of schizophrenia patients with pregnenolone. It is
      hypothesized that the combined effect of antipsychotic agents and pregnenolone would be
      beneficial in the treatment of negative,depressive, and cognitive symptoms.

      Either pregnenolone (30 mg/d or 200 mg/d), DHEA (400 mg/d)or placebo will be added to regular
      treatment for 8 weeks. Subjects will be assessed at baseline and after 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks of
      treatment. An extensive battery of research instruments will be used for assessment of the
      following domains of interest: psychopathology, insight, side effects, and cognitive
      functions. Plasma pregnenolone, DHEA(S), cortisol and other relevant steroids will be assayed
      at baseline, 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks of treatment. Efficacy and safety of augmentation of
      antipsychotic treatment with pregnenolone will be analyzed.
