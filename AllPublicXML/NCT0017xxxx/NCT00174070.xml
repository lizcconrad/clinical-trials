  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute respiratory failure (ARF) remains a common reason for admission to the intensive care
      unit (ICU). ARF to be present in 32% of patients on ICU admission, with a further 24% of
      patients developing ARF during the ICU stay. A total of 56% of all ICU admissions for a
      length of &gt;48 h had ARF at some point during their stay. The incidence of ARF was from 88.6
      to 137.1 hospitalizations per 100,000 residents. The incidence of ARF was found to increase
      nearly exponentially with each decade until age 85 years. However, there is still paucity
      data about etiology and outcomes of acute respiratory failure happened in community.

      Mortality of ARF in critically ill patients is between 40% and 65%. Independent hazards for
      ARF mortality include older age, severe chronic co-morbidities (HIV, active malignancy,
      cirrhosis), certain precipitating events (trauma, drug overdose, bone marrow transplant), and
      multiple organ system failure (MOSF) [7-9]. Mortality has also been associated with acute
      lung injury or bilateral infiltrates on chest radiograph, and with an elevated acute
      physiology score.

      ARF patients form a large percentage of all ICU admissions and many factors might influence
      the final outcomes. With the high incidence of ARF in ICU, any improvement in the outcome of
      such population is likely to have marked effect on intensive care resource allocation. We
      wish this study may provide some valuable information about acute respiratory failure in
      community and improve the outcome of these patients.

      Acute respiratory failure (ARF) remains a common reason for admission to the intensive care
      unit (ICU). ARF to be present in 32% of patients on ICU admission, with a further 24% of
      patients developing ARF during the ICU stay [1]. A total of 56% of all ICU admissions for a

      88.6 to 137.1 hospitalizations per 100,000 residents [2, 3]. The incidence of ARF was found

      paucity data about etiology and outcomes of acute respiratory failure happened in community.

      Mortality of ARF in critically ill patients is between 40% and 65% [2, 4-6]. Independent
      hazards for ARF mortality include older age, severe chronic co-morbidities (HIV, active
      malignancy, cirrhosis), certain precipitating events (trauma, drug overdose, bone marrow
      transplant), and multiple organ system failure (MOSF) [7-9]. Mortality has also been
      associated with acute lung injury or bilateral infiltrates on chest radiograph [6], and with
      an elevated acute physiology score [9-10].

      ARF patients form a large percentage of all ICU admissions and many factors might influence
      the final outcomes. With the high incidence of ARF in ICU, any improvement in the outcome of
      such population is likely to have marked effect on intensive care resource allocation. We
