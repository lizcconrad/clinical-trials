  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious disease. It is caused by a
      novel SARS-associated coronavirus. According to the epidemiological data, it is highly
      infectious by intimate contact, respiratory secretion, or direct contact with infectious body
      fluid. By June 1, 2003, Center for Disease Control Taiwan, R.O.C reported 677 probable SARS
      cases. Among them, 93.2% (631/677) were more than 20 years old. Only 6.8% (46/677) were under
      20 years old. Usually the major hosts of respiratory viruses are children, but evidence up to
      now shows that SARS is mainly a disease of adults. The data of clinical presentation and
      epidemiological prevalence in teenage group and children are lacking. Therefore, this project
      is aimed at the children and teenager among 1 month to eighteen years old. Seroepidemiology
      of SARS-CoV infection in children would be investigated. Patients who admitted to pediatric
      wards or visited ER and received blood sampling due to the need of clinical
      diagnosis/management would be enrolled. After the necessary laboratory examinations were
      done, the remaining serum would be collected and tested for anti-SARS-CoV IgG by ELISA.
