      The purpose of this study is to optimize the management of patients treated for invasive
      fungal infections by establishing a real-time, continuous clinical data base that will
      capture and monitor trends in the epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment and outcomes of invasive
      fungal infections; reflect routine clinical management of patients with invasive fungal
      infections in order to evaluate treatment and provide a rationale for future treatment
      paradigms; and allow physicians to assess adherence to institutional clinical practice
      guidelines, validate current standardized definitions for patients with invasive fungal
      infections and promote change where appropriate.
