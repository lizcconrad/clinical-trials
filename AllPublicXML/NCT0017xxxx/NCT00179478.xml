  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study is a continuation of the 5 year extension study of the phase III CHAMPS
      study (see reference). This study was designed to determine if immediate initiation of
      therapy with Interferon Beta-1a (AVONEX) after a first attack of multiple sclerosis (MS)
      continues to delay the development of further attacks (CDMS) and the development of
      neurological disability over a 10 year period of observation. The initial 5 year extension
      study, called CHAMPIONS5, reported that immediate initiation of interferon Beta-1a (AVONEX)
      after a first attack of MS continued to delay the development of CDMS and lowered relapse
      rates compared to delayed initiation of disease modifying treatment (usually with AVONEX)
      either at the time of a second attack or at the end of the phase III study (24 months). The
      study was extended to 10 years to determine if these effects are sustained and result in less
      long term permanent disability.

      The CHAMPS study determined that immediate initiation of interferon beta 1a therapy (AVONEX)
      immediately following a first clinical demyelinating event in high risk patients (i.e. those
      with at least 2 asymptomatic white matter lesions on cranial MR imaging &gt; 3 mm in diameter or
      ovoid) delayed the development of clinical definite Multiple Sclerosis (CDMS)(as defined by a
      second, clinically verifiable attack involving another part of the central nervous system)
      over 2 years of observation and significantly decreased the development of new or enlarging
      white matter lesions on MRI over 18 months (see reference). The current study is a long term
      extension of a cohort of CHAMPS study site and participants. The three main aims of the study
      are as follows:

        1. To determine the long term neurological outcome in patients treated with interferon beta
           1a (AVONEX) from onset of a first clinical demyelinating event

        2. To determine if immediate initiation of AVONEX therapy (the CHAMPS Avonex treatment
           group) confers long term benefits compared to delayed initiation of therapy (the CHAMPS
           placebo group) on the rate of development of CDMS, annualized relapse rates, the
           development of permanent disability and MR measures of disease activity and progression.

        3. To determine predictors of long term disease activity and disability in patients
           following a first clinical demyelinating event

          <description>All patients in the study were receiving the same FDA approved treatment, interferon beta 1a IM once weekly (AVONEX), which they received commercially through their insurance coverage. No AEs were collected and any serious AEs that occurred, would have been reported to the manufacturer (Biogen). We collected information on all cause mortality on the cohort of 155 patients who continued in the 10 year extension study. This was done as an additional outcome measure since we anticipated that there may be deaths due to the primary disease (MS) over a period of observation as long as 10 years.</description>
