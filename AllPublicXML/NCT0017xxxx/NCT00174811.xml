          -  Subjects ≥6 months and &lt;59 months of age with AOM;

          -  Recent (within the last 72 hours) and rapid onset of AOM signs and symptoms;

          -  The presence of MEF on otoscopy indicated by a bulging tympanic membrane;

          -  Otalgia or ear tugging or touching within the last 24 hours that interferes with or
             precludes normal activity or sleep;

          -  At least 1 of the following clinical findings not specific to AOM: fever, vomiting,
             diarrhea, anorexia, sleep disturbance, or irritability;

          -  Tympanocentesis performed per protocol with MEF sample collected;

          -  Informed consent must be obtained in writing at enrollment into the study, from the
             child's parent/legally authorized representative. The parent/legally authorized
             representative has agreed to provide follow-up information and arrange for all
             scheduled visits, even in the event that study medication is discontinued.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Uncertain diagnosis of AOM or signs and symptoms of AOM that would make the subject a
             candidate for observation and analgesic therapy with observation for 2-3 days;

          -  Otorrhea or tympanostomy tube present in either ear at study entry;

          -  Otitis externa;

          -  Down syndrome, cleft palate, craniofacial disorders, cystic fibrosis/mucoviscidosis,
             immotile cilia syndrome, congenital immunodeficiency or acquired immunodeficiency
             syndrome with &lt;25% CD4 count or requiring prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jiroveci
             (carinii) or requiring treatment for an opportunistic infection;

          -  Known congenital prolonged QT syndrome;

          -  Uncorrected hypokalemia (≤3 mmol/L [mEq/L]), hypomagnesemia (based on laboratory
             assessment), bradycardia (&lt;50 bpm);

          -  Myasthenia gravis;

          -  Known impaired renal function, as shown by the creatinine clearance ≤25 mL/min;

          -  Any medical condition (including developmental disorders, visual disorders, or ocular
             abnormalities) that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with
             implementation of the protocol or interpretation of the study results;

          -  The subject:

          -  Is being treated with drugs not permitted by the study protocol ie, cisapride,
             pimozide, astemizole, terfenadine, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, class IA (eg,
             quinidine and procainamide) or Class III (eg, dofetilide) antiarrhythmic agents,
             simvastatin, lovastatin and atorvastatin;

          -  Is currently being treated with systemic antibacterials or has been treated with
             systemic antibacterials within 5 days prior to enrollment;

          -  Has been treated with any investigational medication within the last 30 days; or

          -  Has been treated with rifampicin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, or St. John's wort within
             the last 2 weeks.

          -  History of hypersensitivity or intolerance to macrolides, penicillins, or
             cephalosporins;

          -  Previous enrollment in this study or previous treatment with telithromycin;

          -  Children of the investigator or subinvestigator, research assistant, pharmacist, study
             coordinator, other staff, or relative thereof directly involved in the conduct of the
