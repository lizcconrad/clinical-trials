      RATIONALE: When irradiated donor lymphocytes are infused into the patient they may help the
      patient's immune system kill tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well giving irradiated
      donor lymphocytes works in treating patients with metastatic kidney cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the response rate in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma treated
           with HLA-partially matched related donor lymphocytes.

        -  Determine the rate and kinetics of clinical/radiological response in patients treated
           with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the rates of graft-vs-host disease in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive irradiated donor lymphocytes IV over 1 hour on day 0. Treatment
      repeats every 8-16 weeks for up to 6 donor lymphocyte infusions in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood is collected periodically for research studies, including immunophenotypic analysis of
      cells and assay for cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and natural killer-cell activity against target
      cells.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 60 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study.

    <description>With regard to responses, this trial will use a two-stage Simon's design optimized to minimize the expected number of patients accrued into the study. The maximum sample size will be 35 subjects. 18 subjects will be accrued during stage 1. If there are 2 or fewer responses during this stage, the trial will be stopped early. If there are 3 or more responses during this stage, an additional 19 patients will be accrued for stage 2. If 6 or fewer responses (out of 35) are observed by the end of the trial, then no further investigation of this therapy is warranted.</description>
