  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new emerging infectious disease. Its pathogen
      is a newly discovered coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The clinical course can be classified to 3
      stages: viral replication phase, hyperimmune reactive phase, and pulmonary destruction phase.
      Human monocyte plays a critical role in the initiation of immune response in defending the
      intracellular pathogens (eg viruses). Monocytes can engulf viruses and present the viral
      antigens in the major histocompatibility (MHC) molecule to the cell surface to initiate T
      lymphocyte response. Monocytes also secrete various cytokines to modulate immune response.
      SARS-CoV is a mutant of animal virus to cause human disease and is able to cause unusual
      severe respiratory illness. It is suggested the unusual severe disease is due to the intense
      immune reaction.

      The investigators will harvest human monocytes from healthy adult and children blood donors.
      Monocytes would be cultured and infected by SARS-CoV. The change of viral load is monitored
      after infection. Cytokines secreted by monocytes after infection are also measured. The
      difference of monocyte cytokine secretion is compared between adults and children. The study
      is to verify the SARS-CoV infectivity of human monocytes and prove the unusual severity
      caused by SARS-CoV is related to viral-induced dysregulation of cytokine responses. The
      results may also clarify why adults tend to have a more severe illness compared with
      children.
