  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vascular access is considered the Achilles heel of the dialysis patient. It constitutes the
      largest single cause of morbidity in the chronic hemodialysis population, accounting for over
      25% of hospitalizations at an estimated cost in the US of at least one billion dollars
      annually. Currently, complication free survival of vascular access ranges between 30-50% a
      year and multiple investigative efforts in this area have been initiated and are directed at
      prolonging the functional life of vascular accesses.

      It is not well established whether intervention prior to overt malfunction or thrombosis of
      the vascular access could reduce these complications and thereby improve the functional
      longevity of the access. Moreover, once accesses at potential risk are identified, it is not
      well established which method of intervention, Surgery vs. Angioplasty vs. Expectant
      Management, is superior in terms of clinical and financial outcome. The proposed study aims
      to determine whether early intervention of a vascular access determined to be at risk of
      malfunction and thrombosis improves the long term outcome and, specifically, which means of
      intervention is preferred.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with End Stage Renal Disease on chronic maintenance hemodialysis 3 times per
             week

          2. Have an arteriovenous (polytetrafluoroethylene) graft as vascular access

          3. Have a venous stenosis between 30% and 70% as determined by angiogram

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Native arteriovenous fistula

          2. Known previous vascular accesses complications, such as central vein stenosis, and
             multiple access surgeries &gt;4

          3. Unwilling to participate

          4. Allergy to iodine

          5. Absolute contraindication for surgery (e.g. medical condition precludes anesthesia and
             surgery)

          6. Known arterial limb stenosis or long vessel length venous stenosis which are
             unamenable to surgical or angioplasty techniques, respectively, and therefore prohibit
             randomization

          7. Known hypercoagulable state
