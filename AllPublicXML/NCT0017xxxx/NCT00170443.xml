    <textblock>
      This study will compare the safety and immunogenicity of three different dose levels of an
      experimental recombinant influenza HA protein vaccine to a standard inactivated influenza
      vaccine in heallthy elderly subjects ages 65-80. Blood and nasal secretions for assessment of
      antibody responses will be obtained from all subjects prior to and one month after
      vaccination.

      Approximately 400 healthy, ambulatory adults ages 65-80 will be randomized into one of four
      study groups to receive a single immunization of a licensed trivalent inactivated influenza
      vaccine or one of three dose levels of an investigatioanl trivalent recombinant influenza HA
      protein vaccine. The study will be conducted in 2 stages. In the first stage, 80 subjects
      will be randomized (20 per group) and receive one vaccination on Day 0. Safety will be
      evaluated after Stage 1 subjects have completed a 7 day follow-up. Enrollment of Stage 2
      subjects will begin after the safety data for Stage 1 has been reviewed. In Stage 2, 320
      subjects will be randomized (80 per group) and receive one vaccination on Day 0. Blood and
      nasal secretions will be collected prior to an approximately one month after vaccination to
      assess antibody responses.
