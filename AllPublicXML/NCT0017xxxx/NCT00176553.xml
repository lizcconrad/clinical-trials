  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are to find out whether dextromethorphan can prevent the short or
      long-term neurologic side effects of methotrexate, and whether dextromethorphan can improve
      symptoms of short-term neurologic side effects if they do occur.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We believe that we are beginning to understand the biological cause of the neurotoxicity that
      happens after treatment with methotrexate. Dextromethorphan, an ingredient in common cough
      medicines, may be able to prevent and/or treat this neurotoxicity. We have given
      dextromethorphan to a small group of patients who developed severe neurologic side effects
      after methotrexate. All had a complete recovery within one day.

    <description>Patients will receive an inert carrier with or without dextromethorphan. The study drug will be administered at 1.5 mg/kg/dose on a BID schedule. The first dose to be given prior to each scheduled intravenous and/or intrathecal administration of methotrexate and continued for a total of seven days.</description>
