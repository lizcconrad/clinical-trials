  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oro-pharyngeal cancers can develop from squamous dysplastic precursor lesions, which occur in
      a subset of common white (leukoplakia), red (erythroplasia), or mixed oro-pharyngeal plaques.
      Known risk factors for oro-pharyngeal cancer include tobacco smoke, alcohol consumption, diet
      and, in a subset of tumors, human papillomavirus (HPV). Along the oro-pharyngeal disease
      continuum, there may be variations in gene expression precursor lesions as a result of
      exposure to smoking, alcohol and HPV. However, the components of gene expression that are
      most likely associated with tumorigenesis in these tissues are poorly understood. This study
      will focus upon early gene expression profiles in the oral cavity and oropharynx in subjects
      who have precursor lesions and have been exposed to the common risk factors for carcinoma
      development including smoking and HPV infection. This application is to conduct pilot testing
      and establish appropriate procedures for an international prospective cohort study of the
      natural history of oro-pharyngeal cancer precursors among men and women at high risk of
      oro-pharyngeal cancer at Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx-NY. Brush biopsy specimens will be
      used to collect a transepithelial sample of cells from oro-pharyngeal plaques, as well as
      normal tissue from defined regions of the oral and pharyngeal mucosa. Measurement of gene
      expression will employ novel high-throughput cDNA microarray analysis and PCR-based HPV DNA
      testing. Oro-pharyngeal dysplasia will be diagnosed using cytopathology. Under this
      application, we will assess our planned instruments and procedures on an initial sample of 40
      subjects. This planning period will allow for precise identification of methodologies,
      standardization of instruments and assays to be utilized by additional participating centers
      in a subsequent application.
