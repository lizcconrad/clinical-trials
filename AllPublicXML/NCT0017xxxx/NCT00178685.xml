      These two studies will examine the role of autonomous motivation in maintained adherence. The
      first study will determine whether smokers are still abstinent from tobacco 32 months after
      starting in a previous project (Smoker's Health Study). The purpose of the second study is to
      determine which of three treatments for tobacco dependence provides the greatest amount of
      protection from relapsing to smoking after quitting. Specifically, the investigators will
      determine if extending the length of treatment time focusing on relapse prevention and
      arranging for support from important others prevents relapse compared to community care.
      Also, the investigators will determine if providing extended treatment time and support from
      important others plus providing medications to those that don't want to quit prevents long
      term relapse compared to just extending the length of treatment time and support from others.
      Additionally, a sub set of the population will be randomized to using hand held palm devices
      to recover real-time data assessment during the last 10 months of the project.

    <textblock>
      These two studies will extend our examination of self-determination theory (SDT) based
      counseling interventions to the issue of maintained abstinence from tobacco use. Two projects
      are proposed, both of which build on the results of our current trial. The first is a
      32-month follow-up of the smoking status of patients in the preceding trial called the
      Smoker's Health Study (self-determination, smoking, diet, and health). That SDT intervention
      (4 counselor visits over 6 months) increased cessation at 6 months relative to community
      care, and was also effective in increasing 12 month prolonged abstinence, and the results
      have been reported in two manuscripts (Williams, McGregor, Sharp, Levesque, Kouides, Ryan,
      and Deci, In press; Williams, McGregor, Sharp, Levesque, Kouides, Ryan, and Deci, 2005). The
      part of this first project that will be conducted as part of this grant will be to complete
      32 month follow-up of smokers in the Smoker's Health Study. The second project is a 3-cell
      clinical trial called the Smoker's Health Project that will examine two extensions of the
      current intervention, both of which place greater emphasis on use of, and adherence to,
      cessation medications. The two arms will be compared to community care. Both arms involve two
      visits with a physician to discuss medications and side effects. In both interventions,
      counselors will address medication adherence. The two arms differ in that patients not ready
      to quit in one arm will receive a smoking reduction approach (with medications) in which they
      first try to reduce their smoking to half and then attempt cessation. In addition, to place
      greater emphasis on medications and to examine medication adherence as a mediator of
      maintained cessation.

      There will be two major changes in the intervention intended to facilitate long-term
      maintenance. First, the intervention will extend over 12 months (whereas the current one
      lasts only 6 months) with meetings during the additional 6 months focusing on maintenance and
      relapse prevention. Second, at least one family member or best friend of each patient will be
      encouraged to meet with a counselor to learn how to be more autonomy supportive with the
      patient around issues related to tobacco. Cessation and maintained abstinence will be
      examined with logistic regression. The SDT process model of maintained cessation will be
      tested using structural equation modeling, and cost-effectiveness analyses will be done for
      the interventions.

    <measure>12 Month Prolonged Abstinence From Tobacco Measured at 12 Months From Completion of Intervention.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months after subject completes intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure was 12-month prolonged abstinence (12M-PA) assessed by patient self-report 12-months after the intervention ended. If participant responded that they had not smoked a cigarette, even a puff, in the last 7 days at 12 months post-intervention, and reported date of last cigarette was 365 days or more prior to assessment date, then they were considered to have 12 month prolonged abstinence. A baseline-observation-carried-forward (BOCF)strategy was used for missing data such that those not reporting smoking status 12 months post-intervention were considered smoking.</description>

    <measure>7 Day Point Prevelence (7DPP)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Seven-day point prevalence abstinence (7DPP) was assessed by asking: &quot;Have you smoked a cigarette, even a puff, in the last 7 days?&quot;16 Participants were also asked if they had smoked cigars or pipe, chewed tobacco, or used snuff in the past 7 days, and if they responded yes they were considered tobacco users.</description>

          <title>Community Care</title>
          <description>The CC condition was similar to the translated 6-month SDT and PHS Guideline-based intensive intervention validated in the previous trial and provided for the CC subjects who wanted to make a quit attempt. The clinical endpoint was to guide the subjects to be fully autonomous about stopping smoking, including not stopping if not willing to stop smoking. Once willing to stop, the Tobacco Dependence Counselor (TDC, 4 contacts) worked to provide problem solving and skills training as recommended in the PHS Guideline (Chapter 4) and the prescriber (2 visits) guided the subjects to be fully autonomous about use of effective medications. Those not wanting to stop within 30 days of the first appointment were asked to call back when ready.</description>

          <description>The EAS condition provided the same content as CC, but the intervention was extended: (1) from 6 to12 months; (2) to include 8 contacts (six in first 6 months and two in second 6-months); (3) by encouraging smokers to attend treatment, even if not ready to stop; and (4) by asking the smoker to bring an important other (non-health-care professional) to one 50-minute instructional session about how to support the smoker’s autonomy.</description>

          <description>The HR condition had the same features as EAS, but offered initiation of a first-line smoking cessation medication if unwilling to stop, but willing to reduce their cigarettes by half. Subjects were informed that there is no evidence to suggest that reducing cigarette use improves health, but that doing so might increase their confidence in stopping.</description>

        <title>12 Month Prolonged Abstinence From Tobacco Measured at 12 Months From Completion of Intervention.</title>
        <description>The primary outcome measure was 12-month prolonged abstinence (12M-PA) assessed by patient self-report 12-months after the intervention ended. If participant responded that they had not smoked a cigarette, even a puff, in the last 7 days at 12 months post-intervention, and reported date of last cigarette was 365 days or more prior to assessment date, then they were considered to have 12 month prolonged abstinence. A baseline-observation-carried-forward (BOCF)strategy was used for missing data such that those not reporting smoking status 12 months post-intervention were considered smoking.</description>

            <description>The CC condition was similar to the translated 6-month SDT and PHS Guideline-based intensive intervention validated in the previous trial and provided for the CC subjects who wanted to make a quit attempt. The clinical endpoint was to guide the subjects to be fully autonomous about stopping smoking, including not stopping if not willing to stop smoking. Once willing to stop, the Tobacco Dependence Counselor (TDC, 4 contacts) worked to provide problem solving and skills training as recommended in the PHS Guideline (Chapter 4) and the prescriber (2 visits) guided the subjects to be fully autonomous about use of effective medications. Those not wanting to stop within 30 days of the first appointment were asked to call back when ready.</description>
