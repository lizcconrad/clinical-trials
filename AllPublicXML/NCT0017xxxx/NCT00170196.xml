      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of addition of corticosteroid therapy
      to antibiotics in patient admitted with Community-acquired pneumonia.

      The hypothesis is: Prednisolone in combination with antibiotic treatments is effective in
      improving clinical outcome in patients hospitalized with CAP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a acute illness with a considerable morbidity and
      mortality, especially patients with severe CAP. In the past decennia, in spite of many
      investigations, little reduction is seen in morbidity an mortality. Corticosteroids have a
      immune-modulation effect, which is not completely elucidated. Most likely the immune
      modulation effect is due to down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The use of
      corticosteroids next to antibiotics in CAP could lead to shorter time to clinical stability,
      length of stay and costs.

      Comparison: Hospitalized patients with CAP treated with antibiotics and prednisolone versus
      hospitalized patients with cap treated with antibiotics and placebo
