  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brain damage as a result of decreased oxygen to the brain is found in 80% of patients that
      die with severe head injuries. Laboratory studies in animals and clinical trials have shown
      that increasing oxygen in the brain results in better brain oxygen consumption, less cell
      death, and better functional outcome. This study will test the hypothesis that Oxycyte is an
      effective way to increase brain oxygen levels in severe head injury.

      Decreased brain oxygen in severe brain injuries appears to be implicated in poor functional
      outcome and death. Animal and clinical studies have shown that increasing brain oxygen in
      such patients improves functional outcome, and Oxycyte has been shown to be an effective
      means of delivering oxygen to tissues, including the brain. This study is an eight patient
      proof of concept study to test the effects of oxygen delivery with Oxycyte in patients with a
      severe traumatic head injury with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 3 to 9.

      Subjects diagnosed with a severe head injury (GCS 3-9) who receive a brain oxygen monitor and
      microdialysis catheter, will undergo baseline monitoring for 4 hours. In the first 4 subjects
      the Fi02 on the ventilator will be increased to 50% for a 4 hour stabilization period and
      this will be followed by a single intravenous infusion of 3ml/kg of Oxycyte. The Fi02 will
      remain at 50% for 24 hours.

      In the second 4 subjects the Fi02 on the ventilator will be increased to 100% for a 4 hour
      stabilization period and this will be followed by a single intravenous infusion of 3ml/kg of
      Oxycyte. The Fi02 will remain at 100% for 24 hours.

      Subjects will be enrolled, treated, and then monitored by LICOX 02 monitor before and after
      infusion of PFC, and then for at least 48 hours following the discontinuation of Oxycyte.
