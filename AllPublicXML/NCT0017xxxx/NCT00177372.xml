    <textblock>
      This is a pilot clinical trial to evaluate whether the medical management of early pregnancy
      failure with mifepristone and misoprostol is an effective and acceptable treatment. Subjects
      with early pregnancy failure receive mifepristone followed 24 hours later by vaginal
      misoprostol for medical management. Subjects then return on study day 3 for a repeat
      ultrasound to assess passage of pregnancy tissue. subjects who still have a gestational sac
      present at Day 3 receive a second dose of vaginal misoprostol. All subjects have a follow-up
      at Day 15, by phone for those who passed the pregnancy with the first dose of misoprostol,
      and in person for those who received a second dose. Questionnaires are administered at the
      beginning and end of the study to determine acceptability.
