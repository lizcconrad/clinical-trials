      Primary Objective: To study if lycopene can improve the biomarker status of urothelial cells
      in patients with uremia-associated urothelial carcinoma.

      Secondary Objective: To evaluate the general safety and tolerability of oral lycopene 30 mg
      per day for 12 weeks in uremic patients.

      This is a renal function-stratified phase II chemoprevention trial. After 8 weeks of a run-in
      and washout period, participants will take lycopene, 30 mg per day for 12 weeks. The
      expression of intermediate biomarkers will be determined upon study entry after 8 weeks of
      run-in/washout, and after 6 and 12 weeks of lycopene supplementation. It takes at least 20
      weeks to complete the course.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients have pathologically-proven urothelial carcinoma (UC) with a clinical stage &lt;=
             T3N0M0

          -  Patients have no visible or identifiable residual UC after treatment with a life
             expectancy of &gt; 6 months

          -  Patients have remaining urothelium at risk of recurrence (transplanted renal unit
             excluded)

          -  No other active malignancy. Patients who have other primary malignancies should be
             treated successfully prior to the study entry and should be in a cure or remission
             state for at least one year.

          -  Patients are able to take lycopene capsules orally.

          -  Patients who sign and give informed consents and are willing to conform to the
             scheduled sampling of the blood, urine and/or tissue

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have clinical stage &gt; T3N0M0 or metastatic disease

          -  Positive urine cytology. Patients who have positive cytology should be subjected to a
             serial diagnostic workup which may include renal echo, cystoscopy and
             ureterorenoscopy, and image studies (intravenous urography, computed tomography,
             magnetic resonance urography, retrograde or antegrade pyelography). If no recurrent or
             residual tumors are found, patients are still eligible for the study.

          -  Patients who have ever received systemic chemotherapy within 12 months

          -  Patients who have gastrointestinal malabsorption regardless of the etiology

          -  Have known allergic reaction to tomato or lycopene

          -  Patients who are participating or will participate in other clinical trials

          -  Patients who have active urinary tract infection can not be accrued until infection is
             effectively controlled

          -  Patient's age is less than 18 years
