    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to determine if a stem cell transplant in patients with
      newly diagnosed high risk CNS tumors (glioblastoma multiforme [GBM], high grade astrocytoma,
      pineoblastoma, rhabdoid tumor, supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumor [PNET])
      increases overall survival.

    <description>Group A: recurrent medulloblastoma, recurrent germ cell tumor
Cytoxan treatment
Stem cell autologous harvest
Group B: GBM, high grade astrocytoma, rhabdoid tumors, pineoblastoma, or supratentorial PNET
Carboplatin and Etoposide treatment
Autologous stem cell harvest
The preparatory regimen used for Stem Cell Rescue #1 will be Carboplatinum, VP-16 and Thiotepa. If the patient has recuperated his ANC to &gt;1,000 within 50 days after Stem Cell Rescue #1, (sustained without G-CSF support) a neuroradiographic evaluation will be performed. If there is lack of progression, the patient will then proceed to Stem Cell Rescue # 2 with Cyclophosphamide and Melphalan, followed by stem cell rescue.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient's age must be greater than (&gt;) 18 months and less than or equal to (â‰¤) 25
             years at the time of diagnosis or recurrence.

          -  Neuroradiographic evidence of a recurrent posterior fossa medulloblastoma or recurrent
             CNS germ cell tumor.

          -  The presence of a histologically confirmed high grade astrocytoma, GBM, rhabdoid
             tumor, supratentorial PNET, or pineoblastoma either at the time of diagnosis or
             recurrence.

          -  Patients must be brought to state of minimum residual disease by surgical reduction
             and/or chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy or a combination of above prior to
             myeloablative chemotherapy and tandem stem cell rescue.

          -  Documentation of chemotherapy sensitivity is required for enrollment.
             Chemotherapy-sensitive tumors are defined as those tumors which have had a reduction
             of 50% after 2-4 cycles of chemotherapy (CTX or platinum). For patients with no
             evidence of disease post resection, continued complete remission after 2-4 cycles of
             chemotherapy defines chemosensitivity.

          -  Adequate physiologic function, defined as follows:

               -  creatinine clearance &gt; 70 ml/minutes/1.73 m2.

               -  SGPT &lt; 10 x normal and bilirubin &lt; 10 mg/dl.

          -  Adequate complete blood count (CBC): hemoglobin &gt; 10 gm/dl, absolute neutrophil count
             (ANC) &gt; 1500/ul, and platelets &gt; 100,000/ul.

          -  Informed consent. The patient and/or the patient's legally authorized guardian must
             acknowledge in writing that consent to become a study subject has been obtained, in
             accordance with institutional policies provided by the United States (U.S.) Department
             of Health and Human Services.

          -  Protocol approval. Approval for the use of this institution's Human Rights Committee
             must be obtained in accordance with the institutional assurance policies of the U. S.
             Department of Health and Human Services.

          -  Patients with high-risk medulloblastoma after initial surgery.

          -  To allow non-English speaking patients to participate in this study, bilingual health
             care services will be provided in the appropriate language.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with brain stem glioma are ineligible.
