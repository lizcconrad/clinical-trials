  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this series of study has a many-fold intention depicted as follows: to
      describe and characterize schizophrenic patients' aggressive acts in hospital and community,
      to identify and specify heterogeneity in their structure, and to look for and set up risk
      factors for prevention. This study investigates four major issues: (1) Establishing an
      objective behavior rating scale for measuring aggressive acts; (2) Understanding the
      characteristics and incidence of aggressive acts by patients with schizophrenia; (3)
      Exploration of the heterogeneous structure of aggressive acts by patients with schizophrenia;
      and (4) Identifying the risk factors of aggressive acts of patients with schizophrenia.

      Psychiatric patientsâ€™ aggressive acts can occur frequently and are recognized as a
      significant problem in psychiatric services. Understanding of aggressive acts in clinical
      settings and community is still incomplete and the clinical care of aggressive acts remains
      unsatisfactory. This study investigates four major issues: (1) Establishing an objective
      behavior rating scale for measuring aggressive acts; (2) Understanding the characteristics
      and incidence of aggressive acts by patients with schizophrenia; (3) Exploration of the
      heterogeneous structure of aggressive acts by patients with schizophrenia; and (4)
      Identifying the risk factors of aggressive acts of patients with schizophrenia. At first, the
      content validity, construct validity, and internal consistency of the Chinese version of
      Violence Scale were examined. Both of retrospective survey and prospective panel design were
      used for data collection. Patients fulfilling the DSM-IV criteria of schizophrenia in
      hospital and community, and their siblings and family caregivers, were recruited as different
      phases of study subjects, after signing informed consent for understanding their past
      history, prospective occurrence of aggressive acts, and the related risk factors. It is
      therefore to establish objective measures and to develop insights into the heterogeneity and
      related risk factors of aggressive acts, for improvement in the management and prevention of
      aggressive acts.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients with clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum, fulfilling the diagnostic
        criteria of the 4th version of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV)(APA, 1994)were
        recruited as study subjects, after signing informed consent. Their families, including
        their siblings and family caregivers, were also recruited in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Exclusion criteria of the patient samples include co-mobility with mental retardation,
