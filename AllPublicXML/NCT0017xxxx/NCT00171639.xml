      This study is being conducted to evaluate the effect of an investigational drug on bone loss
      in men with prostate cancer who are receiving Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT).

      In order to participate, male patients 18 years and older must be veterans from participating
      Veterans Administration Medical Centers that are receiving ADT for prostate cancer and have
      established osteoporosis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed informed consent

          -  Age &gt; 18 years

          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of carcinoma of the prostate

          -  Stage M0: Patients just starting ADT must be stage M0 [PSA &lt;10 (then bone scan not
             needed) or negative bone scan (regardless of PSA)]. Patients already on ADT must have
             been M0 at the initiation of ADT and have maintained a stable, low PSA (&lt; 2.0) on
             continuous ADT since that time.

          -  Patients initiating or receiving ADT with a LHRH agonist (with or without an
             antiandrogen) and with the intended duration of ADT of at least 12 months from the
             time of randomization. Patients undergoing bilateral orchiectomy or with history of
             this procedure are also eligible. For patients already on ADT, the therapy must be
             continuous, and if there is more than one missed or delayed dose (&gt; 1 mo delay) in any
             one year period, the patient is not eligible.

          -  Patient with a baseline BMD T-score &lt;-2.0 in the lumbar spine (L2-L4) and/or the total
             hip are eligible

          -  Life expectancy of at least 12 months

          -  Zubrod performance status of 0, 1, or 2

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Patients who received any bisphosphonate therapy in the past 6 months

          -  Metabolic bone disease including Paget's disease or hyperparathyroidism or vitamin D
             deficiency. Patients with vitamin D deficiency or secondary hyperparathyroidism due to
             vitamin D deficiency may be treated and reassessed for consideration for the trial, as
             detailed in Appendix 9.

          -  Radiographic evidence of bone metastases

          -  Patients who have received treatment with systemic corticosteroids within the past 12
             months (short term corticosteroid therapy for up to one month duration, e.g. for acute
             illness like asthma exacerbation, is acceptable)

          -  Patients with prior exposure to anabolic steroids or growth hormone within the past 6
             months

          -  Current treatment with estrogen or complementary medicines known to contain estrogens

          -  Patients with previous or concomitant malignancy within the past 5 years except
             adequately treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, and colonic polyps
             with non-invasive malignancy which have been removed

          -  Patients with nonmalignant conditions which would confound the evaluation of the
             primary endpoint, impair tolerance of therapy, or prevent compliance to the protocol,
             including:

               -  uncontrolled infections

               -  uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus

               -  diseases with influence on bone metabolism, such as Paget's disease or
                  uncontrolled thyroid or parathyroid dysfunction

               -  cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, pulmonary and neurologic/psychiatric diseases
                  which would prevent prolonged follow-up

          -  Patients with clinical or radiological evidence of existing fracture in the lumbar
             spine or either hip

          -  Patients with history of lumbar spine surgery that directly involved the bone or
             resulted in implanted hardware; or rendered the lumbar spine not evaluable (Some
             patients with a history of laminectomy alone may qualify).

          -  Patients with history of unilateral fracture of hip due to trauma or unilateral hip
             surgery and the other hip and lumbar spine are not evaluable.

          -  Patients for whom the lumbar spine and at least one hip are not evaluable for any
             reason.

          -  Patients treated with systemic investigational drugs(s) and /or device(s) within the
             past 30 days

          -  Patients with any prior treatment for osteoporosis except for calcium and vitamin D

          -  Patients with abnormal renal function as evidenced by either a serum creatinine
             greater than 3 mg/dL or by a calculated creatinine clearance of 40 ml/minute or less
             (Use Cockcroft-Gault equation. See Appendix 5).

          -  Corrected (adjusted for serum albumin) serum calcium concentration &lt; 8.0 mg/dl (2.00
             mmol/L)\

        Other protocol-defined exclusion criteria may apply.
