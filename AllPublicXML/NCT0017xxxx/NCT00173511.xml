      Background:

      Upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, a common disorder encountered at emergency room, may
      cause hypotension and tachycardia that may in turn result in myocardial ischemia in patients
      with coronary artery disease (CAD). An emergent endoscopy with hemostasis is the mainstay of
      management. However, endoscopy itself may result in myocardial ischemia. Whether myocardial
      ischemia and arrhythmia occurs more frequently during emergent endoscopy in patients with CAD
      remains unknown.

      Objective:

      To determine whether the risk of myocardial ischemia and arrhythmia is increased during
      emergent endoscopy in patients with CAD.

      Method:

      Adult patients with documented CAD undergoing emergent endoscopy due to UGI bleeding are
      included. Adult patients without CAD undergoing emergent endoscopy due to UGI bleeding were
      included as the control group. The expected case numbers were 50 patients in each group.
      Patients with terminal illness, pregnancy, active lung disease requiring ventilator support
      are excluded. Before endoscopy, symptoms of myocardial ischemia, blood pressure, heart rate,
      O2 saturation, hemogram, baseline 12-lead EKG, and cardiac enzyme are obtained. All patients
      are monitored with Holter EKG since 10 minutes before endoscopy to 2 hours after the
      procedure. Blood pressure, heart rate, and O2 saturation are closely monitored during the
      procedure. Endoscopy is performed by experienced endoscopist and endoscopic hemostasis is
      done according to the types of lesions. The duration of endoscopy, types of endoscopic
      hemostasis, and blood pressure are recorded. After endoscopy, symptoms of myocardial
      ischemia, blood pressure, heart rate, O2 saturation, hemogram, baseline 12-lead EKG, and
      cardiac enzyme are checked again.

      Expected Result and Implication If myocardial ischemia is not increased in CAD patients
      undergoing emergent endoscopy, then this technique can be used safely in this group of
      patients. If myocardial ischemia occurs more frequently in CAD patients undergoing emergent
      endoscopy, we can try to analyze factors associated with increased risk, such as duration of
      endoscopy, severity of anemia, or drugs used for endoscopic hemostasis. Then we can try to
      avoid these predisposing factors and increase the safety of emergent endoscopy.
