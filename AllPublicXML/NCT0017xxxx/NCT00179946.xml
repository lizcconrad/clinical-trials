      The aim of this protocol is to clarify the role of HLA matching in unrelated umbilical cord
      blood (UCB) transplantation and to identify the level of HLA matching required assuring
      successful outcome of unrelated UCB transplantation.

      The study will answer the following questions:

        1. Is HLA matching beneficial to unrelated UCB transplantation?

        2. Which HLA loci, HLA-A, B, C, DRB1, or BQB1 is/are important to math, or alternatively to
           mismatch, to improve graft survival?

        3. Which HLA loci, HLA-A, B, C, DRB1, or BQB1 mismatches is/are &quot;permissive mismatches&quot; or
           well tolerated mismatches?

        4. What level of typing resolution (low, intermediate, or hgh) is required to perform
           patient/donor H:A matching?

      By studying the cells and blood of donors and recipients, we may learn more about improving
      the tissue matching between unrelated donors and their recipients. Also, we hope to learn if
      an additional level of matching testing improves the results of the transplant treatment.
      Increasing knowledge about tissue matching could result in the improved long-term survival of
      cord blood transplant recipients.
