  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out how effectively cervix cancer is controlled when
      radiation is combined with low-dose chemotherapy (Taxotere) . The use of low-dose Taxotere,
      once per week, with radiation is a new treatment for cervical cancer. This study will also
      see how well this treatment regimen can be tolerated.
