  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma, the airway inflammatory disorder, is an important chronic disease in children. About
      10~15% children are bothered with this. Allergens, such as house-dust mites (HDM), animal
      dander (i.e. cats and dogs), and seasonal pollens, are often implicated as causative and
      triggering factors of respiratory attacks in children with asthma. Among them, mites are the
      most common indoor allergen associated with asthma worldwide.

      It appears that SLIT is somewhat effective and safe. However, on the current evidence,
      further studies are needed to define the indications, the duration of treatment and
      therapeutic optimal dose of standardized allergen extracts in relation to efficacy and side
      effects before it is recommended for routine clinical use. The objective of the present study
      was to investigate the effects and safety of StaloralTM, the standardized extracts of D. pt.
      and D. f., in asthmatic children allergic to HDM.
