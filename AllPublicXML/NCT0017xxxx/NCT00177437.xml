  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial to determine whether a home screening test for
      chlamydia and gonorrhea will lead to increased use of screening tests and increased detection
      of sexually transmitted diseases.

      This is a phase III randomized controlled trial. We enrolled 403 young women from a variety
      of clinical settings and neighborhoods in the Pittsburgh, PA region. Women completed a
      baseline questionnaire and then were randomized to either an intervention group (receive home
      testing kit every six months) or to a control group (receive a letter suggesting a clinic
      visit for screening). Participants were followed for 2 years, and medical chart abstraction
      was done to document tests done in clinical settings. The final study end points were number
      of tests completed, number of screening tests completed, number of STDs detected, and
      incident cases of pelvic inflammatory disease.
