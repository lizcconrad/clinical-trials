  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine whether there is a correlation between the levels of
      Vitamin E in sperm and sperm DNA fragmentation.

      Previous research has shown that damage to the DNA in sperm may cause infertility or increase
      the chances of miscarriage, if the damage is extensive (eg. present in the overwhelming
      majority of sperm). Some studies suggest that DNA damage can be caused by oxidative stress.
      Antioxidants, such as Vitamin E, which are present in some foods, can prevent damage to cells
      from &quot;free radicals&quot;, which are naturally present by-products of metabolism. We ask whether
      there is a correlation between sperm DNA damage and Vitamin E

    <textblock>
      Sperm DNA damage is an emerging cause of male infertility that is likely to be more common
      among men with increased reactive oxygen species in the ejaculate. Vitamin E can protect the
      sperm membrane from oxidative damage and increased levels are associated with low levels of
      reactive oxygen species. This is a study of Vitamin E levels in the spermatozoa and sera of
      48 infertile men, and 20 fertile men as a control group, to look for correlations between
      sperm vitamin E levels and the degree of sperm DNA fragmentation. Dietary intake of
      antioxidants will also be included.
