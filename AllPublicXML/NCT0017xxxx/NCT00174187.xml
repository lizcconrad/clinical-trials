    <measure>Change From Baseline in Height Standard Deviation Score According to Chronological Age (SDS/CA) at Year 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Year 3</time_frame>
    <description>Height was measured using a wall mounted device (example, Harpenden stadiometer). Height SDS/CA was obtained by measuring the height, subtracting chronological age- and gender-appropriate mean height and dividing the result by standard deviation of that mean (as obtained from chronological age- and gender-specific population reference data). SDS indicated how many standard deviations higher (in case of positive SDS) or lower (in case of negative SDS) participant's value was relative to the mean of the reference population.</description>

        <description>Lean body mass was assessed by DEXA scan. Lean body mass SDS/CA was obtained by measuring lean body mass, subtracting the chronological age- and gender-appropriate mean lean body mass and dividing the result by standard deviation of that mean (as obtained from chronological age- and gender-specific population reference data). SDS indicated how many standard deviations higher (in case of positive SDS) or lower (in case of negative SDS) participant’s value was relative to the mean of the reference population.</description>

        <description>BMAD (LS) was assessed by DEXA scan. BMAD (LS) (SDS/Tanner Puberty Stage) was obtained by measuring BMAD (LS), subtracting Tanner puberty stage- and gender-appropriate mean BMAD (LS) and dividing the result by standard deviation of that mean (as obtained from Tanner puberty stage- and gender-specific population reference data). SDS indicated how many standard deviations higher (in case of positive SDS) or lower (in case of negative SDS) participant’s value was relative to the mean of the reference population.</description>

        <title>Bone Mineral Content Standard Deviation Score of Total Body According to Tanner Puberty Stage (BMC [TB] [SDS/Tanner Puberty Stage])</title>
        <description>BMC (TB) was measured by DEXA scan. BMC (TB) (SDS/Tanner Puberty Stage) was obtained by measuring BMC (TB), subtracting the Tanner puberty stage- and gender-appropriate mean BMC (TB) and dividing the result by standard deviation of that mean (as obtained from Tanner puberty stage- and gender-specific population reference data). SDS indicated how many standard deviations higher (in case of positive SDS) or lower (in case of negative SDS) participant’s value was relative to the mean of the reference population.</description>

        <title>Growth Velocity Standard Deviation Score According to Bone Age (GV [SDS/BA])</title>
        <description>GV measures the annual rate of increase in height. GV (SDS/BA) was obtained by measuring GV, subtracting the bone age- and gender-appropriate mean GV and dividing the result by standard deviation of that mean (as obtained from bone age- and gender-specific population reference data). SDS indicated how many standard deviations higher (in case of positive SDS) or lower (in case of negative SDS) participant’s value was relative to the mean of the reference population.</description>
