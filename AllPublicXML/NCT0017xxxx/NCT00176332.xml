  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Statin therapy has been shown to efficiently reduce mortality in patients with coronary
      artery disease and myocardial infarction, partially as a result of the lipid-lowering
      properties of statins. However, especially the pleiotropic effects of statins, e.g. their
      anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties, might be of interest in the treatment of
      patients with chronic heart failure that are limited in their exercise capacity due to
      alterations of the skeletal muscle and peripheral endothelial dysfunction.

      Aim of this trial is therefore to assess the effects of three months of rosuvastatin
      treatment on markers of inflammation and oxidative stress in the skeletal muscle and the
      blood, on postnatal vasculogenesis, and endothelial function of the radial artery in patients
      with severe chronic heart failure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 40 patients with severe chronic heart failure are prospectively randomized to
      either 3 months of rosuvastatin or placebo treatment.

      Before and after the intervention period maximal exercise capacity is measured by
      ergospirometry and endothelial function is determined by high-resolution A-mode ultrasound.
      Skeletal muscle biopsies are obtained at begin and after 3 months and are analyzed for
      inflammatory markers, measures of oxidative stress and vasculogenesis. Blood samples are
      assessed with regard to markers of inflammation and oxidative stress as well.
