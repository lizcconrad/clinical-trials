      Background: Frozen shoulder syndrome (FSS) or adhesive capsulitits, a condition of uncertain
      etiology characterized by a progressive loss of both active and passive shoulder motion, is
      one of the most common musculoskeletal disorders encountered in daily orthopaedic practice
      and remains challenging to treat. To regain the normal extensibility of shoulder capsule and
      tight muscular tissues, passive stretching of the shoulder capsule by means of mobilization
      techniques has been recommended, but limited data for supporting the use of these treatments
      are available. Due to the performance of techniques (mid-range/end-range mobilizations
      combined with or without interscalene brachial plexus block), a lack of objective and
      subjective outcome criteria, an inappropriate research design (case report and clinical trial
      without control), and utilization of other treatment modalities (home exercises and hot/cold
      packs), it is not possible to draw firm conclusions about the efficacy of mobilization in
      patients with FSS. Objective: The aim of our study is to investigate the effect of
      mobilization treatment and to determine whether a difference of treatment efficacy exists
      among three mobilization techniques (mid-range mobilization, end-range mobilization, and
      mobilization with movement) in patients with FSS. Design: We will carry out a crossover
      multiple-treatment trial on two groups. In group one, an A-B-A-C (A: mid-range mobilization,
      B: end-range mobilization, C: mobilization with movement) multiple-treatment design will be
      used. In group two, an A-C-A-B multiple-treatment design will be used. There will be three
      weeks of each phase. An independent trained outcome assessor, blinded to treatment
      allocation, will evaluate the participates at baseline and at 3-week intervals for 12 weeks.
      Outcome assessment include pain perception, disability assessment, and Shoulder complex
      kinematics and associated muscular activity. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be
      undertaken using the follow up data at 3, 6, 9 and 12 weeks for each of the outcomes, with
      adjustment for the baseline values of the outcome of interest. Independent t-Tests will be
      conducted to compare change of outcome variables between two groups (A-B in one group vs. A-C
      in the other group, A-C in one group vs. A-B in the other group).

      We will carry out a multiple-treatment trial on two groups. The multiple-treatment trial
      involves the application of two or more treatments in one single-subject [Portney and
      Watkins, 2000; Barlow and Hersen, 1984]. It is used to compare the effects of two or more
      treatments. Consenting patients will be randomized by computer generated permuted block
      randomization of 5 to receive different mobilization treatments. Allocation concealment will
      be ensured and the study biostatistician will keep the assignment scheme. In group one, an
      A-B-A-C (A: mid-range mobilization, B: end-range mobilization, C: mobilization with movement)
      multiple-treatment design will be used. In group two, an A-C-A-B multiple-treatment design
      will be used. The two groups used here are intended to counterbalance the order effects of
      treatments. There will be three weeks of each phase. The differences in outcomes across the
      four phases of the study will be examined. An independent trained outcome assessor, blinded
      to treatment allocation, will evaluate the participates at baseline and at 3-week intervals
      for 12 weeks.
