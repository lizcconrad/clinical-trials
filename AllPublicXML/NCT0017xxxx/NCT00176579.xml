      RATIONALE: Measuring bone mineral density may help doctors predict whether prostate cancer
      will come back. It may also help the study of prostate cancer in the future.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying whether bone mineral density affects cancer
      recurrence in patients with early stage prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine bone mineral density (BMD) in patients with clinically significant early stage
           prostate cancer.

        -  Determine whether patients who have a higher level of BMD and have had a radical
           prostatectomy for cure are less likely to have an early relapse (i.e., less than 3
           years) than those patients with a low level of BMD.

      OUTLINE: This is a case-controlled study followed by a prospective, longitudinal, cohort
      study.

      Patients undergo bone mineral density (BMD) measurements by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry
      with a densitometer. Posteroanterior measurements of the total hip are also recorded.

      Patients also undergo blood collection to examine markers that provide evidence of systemic
      disease.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.

        Subjects will be recruited from urologists' offices and the oncological practices of CINJ.
        This will be done by verbal communication through the office staff and with the
        distribution of a brochure briefly describing the study. If a person is interested, he will
        be given information that briefly describes the study and his name will be taken down. A
        research assistant will call him and set up a meeting, preferably at the same time he is
        scheduled to see his physician. At that meeting, a research assistant will go over the
        consent form with him and cover all questions concerning the study. Eligibility (based on
        history) will also be verified at this meeting. If he wishes to participate, he will be
        instructed to sign the consent and an appointment for the blood tests and DXA scan will be
        arranged.
