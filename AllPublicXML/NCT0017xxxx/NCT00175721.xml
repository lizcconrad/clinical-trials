  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the benefits of a combined cardiac, kidney, and
      diabetes clinic versus multiple clinics.

      Hypothesis: Attendance at multiple clinics by one individual patient has multiple problems
      which may be overcome by the introduction of a combined care clinic.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized control trial to compare health care resource utilization, and
      achievement of stated targets of therapy (BP, Hgb, glucose control, use of preventive
      medications) as well as patient and health care team satisfaction, and longer term patient
      outcomes in patients with kidney disease who have either or both diabetes and heart disease,
      and currently attend either a diabetic or heart function clinic (or both) in addition to a
      kidney care clinic. In addition, we will also establish and refine the specialized
      cross-disciplinary care model, within a framework in Vancouver, and evaluate its functioning
      from the perspectives of allied health and medical professionals.

      This is a systematic evaluation of health care delivery methods to a complex group of
      patients, which will serve as a nidus for ongoing research in both health outcomes research,
      and biomedical research.

      The creation of this multifaceted clinic in an organized manner would permit evaluation of
      all of the components of it, and also demonstrate the importance of collaboration between
      disciplines and between public health care initiatives and industry partners, who would fund
      this clinic infrastructure and research components in the initial phase.
