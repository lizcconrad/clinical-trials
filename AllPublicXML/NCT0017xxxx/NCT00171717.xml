  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial is conducted in patients who have received a liver transplant, were prescribed
      tacrolimus to prevent organ rejection and developed diabetes from 3 month
      post-transplantation onwards. The goal of the trial is to assess the percentage of patients
      in whom diabetes will resolve 6 month after conversion from tacrolimus to cyclosporine
      micro-emulsion as measured by a fasting blood glucose &lt; 1,26 g/l without the need of
      hypoglycemic treatment.
