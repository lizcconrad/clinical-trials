  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate a new anti-cancer drug called S CKD602,
      developed by ALZA Corporation. The drug is investigational and not approved by the Food and
      Drug administration (FDA). The side effects (the way the drug acts in your body) and the
      effect it has on your disease will be studied.

      The main purposes of this study are:

      To determine the maximum tolerated dose (highest dose that can safely be given to subjects)
      of S CKD602 when given every three weeks.

      To determine the incidence and severity of toxicity (side-effects) of S CKD602 when given
      every three weeks.

      To determine a subject's body handles the drug (pharmacokinetics) following administration of
      S CKD602.

      In addition to the above, we would also like to analyze how the genes (material inside each
      cell that is responsible for cell functioning and appearance) found in a subject's blood
      affect how the study drug S-CKD602 is broken down in a subject's body. This process is
      referred to as &quot;metabolic genotyping analyses&quot;. This evaluation is performed using a blood
      sample and is optional.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Male or female subjects with an age &gt; 18 years Histologically or cytologically proven
        malignancy, unresponsive to curative surgery, radiotherapy, conventional chemotherapy or
        for which no conventional therapy exists. (Measurable or evaluable disease is desirable,
        but not required) Note: This study is restricted to patients with advanced solid tumors,
        subjects with hematological malignancies are excluded (including lymphoma and leukemia)
        ECOG Performance Status 0- 2 Adequate bone marrow function, without the support of
        cytokines and/or Epoetin Alpha within 5 days prior to dosing: Absolute neutrophil count
        (ANC) &gt;1,500/mm3, platelet count &gt; 100,000/mm3, Hgb &gt; 9.0 g/dL. Adequate liver function:
        total bilirubin level &lt; 2.0 mg/dL, ALT and AST &lt; 2.0 x institutional upper limit of normal
        in the absence of liver metastasis, or &lt; 4.0 x institutional upper limit of normal in the
        presence of liver metastasis.

        Adequate renal function: serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dL. At least 3 weeks since prior
        chemotherapy or cancer surgery (6 weeks for nitrosourea or mitomycin C).

        Normal cardiac function with no history of uncontrolled heart disease. Women subjects (if
        of child bearing potential and sexually active) and male subjects (if sexually active with
        a partner of child bearing potential) must use medically acceptable methods of birth
        control prior to study entry and for the duration of the study. Medically acceptable
        methods of contraception that may be used by the subject and/or his/her partner include
        abstinence, birth control pills or patches, diaphragm and spermicide, IUD, condom and
        vaginal spermicide, surgical sterilization, post menopausal, vasectomy, and progestin
        implant or injection.

        Written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subject is pregnant or is breast feeding. Subject's life expectancy is less than 3 months.
        Subject exhibits confusion, disorientation, or has a history of major Psychiatric illness,
        which may potentially impair subject's understanding of the informed consent.

        Subject has signs and symptoms of acute infection requiring systemic therapy. Subject has
        used another investigational agent within 30 days of dosing with S CKD602.

        Subjects with known allergic reactions to camptothecin analogs, dextran sulfate or other
        components of S-CKD602 Symptomatic or uncontrolled brain leptomeningeal metastasis. CT
        scans are not required unless there is clinical suspicion of central nervous disease.

        Not recovered from reversible toxicity of prior therapy. Subjects with known brain
        metastases because of their poor prognosis because they often develop progressive
        neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse
        events.

        Concurrent radiation therapy or radiation within 3 weeks of starting treatment with
        S-CKD602.

        Concurrent anti-neoplastic agents.
