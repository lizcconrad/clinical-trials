      The purpose of this study is to determine if WT1 is an adequate measurement of minimal
      residual disease in leukemic patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with acute Leukemia may have a large number of leukemic cells at the time that
      leukemia is evident clinically. At the time that we determine that a patient is in complete
      remission (CR) the patient may still have leukemic cells present in smaller quantities. One
      of the most important factors in the successful treatment of patients with leukemia is the
      ability to determine if the eradication of leukemia has been achieved. The determination of
      Minimal Residual Disease may be important in the determination of the therapy that a given
      patient will receive as determined by the level of residual disease.

      WT1 gene function and expression. The WT1 gene is a candidate gene for Wilms tumor, which is
      thought to arise as a result from inactivation of both alleles of the WT1 gene located at
      chromosome 11p13. The WT1 gene has been considered a tumor suppressor gene because intragenic
      deletions or mutations are found in tumors, germline mutations have been found in-patients
      with leukemia, and mediates growth suppression of Wilms tumor cells expressing a WT1 splicing
      variant.
