  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Northern Taiwan Stroke Center for Prevention and Treatment Project is a single medical
      center, 3-year, multipurpose study. The aims of this study are (1) to set up a
      multidisciplinary stroke team in a well-designed stroke center for stroke care; (2) to
      establish a systemic stroke prevention / education protocol based on people's awareness of
      stroke; and (3) to create a better stroke rehabilitation protocol and pathway.there are three
      components in rehabilitation projects. First, we want to identify potential factors related
      to functional outcome in patients with stroke before and after stroke center. Second, we want
      to compare the functional outcome in patients who admit to the stroke center as to those
      admitted to the general ward. Third, we want to investigate the effect of electrical
      stimulation on upper limb function in patient with acute stroke.

    <description>From a sample of 648 stroke patients who were referred to rehabilitation between November 2002 and October 2002, 345 charts were successfully reviewed. Besides, 126 subjects were randomly selected and successfully contacted for telephone follow-up; and data from 87 subjects of telephone survey were included for statistical analysis. Comparison of functional status between early rehabilitation and ordinary scheduled rehabilitation for acute stroke patients was done from admission to 3 months after stroke onset. The efficacy of early application of electric stimulation for the upper paralyzed extremity was performed.</description>
