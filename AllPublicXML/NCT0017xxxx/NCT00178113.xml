  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether dietary lycopene supplementation lowers
      serum prostate specific antigen(PSA) in men with high grade intraepithelial neoplasia
      (HGPIN).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Observational studies suggest higher lycopene intake or higher lycopene blood levels are
      associated with a lower risk for prostate cancer. Two recent trials of lycopene
      supplementation conducted in men with prostate cancer, during the three weeks prior to
      radical prostatectomy, found a reduction in serum PSA suggesting a regression of prostate
      cancer.

      High grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN)is thought to be a precancerous lesion, and men
      with HGPIN have an elevated risk of prostate cancer diagnosis on subsequent biopsy. The
      objective of this study is to determine whether dietary lycopene supplementation lowers serum
      prostate specific antigen(PSA)over four months of supplementation. Serum PSA is compared in
      men randomized to 30 mg/day lycopene plus a standard multivitamin versus standard
      multivitamin alone.
