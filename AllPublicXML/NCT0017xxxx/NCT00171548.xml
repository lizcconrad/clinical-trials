  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metabolic syndrome is commonly defined as a set of risk factors and abnormalities that
      markedly increase the risk of cardiovascular events. Its relevance has been confirmed by a
      recent population-based survey of subjects aged 40-79 years indicating that the prevalence of
      metabolic syndrome in Italy is 34.1% if diagnosed using WHO criteria and 17.8% if diagnosed
      using the NCEP-ATPIII criteria.

      On the basis of the above considerations, the aim of this study is to promote the use of the
      SCORE algorithm for estimating cardiovascular risk, and to evaluate its evolution in patients
      with metabolic syndrome after the implementation of a multifactorial preventive strategy,
      with particular reference to the correction of lifestyle, hypertension and dyslipidemia.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients of both genders aged 40-65 years.

          -  A diagnosis of metabolic syndrome formulated on the basis of the criteria proposed by
             the NCEP - Adult Panel III: i.e. the presence of at least three of the following
             conditions:

               1. Waist circumference &gt;102 cm in men and &gt;88 cm in women

               2. Triglyceridemia 150 mg/dl

               3. HDL cholesterol &lt;40 mg/dl in men and &lt;50 mg/dl in women

               4. Sitting arterial pressure 130/85 mmHg

               5. Fasting glycemia 110 mg/dl

          -  A risk of cardiovascular death of &gt;5% at the current age of the patient or &gt;5% if
             projected to an age of 60 years, as calculated by means of the SCORE algorithm using
             the table based on the total/HDL cholesterol ratio relating to low-risk populations
             and appropriate for Italy.

          -  Written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women who have not been in menopause for at least one year or are not surgically
             sterile, and do not use an effective contraceptive method, such as spermicidal barrier
             methods or intrauterine devices. The use of oral contraceptives is not allowed.

          -  Known or suspected hypersensitivity to valsartan and/or fluvastatin, or other
             contraindications to their use;

          -  A positive history of ischemic heart disease, peripheral artery disease or cerebral
             vasculopathy;

          -  Patients with an SBP of 180 mmHg and/or DBP of 110 mmHg.

          -  Patients with severe medical conditions which, in the judgement of the Investigator,
             contraindicate trial participation or significantly limit life expectancy;

          -  Treatment with drugs able to modify the lipid profile (ongoing or in the three months
             preceding trial entry);

          -  Patients unable to follow the planned protocol procedures or sign the informed consent
             form.
