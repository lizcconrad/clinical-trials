  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this research we propose to develop a comprehensive model to explain how users process
      persuasive messages. We then propose to experimentally test varying the persuasiveness of
      message content in various domains, and assess their impact on adherence by both physicians
      and patients. Finally based on our conceptual model and results from the experimental data we
      propose to develop preliminary guidelines to assist developers in designing effective
      messages.
