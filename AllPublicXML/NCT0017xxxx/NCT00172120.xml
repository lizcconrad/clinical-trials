    <textblock>
      The primary goal of osteoporosis therapy is to prevent fracture, and anabolic agents can
      accomplish this by strengthening bone structure, which is accompanied by changes in BMD.
      Effects of ALX1-11 on BMD have been previously documented in a dose-finding Phase II clinical
      trial in osteoporotic postmenopausal women taking calcium and vitamin D supplements, who were
      otherwise naive to osteoporosis therapies. The anabolic effects of ALX1-11 on lumbar
      vertebrae were statistically significant compared to placebo after 12 months of treatment. In
      addition, animal studies showed that the new bone formed by treatment with ALX1 11 is of good
      quality both histologically and biomechanically (Mosekilde et al., 1991; Kimmel et al.,
      1993).

      Protocol ALX1-11-93001 (TOP) assessed the effect of 18 months of ALX1-11 treatment on
      fracture incidence as a primary efficacy variable, and Protocol CL1-11-002 (OLES) assessed
      the effect on BMD for up to 24 months of treatment. Subjects who will be enrolled in the
      current study (TRES) will be those who received placebo in TOP and ALX1-11 in OLES. TRES will
      evaluate the effects of continued ALX1-11 treatment on the safety and efficacy variables
      assessed in the OLE study for a maximum treatment duration of 36 months in the OLES and TRES
      combined.
