  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) is a rare lung disorder in which the blood pressure in
      the pulmonary artery rises far above normal levels for no apparent reason. The pulmonary
      artery is a blood vessel carrying oxygen-poor blood from the right ventricle (one of the
      heart's pumping chambers) to the lungs. In the lungs, the blood picks up oxygen, then flows
      to the heart's left side, where the left ventricle pumps it to the rest of the body through
      the aorta. In the United States, an estimated 500 to 1,000 new cases of primary pulmonary
      hypertension are diagnosed each year. The greatest number is reported in women between ages
      20 and 40. However, men and women in all age ranges as well as very young children can
      develop PPH. Researchers have identified more than 40 BMPR2 mutations that can cause primary
      pulmonary hypertension. Many of these mutations introduce a stop signal that halts protein
      production prematurely, decreasing the amount of functional BMPR2 protein. Other mutations
      prevent the BMPR2 protein from reaching the cell surface, or alter its structure so it cannot
      form a complex with other proteins. It remains unclear how BMPR2 mutations cause primary
      pulmonary hypertension. Researchers suggest that a mutation in this gene prevents cell death
      or promotes cell proliferation, resulting in an overgrowth of cells in the blood vessels of
      the lungs. Cell overgrowth can narrow the diameter of the vessels, restricting blood flow and
      resulting in elevated blood pressure. However, it has not yet been reported regarding the
      genetic variants in Taiwan. Further details have been described in this project proposal.
