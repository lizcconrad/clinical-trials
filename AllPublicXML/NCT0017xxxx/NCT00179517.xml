  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if treatment using a medication
      (anastrozole/Arimidex), which lowers estrogen levels in the blood is better than placebo, a
      tablet that does not contain any active medication, when combined with testosterone
      replacement to treat reproductive and sexual dysfunction in men with epilepsy. Anastrozole,
      the medication that is currently under study, does not, at this time, have FDA approval for
      use for this indication.

      This is a three-month study where baseline information is collected at the first visit and
      then each patient is started on treatment with testosterone supplementation and either
      anastrozole or placebo. Lab tests, seizure frequency, sexual function and mood will be
      monitored on a monthly basis.

    <measure>Sexual Function Scores, Calculated Using S-Score and Reynolds' Sexual Questionnaires, Will Increase More Anastrozole and Testosterone Treatment Than With Placebo and Testosterone Treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 month average</time_frame>
    <description>S-Scores and Reynolds Questionnaire scores were assessed at baseline and once a month over three months. The average change in score for each questionnaire over the 3 month study was reported. The S-Scores questionnaire measured sexual function and consisted of four questions with five possible answers. The total scale range was 0-20, with higher scores were considered better. S-Scores that were greater than or equal to 16/20 were considered normalized S-Scores. Reynolds Questionnaire is a 21 item survey that monitors sexual interest, activity, satisfaction, and function. The scale for the Reynolds questionnaire for sexual interest was from 0-12, with higher scores being better. The scale for sexual activity was 0-41 with higher scores being better. The sexual satisfaction scale was from 0-21 with higher scores being better. The scale for sexual function was from 0 to -12 with lower scores being better.</description>

    <measure>A Greater Proportion of Men Will Achieve Normalization of Sexual Scores (Sexual Interest Function) Using Anastrozole Than Placebo.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 month average</time_frame>
    <description>A greater proportion of men will achieve normalization of S-Scores (scores greater than or equal to 16/20) on anastrozole (T-A) than with placebo (T-P). Both Men who achieve normalization of sexual scores and those who did not achieve normalization of sexual scores were reported for anastrozole (T-A) treatment group and the placebo treatment group.</description>

    <time_frame>3 month average</time_frame>

    <measure>Changes in Energy, Mood and Anxiety Scores Will be More Favorable With Anastrozole Than With Placebo.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 month average</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in energy, mood and anxiety scores were measured using The Beck Depression Inventory II and the POMS questionnaire. The Beck Depression Inventory II questionnaire consisted of 21 questions, each with answers ranging from 0-3. The answers for each question were summed. The scale ranged from 0-63 with higher scores meaning a higher depression score (worse score). The POMS questionnaire had a total of 65 questions that measured tension, depression, anger, vigor, fatigue and confusion. The total POMS score ranged from 0-200, with lower scores being better. The POMS tension score ranged from 0-36 with lower scores being better. The POMS depression score ranged from 0-60 with lower scores being better. The POMS anger score ranged from 0-48, lower scores being better. The POMS vigor score ranged from 0-32, lower scores being better. The POMS fatigue score ranged from 0-28, lower scores being better. The POMS confusion score ranged from 0-28 with lower scores being better.</description>

        <title>Sexual Function Scores, Calculated Using S-Score and Reynolds’ Sexual Questionnaires, Will Increase More Anastrozole and Testosterone Treatment Than With Placebo and Testosterone Treatment.</title>
        <description>S-Scores and Reynolds Questionnaire scores were assessed at baseline and once a month over three months. The average change in score for each questionnaire over the 3 month study was reported. The S-Scores questionnaire measured sexual function and consisted of four questions with five possible answers. The total scale range was 0-20, with higher scores were considered better. S-Scores that were greater than or equal to 16/20 were considered normalized S-Scores. Reynolds Questionnaire is a 21 item survey that monitors sexual interest, activity, satisfaction, and function. The scale for the Reynolds questionnaire for sexual interest was from 0-12, with higher scores being better. The scale for sexual activity was 0-41 with higher scores being better. The sexual satisfaction scale was from 0-21 with higher scores being better. The scale for sexual function was from 0 to -12 with lower scores being better.</description>

        <title>Changes in Energy, Mood and Anxiety Scores Will be More Favorable With Anastrozole Than With Placebo.</title>
        <description>Changes in energy, mood and anxiety scores were measured using The Beck Depression Inventory II and the POMS questionnaire. The Beck Depression Inventory II questionnaire consisted of 21 questions, each with answers ranging from 0-3. The answers for each question were summed. The scale ranged from 0-63 with higher scores meaning a higher depression score (worse score). The POMS questionnaire had a total of 65 questions that measured tension, depression, anger, vigor, fatigue and confusion. The total POMS score ranged from 0-200, with lower scores being better. The POMS tension score ranged from 0-36 with lower scores being better. The POMS depression score ranged from 0-60 with lower scores being better. The POMS anger score ranged from 0-48, lower scores being better. The POMS vigor score ranged from 0-32, lower scores being better. The POMS fatigue score ranged from 0-28, lower scores being better. The POMS confusion score ranged from 0-28 with lower scores being better.</description>
