      Study will deteremine the MTD and evaluate the safety profile of oral lenalidomide on days
      1-14 when combined with pemetrexed on day 1 of a 21 days cycle. Subjects will continue on
      study until documention of disease progression.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects must understand and voluntarily sign an informed consent document.

          3. Subjects must be able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol
             requirements.

          4. Histological or cytologic documentation of advanced NSCLC.

          5. Radiographic or clinical evidence of measurable advanced NSCLC. Subjects must have
             measurable disease at least 2 cm in diameter.

          6. Subjects must have been treated and progressed following chemotherapy.

          7. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 (Appendix I: ECOG Performance Status Scale).

          8. Women of childbearing potential (WCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy
             test within 7 days of starting study drug. In addition, sexually active WCBP must
             agree to use adequate contraceptive methods (oral, injectable, or implantable hormonal
             contraceptive; tubal ligation; intra-uterine device; barrier contraceptive with
             spermicide; or vasectomized partner) while on study drug.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any of the following laboratory abnormalities:

               1. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt;1,500 cells/mm3 (1.5 x 109/L)

               2. Platelet count &lt;100,000 cells/mm3 (100 x 109/L)

               3. Serum creatinine &gt;1.5 mg/dL (133 mmol/L)

               4. Serum SGOT/AST or SGPT/ALT &gt;3.0 x upper limit of normal (ULN)

               5. Serum total bilirubin &gt;or = 1.5 mg/dL (26 mmol/L)

          2. Any serious medical condition or psychiatric illness that places the subject at an
             unacceptable risk for study participation or would prevent the subject from signing
             the informed consent.

          3. Prior history of malignancy (except basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma or carcinoma
             in situ of the breast) unless the subject has been free of disease for &gt; 1 year.

          4. Known brain or leptomeningeal disease (CT scan or MRI of the brain required only in
             case of clinical suspicion of central nervous system involvement).

          5. More than one prior chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC.

          6. Concurrent use of any other anti-cancer agents.

          7. Any prior use of lenalidomide.

          8. Pregnant or lactating females.

          9. Prior &gt; or = to grade 3 rash or any desquamating (blistering) rash while taking
             thalidomide.

         10. Prior &gt; or = to grade 3 allergic reaction/hypersensitivity to thalidomide.

         11. Use of any standard/experimental anti-cancer drug therapy within 28 days of the
             initiation of study drug therapy.

         12. Known Hepatitis C.
