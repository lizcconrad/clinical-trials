  <brief_title>VALERIA: Valsartan in Combination With Lisinopril in Hypertensive Patients With Microalbuminuria</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Study to Evaluate the Effectiveness of Valsartan 320 mg in Combination With Lisinopril 20 mg Versus Monotherapy With Lisinopril 40 mg or Valsartan 320 mg in Hypertensive Patients With Microalbuminuria on the Reduction of Urinary Albumin Creatinine Ratio</official_title>

      The purpose of this study is to compare if the combination of valsartan 320 mg/lisinopril 20
      mg versus the monotherapies of lisinopril 40 mg or valsartan 320 mg will result in a greater
      decrease of urinary albumin excretion measured as urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR) in
      the first morning urine of hypertensive subjects with previously diagnosed microalbuminuria
      (MAU).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with mild to moderate hypertension with a mean sitting diastolic blood
             pressure (MSDBP) &gt; 85 and &lt; 110 mmHg for non-treated patients. Previously treated
             patients with MSDBP &lt; 110 mmHg. Treated is defined as having taken medication until &lt;
             2 days prior to Visit 1

          -  Positive urine spot test with Micral dipstick (detection of urinary albumin
             concentration of at least 50 mg/l) at Visit 1 (day -21).

          -  Confirmation of MAU of at least 2 out of 3 measurements determined in the first
             morning urine samples performed at Visit 1 day-21), Visit 2 (day -14) or Visit 3 (day
             -7). MAU is defined for male patients as urinary albumin creatinine ratio (UACR) &gt; 2.5
             mg/mmol and &lt; 25.0 mg/mmol and for female patients as UACR &gt; 3.5 mg/mmol and &lt; 35.0
             mg/mmol at both visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of renal impairment as determined by any one of the following:

               -  serum creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml/min as determined by Cockroft and Gault
                  formula [Cockroft and Gault, 1976] and/or

               -  serum creatinine &gt; 1.25 x ULN at Visit 1,

               -  a history of dialysis, or

               -  a history of nephrotic syndrome.

          -  Serum potassium values &lt;3.5 mmol/l or &gt;5.5 mmol/l at Visit 1

          -  Any medical condition which might significantly alter the urinary excretion of albumin

        Other protocol-defined exclusion criteria may apply.
