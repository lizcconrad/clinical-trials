  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on data supporting the use of cyclophosphamide and etoposide both as single agents in
      combination and a Phase I study showing acceptable toxicity with a chronic dosing regimen, we
      propose a Phase II clinical trial. This protocol establishes a model that will test the
      hypothesis that the use of etoposide and cyclophosphamide early in the course of prostate
      cancer progression, when fewer tumor cells are present, will have greater anti-tumor
      activity. We plan to treat patients with stage D0 prostate cancer to assess toxicity and
      anti-tumor activity.

    <description>The PSA response rate is the percentage of patients who have a PSA response. A PSA response will be considered a PSA decline of at least 50% must be confirmed by a second PSA value four or more weeks later. The reference PSA for these declines should be a PSA measured within 2 weeks prior to the initiation of therapy. Patients may not demonstrate clinical or radiographic evidence of disease progression during this period.</description>

    <description>Therapy will be divided into 4 cycles. Each cycle will be composed of 6 weeks of therapy. Total duration of therapy is 24 weeks. Administration of etoposide (50 mg po qd) and cyclophosphamide (50 mg po qd) will alternate in 21 day intervals. Starting with etoposide, patients will receive 21 days of therapy, upon completion of etoposide therapy patients will then receive 21 days of cyclophosphamide therapy. Therapy will continue in this alternating manner for 24 weeks. Week 1 of each cycle, begins with etoposide; Week 4 of each cycle, begins with cyclophosphamide.</description>

    <description>50 mg per day of cyclophosphamide orally for 21 consecutive days. Cyclophosphamide will be alternated with oral etoposide. The drug is taken 2 hours after breakfast. The patient will be asked to increase hydration throughout the day. Recommendation is at least 6, 8oz glasses of water or other non-caffeinated beverage. Week 4 of the each cycle will begin with cylcophosphamide. Chronic administration of cyclophosphamide at this dose has been well tolerated</description>

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Patients with histologically proven prostate cancer and tumors limited to the prostate
             (including seminal vesicle involvement, provided all visible disease was surgically
             removed) that have completed local therapy and have an rising PSA value, as defined in
             Section 5.1.5.

          -  Prior androgen ablation therapy is allowed as long as the patient completed therapy at
             least 1 year prior to entry into this study. The patient must be fully recovered from

             therapy.

          -  Primary treatment to the prostate (surgery and/or radiation) must have been completed
             at least 3 months prior to entry into this study and the patient must be fully
             recovered from such therapy.

          -  Patients must have a negative CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis and bone scan. The
             scans must be completed within 4 weeks prior to the date of starting therapy.

        <title>PSA Response Rate</title>
        <description>The PSA response rate is the percentage of patients who have a PSA response. A PSA response will be considered a PSA decline of at least 50% must be confirmed by a second PSA value four or more weeks later. The reference PSA for these declines should be a PSA measured within 2 weeks prior to the initiation of therapy. Patients may not demonstrate clinical or radiographic evidence of disease progression during this period.</description>

            <description>Therapy will be divided into 4 cycles. Each cycle will be composed of 6 weeks of therapy for a total of 24 weeks. Administration of etoposide (50 mg po qd) and cyclophosphamide (50 mg po qd) will alternate in 21 day intervals. Starting with etoposide, patients will receive 21 days of therapy, upon completion of etoposide therapy patients will then receive 21 days of cyclophosphamide therapy. Week 1 of each cycle, begins with etoposide; Week 4 of each cycle, begins with cyclophosphamide.
Cyclophosphamide : 50 mg per day of cyclophosphamide orally for 21 consecutive days. Cyclophosphamide will be alternated with oral etoposide. The drug is taken 2 hours after breakfast. The patient will be asked to increase hydration throughout the day. Recommendation is at least 6, 8oz glasses of water or other non-caffeinated beverage. Week 4 of the each cycle will begin with cylcophosphamide. Chronic administration</description>
