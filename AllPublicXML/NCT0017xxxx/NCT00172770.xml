  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness, which has a prodromal phase of 1-2 years prior to
      the onset of the illness. During the prodromal phase, patients might show maladaptation
      and/or poor social functioning. However, these early symptom of schizophrenia might be
      overlooked by patients and their families. At that period, patients might strive to improve
      their social interactions and social functioning. However, the efforts might further create
      their stress level on everyday life, which can actually accelerate the illness onset of
      schizophrenia. In other words, the efforts would worsen the pathophysiologic changes in the
      brain, which can result in the positive symptoms of schizophrenia.

      Previous researches found that the critical period for treatment of schizophrenia is the
      early phase of illness onset, especially the first two or three years. Delay treatment would
      worsen the illness. To this extent, early treatment would bring to a better prognosis as well
      as minimize the costs of individuals, families and society. In other words, early
      interventions not only can prevent relapse, it also can benefit patientsâ€™ psychosocial
      adjustments. However, researches found that the average duration of untreated psychosis is
      25.2 months in Taiwan, which indicates the phenomena of delay treatment and this trend might
      result in missing the critical treatment period.

      This is a two years study aiming to establish an early intervention program for patients with
      schizophrenia. In the first year, it aims to understand the phenomena of psychiatric care
      services utilization for patients with schizophrenia, special emphasis will be on the delay
      treatment and pluralistic health seeking process. In the second year, it aims to establish an
      early intervention program. The results of this research would contribute to in-service
      trainings, service providing, and policy making of psychiatric services.
