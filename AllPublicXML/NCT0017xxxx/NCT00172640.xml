  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one the most common malignancies in the world, especially
      in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. Since 1984, it has been the leading cause of cancer
      death in Taiwan. About 6000-8000 people died of this cancer every year in Taiwan. DNA
      microarray (DNA chip) is a very powerful tool to clarify the genetic changes in cancers.
      Expression profiling techniques have been used to simultaneously monitor the expression of
      thousands of genes from human tumor samples. It has been successfully used to predict
      clinical outcome and survival as well as classify different types of cancer. In this study,
      we will use the DNA chip to study the genetics in liver cancer patients.

      The clinical samples will be collected in the NTUH, while the DNA microarray works will be
      done in Biomedical Engineering Center (BMEC) of ITRI.

      Patients A total of 40 cases of HCC patients (20 HBV-related HCC and 20 HCV-related HCC) who
      received surgical resection in National Taiwan University Hospital will be enrolled from our
      tissue banks. The diagnosis of HCC was confirmed by pathological examination. The surgical
      specimens were frozen immediately after surgery and stored in –140°C. The clinicopathological
      data will be retrospectively obtained from chart reviews.

      Another total of 40 new HCC patients who receive surgical resection in National Taiwan
      University Hospital will be collected. The healthy subjects and patients chronically infected
      with HBV or HCV without HCC will be used as controls. The whole bloods will be collected
      before, one and six months after operation. The diagnosis of HCC will be confirmed by
      pathology. In addition to the whole bloods, the surgical specimens will be frozen immediately
      after surgery and stored in –140°C.
