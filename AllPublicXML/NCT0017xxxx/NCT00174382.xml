      To document effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of donepezil in patients with mixed
      AD/VaD, and to further document the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of donepezil in
      patients with VaD. The effects of donepezil on executive functioning, behavior, general
      cognition, ADLs and global functioning will be assessed.

      The trial was terminated on October 15, 2007 due to difficulties in recruiting the subjects.
      There were no safety or efficacy concerns regarding the study medication in the decision to
      terminate the trial.

    <time_frame>Baseline, week 12, week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in sMMSE total score. Change: mean total score at observation minus mean total score at baseline. Total score is derived by adding all subscores and ranges from 0 to 30; a higher score indicates a better cognitive state.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, week 12, week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The ADL domain includes 17 yes/no questions on four items (hygiene, dressing, continence, eating). Score equals number of questions answered yes multiplied by 100 divided by number of questions answered. Change: Mean ADL score at observation minus mean ADL score at baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <description>IADL domain consists of 23 yes-no questions on 6 items (meal preparation, telephoning, going out, finance &amp; correspondence, medications, leisure &amp; housework. Change: Mean IADL score at observation minus mean IADL score at baseline. Total IADL score = number of questions answered yes multiplied by 100 divided by total number of questions answered</description>

    <description>The ability to draw a clock free-hand. Scored on a scale from 1 to 15; lower scores indicate higher impairment. Change: Mean CLOX 1 score at observation minus mean CLOX score at baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Copied Clock Drawing Test (CLOX 2) Change From Baseline; Full Analysis Set (FAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ability to copy a drawing of a clock. Scored on a scale from 1 to 15; lower scores indicate higher impairment. Change: Mean CLOX 2 score at observation minus mean CLOX 2 score at baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>CLOX Differential Score Change From Baseline; Full Analysis Set (FAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>CLOX differential score equals the difference between the score for CLOX 2 and the score for CLOX 1, values range from 15 to 0, with 0 indicating perfect executive function, and a worsening with the increasing score.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Scale measures subject's clinical condition at baseline for severity (CGI-S) &amp; for improvement from baseline (CGI-I). At baseline subject rated on numerical scale, 1 (not at all ill) to 7 (most extremely ill).
