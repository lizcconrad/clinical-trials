  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect pilot data on the feasibility of recruiting,
      eliciting informed consent, assessing, treating, and following patients aged 60 and older
      with bipolar mood disorders.

      Study specific aims are:

        -  to establish a recruitment, referral, and collaborative network for elderly bipolar
           patients, in collaboration with the NIMH funded STEP-BD

        -  to establish an outpatient treatment clinic at the Bellefield Towers site of the NIMH
           funded Intervention Research Center for Late Life Mood Disorders

        -  to implement standardized care pathways compatible with STEP-BD treatment algorithms for
           mood stabilizing pharmacotherapy.

        -  to document short- and long-term treatment response with respect to affective symptoms,
           sleep, general life functioning, cognition, treatment-emergent side effects

        -  to establish the clinical infrastructure necessary for randomized controlled clinical
           trials and for clinical research training in bipolar mood disorders of late-life.
