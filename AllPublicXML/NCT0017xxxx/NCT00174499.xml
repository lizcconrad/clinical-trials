      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the effects on existing tooth stain of
      nicotine gum. The study will enroll adults who have visible tooth staining.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a 6-week, open-label, single-center study conducted in 78 subjects who were smokers
      with visible staining of teeth and who were motivated to quit smoking through use of
      Nicorette Freshmint gum.

      The subjects were assigned, per label instructions, to either Nicorette Freshmint gum 2 mg or
      4 mg based on the number of cigarettes smoked per day. Subjects who smoked at least 25 or
      more cigarettes per day were assigned to the 4 mg gum group; those who smoked less than 25
      cigarettes per day were assigned to the 2 mg gum group.

      A total of 3 study visits were planned: Screening/Baseline, Week 2 and Week 6. A telephone
      screening prior to Baseline and the Screening/Baseline visit was performed to confirm subject
      eligibility. At each visit an oral examination, including a stain index measurement used to
      rate tooth-staining (MacPherson Modification of the Lobene Stain Index), was conducted; and
      smoking status and motivation to quit smoking were assessed. The safety evaluation at each
      visit included an oral tissue assessment in addition to assessment for any adverse events.
