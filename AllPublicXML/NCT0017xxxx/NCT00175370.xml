    <textblock>
      Patients admitted into the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) have an intravenous (IV) catheter (small
      plastic tube) placed in their vein. Very occasionally (4 times out of 100) the insertion of
      an intravenous catheter may cause an infection in the blood. It has been shown that the
      removal of the catheter and the insertion of a new one at a new site helps to get rid of this
      infection. Sometimes, antibiotics are also given.

      Vancomycin is the antibiotic given intravenously (into the vein) to treat these
      catheter-related infections. At Vancouver General Hospital, some physicians may not give any
      vancomycin at all whereas others may treat with intravenous (IV) vancomycin for one to
      fourteen days.

      Since there are a lack of data to support the length of IV vancomycin therapy, the
      investigators would like to find out if two days of IV vancomycin are as good as seven days.

      Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine if two days of IV vancomycin are as good
      as seven days for the treatment of catheter-related infections in the blood.

      INTRODUCTION: Intravascular device associated bacteremia due to coagulase negative
      staphylococcus has become the most common nosocomial bacteremia. Despite its prevalence, no
      prospective study has investigated how these infections should be treated. Removal of the
      intravascular device is associated with a reduction in recurrence rate from 20% to 3% but the
      required duration of vancomycin therapy is not known. We propose to test the hypothesis that,
      following removal of the intravascular device, treatment with 2 days of vancomycin is
      equivalent to 7 days of vancomycin.

      INTERVENTION: Randomized double-blind equivalence trial to test the hypothesis that 2 days is
      equivalent to 7 days of vancomycin treatment for intravascular device associated bacteremia
      due to coagulase negative staphylococcus. The definitions for the surveillance of
      intravascular device associated bacteremia from the Laboratory Centre for Disease
      Control-Health Canada will be used.

      MEASUREMENTS: Surveillance blood cultures on days 4 and 9 following removal of intravascular
      device. Relatedness of strains will be determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients admitted to the ICU who require treatment for suspected or documented
             intravascular device associated (IVDA) bacteremia due to coagulase-negative
             staphylococci (CNS). Suspected IVDA bacteremia due to CNS is defined as finding of
             gram positive cocci in blood in a patient with either an intravascular device (IVD) in
             situ or within 24 hours of catheter removal, with clinical signs of sepsis:

               -  two signs of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS): heart rate (HR) &gt;
                  90, Temp &gt; 38 or &lt; 36, white blood cell (WBC) &gt; 12 or &lt; 4, respiratory rate (RR)
                  &gt; 20 or pCO2 &lt; 32; and

               -  with no obvious source of bacteremia other than the IVD.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Underlying valvular heart disease

          -  Prosthetic valve or graft

          -  A history of infectious endocarditis

          -  Known hypersensitivity to vancomycin

          -  Calculated creatinine clearance &lt; 25 ml/min
