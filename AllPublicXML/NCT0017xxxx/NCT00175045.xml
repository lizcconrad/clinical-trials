        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects were required to have Grade 2, 3 or 4 esophageal findings according to the
             TAP Grading Scale during the pretreatment endoscopy.

          -  Subjects must discontinue histamine H2-receptor antagonists, proton pump ® inhibitors,
             prokinetic agents, antacids and Carafate before the first dose of drug and during the
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Gastric or duodenal ulcer (a lesion with appreciable depth ≥3 mm) or a hiatal hernia
             &gt;5 cm.

          -  Subjects could not have a diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus (with or without dysplastic
             changes).

          -  Co-existing systemic disease affecting the esophagus, (ie, scleroderma, viral or
             fungal infection), radiation therapy to the region of the esophagus, or caustic or
             physiochemical trauma to the esophagus.

          -  Current esophageal stricture requiring dilatation. The endoscope had to pass freely
             into the stomach during endoscopy. Any strictures could not have been dilated within
             12 weeks before beginning the Pretreatment Period.

          -  Positive H pylori by rapid urease test (CLO® test Kimberly-Clark Corporation).

          -  Uncontrolled, clinically significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, hepatic,
             metabolic, gastrointestinal, neurological or endocrine disease or other abnormality
             (other than the erosive esophagitis disease being studied).

          -  Diagnosis of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, esophageal varices, symptomatic
             pancreaticobiliary tract disease, cholecystitis, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or
             malignancy (except basal cell carcinoma).
