      The purpose of this study is to determine if pelvic exercises can reduce the occurrence of
      urinary incontinence (involuntary loss of urine) before and after delivery. We would also
      like to see if performing pelvic exercises before birth has an effect on labor and/or
      delivery, and if there are any specific characteristics for developing urinary incontinence
      during pregnancy and after delivery.

      The studies investigating physiotherapy for prevention of urinary incontinence during and
      after pregnancy used intensive pelvic floor muscle training. While physical therapy appears
      to be effective in preventing urinary incontinence, extensive physical therapy is too costly
      to be implemented as a preventive measure for the general population. Thus, we want to asses
      if non-intensive pelvic floor therapy decreases the urinary incidence of incontinence during
      pregnancy and postpartum. We propose a prospective randomized controlled trial to obtain
      baseline data on the effect of non-intensive pelvic floor muscle training of urinary
      incontinence in primigravid women.
