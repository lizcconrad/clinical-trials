      This study supplements patients' current medications with Pravastatin, a cholesterol-lowering
      medication, to try to improve residual symptoms and also to improve cognitive functioning. It
      consists of 15 total study visits over a 28-week period of time, one visit every 2 weeks.

      Blood draws will be done once every 4 weeks throughout the study to monitor lipid levels,
      C-Reactive protein, AST, ALT, and CPK Total. Cognitive testing will be completed at the
      beginning of the study and at the end of the study. During the study visits, the staff will
      be monitoring vitals signs (weight, height, blood pressure, pulse, waist/hip ratio), possible
      side effects, positive and negative symptoms, mood symptoms, and overall functioning.
