  <brief_summary>

      This project will test the efficacy of a brief, 2 session behavioral intervention for
      insomnia, as compared to an information-only condition. We hypothesize that compared to those
      receiving the information-only intervention, those assigned to BBTI will have superior
      short-term outcomes and retain the gains made, at 12 months.

      We will also compare older insomniacs to age matched good sleepers through measurers of
      mental and physical health, sleep, and general functioning. We hypothesize that the insomnia
      cohort will have more physical and mental health disorders of a greater severity than the
      age-matched controls.

    <textblock>
      As a prevalent problem among the elderly, insomnia is often treated by primary care
      physicians, and benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BzRA) are the most widely prescribed form
      of treatment. Behavioral interventions offer an effective option to BzRA therapy as they are
      preferred by many elderly patients and have a lower side effect profile. Presently behavioral
      interventions are available on specialty care clinics, provided by trained therapists,
      requiring up to six intervention sessions. This project will test the efficacy of a brief,
      two sessions behavioral model which could be adapted to the primary care setting. In
      addition, we will compare older insomniacs to age matched good sleepers through measurers of
      mental and physical health, sleep and general functioning. We expect that 100 enrolled
      individuals age 60 or older with Insomnia and a control cohort of 50 enrolled individuals
      matched by age and gender will complete the study. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one
      of two intervention conditions: (1.) receive a two session Brief Behavioral Treatment
      Intervention(BBTI), or (2.) a information-only modality in which they will be encouraged to
      read handouts on sleep, insomnia and healthy sleep practices published by the AASM. Clinical
      evaluation will include the Agebat measures (common to all five projects in this Program
      Project) and in-home or laboratory polysomnographic measures. Sleep dairies and wrist
      actigraphy will be used to measure treatment adherence. Patients will be evaluated before and
      after completing the assigned intervention cells. Those receiving BBTI will be re-evaluated
      at 12 months following a six month &quot;booster&quot; session. Data obtained from the control cohort
      will include the Agebat measures. We hypothesize that compared to those receiving the
      information-only intervention, those assigned to BBTI will have superior short-term outcomes
      and retain the gains made, at 12 months. We also predict that the insomnia cohort will have
      more physical and mental health disorders of a greater severity than the age-matched
      controls.

    <description>The behavioral treatment involves education about sleep and its disorders; habits that help and hurt sleep; and recommendations about sleep hours and time in bed. It involves two meetings with a nurse who is part of the research team.
In the information condition, participants are given similar information in printed brochures that are published by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. They are instructed to read the information.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 60 or older

          -  Current diagnosis of Insomnia using DSM-IV criteria (Insomnia group)

          -  No current diagnosis of Insomnia (Control group)

          -  Provision of written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Psychiatric: untreated depressive, anxiety, psychotic and substance use disorders
             and/or treated or untreated delirium of dementia. We will exclude at intake to the
             study any individual with moderate to severe cognitive impairment who is likely to be
             demented. In the event that an individual scores less than &lt; 25 on the Mini-Mental
             State Exam, we will exclude that person from the study. We will also discuss our
             concerns with the subject and will suggest that he or she contact the Memory Disorders
             Clinic run by the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. We will give the subject
             literature on this Clinic as well as their phone number. We will not exclude persons
             with milder cognitive decrements because chronic medical disease and its associated
             sleep disruption are themselves associated with some impairment of cognitive
             performance.

          -  Medical: ongoing chemotherapy or radiation cancer treatment, hospitalization within
             the past two weeks or terminal illness with a life expectancy less than 6 months;

          -  Sleep: untreated obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, narcolepsy or restless legs
             syndrome.
