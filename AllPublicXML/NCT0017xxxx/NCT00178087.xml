      This study will determine the changes in brain structure and function that are responsible
      for mood and cognition changes that are sometimes associated with late-life depression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to investigate the relationships among late-life
      depression (LLD), cognitive impairment and progressive neurodegeneration. The guiding
      hypothesis is that LLD patients have evolving cognitive impairments as a consequence of
      distinct underlying neuropathological changes, which frequently are expressed as Mild
      Cognitive Impairment (MCI). These neuropathological and cognitive changes are risk modifiers,
      lowering brain reserve capacity, and in turn, increasing risk of developing Alzheimer's
      Disease (AD). In order to pursue this goal we will enroll LLD, MCI, and normal control
      subjects to enrich our existing cohort to include a total of 150 elderly, non-demented,
      non-depressed subjects, 60 non-depressed MCI subjects and 270 LLD subjects. Using the joint
      infrastructure of the University of Pittsburgh's Advanced Center for Intervention and
      Services Research for Late-Life Mood Disorders and the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center,
      we will complete a detailed neurobehavioral evaluation, including clinical,
      neuropsychological, neuroimaging and biological markers, using these data to evaluate the
      factors associated with the development of MCI or dementia. Subjects will be studied annually
      for at least three years, allowing us to use longitudinal data to evaluate a series of linked
      hypotheses that postulate the pathways by which elderly, depressed patients develop cognitive
      impairment, and which may lead some to develop dementia.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of a mood disorder

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Major acute medical illnesses or injuries known to have significant direct effects on
             cognitive functioning (e.g., metastatic cancer, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain
             injury).

          -  Uncorrectable sensory handicap (e.g., blindness), because they are unable to complete
             the cognitive test battery.

          -  Exclusion criteria for MR scans include: cardiac pacemaker, aneurysm clip, cochlear
             implant, pregnancy, IUD, shrapnel, history of metal fragments in the eye,
             neurostimulators, weight of 250 lbs. or more, or claustrophobia.
