  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The extension protocol is designed to allow those patients randomized to placebo in the core
      portion of the protocol to receive a 6 month treatment of open label octreotide and allow
      those patients randomized to octreotide who appeared to benefit from treatment, to continue
      to receive octreotide.
