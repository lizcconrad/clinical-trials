  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim of the study is to assess the interaction between sildenafil and fluvoxamine and its
      effect on the venous response to sodium nitroprusside.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study in healthy men we will
      assess the effect of oral fluvoxamine (50mg qd on day 1-3; 100mg qd on day 4-10) on
      sildenafil kinetics (single oral 50mg dose on day 11). Sildenafil plasma concentrations will
      be determined by LC/MS. We will also assess the effect of sildenafil on venodilation induced
      by a constant dose-rate of the NO-donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) during preconstriction
      with phenylephrine (dorsal hand vein compliance technique).
