      Short description of the primary purpose of the protocol intended for the lay public. Include
      brief statement of study hypothesis

      Pre-eclampsia (toxemia of pregnancy) is the most cause of death among pregnant women in North
      America. It also causes many complications for fetuses (unborn children) and neonates
      (newborn children). Pre-eclampsia is defined by high blood pressure (hypertension), the loss
      of protein into the urine (proteinuria), and disorders of many body systems, including the
      blood clotting (coagulation) and inflammation. What is needed is a compound that will safely
      prolong pregnancies, to give babies more time to grow inside their mothers, and will help the
      recovery in those mothers after delivery.

      We are going to investigate a compound (recombinant human activated protein C (rhAPC)) that
      has the potential to modify disease activity in pre-eclampsia by reducing coagulation and
      inflammation disorders. rhAPC is effective in patients suffering from septic shock. We will
      test rhAPC in women who develop severe pre-eclampsia in two ways. First, in women with severe
      pre-eclampsia remote from term who are carrying small babies (intent: safely prolong their
      pregnancies). Second, in women who have had severe pre-eclampsia before their baby delivered
      (including women in the first group), or whose disease develops/worsens after delivery
      (intent: switch off the disease so dangerous complications do not arise).

      This study is a preliminary one to look for possible risks and benefits for these women. Only
      40 women will be studied to provide initial evidence on which to base a larger international
      trial which is planned. We will study their pregnancy outcomes as well as markers of disease
      activity, to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms by which these women become
      unwell.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Scenario 1 is severe early-onset pre-eclampsia, where the fetal prognosis is dismal
             (&lt;50% chance of intact survival [disease onset &lt;27+0 weeks gestation and/or estimated
             fetal weight &lt;600g].

          -  Scenario 2 is postpartum pre-eclampsia, where there is either severe antenatal
             disease, deteriorating postpartum disease, or de novo postpartum disease.
