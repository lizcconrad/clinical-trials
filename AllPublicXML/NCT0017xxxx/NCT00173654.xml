      17βhydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 3 (17βHSD3) deficiency is a rare cause of male
      pseudohermaphroditism. The incidence is reported to be 1: 147,000 in the Netherlands. Fewer
      than one hundred affected 46, XY males were reported in the literature, and no such case has
      been reported in Taiwan before. The 46, XY patients have ambiguious or complete female
      external genitalia. They are mostly unrecognized at birth and reared as female. They often
      draw medical attention when they receive operation for inguinal hernia or during puberty,
      clitoromegaly and musculization were noticed. However, the homozygous or compound
      heterozygous genetic females are asymptomatic. The 17βHSD3 catalyze the conversion of
      androstenedione to testosterone, the last step in the synthesis of testosterone. Therefore,
      the serum levels of androstenedione are elevated and testosterone or dihydrotestosterone are
      in the low range in these affected 46, XY individuals. The clinical diagnosis is made by HCG
      stimulation test, because androstenedione-to-testosterone ratio is abnormally elevated in
      these patients. But the molecular basis of 17βHSD3 deficiency was not determined till recent
      decade.

      The HSD17B3 gene was elucidated in 1994, and composed of 11 exons. Several missence mutation
      and splice mutation were identified. But the precise action and tissue distribution of
      17βHSD3 still need to be clarified. The Wölffian ducts virilze normally in the embryonic
      stage and the serum concentration of testosterone achieve to the normal range in the pubertal
      stage. The exact mechanism is not understood clearly and peripheral conversion under other
      isozymes was suggested in some studies.

      The purpose of this study is to disclose the molecular pathology of our 3 families with
      17βHSD3 deficiency.
