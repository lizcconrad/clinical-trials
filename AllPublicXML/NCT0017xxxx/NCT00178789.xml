  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, most emergency physicians have limited access to obtaining formal radiology
      ultrasound studies, particularly overnight. Many are forced to adopt risky and expensive
      strategies in managing their patients with suspected deep venous thrombosis (DVT) who present
      during off-hours: for low risk patients, discharging without anticoagulation and arranging
      for outpatient studies; for moderate to high risk patients, empirically anticoagulating and
      admitting to the hospital to await definitive testing. If emergency physicians could reliably
      perform an accurate ultrasound exam for DVT, such risks could be obviated.

      This is a prospective, observational cohort study assessing the accuracy of emergency
      physician diagnosis of proximal DVT using compact ultrasound equipment and a simplified
      compression technique. The value of color flow doppler and augmentation will also be
      assessed. Outcomes (sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio and negative
      likelihood ratio) will be assessed at 30 days.

      Prior to enrolling patients in the study, emergency physicians will undertake a 2 hour
      training course on the performance of the simplified compression technique for the diagnosis
      of lower extremity DVT. Emergency physicians will perform the DVT ultrasound exam on study
      subjects with suspected DVT. Clinical management of the study subjects will not be altered;
      all subjects will proceed to receive a formal DVT ultrasound study by the radiology
      department which will serve as the criterion reference for the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Inclusion criteria:

               1. Presenting signs and symptoms sufficiently suspicious for lower extremity DVT to
                  warrant a formal radiology study in the opinion of the treating physician AND
                  EITHER 2a. Moderate or high pre-test clinical probability of DVT (Wells Criteria)
                  OR 2b. Low pre-test clinical probability of DVT with a positive D-dimer

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria:

               1. Documented lower extremity DVT within the past 60 days

               2. Anatomic abnormality that, in the judgment of the investigator, would preclude
                  imaging of both femoral and popliteal veins on the affected leg (i.e. above-knee
                  amputation or severe scarring from intravenous drug abuse in the inguinal area)

               3. Patient below the age of 18 years.
