  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if full weight bearing following total hip
      replacement can speed recovery when the hip replacement in the long bone of the leg is not
      cemented into the bone. When cement is used, most surgeons allow full or nearly full weight
      bearing following hip replacement. One drawback to cementless implants has been the
      restriction of weight bearing for six to eight weeks after surgery, during which time
      patients are allowed to only put their foot flat on the floor of the operated leg without
      bearing weight on that leg. This study compares the effect of immediate weight bearing on the
      speed of recovery from hip replacement surgery in two groups of patients receiving a
      non-cemented total hip replacement: one group is randomly assigned to not bear weight, and
      the other group is randomly assigned to allowed, tolerated weight bearing from the day of
      surgery forward.

      Patients undergoing non-cemented total hip arthroplasty with a Zimmer Fiber Metal Taper Stem
      and who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria are offered the informed consent process.
      Those consenting are randomized following surgery by flip of a coin into one of two groups:
      Weight Bearing as Tolerated or Toe Touch Weight Bearing Only. Each patient is followed for
      two years, and is seen at 6 weeks, 3 months, 1 year and two years. Questionnaires are
      completed including the Harris Hip Score and the SF-36. Patients complete a compliance survey
      to determine behavior related to their study group assignment and compliance with their study
      group. Radiographs are obtained at each post-operative interval and subsidence is evaluated
      and recorded. Range of motion and ambulation are assessed and recorded also.
