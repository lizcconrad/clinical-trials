  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Soft food chewing does not require strong bite force. The number of chewing strokes and
      occlusal surface area of the posterior teeth are more important. Clinically, reduction of
      occlusal surface to protect the abutments of a fixed or removable partial denture or the
      implant supported teeth is often necessary. If a certain chewing ability is maintained with
      reduced occlusal area, changing chewing velocity might help. For this hypothesis, the effect
      of chewing velocity on soft food chewing ability would be observed first. The purpose of this
      study is to evaluate the deliberately changed chewing gum chewing velocity on the chewing
      ability of healthy subjects whose dental occlusal surface area is known. Twenty dental
      students (10 men and 10 women with an age range of 20-30 years) with healthy masticatory
      systems and complete dentition will be asked to chew HA containing chewing gum with habitual
      side teeth at the cycle time of 0.5 sec, 1.0 sec and 1.5 sec for 30, 40, and 50 times. Jaw
      movement, tooth contact, and muscle activities will be observed during chewing gum chewing.
      The distribution of HA particles in the gum bolus after each chewing session will be measured
      and regarded as the chewing efficiency of that subject. Occlusal surface area of the
      maxillary posterior teeth, chewing rate, chewing time, muscle activity and jaw lateral
      displacement will be related to the chewing efficiency with multiple regression analysis. The
      effects of practice due to changing of chewing rate will also be evaluated.
