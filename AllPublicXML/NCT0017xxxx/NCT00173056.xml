  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peritoneal fibrosis (PF) is one of the most serious complications after long-term continuous
      ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Human peritoneal fibroblast (HPFB) and extracellular
      matrix (ECM) deposition is the most possible causes leading to PF. ECM are mainly synthesized
      from HPFB and human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMC). In the PF process, there is
      decrement in the quantity of HPMC, loss of permeability for lower molecules, and eventually
      ultrafiltration failure. This phenomena will result in technique failure.

      High glucose content of the dialysate and peritonitis have been claimed as major stimulants
      to the development of PF. In each episode of peritonitis, the number of HPMC will decrease.
      On the other hand, ECM production will be reinforced by the inflammatory cytokines secreted
      by the white cells or HPMC per se. High glucose dialysate will induce the above process with
      more chronic stimulation, and PF followed by technique failure is inevitable.

      Peritoneal fibrosis is definitively diagnosed with peritoneal biopsy, but this is
      inconvenient for most patients. Besides, pathology changes will be noted only after a
      substantial loss of peritoneal function. The peritoneal equilibration test (PET) is usually
      used as the index of peritoneal function. However, in the chronic process, PET change is also
      slow and is unable to be a parameter for treatment outcome. In this study, the factors
      predicting PET change will be searched, and they could be an index for evaluation and even a
      marker of preventing or treating PF.

      In this project, peritoneal dialysis (PD) dialysate will be collected during an annual PET in
      each PD patient in the National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH). Some cytokines that will
      be measured include vasculoendothelial growth factor, hyaluronan, transforming growth
      factor-Î², procollagen, and cancer antigen-125. The same test and measurement will be
      performed during PET in the next year. The factors which affect PET results will be analyzed
      such as cytokines, glucose exposure, peritonitis incidence, PD duration, gender, age. The
      investigators will try to find a convenient acute reactive marker for preventing or treating
      PF to monitor the PET change clinically.
