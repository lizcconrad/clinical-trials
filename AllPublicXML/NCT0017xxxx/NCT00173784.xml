      This study is to develop an IADL Scale for patients with SCI (IADL-SCI) and examine its
      psychometric properties in three years. In the first year, we will devote ourselves to the
      development of IADL-SCI â€“ first version. About 150 patients will be recruited in this year.

      In the second year, the study will be focused on investigating the psychometric properties of
      IADL-SCI in order to construct the formal version of IADL-SCI in about 120 patients with
      stable condition.

      In the third year, we will be engaged in analyzing and comparing the psychometric properties
      of the three IADL scales (IADL-SCI, Frenchay Activities index, and Lawton IADL) to confirm
      that IADL-SCI is the best among the three. About 50 inpatients receiving rehabilitation will
      be recruited in this year.
