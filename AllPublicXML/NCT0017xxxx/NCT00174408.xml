  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate, if Genotonorm (Genotropin) increases linear growth in
      short children born SGA. Safety of the drug is a main objective as well. The growth promoting
      effect of two different dosages is compared. The effect of long-term treatment on final
      height is evaluated (according to several amendments)
