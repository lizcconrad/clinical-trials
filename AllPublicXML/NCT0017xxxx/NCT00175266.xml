  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Islet transplantation has been investigated as a treatment for Type 1 diabetes mellitus in
      selected patients with inadequate glucose control despite insulin therapy. However, the
      perennial hope that such an approach would result in long-term freedom from the need for
      exogenous insulin, with stabilization of the secondary complications of diabetes, has failed
      to materialize in practice. The goal of the present study is therefore to improve the safety
      and efficacy of clinical islet-alone transplantation by minimizing dependence on
      calcineurin-inhibitor therapy - thereby avoiding potential nephrotoxicity, and furthermore
      improving success with single-donor islet infusions by avoiding all diabetogenic
      immunosuppression. Campath-1H, combined with Infliximab induction therapy provides a unique
      opportunity to minimize dosing of maintenance long-term immunosuppression while further
      promoting islet engraftment.

      This is a single-centre, prospective, open-label study in Type 1 diabetic participants
      receiving an islet cell transplant; all participants will receive Campath-1H + Infliximab
      induction therapy followed by sirolimus and ultra-low dose tacrolimus maintenance therapy.

      The primary objective of this protocol is to assess the safety of this treatment regimen in
      adult Type 1 diabetic participants receiving their first islet transplant.

             symptoms at plasma glucose levels of &lt; 3.0 mmol/L; (2) Metabolic lability/instability,
             characterized by MAGE ≥ 11.0 mmol/L and wide swings in blood glucose despite optimal
             diabetes therapy; and (3) Despite efforts at optimal glucose control, progressive
             secondary complications of diabetes, including retinopathy, neuropathy, or nephropathy

             procreate, failure to follow effective contraceptive measures, or presently breast
             feeding

          -  Previous transplant, or evidence of sensitization on PRA

          -  Insulin requirement &gt; 1.0 IU/kg/day
