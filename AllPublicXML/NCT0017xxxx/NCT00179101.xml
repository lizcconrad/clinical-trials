      We will evaluate the effect of deep brain stimulation on the depression and quality of life
      in Parkinson’s disease. We aim to compare depression pre-operatively and post-operatively in
      Parkinson’s patients with deep brain stimulation to Parkinson’s patients evaluated and
      approved for deep brain stimulation but who did not complete surgery. We will also compare
      quality of life measures between patients with and without deep brain stimulation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Deep brain stimulation is an approved therapy for Parkinson’s patients, and this procedure is
      actively performed at Vanderbilt University Hospital. Questions have been raised concerning
      the effect of deep brain stimulation on the depression commonly seen in Parkinson’s patients.
      Through this study, we plan to evaluate and compare the incidence and severity of depression
      in Parkinson’s patients with deep brain stimulation to those who did not complete the
      surgery. Primary literature has indicated a general increase in quality of life of those
      patients receiving DBS, but no studies have compared these two specific patient populations.
