  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      You have been asked to participate in this research study because you have or may have oral
      leukoplakia. Oral leukoplakia is described as a white patch or plaque on the oral mucosa
      (mouth) that will not rub off and cannot be removed by scraping, reversed by elimination of
      obvious irritants (things that cause redness and/or swelling) such as dentures (artificial
      replacment for missing teeth), or lesions as described that are diagnosed by your dentist.

      Since oral leukoplakia may precede the development of cancer, using agents that may prevent
      cancer, called chemoprevention, may be useful. The purpose of this study is to determine
      whether taking a green tea preparation may have effects on your leukoplakia. It is hoped that
      these effects may reduce the subsequent risk of cancer in or around the area of leukoplakia.
      To assess for these effects, samples of the lining of your mouth will be obtained, and they
      will be analyzed looking for certain features (biomarkers).
