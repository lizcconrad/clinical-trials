  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is an important issue for the emergency physicians and
      co-workers. How to improve the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) rate and prognosis of
      these patients challenges the emergency team. When encounters stress, the hypothalamus of
      human releases corticotropin releasing hormone, which in turn stimulates the pituitary gland
      to release ACTH. Then ACTH acts on the adrenal gland to release glucocorticoid to against
      stress. Foley PJ et al found the dogs with bilateral adrenalectomy had lower ROSC rate during
      resuscitation than those without surgery[1]. Karl H. Linder et al showed OHCA patients had
      high serum vasopressin and ACTH level but low serum cortisol level. Besides, the serum
      cortisol level had a negative correlation with collapse duration (no CPR duration)[2].
      Studies also revealed the successfully resuscitated patients had higher serum ACTH and
      cortisol level than non-resuscitated ones[2,3]. In addition, the serum cortisol level was
      found to be correlated with short term survival rate and hemodynamic status in resuscitated
      OHCA patients[3]. Animal study also showed mice receiving higher dosage of hydrocortisone had
      higher ROSC rate and lower epinephrine requirement than those receiving lower dosage of
      hydrocortisone or normal saline.
