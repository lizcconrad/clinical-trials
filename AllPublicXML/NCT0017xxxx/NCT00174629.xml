      Primary Objective:

        -  To compare response rate between genotypic groups and control group.

      Secondary Objective:

        -  To determine the safety, time to treatment failure and survival in control and genotypic
           arms.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients must be/have:

          -  histologically confirmed non-small cell lung cancer (squamous cell carcinoma, large
             cells or adenocarcinoma; it is recommended to provide the full paraffin-embedded block
             or at least 5 5 sections obtained from the primary tumor, recurrence or metastasis,
             not stained, fixed in formalin/embedded in paraffin, mounted on slides (10 micron
             sections), as well as two serum samples in two 10-ml tubes and two blood samples (see
             appendix X);

          -  unresectable metastatic (stage IV or IIIB malignant pleural effusion) NSCLC;

          -  WHO performance status &lt; 2;

          -  Adequate bone marrow, hepatic and renal functions, assessed during the previous 14
             days, that should be shown by the following characteristics:

               -  hemoglobin &gt; or = 10g/dl and no blood cell transfusion within the previous 2
                  weeks;

               -  absolute neutrophil count &gt; 2.0 10^9 cells/l;

               -  platelet count &gt; or = 100.10^9 cells/l;

               -  no evidence of myelodysplastic syndrome or abnormal bone marrow reserve;

               -  creatinine &lt; or = 1.5 x UNL or creatinine clearance &gt; or = 60 ml/min (real or
                  calculated);

               -  total bilirubin &lt; or = UNL;

               -  ASAT (SGOT) and/or ALAT (SGPT) &lt; or = 1.5 x UNL;

               -  alkaline phosphatases &lt; or = 5 x UNL;

               -  serum calcium &lt; or = 1.1 x UNL;

          -  at least one measurable lesion;

          -  previous surgery intervention (more than 30 days before inclusion in the study) is
             allowed but metastatic disease must be demonstrated;

          -  previous radiotherapy is allowed if:

               -  less or equal to 10% of bone marrow has been irradiated

               -  end of radiotherapy 21 days or more prior to inclusion in the study;

               -  patient has fully recovered from all toxic effects;

               -  at least one of the measurable target lesions for evaluation of tumor response
                  has not been irradiated;

             carcinoma of the cervix or other cancer curatively treated and with non-evidence of

          -  history or clinical symptomatic brain or leptomeningeal metastases;

          -  current peripheral neuropathy and neurohearing &gt; or = NCIC-CTG grade 2 except if due
             to trauma;

          -  other serious illness or medical condition, including:

               -  congestive heart disease; prior myocardial infarction within 6 months;

               -  history of significant neurologic or psychiatric disorders that would inhibit
                  their understanding and giving of informed consent;

               -  infection requiring I.V. antibiotics and tuberculosis under treatment ongoing at
                  study entry;

               -  untreated superior vena cava syndrome;

               -  active peptic ulcer; unstable diabetes mellitus or other contraindication to high
                  dose corticotherapy such as herpes, herpes zoster, cirrhosis;
