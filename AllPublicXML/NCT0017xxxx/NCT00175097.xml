  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the impact of soybean processing as well as the effect of soy relative to animal
      protein, independent of alterations in the fatty acid profile of the diet on CVD risk factors
      in hypercholesterolemic subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent data suggests that the magnitude of the effect of soy protein on lipid and lipoprotein
      levels is variable and less dramatic than originally reported. This discordance might be
      attributable to the forms of soy protein used, as well as subtle unrecognized shifts in the
      fatty acid, cholesterol and fiber content of the diets.The aim of the present investigation
      is to assess the effects of different forms of soybeans (whole bean and products made
      thereof), products derived from soy flour (textured soy protein) and products made from a
      soybean extract (i.e. tofu, yogurt) relative to animal protein, independent of alterations in
      the fatty acid profile of the diet on CVD risk factors in hypercholesterolemic subjects. The
      intent is to isolate any potential impact of processing on the plasma lipid lowering efficacy
      of the soy product or soy protein relative to animal protein.
