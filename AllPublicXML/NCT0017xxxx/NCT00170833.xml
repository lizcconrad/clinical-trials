          -  Male or female patients who are primary cadaveric, living unrelated or non-HLA
             identical living related donor renal transplant recipients

          -  The renal cold ischemic time (CIT) must be &lt; 30 hours

          -  The age of the donor must be between 10 and 59 years and not meet UNOS expanded donor
             criteria

        Exclusion criteria

          -  Patients meeting any of the following criteria at baseline will be excluded from study
             participation.

          -  Patients who have previously received an organ transplant

          -  Patients who are recipients of a multiple organ transplants

          -  Recipients of non heart-beating donor organs

        Other protocol define inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply. Patients who are recipients
        of A-B-O incompatible transplants or T-cell crossmatch positive transplants Patients with
        current panel reactive T-cell antibodies (PRA) titers of 50% or more (when the test is
        performed with dithiothreitol treated patient's serum) Patients who are known to have a
        positive hepatitis C serology, who are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or Hepatitis B
        surface antigen positive. Laboratory results obtained within 6 months prior to first dose
        of everolimus are acceptable. Recipients of organs from donors who test positive for
        Hepatitis B surface antigen or Hepatitis C are excluded Presence of cardiac disease ( Old
        New York Heart Association Classification Grade 3, elevated creatine phosphokinase
        myocardial binding isoenzyme (CPK-MB)or any cardiac disease considered to be unsafe for the
        study by the investigator) 10.Presence of severe hypercholesterolemia ( 350 mg/dL, 9.1
        mmoL/dL) or hypertriglyceridemia ( 500mg/dL, 5.6 mmoL/L). Patients with controlled
        hyperlipidemia are acceptable 11.White blood cell (WBC) count 4500/mm3, or platelet count
        100,000/mm3 12.Evidence of liver injury as indicated by an abnormal liver profile (AST,
        ALT, alkaline phosphatase or total bilirubin 3 times ULN) before transplantation
        13.Presence of any severe allergy requiring acute (within 4 weeks of baseline) or chronic
        treatment, or hypersensitivity to drugs similar to everolimus (e.g., macrolides) 14.The use
        of any investigational drug within 4 weeks of the baseline period 15.Patients who have been
        treated with non-protocol immunosuppressive drug or treatment within 1 month prior to first
        dose of everolimus 16.Patients with severe systemic infections 17.Existence of any surgical
        or medical condition, other than the current transplant, which in the opinion of the
        investigator, preclude enrollment in this trial 18.Malignancy (current or history within
        last 5 years) except for successfully treated localized basal or squamous cell carcinoma of
        the skin 19.Patients with any medical condition requiring long-term anticoagulation, such
        as heparin, low molecular weight heparin, or warfarin, after transplantation (Low dose
        aspirin, clopidogrel, or cilostazol treatment is allowed) 20.Abnormal physical or
        laboratory findings of clinical significance within 2 weeks prior to first dose of
        everolimus which at investigators discretion would interfere with the objectives of the
        study 21.Breast feeding women 22.Patients with symptoms of significant somatic or mental
        illness. Unresolved history of drug or alcohol abuse 23.Inability to cooperate or
        communicate with the investigator 24.Donors that meet the UNOS expanded donor criteria
