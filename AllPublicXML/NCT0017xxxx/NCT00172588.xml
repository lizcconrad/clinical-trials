  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our previous results revealed that the expression of killer inhibitory receptors (KIRs) on NK
      cells was decreased in eutopic endometrium in women with adenomyosis. It implies that the
      formation of adenomyosis might be due to abnormal endometrial tissues, but not the aberrant
      local immunological dysfunction in myometrium. In addition, in vitro coculture of macrophages
      and endometrial stromal cells (ESC) increase the expression of IL-6 mRNA in ESC, which might
      further enhance the proliferation of ESC and subsequently result in the formation of ectopic
      endometrial implants in adenomyosis. Besides, another possible mechanism is the abnormal
      apoptosis of ESC in adenomyosis. In endometriosis, apoptotic endometrial cells were found to
      be decreased, which possibly accounts for the formation of endometriosis. However, there have
      not been reports investigating the apoptosis of ESC in adenomyosis.

      In this study, we try to investigate apoptotic ESC with flow cytometry in women with and
      without adenomyosis. Annexin V, bcl-2, and caspase-3 were measured to represent the degree of
      apoptosis in ESC.

      Eutopic endometrium was obtained and separated into single endometrial stromal cell (ESC) in
      women with adenomyosis (study group) and without adenomyosis (control group).

      Annexin V-PE, bcl-2-PE, and caspase-3-PE are stained, and flow cytometry is done to measure
      the degree of apoptosis in ESC. On the other hand, another half of ESC are cultured for 24h,
      and also Annexin V-PE, bcl-2-PE, and caspase-3-PE are stained, and flow cytometry is done.
