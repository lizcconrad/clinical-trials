      Title: Antiproteinuric effect of valsartan, lisinopril and valsartan versus lisinopril in
      non-diabetic and diabetic renal disease: a randomized (3:3:1), double blind, parallel group,
      controlled trial, 5 months follow-up.

      Objective: To evaluate the antiproteinuric effect of high doses of valsartan vs combo
      treatment in no-diabetic and diabetic patients.

      Hypothesis: Combo treatment reduces microalbuminuria, proteinuria and the albumin/creatinin
      ratio more than monotherapies.

      Design: Multicentric, randomized, double blind, parallel group, active controlled.

      Dose / regimen Valsartan 320 vs Lisinopril 40 vs Valsartan/lisinopril 160/20

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female outpatients aged 18-70 years,

          2. Chronic nephropathy, as defined by a serum creatinine concentration of &gt; 3 mg/dL or

          3. Persistent proteinuria, as defined by urinary protein excretion exceeding 1g/24 h.
             (for a minimum of three months ).

          4. Normotensive and hypertensive patients not adequately controlled with or without
             treatment (controlled: &lt;125/75 mmHg).

             immunosuppressive drugs.

          -  Proteinuria greater than 10g /24h and/or hypoalbuminaemia less than 28g/L.
