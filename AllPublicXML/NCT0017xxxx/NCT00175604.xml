  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose is to investigate the effect of Botox on the treatment of congenital
      muscular torticollis (CMT). The investigators' hypothesis is that a Botox injection will be
      an effective treatment when used in conjunction with current treatment procedures.

      The babies that require a neck collar for CMT will be randomly placed into two groups. One
      group will receive standard treatment which includes physiotherapy and occupational therapy.
      The other group will receive standard treatment plus an injection of Botox. The babies will
      be monitored to determine if one group has a more favorable outcome than the other in terms
      of range of motion, length of treatment time and number of required surgeries.
