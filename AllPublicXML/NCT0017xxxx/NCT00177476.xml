  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether behavioral strategies implemented during the
      adoption versus the maintenance periods of weight loss to enhance exercise participation in
      overweight adults are more effective than a standard behavioral intervention.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Female or Male

          2. 18-55 years of age

          3. BMI = 25-39.9 kg/m2

          4. Ability to provide informed consent.

          5. Ability to provide consent from their personal physician to participate in this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Reporting regular exercise participation of at least 20 minutes per day on at least 3
             days per week during the previous six months. (This study is designed to recruit
             relatively sedentary adults.)

          2. Diabetes, hypothyroidism, or other medical conditions which would affect energy
             metabolism.

          3. Women who are currently pregnant, pregnant within the previous six months, or planning
             on becoming pregnant within the next 18 months. (Pregnancy during initial screening
             will be based on self-report and will be included on the detailed medical history that
             is completed by subjects)

          4. Non-medicated resting systolic blood pressure &gt;160 mmHg or non-medicated resting
             diastolic blood pressure &gt;100 mmHg, or taking medication that would affect blood
             pressure.

          5. Taking medication that would affect resting heart rate or the heart rate response
             during exercise (e.g., beta blockade).

          6. Arrhythmia on resting or exercise electrocardiogram that would indicate that vigorous
             exercise was contraindicated.

          7. History of myocardial infarction or valvular disease.

          8. Weight loss of &gt;5% of body weight within the previous 12 months.

          9. History of orthopedic complications that would prevent optimal participation in the
             exercise component (e.g., heel spurs, severe arthritis).
