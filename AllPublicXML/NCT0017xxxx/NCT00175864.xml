        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  An IRB/IEC approved written informed consent form signed and dated Male/Female

          -  Minimum body weight of 40 kg.

          -  Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of refractory epilepsy of ≥ 6 months.

          -  Patients must be receiving 1 - 3 concomitant AEDs.

          -  Female patients without childbearing potentials (2 years post-menopausal or surgical
             sterilization) are eligible. Female patients with childbearing potential are eligible
             if they use a medically accepted non-hormonal contraceptive method.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Seizures occurring in clusters (seizures occurring either too frequently or
             indistinctly separated to be reliably counted).

          -  Status epilepticus within 3 months of Visit 1.

          -  History of non-epileptic seizures.

          -  Patients on vigabatrin.

          -  Patients on felbamate, unless treatment has been continuous for ≥ 18 months.

          -  Use of benzodiazepines (for any indication) taken at a higher frequency than an
             average of once a week, unless counted as one of the concomitant AEDs.

          -  Ongoing psychiatric disease other than mild controlled disorders.

          -  Patients with a clinically significant organ dysfunction.

          -  Known allergic reaction or intolerance to pyrrolidine derivatives and/or excipients.

          -  Pregnant or lactating women. Any woman with childbearing potential who is not using a
             medically accepted, non-hormonal method of birth control.
