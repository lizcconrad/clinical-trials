  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A fixed dosage regimen of voriconazole is routinely used for prophylaxis of aspergillosis in
      lung transplant patients at our institution. We hypothesize that use of a fixed dosage
      voriconazole regimen leads to large degree of variability in drug exposure among lung
      transplant patients and consequently, therapeutic failures or toxicity. This is a three part
      study which will examine plasma and lung voriconazole concentrations achieved with the
      prophylactic regimen and assess for a correlation between these concentrations with efficacy
      and toxicity. We aim to conduct an initial pilot study in 12 lung transplant patients to
      characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of voriconazole with both intravenous and oral
      doses. The data gathered from the pilot pharmacokinetic study will then be utilized to
      correlate trough concentrations with total voriconazole drug exposure as measured by area
      under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC). Additionally, trough concentrations
      will be followed over nine weeks of the prophylactic treatment period in a larger cohort of
      patients to determine maintenance of consistency in trough concentrations and whether the
      plasma concentrations are predictive of efficacy and toxicity. Voriconazole lung
      concentrations will be measured in a pilot study of 12 patients who undergo a bronchoscopy
      procedure as part of their standard medical care in order to determine the relationship
      between plasma and lung concentrations. The information obtained from this three phase study
      will be utilized to characterize the pharmacokinetics of voriconazole in lung transplant
      patients. Further, it will be used to define an optimal therapeutic voriconazole regimen that
      will be individualized to target specific concentrations in the lung and plasma to maximize
      efficacy and minimize toxicity

      Blood samples (5 mL) will be collected either from an existing indwelling intravenous
      catheter or via a catheter placed by a research nurse or phlebotomist. The samples will be
      centrifuged at 1,500 g for 10 minutes within 60 minutes of collection. The plasma will be
      separated into two separate cryovials and stored at - 80 C until the time of assay for
      Voriconazole.A standardized data collection sheet will be created by the study investigators
      and utilized to gather pertinent information on each study participant from the patient
      medical records and electronic databases. The type of information collected will include, but
      will not be limited to, demographic information, transplant history, periodic serum chemistry
      and hematology monitoring, medication regimen, plasma voriconazole level monitoring and
      efficacy and safety monitoring parameters.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female lung transplant recipients, greater than 18 years old, who are
             initiated on the voriconazole prophylactic regimen (Figure 1) by their transplant
             physician as standard care will be eligible for inclusion in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients receiving voriconazole to treat an active fungal infection will be excluded.
             Patients that are concurrently receiving medications that are documented to affect
