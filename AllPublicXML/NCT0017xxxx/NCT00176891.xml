  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that weekly infusions of Laronidase ERT for 10-12 weeks prior
      to transplant and 8 weeks following transplant will result in a reduction of
      glycosaminoglycans (GAG) burden that is associated with decreased complications following
      transplant.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will receive laronidase once a week intravenously for 10-12 weeks prior to
      transplant and for approximately 8 weeks after transplant. Laronidase will be given by
      intravenous infusion (IV) through a catheter and from there to your child's body's cells and
      organs to break down the glycosaminoglycans (GAG) buildup.

      Prior to starting ERT, subjects will have a complete physical examination, which includes a
      complete assessment of your child's airway and lungs. In addition to standard treatment
      evaluations and tests, which are done prior to hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT),
      subjects will have the following tests: an additional teaspoon of blood for a baseline test
      for serum antibodies against laronidase, before and after the fourth dose of laronidase, the
      investigators will collect 2 teaspoons of blood for an alpha-L-iduronidase enzyme level; to
      watch for side effects to laronidase and the development of antibodies to laronidase,
      approximately 2 teaspoons of blood will be collected every 3 weeks while the subject is
      receiving laronidase ERT.
