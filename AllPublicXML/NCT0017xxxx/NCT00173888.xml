      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the 1-year treatment failure rate of two sequential
      chemotherapy regimens: weekly docetaxel plus cisplatin followed by gemcitabine; and
      gemcitabine plus cisplatin followed by weekly docetaxelã€‚

      Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in men and women worldwide. Shifting trends
      in the incidence of lung cancer closely follow the patterns of cigarette smoking, although
      other carcinogens have been implicated. Despite intensive treatment over the past several
      decades, the 5-year lung-cancer survival rate remains a dismal 8-14%.

      Chemotherapy is the primary therapy to patients with stage IIIB/IV disease, and most
      investigators believe that treatment with a combination of two agents is the best first-line
      treatment for stage IV NSCLC. In the late 1970s and 1980s, studies were conducted using
      combinations of agents. Outcomes were improved and these agents were eventually incorporated
      into clinical practice.

      Weekly docetaxel is being studied in combination with other commonly used NSCLC
      chemotherapeutic agents including carboplatin, navelbine, and gemcitabine. These combinations
      are being studied in both first- and second-line settings. Second line chemotherapy with
      docetaxel may affect survival (TAX 318, 1 year survival 37% vs. 11%). However, the optimal
      sequence of chemotherapy was rarely explored. Weekly docetaxel may offer better tolerability
      vs. 3-weekly schedule when combining docetaxel to cisplatin. Based upon these studied, we
      choose weekly docetaxel in combination with cisplatin as our regimen. We expected the regimen
      would be effective and well tolerated.
