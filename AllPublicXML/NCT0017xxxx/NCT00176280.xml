      STUDY SYNOPSIS

      Objectives:

      Primary:

        1. Determine the response rates and overall survival in patients with metastatic renal cell
           carcinoma (RCC) receiving pre-treatment with Leukine-dexamethasone vs Leukine alone in
           combination with gemcitabine-5-FU.

        2. Determine if pre-treatment with the combination of Leukine-dexamethasone is more
           effective than pre-treatment with Leukine alone in reducing the hematopoietic and
           non-hematopoietic toxicities of gemcitabine-5-FU in patients with metastatic RCC.

      Secondary:

        1. Determine the effects of the combination of Leukine-dexamethasone vs Leukine alone on
           the number and function of peripheral blood dendritic cells, and cytokine levels when
           given prior to gemcitabine-5-FU in patients with metastatic RCC.

        2. Determine quality of life and toxicity of treatment in patients with metastatic RCC
           receiving pre-treatment with Leukine-dexamethasone vs Leukine alone in combination with
           gemcitabine-5-FU.

        3. Determine the dose intensity administered in both treatment groups.

      Study Design:

        -  Overall study design: A randomized Phase II study in patients with metastatic RCC
           Patients will receive chemotherapy with gemcitabine-5-FU. Patients will receive prior to
           each chemotherapy the combination of Leukine alone (Cohort 1) or Leukine-dexamethasone
           (Cohort 2).

        -  Patient eligibility: a) chemotherapy naive patients with biopsy proven RCC, b) PS
           (ECOG), 0, 1, or 2, c) measurable disease by RECIST criteria, d) previous immunotherapy
           and anti-angiogenic therapy is allowed, e) adequate bone marrow, renal and hepatic
           function as defined by AGC &gt; 1500 and PLC &gt; 100,000 mm3 and serum creatinine and
           bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dl.

        -  Chemotherapy: Cohorts 1 and 2: Days 7 and 21: gemcitabine 1.0 g/m2 intravenously over 30
           minutes; Days 7-8 and 21-22: Folinic acid 200 mg/ m2, then 5-FU 400 mg/ m2,
           intravenously over 30 minutes followed by 5-FU 600 mg/ m2 intravenously over 24 hours.

        -  Study Drugs:

             -  Cohort 1, Leukine, 250 ug/m2 daily (8 am) subcutaneously days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and
                15, 16, 17, 18, and 19;

             -  Cohort 2, Leukine, 250 ug/m2 daily (8 am) subcutaneously days 1, 2, 3, 4,5, and 15,
                16, 17, 18, and 19 and dexamethasone 12 mg every 12 hours (8 am and 8 pm) orally
                days 3, 4, 5,6, 7, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21.

        -  Evaluations during this trial: Baseline: history and physical examination with vital
           signs/weight, estimation of performance status (PS), CAT scans of chest, abdomen and
           pelvis, EKG, CBC/differential, urinalysis, complete biochemistry profile (CMP) (12
           component) and quality of life assessment. Prior to each course: interim history,
           physical examination with vital signs/weight, grading of all toxicities, and estimation
           of PS, CMP, and CBC/differential. Prior to course 3, 5, and thereafter (every other
           course): CAT scans of chest, abdomen, and pelvis, tumor response and quality of life
           assessment. Each week after initiation of study (ie day1, course 1): CBC/differential, x
           3 (Monday Wednesday and Friday). Biologic studies to include assessment of dendritic
           cell number and function (20 ml blood), days 1 and 7 of course 1.
