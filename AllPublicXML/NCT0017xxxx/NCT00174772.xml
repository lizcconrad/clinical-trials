      Primary Objective:

        -  To evaluate the toxicity/safety profile of docetaxel/cisplatin induction therapy
           followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy versus concurrent chemoradiotherapy followed by
           consolidation docetaxel/cisplatin in patients with locally advanced unresectable NSCLC
           (stage IIIA- multiple cN2 or IIIB).

      Secondary Objective:

        -  To estimate efficacy parameters in overall response rate, progression free survival and
           1 year survival for each of the two above mentioned arms.
