  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to show that valsartan compared to atenolol has favorable effects
      on exercise capacity, quality of life, diastolic function and elevated blood pressure in
      hypertensive postmenopausal overweight women with impaired exercise tolerance despite normal
      left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).
