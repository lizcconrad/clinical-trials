  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to survey patientâ€™s cognition and attitude about health-related
      quality of life, use of estrogen, experience of menopausal syndrome, compliance of
      medication, experience, and satisfaction for women who underwent hysterectomy and bilateral
      oophorectomy before menopause.

      The cognition and attitude of menopausal women toward hormone replacement could have been
      changed since the report from WHI in July 2002. Previously, many women used hormone
      replacement to prevent cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis. Recently, the use has been
      challenged, exaggerated, and also discussed both in media press and academic meetings. Many
      women dare not to use them. The women who underwent hysterectomy and bilateral
      salpingo-oophorectomy before menopause may immediately face the problems caused by deficiency
      of female sex hormone. For this group of women, as yet there is no conclusion about whether
      the women should take hormone replacement therapy for a long time to osteoporosis,
      cardiovascular disease and other chronic disease. The arm for this study from WHI is not
      closed yet. While the women in our area might have been influenced by this report and have
      changed their mind. It is essential for us to make a clear understanding about the cognition
      and attitude for hormone replacement therapy for women who underwent hysterectomy and
      bilateral salpingo- oophorectomy. Therefore, it may be a pioneer study and worthwhile to do
      this study. Data from a medical center from 2000 to 2004 will be examined for evidence of
      bilateral oophorectomy &amp; hysterectomy. The cause for the surgery will be confirmed by
      pathological findings. These women who were under 50 years of age will be candidate of the
      study. The women will be interviewed about their beliefs, and cognition, regarding their
      quality of life and health risks as well as their opinion on menopause and hormone
      replacement therapy.
