  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insulin resistance and disturbances in energy homeostasis are associated with body weight
      changes, such as diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, cancer cachexia, aging, and
      acute or chronic infectious diseases. Cytokines secreted by adipose tissue and inflammatory
      cells play important roles in the pathological conditions. Several novel cytokines were
      disclosed recently, but their functions have not been well known. Further investigation of
      these cytokines, resulting in insulin resistance and energy homeostasis, is very important to
      elucidate the mechanisms and develop new therapeutic strategies.

      We are studying patients with body weight change, increased or decreased. Healthy people are
      the control group. We are recording body weight, body height, and physical exam results. In
      addition, we are drawing peripheral blood for further biochemical and cytokine assays.
