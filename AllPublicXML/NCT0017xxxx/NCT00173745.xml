    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of botulinum toxin injection to
      treat drooling in children with cerebral palsy, and to find the most appropriate dosage,
      duration of effect and side effects.

    <textblock>
      Sialorrhea, or drooling, has been reported to be a significant problem in 10%to 37% of
      patients with cerebral palsy. Excessive drooling may cause skin maceration, increased the
      burden of caregiver, affect articulation of the patients, and increase the risk of aspiration
      and dehydration. Many options, including various therapies, medications, surgeries and
      radiation, have been proposed to treat drooling. Yet none of these is universally successful
      and many have potential complications. Nerve endings of the parasympathetic post-ganglionic
      neurons secret aceylcholine. Botulinum toxin should be able to inhibit salivary gland
      secretion by blocking the release of acetylcholine. Very limited case series had proved fair
      result of botulinum toxin injection to treat drooling. However, most of the subjects were
      adult patients with neurological disorders. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the
      effectiveness of botulinum toxin injection to treat drooling in children with cerebral palsy,
      and to find the most appropriate dosage, duration of effect and side effects.
