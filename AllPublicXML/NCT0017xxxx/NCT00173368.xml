  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using a needle knife papillotome by an experienced endoscopist, endoscopic sphincterotomies
      were performed in difficult cannulation cases. In a prospectively collected database, we
      investigate the complications of those with ampullary impacted stone.

      The endoscopic sphincterotomy with needle knife papillotome is a well-established advanced
      endoscopic technique in difficult cannulation cases. Choledocholithiasis impacted at the
      ampulla of Vater is occasionally seen. Inflammed surrounding mucosa frequently accompanies.
      Whether sphincterotomy with a needle knife increases the bleeding complications is to be
      elucidated in this study.
