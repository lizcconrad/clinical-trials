      The primary goal of this study is to test a single multi-component intervention among family
      caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's disease or related disorders. The overall objectives
      of study are to 1) identify and reduce modifiable risk factors among diverse family
      caregivers of patients with Alzheimer's Disease or a related disorder, 2) enhance the quality
      of care of the care recipients, and 3) enhance the well-being of the caregivers.

      The proposed Coordinating Center (CC) will work with five sites and staff from the National
      Institute on Aging (NIA) and the National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR) to implement a
      multi-site caregiver intervention trial. The overall objective of this research program is to
      refine and test a multicomponent psychosocial intervention to reduce burden and depression
      among family caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's Disease or a related disorder. This
      competing renewal will build upon results obtained from its parent multi-site feasibility
      study, Resources for Enhancing Alzheimer's Caregiver Health (REACH) funded by the NIA/NINR as
      a cooperative agreement (UO1-AG13305). In the study proposed here, five intervention sites
      (Birmingham, Memphis, Miami, Palo Alto, and Philadelphia) will recruit 600 (120 per site)
      caregiver-care recipient dyads consisting of equal numbers of African Americans/Blacks,
      Hispanics/Latinos, and Caucasians/Whites. Caregivers will be randomized to either an in-home
      multicomponent intervention condition or a standardized information-only control condition.

      The Coordinating Center at the University of Pittsburgh will work with the intervention site
      investigators and the NIA/NINR to support the implementation of the intervention study at
      each site and to collect and analyze a common database across sites.
