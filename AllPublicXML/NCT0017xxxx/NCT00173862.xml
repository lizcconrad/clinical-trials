  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Gemcitabine plus Ifosfamind as
      second line chemotherapy in advanced transitional cell carcinoma in terms of response rate
      and overall survival .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy produces a response rate of 40-70% in TCC patients.
      However, only less than 10% of the patients can achieve long-term remission. Until now, there
      is no standard chemotherapy for cisplatin-failed TCC patients. Both gemcitabine and
      ifosfamide have been identified to have response rates of 20% or more in pretreated TCC
      patients. It is thus reasonable to combine these two active drugs as a second-line treatment
      for TCC.

      Patients enrolled must have a pathologically proven urothelial transitional cell carcinoma
      (TCC) and must have exposed to one cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy for the advanced
      disease. GI regimen will be continued until maximal response.
