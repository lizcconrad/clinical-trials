        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Patients with acute musculoskeletal pain following an uncomplicated soft tissue injury
             (within the last 72 hours) which is expected to be self-limiting, requiring short-term
             treatment with a NSAID.

          -  Patients’ acute musculoskeletal pain at baseline must be ≥ 50 mm on a 0 – 100 mm on a
             Visual Analogue Scale.

          -  Patients may have taken analgesic therapy following injury. However, the baseline pain
             intensity assessment should be taken: (i) 4 hours after the last dose of ≤ 400 mg
             ibuprofen, ≤ 1000 mg paracetamol, ≤ 600 mg aspirin or ≤ 2 tablets of other
             over-the-counter analgesic aspirin-based or paracetamol-based combination medications
             (ii) or 8 hours after the last dose of &gt; 400 mg ibuprofen or ≤ 50 mg diclofenac

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Patients whose pain is due to an acute exacerbation of a chronic condition e.g.
             osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus.

          -  Patients who have taken non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the previous 24 hours
             (other than aspirin, ibuprofen, diclofenac, as described above).

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/ exclusion criteria may apply.
