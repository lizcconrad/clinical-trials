      The purpose of this study is to determine the inter- and intra-rater reproducibility of
      direct physical measurement of tophus nodules in subjects with gout.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gout is a chronic urate crystal deposition disorder. Left untreated, gout may result in
      progressive disease characterized by joint and bone destruction from tophaceous deposits and
      renal impairment due to gouty nephropathy. Hyperuricemia, defined as a serum urate
      concentration greater than 7.0 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), is the underlying metabolic
      aberration leading to urate crystal deposition in gout. Gout has several clinical
      presentations, including: recurrent acute attacks of inflammatory arthritis; deposition of
      monosodium urate monohydrate crystals in joints, bones and even parenchymal organs
      (tophaceous gout); renal impairment; and uric acid nephrolithiasis.1 As serum urate levels
      increase beyond greater than 7.0 mg/dL, the risks for gouty arthritis or for renal calculi
      increase.

      Febuxostat is a 2-aryl-thiazole derivative chemically engineered as a novel xanthine
      oxidase/dehydrogenase inhibitor. Febuxostat is being developed as an orally administered
      agent for the management of hyperuricemia in patients with gout.

      Subjects with palpable tophi &gt;10 millimeters (mm) in length and width and as round as
      possible will have the tophus measured on two separate visits by two different raters to
      assess the inter- and intra-rater reproducibility of direct physical measurement.

Area of the tophus was summarized using the average percent difference, calculated as the absolute difference of Raters 1 and 2 divided by the average of Raters 1 and 2 for the same tophus, pooled across visits.</description>

        <population>Measurements of 52 tophi were obtained at 2 separate visits separated by no more than 10 days from the 13 subjects enrolled.</population>
