  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine an investigational (experimental) agent Tetrathiomolybdate (TM)
      combined with the chemotherapy drugs Irinotecan, 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) and Leucovorin (LV).
      This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination of these drugs when
      they are used in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer.

      This is a pilot clinical trial which will be studying the reactions of the patient's body and
      tumor to the experimental treatment described above. The purpose of this study is to find out
      what kind of side effects this experimental treatment causes and see how often these side
      effects occur.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically proven adenocarcinoma primary to the colon or rectum
             and clinical or pathologic evidence of distant metastasis.

          -  Patients may have received adjuvant chemotherapy and/or one regimen of chemotherapy
             for metastatic disease. Patients must not have been previously treated with the
             combination of irinotecan/5-FU/LV.

          -  Patients must be past their 18th birthday at the time of enrollment.

          -  Patients must have a performance status of 0-2 at the time of registration.
