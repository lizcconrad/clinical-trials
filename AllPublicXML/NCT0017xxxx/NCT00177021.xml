  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose to examine the efficacy and tolerability of Aldara Cream 5% for the treatment of
      extensive alopecia areata. Aldara is a immune-response modifier. The drug induces the
      production of cytokines which are small, hormone-like proteins involved in cellular
      communication during immune responses. We hypothesize that this drug will effect the
      inflammatory cells present around hair follicles in patients with alopecia areata.

      Ten patients with extensive scalp alopecia areata (&gt;95% hair loss)of less than 2 years
      duration will be invited to participate in this study. For six months each person will be
      asked to apply Aldara Cream 5% daily to the right half of the scalp. No drug will be applied
      to the left side. Skin biopsies will be taken of the right scalp before and at the completion
      of the therapy.
