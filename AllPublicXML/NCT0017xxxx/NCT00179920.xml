  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retinoblastoma is an unusual cancer of early childhood involving tumor is both eyes or, in
      certain circumstances, one eye only. This condition is the result of an abnormal gene which
      makes both retinas (the back of the eye) vulnerable to develop multiple tumors. Growths in
      the eye impair vision temporarily or permanently. These tumors are malignant, which means
      that they can grow within the eye, spread outside of the eye, and be fatal if untreated.

      Standard therapy for bilateral retinoblastoma includes removal of one eye if vision cannot be
      save and radiation treatment of either eye in which vision might be saved. Radiation controls
      tumor growth in the majority of cases. Another standard method is cryotherapy (freezing a
      tumor to kill it). Chemotherapy (medicines used to kill tumor cells) has been used in the
      past for tumor in or outside the eye, but is not standard. Hyperthermia, increasing the
      temperature of a tumor to kill it, is widely performed, and can be done to a retinoblastoma
      tumor by a laser; this method is not standard.

      The problem with removal of an eye is that any hope of vision is lost. The problems with
      radiation include incomplete control of tumor, injury to the eye or surrounding tissue with
      decreased growth, and that (due to the abnormal retinoblastoma gene) children are very
      susceptible to develop other tumors, especially in the tissue which was given radiation.

      The doctors at Children's Memorial Hospital are using a newer form of treatment, including
      laser hyperthermia, chemotherapy and cryotherapy to decrease retinoblastoma tumors. Some may
      be controlled indefinitely, reducing the number of eyes that need radiation or removal.

      OBJECTIVES

        1. To find out how well chemotherapy plus cryotherapy and laser hyperthermia work on
           retinoblastoma tumors.

        2. To find out whether vision can be saved and tumors controlled without radiation or
           removal of the eye.
