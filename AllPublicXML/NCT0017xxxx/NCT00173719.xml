  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purposes of the this three-year research proposal are to investigate the
      influence of assistive device use on dynamic balance and the associated attentional demands
      during standing and walking in patients with stroke
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research has shown the effectiveness of using ambulatory assistive devices to increase
      standing stability of patients with stroke in clinical practice (Maeda et al., 2001).
      However, literature has also suggested that manipulation of ambulatory assistive devices in
      dynamic motor tasks, such as walking, inevitably requires additional attention, even in
      healthy adults (Wright &amp; Kemp, 1992). Given that the majority of patients with stroke suffer
      from balance control difficulty, which subsequently increases their attentional demands
      associated with maintaining balance (Brown et al., 2002), it remains an important question as
      to whether the use of ambulatory assistive devices would take away some attentional resources
      that would otherwise be used for maintaining balance.
