          3. For women, report being pregnant during the previous 6 months, or planning on becoming
             pregnant over the following 3 months of the intervention. (Pregnancy during initial
             screening will be based on self-report and will be included on the detailed medical
             history that is completed by subjects. In addition, this will also be obtained as part
             of the signed medical clearance from the individualâ€™s personal physician.)
