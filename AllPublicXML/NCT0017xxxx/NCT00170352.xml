      The purpose of this study is to study the effects of EARLY (no more than 24 four hours from
      injury) administration of extra amounts of oxygen on traumatic brain injury.

      Brain injury continues to be a major cause of death and disability throughout the world. Our
      investigations of hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT) indicate that it is a relatively safe
      treatment that has promise as a potential therapy for patients with severe traumatic brain
      injury (TBI). The goals of the present proposal are to further elucidate the mechanisms of
      action of HBOT on severe TBI and to test hypotheses that are crucial to the possible future
      design of a Phase III clinical trial.

      Our initial prospective clinical trial to assess the effectiveness of HBOT in severe TBI
      documented very significant improvement in survival, particularly in certain subgroups of
      patients. In our second study, HBOT was found to improve cerebral aerobic metabolism in
      patients with severe TBI, reduce elevated intracranial pressure, and had a persistent
      positive effect for at least six hours following the treatment. Our work suggests that HBOT
      allows the brain to utilize increased amounts of oxygen more efficiently following treatment.

      Recently, increasing the inspired oxygen concentration (FiO2) to 100% has been proposed as an
      alternative way of delivering supranormal levels of oxygen to severe TBI patients.
      Experimental investigation in the fluid percussion rat model using HBOT at 1.5 ATA
      (atmospheres absolute) for 60 minutes followed by 3 hours of 100%fraction of inspired oxygen
      (FiO2) have given optimum results in terms of mitochondrial functional and neurobehavioral
      improvement.

      The clinical and experimental data together provide a strong basis for the restorative effect
      of the combination of hyper- and normobaric hyperoxia on severe TBI. The goal of this study
      is to evaluate the use of HBOT and 100% FiO2 separately and in combination.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All closed head trauma victims with GCS score &lt; 8, when no effects from paralytics,
             sedation, alcohol and/or street drugs are present.

          -  Informed consent obtained.

          -  Entry into the study within 24 hours after injury.

          -  If a patient enters the hospital with a mild or moderate brain injury and subsequently
             deteriorates to a GCS &lt; 8 within 48 hours of admission, the patient is considered a
             candidate for entry into the study.

          -  CT scan score &gt; II in accordance with the classification system of the Traumatic Coma
             Data Bank.
