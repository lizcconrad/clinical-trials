    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with type-I or type-II-diabetes mellitus.

          2. Males or females aged 18 - 70 years.

          3. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) in at least one eye that has an ETDRS visual
             acuity score &gt; 35 letters (20/200 or better), and that has no other condition that
             might interfere with assessment of retinopathy progression (see exclusion criterion
             #1).

          4. Media clarity, pupillary dilation and patient cooperation sufficient to allow
             stereoscopic 30Â°, or equivalent, fundus photographs of adequate quality in at least
             one eye that meets criterion #3 above.

          5. Starting of photocoagulation of at least one eye to treat PDR in between approximately
             2 weeks prior to start of study.

          6. HbA1c &lt; 13.0% at study entry. In addition, patients must be capable of testing their
             blood glucose levels at home and adjusting their insulin dosage to maintain blood
             glucose control.

          7. Systolic blood pressure &lt; 180 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure &lt; 105 mm Hg at study
             entry.

          8. Females of childbearing potential must:

               -  Have a negative pregnancy test prior to study entry.

               -  Be practicing acceptable birth control measures inclusive of intrauterine devices
                  or mechanical methods (i.e., oral contraceptives, vaginal diaphragm, vaginal
                  sponge or condom with spermicide).

          9. Ability to read, understand and write German language

         10. Patients must give written informed consent to participate in this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pretreatment as panretinal laser treatment other than photocoagulation which started
             approximately 2 weeks prior to start of study (see inclusion criteria # 5).

          2. Patients in whom the only otherwise eligible eye has, in the opinion of the
             investigator or of the central fundus photograph reading center, a condition that
             might interfere with assessment of retinopathy progression, including optic atrophy,
             extensive healed chorioretinitis, retinopathy that appears to have regressed
             spontaneously (with or without traction retinal detachment), retinal vascular
             occlusion, retinal degeneration, or other abnormality.

          3. Patients with a history of symptomatic gallstones who have not had a cholecystectomy
             (patients with asymptomatic cholelithiasis may be entered).

          4. Patients with brittle diabetes, type-I diabetes who have frequent decompensations in
             their glycemic control, with recurrent ketoacidosis or hypoglycemia that significantly
             interferes with their lifestyle.

          5. Patients with a history of severe hypoglycemia unawareness.

          6. Patients with a significant medical condition, other than diabetes mellitus, which may
             interfere with the evaluation of safety or efficacy of the study compound (e.g.,
             unstable angina pectoris, myocardial infarction within 3 months prior to study entry,
             severe renal failure, patients on renal dialysis, patients who have received a renal
             transplant).

          7. Patients who have received any investigational drug within 4 weeks prior to study
             entry.

          8. Patients who have received prior treatment with Sandostatin or any other somatostatin
             analogue.

          9. History of non-compliance to medical regimens or who are considered potentially
             unreliable Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.
