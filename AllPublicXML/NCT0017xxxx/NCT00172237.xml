      Specific aims of this project were as follows:

        1. To investigate the eye-head coordination of patients with cervical spine degeneration.

        2. To investigate the relationship of these impairment measurements (range of motion,
           muscle power, proprioception, sensory threshold, eye-head coordination) and functional
           outcome (neck disability index, quality of life evaluation).

        3. To develop a computer assistant device and software for the proprioceptive training and
           eye-head coordination.

        4. To provide a treatment and prevention program emphasized on proprioception treatment and
           coordination for employee with neck-shoulder complaints.
