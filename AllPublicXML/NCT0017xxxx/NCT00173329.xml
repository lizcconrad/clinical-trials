  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lately researchers and clinicians have emphasized the health related quality of life. Several
      reasons account for this trend. First of all, the advanced medical practices have contributed
      to the increased life expectancy. Secondly, the pattern of diseases has shifted from high
      acuity to chronicity. Therefore, the effectiveness of health care could not be solely
      evaluated by the rates of morbidity and mortality. The state of patients’ quality of life has
      become the pivotal indicator of the effectiveness of health care interventions. On the other
      hand, patients’ subjective perceptions of health care are crucial factors in treatment
      processes. Therefore quality of life becomes reference in choosing health care interventions
      to enhance the benefits of patients.

      The scopes of quality of life research include the essence of quality of life, the
      measurements of quality of life and the relationships between quality of life and its related
      factors, etc. The local researchers have long put efforts in quality of life research. The
      results of these studies have contributed to the understandings of different patients’
      quality of life. However, the majority of studies have focused on specific diseases. This
      study propose to extend the scope of quality of life research to study patients’ quality of
      life of two severe illnesses, i.e. HIV infections and schizophrenia. These two illnesses
      represent two severe physical and psychiatric illnesses. Even their etiology, mechanisms,
      disease process, signs and symptoms, and treatments are different. However, the similarities
      of these two illnesses include both are severe illnesses without cure, both are stigmatized
      by the society. Patients with these two illnesses suffer in their personal lives, social
      relations and quality of life. Therefore the current study to further investigate and compare
      and contrast the essence of patients’ quality of life and their related factors.

      The proposed study is a second year study of the two-year study - The quality of life of
      patients with severe illnesses (NSC93-2314-B-002-294). The first year study focused on the
      investigation of the quality of life of patients with HIV infections (NSC93-2314-B-002-294).
      The aim of this proposed study is to compare and contrast the quality of life and its related
      factors of patients with schizophrenia and HIV infections. The contributions of this study
      include the in-depth understandings of quality of life of patients with HIV infections and
      schizophrenia and the comparison of quality of life of different illnesses. The results serve
      as the foundations in future development of intervention programs to enhance patients’
      quality of life and cost-effectiveness analyses.
