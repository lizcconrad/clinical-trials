  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the changes of cardiorespiratory fitness and left
      ventricular function in type 2 diabetes after uncomplicated coronary artery bypass graft
      (CABG) surgery.

      We hypothesize that exercise capacity, left ventricular diastolic function, and biochemical
      data improves after 12-wk exercise training in patients with type 2 diabetes underwent CABG.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus have higher incidence of coronary artery disease or
      left ventricular dysfunction, particularly diastolic dysfunction. Coronary artery bypass
      surgery is known to decrease the mortality rate in diabetes. Further exercise training can
      improve their cardiorespiratory fitness and the control of risk factors in these patients.
      However, the extent of improvement and the mechanism, especially the changes in left
      ventricular function, in diabetes after exercise training have not been fully explored.

      Subjects will be assigned to the intervention or control group by randomization. Subjects in
      the intervention group will receive 60% VO2 max moderate aerobic exercise training, twice per
      week under supervision and three times per week at home, for 12 weeks. All subjects receive
      left ventricular function test by echocardiography and impedance cardiography, graded maximal
      exercise test, and biochemical analyses of sugar and lipid before and after 12 weeks. Their
      dietary intake and physical activity will be inquired every 4 weeks by questionnaires.

    <description>Heart rate (HR) and stroke volume (SV) were collected at rest, during the exercise test, and during the recovery phase by a noninvasive bioimpedance cardiograph device (PhysioFlow PF-05, Manatec Biomedical, Paris, France). Cardiac output (CO) and arteriovenous oxygen difference ((a-v)O2 difference) were then determined by the following equations: CO=HR*SV and (a-v)O2 difference=VO2/SV*HR</description>
