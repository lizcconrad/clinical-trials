  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to examine the effect of an intervention to improve walking based
      on motor learning (skill-based) compared to the usual intervention (strength, flexibility and
      balance-based) on clinical, psychological and laboratory measures of walking and balance of
      older adults with mobility disability (walking problems).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While therapeutic exercise to improve mobility and balance appears to improve physical
      performance and may reduce falls, less is known about the responsiveness to specific
      interventions or the relation between response to intervention and the underlying problems or
      impairments. Therapeutic approaches for improving mobility and reducing fall risk are
      heterogeneous, but do not consistently focus on problem solving as a method of enhancing
      motor control or skill, an approach that has been found to be important for motor learning in
      animal models.

      This two-year pilot study will allows us to compare the clinical, psychological and
      laboratory outcomes after a motor-learning based and an impairment-targeted exercise
      intervention to improve walking in older adults. All subjects will participate in pre and
      post intervention testing and a 12 week exercise intervention for gait involving either a
      motor learning (skill enhancement) or impairment-targeted (lower extremity strengthening,
      flexibility and gait cues).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  65 years of age and older

          -  Ambulatory (with or without a straight cane, and without the assistance of another
             person)

          -  Have written approval/clearance of their physician to participate in low to moderate
             intensity, supervised exercise as is characteristic of the interventions for improving
             gait.

          -  Difficulty with walking or balance as indicated by the following two criteria during
             baseline testing:

               -  mild to moderate slowing of walking speed (walking speed ≥ .6m/s and ≤ 1.0m/s)
                  and,

               -  gait variability (step length coefficient of variability, CV &gt; 4.5%, or step
                  width CV &lt; 7% or &gt; 30%)
