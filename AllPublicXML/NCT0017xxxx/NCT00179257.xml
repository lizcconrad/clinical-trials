  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this is to determine the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of sertraline in
      patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) who have shown inadequate response ot
      escitalopram.

      Eight week open-label flexible dose trial in adult outpatients diagnosed with Major
      Depressive Disorder (MDD) who have had a prior failure with escitalopram. Failure is
      operationally defined as either premature discontinuation because of side effects or the
      report of an incomplete response to escitalopram, minimum dose 10mg/day, maintain for 3 weeks
      or more. 10mg/day was chosen because 1) it is the most commonly prescribed single dose of
      escitalopram in clinical practice, 2) it is equivalent to approx. 30mg/day of arcemic
      citalopram and 3) escitalopram has very high potency at the serotonin transporter (Ki=1.1);
      this means that escitalopram would be expected to saturate the transporter at relatively low
      doses. A total of twenty patients will be treated.
