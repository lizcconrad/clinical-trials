      Primary objectives:

        -  To compare the disease free survival (DFS) in patients treated with the sequential
           epidoxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) regimen to that
           in patients treated with the same treatment plus docetaxel given sequentially after
           epidoxorubicin

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To compare the DFS in patients treated with the sequential epidoxorubicin, docetaxel and
           CMF (only patients with &gt; or = 4 lymph nodes) regimen to that in patients treated with
           sequential intensified epidoxorubicin/docetaxel/high dose (HD) cyclophosphamide regimen

        -  To evaluate the overall survival in each arm

        -  To evaluate the tolerability of a sequential intensified
           epidoxorubicin/docetaxel/HD-cyclophosphamide (arm C)

        -  To compare the safety of a sequential epidoxorubicin/docetaxel/CMF (arm B) regimen
           versus a standard sequential epidoxorubicin/CMF regimen (arm A)

             nodes showing evidence of tumor among a minimum of 10 resected lymph nodes (American
             Joint Committee on Cancer 1992 pathologic staging pT1-4, pN1-2 [at least 1/10], M0)

          -  Ages ≥ 18 years and ≤ 70 years for patients who will be randomized to arm A and B.

             of invasive adenocarcinoma and ductal carcinoma in situ. Lobular carcinoma in situ
