  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the molecular (nitric oxide) and biochemical
      (epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol and ACTH) parameters that are associated with RR
      elicitation and which may counteract the effects of acute stress in the elderly.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>A primary goal of this study is to quantify the magnitude of relaxation response elicitation by comparing oxygen consumption during rest versus during elicitation of the relaxation response in a sample of healthy older adults.</measure>

  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>A second area of interest is the relationship between exhaled levels of nitric oxide (NO) and oxygen consumption (VO2) during relaxation response elicitation.</measure>
