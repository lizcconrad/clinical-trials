    <textblock>
      A Phase 3 Study comparing 80 mg, 120 mg or 240 mg of febuxostat, allopurinol (300 mg for
      those with normal renal function and 100 mg for those with impaired renal function) and
      placebo administered once daily in subjects with gout.

      Subjects will receive treatment for 28 weeks.

    <measure>Percentage of Subjects Whose Last Three Serum Urate Levels Are &lt;6.0 Milligram Per Deciliter (mg/dL).</measure>
    <time_frame>Last 3 visits (any last 3 visits up to week 28)</time_frame>
    <description>Each subject's serum urate at the last 3 visits determined the subject's response for the primary efficacy variable. A subject who prematurely discontinued without least 3 postbaseline serum urate levels was considered a nonresponder; if at least 3 serum urate were obtained postbaseline, those 3 visits were used. The last 3 visits used may have differed for each subject.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 28</time_frame>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Final Visit (up to 28 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The percent change in serum urate from baseline to the Final visit was summarized. The percent change in serum urate was calculated as [(Final visit - baseline levels)/baseline]*100.

    <measure>Percent Change in Primary Tophus Size at Week 28, as Determined by Physical Measurement in the Subset of Subjects With Palpable Tophi at the Screening Visit.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>The percent change from baseline in primary tophus size as determined by physical measurement was calculated as [(Week 28 - baseline sizes)/baseline]*100 for the subset of subjects with a primary palpable tophus at the Screening Visit. If the primary tophus was no longer palpable at the Week 28 visit, the size was assumed to be zero.</description>

    <description>Percent change in primary tophus size was calculated as [(Final Visit - baseline sizes)/baseline]*100 for the subset of subjects with a primary palpable tophus at Screening. If tophus was not palpable at Final visit, the size was assumed to be 0. The timing of the final visit may have differed for each subject.</description>

    <measure>Change in the Total Number of Tophi at Week 28 in the Subset of Subjects With Palpable Tophi at the Screening Visit.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline at Week 28 in the total number of tophi per subject was calculated for the subset of subjects with palpable tophi at the Screening Visit. If the tophi were not palpable at the Week 28 visit, the total count was assumed to be 0.</description>
