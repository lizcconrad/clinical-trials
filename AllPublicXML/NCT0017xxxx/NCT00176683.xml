  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess if capnography can be utilized to assist in the
      process of endotracheal intubation; specifically, in locating the glottic opening. Ultimately
      this would result in a new use of capnography to aid in securing normal and difficult
      airways. Currently capnography is only utilized for the confirmation of endotracheal tube
      placement.

      If successful, this study will provide information, and allow for the development of
      instrumentation that will assist in difficult airway management; specifically, in locating
      the glottic opening when visualization may be impaired. Ultimately, this technique will be
      useful for routine and emergency airway management.
