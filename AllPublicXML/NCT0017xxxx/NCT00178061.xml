      The major aim of this proposal is to examine the impact of comorbid personality disorder on
      the outcome of treatment among patients with bipolar I disorder.

      The specific aims are to create a research and supervisory team and to identify potential
      moderators of treatment response and mediators of outcome over the course of treatment.

      Members of the team will meet weekly to begin a treatment development process for enhancing
      Interpersonal Social Rhythm Therapy (IPSRT) for these patients. Additional assessment
      measures will be utilized to examine the proposed mediators and moderators of treatment.
