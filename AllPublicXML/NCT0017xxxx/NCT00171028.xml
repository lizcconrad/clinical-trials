    <textblock>
      Drugs used to treat hypertension in adults should also be effective in treating high blood
      pressure in infants and children. This study will test the safety and efficacy of valsartan
      in lowering blood pressure in children 1 - 5 years old whose parents grant permission to
      participate.
