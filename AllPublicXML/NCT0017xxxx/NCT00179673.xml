    <textblock>
      Participants who qualify will receive lenalidomide daily on days 1-21 of every 28 day cycle.
      Treatment will continue for up to 52 weeks or until disease progression; participants who
      achieve a complete response (CR) will receive an additional 2 cycles of treatment prior to
      discontinuation. Participants will be followed for progression free survival following
      discontinuation from the treatment phase

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants who qualified for enrollment into the study entered the treatment phase and
      received single-agent lenalidomide 25 mg once daily on Days 1 to 21 of every 28-day cycle.
      The treatment phase began on Day 1 of Cycle 1. Study visits were scheduled to occur every 28
      days to coincide with the beginning of a new cycle. The start date of a new cycle was delayed
      if adverse events (AEs) occurred, in which case the visit date for the start of the following
      cycle was scheduled 28 days after the actual start date of the delayed cycle. Efficacy and
      safety assessments, including complete blood counts (CBCs) were performed at least every 2
      weeks during Cycles 1 to 4 of the treatment phase. Participants continued in the treatment
      phase of the study for up to 52 weeks or until disease progression developed, lenalidomide
      treatment was discontinued for any reason, or the study was terminated.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Response</measure>
    <time_frame>From enrollment through study completion. Median duration on study was 4.4 months with a maximum of 32 months</time_frame>
    <description>Response was defined as participants with a complete response (CR), unconfirmed complete response (Cru) or partial response (PR), assessed using the International Workshop Lymphoma Response Criteria (IWLRC) and based on best responses as determined by the investigator. CR: Complete disappearance of all detectable clinical and radiographic evidence of disease, disappearance of any disease-related symptoms, and normalization of biochemical abnormalities.
Cru: Criteria for CR above but with 1 or more of the following:
A residual lymph node mass &gt; 1.5 cm in greatest transverse diameter that has regressed by more than 75% in the sum of the products of diameters (SPD)
Indeterminate bone marrow (increased number or size of aggregates without cytologic or architectural atypia).
PR: ≥ 50% decrease in SPD of the 6 largest dominant nodes or nodal masses. No increase in the size of other nodes, liver, or spleen. Splenic and hepatic nodules must regress by at least 50% in the SPD.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Tumor Control</measure>
    <time_frame>From enrollment through study completion. Median duration on study was 4.4 months with a maximum of 32 months</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor control was defined as participants with a complete response, unconfirmed complete response, partial response or stable disease (SD), assessed using the International Workshop Lymphoma Response Criteria (IWLRC) and based on best responses as determined by the investigator.
SD was defined as a response less than a PR (see above) but not Progressive Disease (PD).
PD was defined as
≥ 50 % increase from nadir in the SPD of any previously identified abnormal node for partial responders or non-responders.
Appearance of any new lesion during or at the end of therapy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Duration of Response</measure>
    <time_frame>From enrollment through study completion. Median duration on study was 4.4 months with a maximum of 32 months</time_frame>
    <description>The duration of response was calculated as the first response assessment demonstrating evidence of at least a partial response to the first documentation of progressive disease (as determined by computed tomography scan) or death due to NHL, whichever occurred first. For participants without documentation of progression, the duration of response was censored at the last date of tumor assessment indicating no progression. Median was based on the Kaplan-Meier estimate.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From enrollment through study completion. Median duration on study was 4.4 months with a maximum of 32 months</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival was defined as the time from the start of study drug therapy to the first observation of disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever came first. Participants who withdrew for any reason or received another NHL therapy including stem cell transplantation without documented progressive disease were censored on the date of their last adequate response assessment indicating no progression (or last adequate assessment prior to receiving other NHL therapy). Participants who were still active without progressive disease at the time of the data cut-off date were censored on the date of their last adequate response assessment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the start of study drug through 30 days after the last dose of study drug. Maximum time on study drug was 13.8 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The Investigator determined the relationship between the administration of study drug and the occurrence of an AE as suspected if the temporal relationship of the adverse event to study drug administration made a causal relationship possible, and other drugs, therapeutic interventions, or underlying conditions did not provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event.
The Investigator graded the severity of AEs according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) criteria and the following scale:
Grade 1 = Mild
Grade 2 = Moderate
Grade 3 = Severe
Grade 4 = Life threatening
Grade 5 = Death
A Serious AE is defined as any AE which results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or constitutes an important medical event.</description>

          <title>International Prognostic Index (IPI)]</title>
          <description>A clinical tool to aid in predicting the prognosis of patients with NHL. One point is assigned for each of the following risk factors:
Age greater than 60 years
Stage III or IV disease
Elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase
ECOG performance status of 2, 3, or 4
1 extranodal site
The sum of the points allotted correlates with the following risk groups:
Low risk (0-1 points): 5-year survival of 73%; Low-intermediate risk (2 points): 5-year survival of 51%; High-intermediate risk (3 points): 5-year survival of 43%; High risk (4-5 points): 5-year survival of 26%.</description>

        <description>Response was defined as participants with a complete response (CR), unconfirmed complete response (Cru) or partial response (PR), assessed using the International Workshop Lymphoma Response Criteria (IWLRC) and based on best responses as determined by the investigator. CR: Complete disappearance of all detectable clinical and radiographic evidence of disease, disappearance of any disease-related symptoms, and normalization of biochemical abnormalities.
Cru: Criteria for CR above but with 1 or more of the following:
A residual lymph node mass &gt; 1.5 cm in greatest transverse diameter that has regressed by more than 75% in the sum of the products of diameters (SPD)
Indeterminate bone marrow (increased number or size of aggregates without cytologic or architectural atypia).
PR: ≥ 50% decrease in SPD of the 6 largest dominant nodes or nodal masses. No increase in the size of other nodes, liver, or spleen. Splenic and hepatic nodules must regress by at least 50% in the SPD.</description>

The Investigator graded the severity of AEs according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) criteria and the following scale:
Grade 1 = Mild
Grade 2 = Moderate
Grade 3 = Severe
Grade 4 = Life threatening
Grade 5 = Death
A Serious AE is defined as any AE which results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or constitutes an important medical event.</description>
