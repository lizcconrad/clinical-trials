    <textblock>
      This study examined the cognitive and behavioral differences in children who have an autism
      spectrum disorder (ASD) with or without additional symptoms of ADHD. The study also examined
      the effectiveness of a range of doses of methylphenidate in improving cognitive and
      behavioral outcomes in children with both ASD and ADHD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a major comorbid psychiatric disorder in
      children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) that significantly undermines behavioral,
      social, and emotional adjustment. Although the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
      Disorders (DSM-IV) does not specifically allow for a comorbid diagnosis of ADHD with ASD,
      many children with an ASD manifest symptoms of ADHD and are treated for it with stimulants or
      other medication. The few studies on ADHD in ASD have not consistently established its
      cognitive and behavioral manifestations, or the optimal parameters for treatment. The
      proposed project will address these issues through studies of cognitive and behavioral
      functioning in children with ASD, with and without ADHD, and through a study of medication
      treatment of ADHD symptoms in autism.

      Participants between the ages of 7 to 12 with an autism spectrum disorder participated in the
      initial phase of the study to examine the nature and effects of ADHD symptoms on behavioral
      and cognitive functioning. Participants underwent an initial psychological testing session
      that included standardized measures of intellectual, adaptive behavior, language, behavioral,
      and emotional functioning, along with standardized diagnostic measures to confirm their
      diagnoses of ASD and/or ADHD (Visit 1). Children with intelligence quotients (IQs) below 50
      or greater than 130 or with major sensory, motor, neurological, genetic, or psychiatric
      disorders that may interfere with testing were be excluded. The participants who meet
      eligibility criteria completed computerized tasks of attentional functioning in a second
      visit (Visit 2).

      A subset of the children meeting criteria for the ASD/ADHD group (N=24) participated in a
      six-week randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment trial using various doses
      (low, medium, or high dose) of methylphenidate (MPH). Children participated in the treatment
      trial will be those who qualified based on the initial phase and who do not have any physical
      contraindications to MPH (e.g., history of MPH intolerance). In each week of the treatment
      trial, the children took one of the three doses of MPH or a placebo. At the end of each week
      the child were evaluated in the clinic by including a medical check-up, parent interviews
      about the child's behavior and functioning that week, and computerized cognitive testing.
      Additionally, the child's parent and teacher completed questionnaires about the child's
      behavior each week, so that the child's home and school behaviors at each MPH dose could be
      assessed.

    <measure>Mean Conners' Teacher ADHD Index T Score by Dose</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at each dosing week of the drug trial (placebo, low, medium, high)</time_frame>
    <description>The ADHD Index of the Conners' Teacher Rating Scale-Revised (CTRS-R) assesses symptoms associated with ADHD, including inattentiveness, hyperactivity and impulsivity. Lower T-scores on this subscale are associated with milder ADHD symptoms. T-scores have a mean of 50 and a SD of 10. Thus, T-scores of 70+ (i.e., 2 SD's over the mean) on the ADHD Index are suggestive of very significant ADHD symptomatology. Treatment-related changes of 5+ points are considered to be significant.</description>

    <description>CPT is a measure of sustained attention using nonverbal stimuli (pictures). Participants are asked to click on the witch (target), which appears for 25% of the trials. Commission errors are measured by number of times they click for the non-target items.</description>

        <title>Mean Conners' Teacher ADHD Index T Score by Dose</title>
        <description>The ADHD Index of the Conners' Teacher Rating Scale-Revised (CTRS-R) assesses symptoms associated with ADHD, including inattentiveness, hyperactivity and impulsivity. Lower T-scores on this subscale are associated with milder ADHD symptoms. T-scores have a mean of 50 and a SD of 10. Thus, T-scores of 70+ (i.e., 2 SD's over the mean) on the ADHD Index are suggestive of very significant ADHD symptomatology. Treatment-related changes of 5+ points are considered to be significant.</description>
