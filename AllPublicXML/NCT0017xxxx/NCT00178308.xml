  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to evaluate an automated, laser-based technique for measuring
      DNA damge resulting from radiation. We want to use controlled exposure on cancer patients to
      help develop a measurement to test people who may have been accidentally exposed to
      radiation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female, age 21 to 70 years old.

          -  Patient undergoing with anti-neoplastic agent(s) known to have genotoxic activity
             (e.g., cyclophosphamide, 5-FU, cisplatin, Ara-C.

          -  X-irradiation may be considered, so long as a substantial fraction of red marrow is
             exposed (e.g., femur or chest/trunk region);

          -  treatment could be ongoing therapy or initial therapy.
