      This study will determine the MDT of intravenous DTIC when administered in combination with a
      fixed dose of oral lenalidomide in subjects with metastatic malignant melanoma previously
      untreated with systemic chemotherapy. This study will evaluate the safety and preliminary
      efficacy of the combination of lenalidomide and DTIC. Subjects will be receive lenalidomide
      for 14 consecutive days and DTIC on day one of each 21 day cycle.

             skin patch or vasectomized partner) while on study drug

          9. All acute adverse effects (excluding alopecia of any prior therapy must have resolved
