  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to assess the causes and impact of acute respiratory illness (common
      colds, flu, bronchitis, pneumonia) in adults age 65 and older. One of the ways to determine
      the virus causing a particular illness is to get a blood specimen when a person is sick and
      again later and look for the body's specific responses that identify the virus. Approximately
      3000 subjects will be evaluated and their medical records assessed for details of recent
      illness and general health to help in understanding the subjects' current illness.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the role of respiratory viruses in the etiology of
      medically attended acute respiratory illness in elderly populations and to assess the impact
      of these illnesses. Ambulatory elders presenting for health care with an acute respiratory
      illness will be recruited. Nose and throat swab specimens will be collected to test for one
      of the respiratory viruses, and acute and convalescent blood specimens will be collected to
      test for increases in specific antibody. Specimens will be collected within seven days of the
      onset of illness and then 1 month later for comparison specimens. A brief questionnaire will
      accompany the specimens, and more complete data on the illness and consequences will be
      obtained from the medical record. The pattern of illnesses by virus and their severity and
      duration will be determined.
