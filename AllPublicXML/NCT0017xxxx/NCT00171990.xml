    <textblock>
      This is a phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study to compare
      the efficacy and safety of a two-day treatment with famciclovir (500 mg loading dose followed
      by 250 mg 12-hourly) to standard five-day treatment with famciclovir (125 mg 12-hourly) in
      patients with active recurrent genital herpes.

      This study is not recruiting patients in the United States.
