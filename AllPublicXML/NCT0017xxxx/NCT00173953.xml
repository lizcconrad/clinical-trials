    <textblock>
      The aims of this study are 1) to determine the cytokines produced by both Th1 and Th2 subsets
      in gastric antral biopsy specimens from Taiwanese patients before and after anti H. pylori
      therapy; 2) to obtain a detailed phenotypic characterization and distribution pattern of
      mucosal lymphocytes in H. pylori-associated gastritis and to define possible contributing
      immune mechanisms responsible for the chronicity of the disease and its associated lesions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Helicobacter pylori, a Gram-negative spiral bacterium, has been first isolated from a patient
      with chronic active gastritis since 1982. Recent studies strongly suggest that chronic
      infection with H. pylori is tightly associated with chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer, and
      gastric carcinoma. However, only a minority of infected people develop signs and symptoms of
      gastric pathology. Thus, both host and microbial factors may lead to different outcomes of
      infection. In spite of high prevalence in general population and increasing clinical
      attention has been paid on this infection, the knowledge of pathogenic mechanism of H. pylori
      infection is still limited and little is known about the role of host immune response in the
      pathogenesis of disease.The aims of this study are 1) to determine the cytokines produced by
      both Th1 and Th2 subsets in gastric antral biopsy specimens from Taiwanese patients before
      and after anti H. pylori therapy; 2) to obtain a detailed phenotypic characterization and
      distribution pattern of mucosal lymphocytes in H. pylori-associated gastritis and to define
      possible contributing immune mechanisms responsible for the chronicity of the disease and its
      associated lesions.
