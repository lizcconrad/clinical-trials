  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glutamine is considered a conditionally essential amino acid during critical illness. After
      severe trauma, glutamine supplementation into the gastrointestinal tract may help maintain
      bowel function. We hypothesize that for the major torso trauma patient, high dose glutamine
      given enterally during resuscitation from shock and continued during enteral nutrition
      support is absorbed, available systemically and preserves gut integrity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective, randomized, controlled trial of patients with major torso trauma,
      high-dose enteral glutamine and enteral nutrition will be given to research subjects while
      controls will receive isocaloric, isonitrogenous enteral support. Enteral tolerance, bowel
      integrity and permeability will be evaluated. The systemic appearance of glutamine will be
      measured.
