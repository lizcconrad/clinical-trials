  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are to:

      I. Characterize the plasma concentration-time profile of cefepime in liver transplant
      patients to determine the pharmacokinetic parameters in this patient population.

      II. Perform stochastic modeling using the population pharmacokinetic parameters obtained in
      Specific Aim I to determine the ideal dose and dosing regimen of cefepime required to attain
      predetermined therapeutic targets in liver transplant patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of cefepime in liver transplant patients at conventional doses used for other patient
      populations leads to non-optimal drug exposure among liver transplant patients. Furthermore,
      using serum creatinine as a method of estimating creatinine clearance is not the optimal way
      to determine the best cefepime dose. The consequence of this non-optimal exposure is the
      unattainability of therapeutic targets. These therapeutic targets are correlated with
      positive microbiologic outcome and clinical cure.

      All biologic samples will be under the control of the principal investigator of this research
      project. To protect confidentiality, all personal identifiers will be removed and replaced
      with a specific code number. The information linking these code numbers to the corresponding
      subjects' identities will be kept in a separate, secure location. The investigators on this
      study will keep the samples indefinitely. All samples will be provided to investigators not
      associated with the study without any identifiers and only contain a code number. If a
      subject withdraws samples collected and not already processed will be destroyed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women and members of minority groups will be included in this study. However, as this
             study seeks to generate pilot data, there will be no specific statistical analysis
             comparing differences based on gender or race.

          -  Subjects receiving drugs known to induce or inhibit hepatic enzymes are not excluded
             from this study as cefepime is renally eliminated and not significantly metabolized by
             the liver.

          -  All liver transplant subjects are eligible for enrollment in this study, including
             subjects who have undergone a living related liver transplant.

          -  The pharmacokinetics of cefepime in children are significantly different from those of
             adults. For the purposes of this study only adults (aged &gt; 18 years old) will be able
             to participate.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects will be excluded if they are anemic (hemoglobin &lt; 7 mg/dl), or are patients
             with severe gastrointestinal bleeding who are receiving packed red blood cells.

          -  Subjects who are receiving hemodialysis or other forms of renal replacement therapy
             (such as continuous veno-venous hemofiltration), or patients with a calculated
             creatinine clearance of &lt; 10 ml/min will be excluded from the study.
