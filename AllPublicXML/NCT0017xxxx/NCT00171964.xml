  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is the aim of this multicentric clinical study to assess the efficacy and tolerability of
      zoledronic acid in combination with radiotherapy in patients with advanced osteolytic bone
      lesions in terms of the reduction of pain and analgesic consumption.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of at least one cancer-related bone lesion in cancer patients, confirmed by
             X-ray, MRT or computer tomography

          -  Severity of pain ≥ 5 on item 3 of the BPI which is caused by the bone lesion(s) and
             requires radiotherapy

          -  Adequate liver function - serum total bilirubin concentration less than 1.5 x the
             upper limit of normal value

          -  Expected survival time ≥ 6 months

          -  If the patient is of child-bearing potential: negative pregnancy test at screening

          -  ECOG performance status of 0, 1 or 2.

          -  Written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior treatment with an oral bisphosphonate for more than 3 months or more than 3
             intravenous (i.v.) bisphosphonate applications

          -  Bisphosphonate treatment within 6 months before study start

          -  Previous radiotherapy of the painful areas to be irradiated. An initiation of
             radiotherapy for the target area(s) up to 3 days at maximum prior to the first
             infusion is allowed.

          -  Skeleton-related complications (e.g., pathological fractures, orthopedic intervention
             to treat or stabilize an osteolytic defect, spinal cord compression) during the last 3
             weeks prior to the first infusion of trial medication.

          -  Initiation of a new chemotherapeutic treatment regimen during the last 2 weeks prior
             to the first infusion of trial medication

          -  Abnormal renal function as evidenced by a calculated creatinine clearance &lt; 30
             ml/minute. Creatinine clearance (CrCl) is calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault
             formula: CrCl = [140-age (years)] x weight (kg) {x 0.85 for female patients} [72 x
             serum creatinine (mg/dL)]

          -  Corrected (adjusted for serum albumin) serum calcium concentration &lt; 8.0 mg/dl (2.00
             mmol/L) or ≥ 12.0 mg/dl (3.00 mmol/L).

          -  Patients with clinically symptomatic brain metastases

          -  History of diseases with influence on bone metabolism such as Paget's disease and
             primary hyperparathyroidism

          -  Pregnancy and lactation

          -  Women of childbearing potential not on a medically recognized form of contraception
             (i.e., oral contraceptives or implants, intrauterine device [IUD], vaginal diaphragm
             or sponge, or condom with spermicide)

          -  Current active dental problems including infection of the teeth or jawbone (maxilla or
             mandibular); dental or fixture trauma, or a current or prior diagnosis of
             osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), of exposed bone in the mouth, or of slow healing after
             dental procedures.

          -  Recent (within 6 weeks) or planned dental or jaw surgery (e.g. extraction, implants)

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.
