      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of
      extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) in the treatment of steroid-refractory acute
      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in children.

    <intervention_name>Extracorporeal Photopheresis</intervention_name>
    <description>ECP will be performed using the UVAR® XTS™ photopheresis system (Therakos). Whole blood is drawn and separated by centrifuge to collect the buffy coat (lymphocyte solution). Methoxsalen (8-MOP) is added to the blood, and the final solution of cells is passed as a film, 1mm thick, through a disposable plastic device, exposed to a UVA light source (2J/cm2/cell) and then returned to the patient.
ECP will be performed weekly on 2 consecutive days for 4 weeks. After 4 weeks the interval will be prolonged to every 2 weeks and ECP will be stopped after maximal response has been maintained for 2 weeks. The actual study finishes at d56 but ECP may be continued beyond that (off-study) at the discretion of the physician.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Status-post allogeneic stem cell transplant (includes cord blood transplant,
             matched-unrelated-donor transplant and matched-related donor transplant) for any
             indication.

          -  HLA matching needs to be 4-6/6 by at least intermediate resolution for class I + II
             for cord blood and 5-6/6 for matched related or matched unrelated donors.

          -  Diagnosis of grade II-IV acute GVHD with histological confirmation of at least one
             organ (skin, gut, or liver) within the last 14 days. Grading of acute GVHD is per the
             standard Keystone criteria. Prior to enrollment, efforts should be made to rule out
             diagnoses that may mimic GVHD, such as drug rashes or GI infection. Patients that are
             being treated for acute GVHD and appear to be progressing to chronic GVHD are also
             eligible

          -  No improvement, or worsening, of acute GVHD after at least 4 days of IV
             methylprednisolone dosed at, at least 2.0mg/kg/day..

          -  Weight &gt;25.0kg.

          -  Adequate venous access.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of veno-occlusive disease.

          -  Intubated patient.

          -  Patient receiving dialysis.

          -  Age &gt; 30.

          -  Total bilirubin &gt;15mg/dL
