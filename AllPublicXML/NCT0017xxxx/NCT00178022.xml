  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aims of this project are to examine the feasibility and relative efficacy of two
      models of on-line intervention for families of children with traumatic brain injury: one, a
      model emphasizing cognitive appraisals and problem solving skills; the other, emphasizing
      linking families to resources and providing professionally-moderated peer support.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The feasibility of the two interventions will be evaluated by examining family utilization of
      on-line materials and satisfaction with receiving services this way. Previous studies suggest
      the longer-term effects of TBI often create significant stress for both child and family and
      the need for psychological services.
