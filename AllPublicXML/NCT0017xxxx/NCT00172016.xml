        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written informed consent must be obtained

          -  Current (or previous) objective evidence of metastatic disease to the bone

          -  Currently receiving 1st line hormonal therapy with LHRH agonists or other hormonal
             treatments

          -  ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with abnormal renal function as evidenced by either a serum creatinine
             determination 1.5 x or greater above the upper limit of normal or by a calculated
             creatinine clearance of 60 ml/minute or less

          -  Corrected (adjusted for serum albumin) serum calcium concentration &lt; 8.0 mg/dl (2.00
             mmol/L)

          -  Liver function tests &gt;2.5 ULN, serum creatinine &gt;1.5 ULN.

          -  Patients with another nonmalignant disease which would confound the evaluation of
             primary endpoints or prevent the patient complying with the protocol.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to zoledronic acid or other bisphosphonates

          -  Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, are unlikely to cooperate fully
             during the study
