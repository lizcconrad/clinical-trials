      There is an increasing incidence of overweight children in Germany, due to a lack of physical
      activity.

      The aim of this study is to improve physical fitness and activity in school children. Two

      The increasing incidence of overweight children in Germany is due to a lack of physical
      activity and intake of unhealthy food. The importance of physical activity for the prevention
      of cardiovascular diseases in adults was shown in several trials. Therefore we provide
      additional sport lessons over the period of one year in two defined schools in Leipzig with
      the aim to improve physical fitness in school children. Two other classes with the -in
      germany- usual quantity of sport classes served as control classes.

      In all classes at the beginning and at the end of the school year blood samples were taken,
      and a clinical investigation, a coordination test for children and a spiroergometer were
      performed. Additionally each child had to fill out a questionnaire.

      Endurance training is emphasized in the sport lessons.
