      This study is being done to find out the good and bad effects of an investigational drug that
      is not approved for sale, called AG-013736. Tumors need blood vessels in order to continue to
      grow, and AG-013736 is thought to work by playing a role in preventing new blood vessels from
      growing. We want to see if AG-013736 has any effect on your disease by making your tumor
      smaller and if so, for how long. We also want to test the safety [the effect on your body] of
      AG-013736 and to measure the amount of AG-013736 that gets into your blood. AG-013736 has
      been given to over 140 patients with cancer on other studies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The American Cancer Society estimates that there will be about 23,600 new cases of thyroid
      cancer (5,960 in men and 17,640 in women) annually in the United States, and about 1,460
      people (620 men and 840 women) will die from this disease.1 It is the most common malignancy
      of the endocrine system. Depending upon type and stage, thyroid cancer may be treated with
      surgery, radioactive iodine (131I), hormone treatment, external radiation, or chemotherapy.

      The systemic therapy of metastatic disease remains palliative until new agents are found that
      might afford a better prognosis. Thyroid tumors are often vascular, and a decrease in the
      number of blood vessels that supply the tumor may starve it of needed nutrients. An approach
      to blocking the growth of blood vessels that supply the tumor is to inhibit the VEGF receptor
      tyrosine kinase (VEGFR TK) signaling pathway. The VEGFR TK inhibitor SU011248 has produced 4
      objective responses in 15 patients receiving the drug on Phase 1 studies.2 AG-013736 is
      another VEGFR TK inhibitor. Besides having potential anti-angiogenesis properties through
      VEGFR TK inhibition, it also has additional potential antitumor through platelet derived
      growth factor receptor (PDGFR) TK inhibition.

        Inclusion Criteria

        To be eligible for the study, subjects must satisfy all the following criteria:

          1. Histologically documented thyroid cancer with metastases.

          2. Failure of 131I to control the disease or 131I is not an appropriate therapy (eg, due
             to lack of iodine uptake by the tumor).

          3. No expectation of further effects of prior anticancer therapy.

          4. At least 1 target lesion, as defined by RECIST (Appendix C), that has not been
             irradiated. New lesions that have developed in a previously irradiated field may be
             used as sites of measurable disease assuming all other criteria are met. All target
             lesions must have a unidimensional diameter of at least 2 cm. (1 cm is acceptable for
             spiral CT scans if the reconstruction algorithm is 0.5 cm). Baseline
             measurements/evaluations must be completed within 4 weeks prior to treatment.

          5. Adequate bone marrow, hepatic, and renal function documented within 14 days prior to
             treatment as documented by:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC, calculated as the absolute number of neutrophils
                  and bands) ≥1.5 x 109 cells/L

               -  Platelets ≥100 x 109 cells /L

               -  AST and ALT ≤2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN), unless there are liver metastases
                  in which case AST and ALT ≤5.0 x ULN

               -  Total bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN

               -  Serum creatinine ≤1.5 x ULN or calculated creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min

               -  Urinary protein &lt;2+ by urine dipstick. If dipstick is ≥2+ then a 24-hour urine
                  collection can be done and the patient may enter only if urinary protein is &lt;2 g
                  per 24 hours

          6. Age ≥18 years.

          7. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 (see Appendix D)

          8. No evidence of preexisting uncontrolled hypertension as documented by 2 baseline blood
             pressure readings taken at least 1 hour apart. The baseline systolic blood pressure
             readings must be ≤140, and the baseline diastolic blood pressure readings must be ≤90.
             Patients whose hypertension is controlled by antihypertensive therapies are eligible.

          9. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test
             within 7 days prior to treatment.

         10. Written and voluntary informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Subjects with one or more of the following criteria are ineligible for this study:

          1. Central lung lesions involving major blood vessels (arteries or veins). (Central
             lesions that maintain the structural integrity of vessels have the potential to bleed
             if the tumor lesion undergoes necrosis. MRI or CT angiography should be used in any
             case where there is any question as to whether blood vessels are involved.)

          2. History of hemoptysis

          3. Gastrointestinal abnormalities including:

               -  inability to take oral medication

               -  requirement for intravenous alimentation

               -  prior surgical procedures affecting absorption including gastric resection

               -  treatment for active peptic ulcer disease in the past 6 months

               -  active gastrointestinal bleeding, unrelated to cancer, as evidenced by
                  hematemesis, hematochezia or melena in the past 3 months without evidence of
                  resolution documented by endoscopy or colonoscopy.

               -  malabsorption syndromes.

          4. Previous treatment with anti-angiogenesis agents including thalidomide, or inhibitors
             of epidermoid growth factor (EGF), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), or
             fibroblast growth factors (FGF) receptors.

          5. Current use or anticipated inability to avoid use of drugs that are known potent
             CYP3A4 inhibitors (ie, grapefruit juice, verapamil, ketoconazole, miconazole,
             itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ergot derivatives, indinavir, saquinavir,
             ritonavir, nelfinavir, lopinavir, and delavirdine).

          6. Current use or anticipated inability to avoid use of drugs that are known CYP3A4 or
             CYP1A2 inducers (ie, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, felbamate, omeprazole,
             phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone, rifabutin, rifampin, and St. John's wort).

          7. Active seizure disorder or evidence of brain metastases.

          8. A serious uncontrolled medical disorder or active infection that would impair their
             ability to receive study treatment.

          9. History of a malignancy (other than thyroid cancer) except those treated with curative
             intent for skin cancer (other than melanoma) or in situ breast or cervical cancer or
             those treated with curative intent for any other cancer with no evidence of disease
             for 5 years

         10. Major surgical procedure or any radiation therapy within 4 weeks of treatment.

         11. Dementia or significantly altered mental status that would prohibit the understanding
             or rendering of informed consent and compliance with the requirements of this
             protocol.

         12. Patients (male and female) having procreative potential who are not using adequate
             contraception or practicing abstinence

         13. Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding.
