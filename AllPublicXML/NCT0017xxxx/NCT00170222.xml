    <textblock>
      The role of antibiotic therapy in patients with COPD remains controversial. While the outcome
      of several clinical trials is in favour of antibiotics, the quality of these studies in
      insufficient. In this study the efficacy of doxycycline is compared to placebo. All
      concommitant treatment (steroids, bronchodilator therapy, physiotherapy) is standardized.

      The investigators hypothesize that patients with an acute exacerbations will have a better
      outcome when treated with antibiotics.
