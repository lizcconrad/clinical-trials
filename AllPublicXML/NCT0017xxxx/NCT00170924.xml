  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who have had high blood pressure for a long time may have diastolic dysfunction.
      Diastolic Dysfunction is when your heart has difficulty filling and emptying, and relaxing
      adequately.

      This study is to find out if Valsartan) will improve the ability of the heart to fill, empty,
      and relax appropriately when given alone or with other medicines to treat high blood
      pressure.
