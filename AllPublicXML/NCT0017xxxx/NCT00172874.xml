      college students (N=800); 2nd group is clinical eating disorder patients (N=600) and 3rd
      group is age-, sex-matched clinical non-eating disorder patients (N=600). Clinical patients
      are screened by eating disorder module of the SCID and are grouped into eating disorder or
      non-eating disorder group. After written informed consent, eating disorder patients will
      receive clinical assessments which included important clinical characteristics and
      psychopathology of eating disorders by experienced senior psychiatrists. All clinical
      patients are asked to complete the self-rating scales which included eating and general
