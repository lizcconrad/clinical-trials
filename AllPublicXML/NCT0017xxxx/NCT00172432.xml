      Background: Myocardial fibrosis is a major component in cardiac remodeling in patients with
      myocardial infarction or hibernation. However, the association of cardiac fibrosis and
      coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients without infarction or hibernation is still unclear.
      In the present study, we analyzed the relationship between serum concentrations of
      procollagen propeptides and severity of CAD in such patients. Patients and methods: Forty-six
      patients (32 men and 14 woman; mean age 64 years) with chest pain and normal left ventricular
      contractility were enrolled into this study. Myocardial infarction was excluded by history
      and electrocardiograms. All patients received stress thallium-201 single photon emission
      computed tomography (SPECT) and analysis of the serum levels of the aminoterminal propeptide
      of type I and III procollagen (PINP and PIIINP).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  We prospectively studied 46 consecutive patients aged 50 to 75 years (32 men and 14
             women; mean age was 64 years) who were referred for chest pain evaluation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  MI was excluded by history and electrocardiograms. Regional wall motion abnormalities
             and impaired left ventricular contractility (left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 50%)
             were excluded by routine echocardiography.
