  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep disorders are common in patients with end-stage renal disease on both hemodialysis and
      peritoneal dialysis and are associated with significant medical, psychological and social
      disturbances. Numerous factors have been suggested as contributing to or associated with the
      high prevalence of sleep disturbance in this population.

      Increasing evidence suggests that cytokines are involved in the regulation of sleep and
      wakefulness and that the communication between the sleep and the immune system is
      bi-directional. Blood-dialyzer or peritoneum-dialysate interaction during dialysis therapy
      has the potential to activate mononuclear cells leading to production of inflammatory
      cytokines. These cytokines are believed to play a significant role in dialysis-associated
      morbidity and mortality. Nevertheless, a cytokine overproduction may alter sleep pattern in
      chronic dialyzed patients, thus explaining the presence of sleep disorders in these patients.
      In the other way, sleep loss may have effects on immune process and secretion of cytokines in
      chronic dialyzed patients. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between
      quality of sleep and serum cytokine levels in hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients.
