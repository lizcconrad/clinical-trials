      Primary objective:

      The primary study objective is to demonstrate superior efficacy of an intensified insulin
      regimen with insulin glulisine and insulin glargine to a two-injection conventional insulin
      regimen in terms of change in glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), from baseline to endpoint.

      Secondary objectives:

      Secondary study objectives are to compare the intensified insulin regimen with insulin
      glulisine and insulin glargine to a two-injection conventional insulin regimen in terms of
      blood glucose (BG) values (fasting, pre-/postprandial (ppBG), nocturnal, mean daily, fasting
      plasma glucose), daily BG profiles, BG and HbA1c response rates (predefined), hypoglycemic
      events, adverse events, change of late diabetes complications, weight, body-mass-index,
      course of total daily insulin dose and adjustment, blood lipid profile, microalbuminuria,
      standard lab and quality of life/treatment satisfaction.

        Inclusion criteria :

        Subjects meeting all of the following criteria will be considered for enrollment into the
        study:

          -  Type 2 diabetes mellitus, as defined by the American Diabetes Association for at least
             five years, treated with insulin for at least 6 months (no history of ketoacidosis).

          -  HbA1c between 7.5% and 11.0%, inclusive at both pre-screening and pre-randomization
             (week -2).

          -  For at least 3 months prior to week -8 visit, subjects must have been on a stable
             insulin regimen with two daily s.c. injections of premixed insulin: NPH plus regular
             insulin or NPH plus rapid acting insulin (insulin lispro or insulin aspart) in a
             mixture of 70/30 or 75/25. &quot;Stable&quot; means no change in regimen and no more than 30 %
             change in dose. Optionally, the subject can have been treated in addition with
             metformin according to its current official product information leaflet, treatment
             with other oral blood glucose lowering drugs is not allowed.

             or condom with spermicide.

             comply with study protocol requirements.

          -  Willing to change from a twice daily insulin regimen to a regimen requiring four daily
             insulin injections.

          -  Provision of signed and dated informed consent prior to any study
             procedures.&quot;Prescreening&quot; informed consent, obtained in writing for all subjects, may
             be used during screening, but full study-specific informed consent must be obtained in
             writing for all subjects after any post-screening procedures.

        Exclusion criteria :

        Subjects presenting with any of the following will not be included in the study:

          -  Two or more severe hypoglycemic episodes within the past 3 months, or any
             hospitalization or emergency room visit due to poor diabetic control within the past 3

          -  Impaired hepatic function, as shown by, but not limited to, ALAT (SGPT) or ASAT (SGOT)
             above 2x the upper limit of normal as measured at visit 1.

          -  Impaired renal function, as shown by, but not limited to, serum creatinine &gt; 177
             mmol/l (&gt; 2 mg/dl) as measured at visit 1 (if no lower values due to individual
             metformin intake are required) or current renal dialysis.

             panretinal photocoagulation or vitrectomy, in the 6 months prior to visit 1, or any
             other unstable (rapidly progressing) retinopathy that may require surgical treatment
             (including laser photocoagulation) during the study.

          -  History of hypersensitivity to insulin or insulin analogues or any of the excipients
             in the HMR 1964 formulation.
