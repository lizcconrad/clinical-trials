      To correlate the Human Leukocyte Antigen type and genetic defect with hemophilia A.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the most serious complications of treatment in patients with hemophilia A or
      hemophilia B is the development of an inhibitor, which is an antibody that neutralizes the
      factor VIII or IX coagulant activity. Up to one fourth of patients with severe hemophilia A
      develop an inhibitor but at present it is not possible to predict which patients will develop
      such antibody. The ability to predict an inhibitor development at an individual level would
      greatly improve therapeutic approach to this serious problem
