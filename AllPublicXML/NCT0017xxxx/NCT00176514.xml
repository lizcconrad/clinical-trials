      This is a clinical research study that is designed to determine if there is a potential
      benefit of green tea to help treat and prevent therapy induced mucositis, which is mouth
      sores caused by chemotherapy.

      The overall objective of this study is to assess the effect of green tea on reducing the
      incidence or severity of chemotherapy (with or without radiotherapy) induced mucositis in
      patients receiving standard therapy that will produce a very high likelihood of oral,
      esophageal, or gastrointestinal mucositis (e.g. high dose chemotherapy with stem cell
      reconstitution in patients with multiple myeloma; concurrent 5-FU/ cisplatin and radiotherapy
      to the head and neck area; patients receiving paclitaxel).

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Histologically confirmed diagnosis of cancer for which standard chemotherapy will produce a
        very high likelihood of oral, esophageal or gastrointestinal mucositis (e.g. high dose
        chemotherapy with stem cell reconstitution in patients with multiple myeloma; concurrent
        5-FU/ cisplatin and radiotherapy to the head and neck area; patients receiving paclitaxel).
        Patients receiving concurrent chemotherapy/radiation therapy for lung or gastrointestinal
        cancer are eligible.

        If not receiving a highly mucosally toxic regimen, have had Grade 2 mucositis on the prior
        cycle of chemotherapy Have no evidence of active infection in the oral cavity such as
        thrush, HSV, or aphthous ulcers.

        Patients must be free of known infectious stomatitis or systemic infection (culture not
        required). If unclear that the patient has infectious stomatitis, cultures may be obtained
        and the patient entered on study.

        Must be free of Grade 3 or 4 vomiting. Have no contraindication for buccal scrapings. Not
        be a frequent (&gt;3 cups per day) tea drinker Must be able to speak English.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Xerostomia Use of any investigational agent (not FDA approved) Current use of, allopurinol,
        prostaglandin inhibitors, sulcralfate, vitamin E or antioxidant supplements during the
        course of this study.

        Patients receiving an anesthetic &quot;cocktail&quot; regimen or other topical anesthetics.

        Patients with existing oral lesions.
