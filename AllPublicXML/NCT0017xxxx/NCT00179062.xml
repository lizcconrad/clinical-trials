    <textblock>
      This twelve month, open-label study considers the effect of Risperdal (risperidone) versus
      Zyprexa (olanzapine) on weight gain, physical health, and outcome in a population of those
      diagnosed with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, major depression or bipolar disorder
      with psychotic features. This study evaluates symptom response as well as general health
      indicators such as body mass index, glucose, prolactin, and cholesterol levels at baseline,
      month (M)1, M3, M6 and M12.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects must meet all of the following criteria to be eligible for participation in the
        current research study.

          1. Subjects will be males and females between 18-60 years of age

          2. Subjects will have a definite diagnosis by DSM-IV criteria of schizophrenia,
             schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder or major depression with psychotic
             symptoms.

          3. Subjects may be outpatients or inpatients at the time of entry. They will continue in
             the study if hospitalization should occur.

          4. The subjects or their legal guardian must sign the informed consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from consideration for the
        current research project.

          1. Subjects will be excluded if they have a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
             Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) diagnosis other than schizophrenia, schizoaffective
             disorder, bipolar disorder or depression with psychotic features; however, a
             concurrent diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder, which does not account for the
             subjects's psychosis is acceptable..

          2. Subject has received continuous treatment of olanzapine or risperidone in the last two
             months.

          3. Subjects receiving continuous treatment with olanzapine or risperidone in the last two
             months prior to entering the study will be excluded. This means the subject cannot
             have actually taken olanzapine or risperidone daily for more than four weeks prior to
             enrollment. There must be a gap of at least two days of not taking medication during
             that period. The dose for olanzapine cannot exceed 10 mg /day, the dose for
             risperidone 2 mg/day. The last day of exposure of any kind should be at least seven
             days before baseline.

          4. Subject has been diagnosed as treatment refractory.

          5. Subjects unable to speak or read the English language.

          6. Subjects with a DSM-IV diagnosis of substance dependence within three months prior to
             selection. Occasional abuse (defined as bingeing no more than once per week) will not
             preclude entry.

          7. Subjects with a documented disease of the central nervous system, including but not
             limited to stroke, tumor, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's
             disease, seizure disorder requiring anticonvulsants, history of brain trauma resulting
             in documented impairment, chronic infection, neurosyphilis.

          8. Subjects with hepatic, renal, atherosclerotic heart disease, arrhythmias or
             gastrointestinal disease of sufficient degree to interfere with the excretion,
             absorption, and/or metabolism of trial medication.

          9. Subjects with clinical signs of liver disease should be excluded.

         10. Subjects with acute (e.g. infection), unstable (e.g. labile hypertension, unstable
             angina), significant, or untreated medical illness; patients with diastolic blood
             pressure &gt; 95 mmHg at screening should be treated and stabilized before randomization.

         11. Subjects with narrow angle glaucoma, chronic urinary retention and/or clinically
             significant prostatic hypertrophy, paralytic ileus or related conditions, which in the
             opinion of the investigator may be exacerbated by the anticholinergic effects of
             olanzapine.

         12. Subjects with a known eating disorder

         13. Female subjects who are pregnant or breast-feeding

         14. Subjects who are being treated with a depot neuroleptic within one treatment cycle of
             the beginning of the washout period.

         15. Subjects with a history of neuroleptic malignant syndrome.

         16. Subjects with a high-risk for suicide.
