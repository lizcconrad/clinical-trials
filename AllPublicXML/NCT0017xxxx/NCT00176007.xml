      Aim of the study is to investigate the function of the systemic vascular endothelium in
      individuals susceptible to high-altitude pulmonary oedema during normoxia and normobaric
      hypoxia.

      Rationale: High-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) is characterized by excessive pulmonary
      vasoconstriction and is associated with decreased concentrations of nitric oxide (NO) in the
      lung. Objectives: We hypothesized that individuals susceptible to HAPE (HAPE-S) would also
      have dysfunction of the vascular NO vasodilator pathway during hypoxia in the systemic
      vasculature. Methods: During normoxia (FI(O(2)) = 0.21) and 4 hours of normobaric hypoxia
      (FI(O(2)) = 0.12, corresponding to an altitude of 4,500 m above sea level)
      endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent vasodilator responses to intraarterial
      infusion of acetylcholine (ACh) and sodium nitroprusside, respectively, were measured by
      forearm venous occlusion plethysmography in nine HAPE-S subjects and in nine HAPE-resistant
      control subjects. Main Results: Pulmonary artery systolic pressure increased from 22 +/- 3 to
      33 +/- 6 mm Hg (p &lt; 0.001) during hypoxia in control subjects, and from 25 +/- 4 to 50 +/- 9
      mm Hg in HAPE-S subjects (p &lt; 0.001). Despite similar responses during normoxia in both
      groups, ACh-induced changes in forearm blood flow markedly decreased during hypoxia in HAPE-S
      subjects (p = 0.01) but not in control subjects. The attenuated vascular response to ACh
      infusion during hypoxia inversely correlated with increased pulmonary artery systolic
      pressure (p = 0.04) and decreased plasma nitrite correlated with attenuated ACh-induced
      vasodilation in HAPE-S subjects (p = 0.02). Conclusions: Hypoxia markedly impairs vascular
      endothelial function in the systemic circulation in HAPE-S subjects due to a decreased
      bioavailability of NO. Impairment of the NO pathway could contribute to the enhanced hypoxic
      pulmonary vasoconstriction that is central to the pathogenesis of HAPE.
