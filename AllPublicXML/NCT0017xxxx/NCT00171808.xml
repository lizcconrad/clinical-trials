  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Western industrialized countries, endometrial cancer is the most common malignancy of the
      female reproductive tract.

      The general therapy options are surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and endocrine therapy.
      This trial will investigate the efficacy and safety of letrozole in the treatment of advanced
      or recurrent hormone receptor-positive endometrial cancer .
