    <textblock>
      Treatment for brain cancer may include radiation therapy. Radiation therapy is the treatment
      of tumors with X-rays. This study is related to understanding the side effects of radiation
      treatment for brain tumors.

      This study is being conducted by the University of Rochester Cancer Center to compare the
      extent of side effects of brain cancer treatment with changes in levels of blood proteins
      called cytokines.
