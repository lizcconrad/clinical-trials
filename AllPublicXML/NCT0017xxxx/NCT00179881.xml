  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment on this study combines two drugs: Thalomid™ (thalidomide) and carboplatin.
      Thalidomide has been available for many years and has been used to treat many different
      illnesses. Carboplatin is an effective medicine in killing cancer cells. Thalidomide works by
      blocking angiogenesis (the process of new blood vessel formation). If a tumor does not have
      blood vessels providing oxygen and nutrients, it will not be able to grow. This research will
      look at how combining the effects of thalidomide (preventing tumor growth) with the tumor
      killing effect of carboplatin effects the long-term outlook for patients with these tumors.

      This study will try to find out how well Thalomid™ and carboplatin combined with radiation
      therapy works in treating children newly diagnosed with brain stem glioma. This study will
      look at how well Thalomid ™ and carboplatin work in patients with recurrent brain stem
      glioma. This study will also look at any side effects of these treatments.
