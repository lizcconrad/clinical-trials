  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine how injection of botulinum toxin in the bladder
      affects bladder function. The trial is carried out in children born with malformation of the
      spinal cord and subsequent overactive bladders. The purpose of treating the bladder (with
      different drugs) is to prevent damage to the kidneys and renal function. The aim of this
      study is to compare a conventionally used drug (oxybutynin) with botulinum toxin. The
      hypothesis of the study is that botulinum toxin is equal to oxybutynin in the treatment of
      overactive bladder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neurogenic bladder is often seen in children with myelomeningocele, tumors in the spinal
      canal, or a traumatized spinal cord. The majority of the patients have high pressure bladders
      which can lead to reflux and frequent infections in the urinary tract. Although children
      experience insufficient bladder emptying, many of them also experience urinary incontinence
      and have to perform clean intermittent catheterization (CIC). If no intervention is made, the
      children are at high risk of renal deterioration.
