        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Traumatic brain injury confirmed by available brain imaging (CT or MRI) and be at
             least 52 weeks post injury

          -  Neuropsychologic disturbances indicated by: impaired memory (reduction of below 1
             standard deviation (SD) of the mean on the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT) and
             impaired executive function (reduction of below 1 standard deviation (SD) of the mean
             on the Verbal Memory Learning Test (VLMT) and Tower of London Test (ToL) and impaired
             attention (reduction of below 1 standard deviation (SD) of the mean on the Test
             Battery for Attentional Performance (TAP)

          -  Be required to have had sufficient education to read, write, and effectively
             communicate

          -  Be cooperative, able to ingest oral medication, and able to complete all aspects of

             caregiver according to the investigator's judgement

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A current diagnosis of cerebrovascular disease, any primary neurodegenerative
             disorder, or any other causes of neuropsychologic disturbances

          -  A current diagnosis of active, uncontrolled seizure disorder or major depression, or
             any other diagnosis that may interfere with the patient's response to study medication

          -  An advanced, severe or unstable disease of any type that may interfere with efficacy
             evaluations

          -  Female patients with child-bearing potential who are breast-feeding, pregnant or not
             practicing non-hormonal contraception

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.
