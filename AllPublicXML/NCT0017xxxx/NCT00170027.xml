  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A magnetocardiograph (MCG) is a medical device capable of recording the magnetic fields that
      arise from the electrical activity of the heart. It was developed for the general purpose as
      a noninvasive, non-contact diagnostic tool of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD), and
      especially of cardiac ischemia. The overall objective of the present study is to demonstrate
      the efficacy of this MCG device in the diagnosis of lack of oxygen to an area of the heart
      (as in an Heart attack) in patients presenting with chest pain.

      The CMI-2409 magnetocardiograph (MCG) is an FDA-approved medical device capable of
      noninvasive recording of magnetic fields arising from the electrical activity of the heart.
      This system was developed by CMI for the general purpose of noninvasive, non-contact
      diagnostics of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD), and especially of cardiac ischemia.
      The overall objective of the present study is to demonstrate the efficacy of this MCG device
      and of the associated MCG method for the detection and diagnosis of ischemia in chest pain
      patients.

      The primary objective is to demonstrate that the diagnostic accuracy of the MCG device and
      method is equivalent to or better than that of a standard 12-lead ECG for detecting the
      presence of ischemia in patients presenting with chest pain of unknown etiology. In this
      study the rest MCG data will be analyzed and compared to the results of a rest ECG.
