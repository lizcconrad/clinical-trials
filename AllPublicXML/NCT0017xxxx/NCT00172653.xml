      Background:

      Shoulder-related dysfunction (SD) is a common health problem in various patient populations.
      SD can affect an individual's ability to function independently, consequently decreasing
      quality of life. A battery of simple measurable function-related tests for patients with SD
      is important.

      Objective:

      The purpose of this study is to test the reliability, validity, and potential clinical use of
      a battery of function-related tests in patients with SD. Additionally, the biomechanical
      characteristics of the battery of function-related tests will be analyzed in terms of
      three-dimensional shoulder complex movements and associated muscular activities.

      Design:

      Repeated measurements and descriptive study

      Methods:

      The affected arms of 60 symptomatic patients with SD will be assessed by two clinicians as
      well as by one clinician twice to calculate intertester and intrarater reliabilities.
      Assessment will include self-report measures and the battery of function-related tests
      (hand-in-neck, hand-to-scapula, hand-to-opposite-scapula, and modified Kibler's lateral
      scapular slide test). Pearson correlation or Spearman's rho correlation coefficients will be
      calculated and the correlation matrices will be examined for evidence of convergent and
      discriminative validity among pain, disability, and function-related measures in patients
      with SD. Principle axis factor analysis will be performed on the kinematic measurements and
      muscular electromyography (EMG) activities to characterize the factor loading of each task.

      Subjects:

      Subjects with SDs will be recruited from the clinics in the department of Orthopedics and
      Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation at National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH). There are
      about three patients with SD among 40 outpatient visits from the clinics each week. It is
      estimated that at least two subjects with SD per week will participate in this study. Thus,
      it will take six months to recruit 60 subjects with SD. All patients will be recruited and
      tested within a 6-month period. They will receive a written and verbal explanation of the
      purposes and procedures of the study. If they agree to participate they will be required to
      sign approved informed consent forms approved by the Human Subjects Committee of NTUH.

      The inclusion criteria are adults at least 18 years old. Patients with SD will have (1) a
      limited ROM of a shoulder joint (ROM losses of 25% or greater compared with the noninvolved
      shoulder in at least two of the following shoulder motions: glenohumeral flexion, abduction,
      or medial/lateral rotation), and (2) pain and stiffness in the shoulder region for at least
      three months, and (3) the consent of the patient's physician to participate in the study.
      Patients with SD will be excluded after an examination by a physical therapist if they have
      (1) reproduction of cervical symptoms during a cervical screening examination (active and
      resisted range of motion, active and resisted range of motion with overpressure, quadrant
      test), (2) numbness or tingling in the upper extremity, (3) a history of onset of symptoms
      due to traumatic injury, glenohumeral or AC joint dislocation; or (4) surgery on the
      shoulder.

      Function-related tests:

      Hand-in-neck:

      The hand-in-neck test will be scored on a 5-point scale, where zero represents normal
      function and four indicates the most decreased function (Table 1) [Mannerkorpi et al., 1999].
      For this test, patients will stand and place their hands over the posterior aspect of the
      neck. The test performance of the patients with fibromyalgia is significantly decreased in
      comparison with healthy subjects [Mannerkorpi et al., 1999]. It is not known, however, to
      what extent performance is compromised in patients with SD.

      Hand-to-scapula:

      The hand-to-scapula test will be scored on a 5-point scale, where zero represents normal
      function and 4 indicates the most decreased function (Table 1) [Mannerkorpi et al., 1999].
      This is a common task that is performed with difficulty by patients with limited range of
      motion of the shoulder joint. The test performance of the patients with fibromyalgia is also
      significantly decreased in comparison with healthy subjects [Mannerkorpi et al., 1999].

      Hand-to-opposite-scapula:

      The hand-to-opposite-scapula test will be scored on a 4-point scale, where zero represents
      normal function and three indicates the most decreased function (Table 1).

      Modified Kibler's lateral scapular slide test:

      Kibler et al. [1998 and 2002] characterized the scapula dysfunction by side-to-side
      comparisons of the scapular during arm elevation as well as at 3 test positions (Table 1).
      Measurements of scapula symmetry are taken bilaterally from the inferior angle of both
      scapulas. In this study, we will use the modified Kibler's lateral scapular slide test
      (LSST). The observed difference will be assessed on a three-point scale (Table. 1). The
      reliability and validity of the test will be assessed in patients with SD.

      Pain:

      Measures of pain will be included to assess validity. The patient will be asked to rate pain
      with movement according to a scale in which no pain will be assigned 0 points and the worst
      possible pain will be assigned 10 points.

      Self-report measures:

      Self-report measures are valuable, since they present patients' perceptions of the
      multifaceted effects of shoulder disorders. The literature shows that various self-report
      scales for the assessment of functional limitation and disability of the shoulder are
      available [Michener and Leggin, 2001]. Each scale is different because the developers of each
      questionnaire placed a particular emphasis on the selection of items from the vast range of
      symptoms in patients with shoulder disorders. The selection of the disabilities of the arm,
      shoulder and hand (DASH) and Flexilevel Scale of Shoulder Function (FLEX-SF) to assess
      shoulder function and disability in our study is based on its entire continuum assessment of
      shoulder functions and appropriate psychometric properties of reliability, validity, and
      responsiveness to clinical change [Beaton et al., 2001; Cook et al., 2003].

      DASH:

      The DASH outcome measure is a 30-item, self-report questionnaire designed to measure physical
      function and symptoms in subjects with any musculoskeletal disorder of the upper extremity.
      Beaton et al. [2001] evaluated the reliability, validity, and responsiveness of the DASH in
      two hundred patients with shoulder problems and demonstrated good validity, test-retest
      reliability, and responsiveness of the DASH. The DASH is scaled on a 0-100 score. A higher
      score indicates greater disability.

      DASH disability/symptom score = [(sum of n responses) /n - 1] x 25 n is equal to the number
      of completed responses.

      FLEX-SF:

      In this scale, respondents answer a single question that grossly classifies their level of
      function as low, medium, or high. They then respond to only the items that target their level
      of function. Scores are recorded from 1, with the most limited function, to 50 without any
      limited function in the subject. This scale has been tested on 400 subjects with SDs and has
      showed high reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient [3,1] = 0.90) and good validity
      (Guyatt responsiveness index = 1.12) [Cook et al., 2003].

      Quality of life:

      Quality of life will be assessed on a 10-cm visual analog scale on which 0 cm indicates an
      excellent quality of life and 10 cm indicates the worst imaginable.

      Instrumentation:

      The FASTRAK motion analysis system (Polhemus Inc., Colchester, VT, USA) and a surface
      electromyography (sEMG) device will be used to detect shoulder complex movements and
      associated muscle activities. The sEMG assemblies include differential silver-silver chloride
      surface electrodes (an inter-electrode distance of 30 mm, 4 mm diameter), a pre-amplifier
      headbox (with a gain of 150), and a Bagnoli-8 amplifier (DelSys Inc., PO Box 15734, Boston,
      MA, USA), which has a gain of 1000, a high input impedance (10 M Ohm at 60 Hz), a common mode
      rejection ratio of 92 dB at 60 Hz, and a bandwidth (-3 dB) of 20 to 500 Hz. The sEMG data
      will be collected at 2500 Hz/channel using a 16-bit A/D board. Full bandwidth sEMG data will
      be reduced using a root mean square (RMS) algorithm to produce sEMG envelopes with an
      effective sampling rate of 20 s/s. These envelope data will be the basis for subsequent
      processing. Our previous investigation demonstrated that this system has good reliability to
      characterize functional tasks [Lin et al., 2004].

      Procedures:

      Reliability, validity, and potential clinical use of a battery of function-related tests:

      Demographic information, physical examination, completion of pain scale report, and
      self-report measures (DASH and FLEX-SF) will be assessed for all patients. Two physical
      therapists with a minimum of 5 years' clinical experience will independently measure patients
      with function-related tests in each test session. One of the two testers will measure
      patients with function-related tests twice with 3 to 5 days' separation.

      Biomechanical characteristics of the battery of function-related tests:

      Surface electrodes will be placed over the upper trapezius muscle (two thirds of the distance
      from the spinous process of the seventh cervical vertebra to the acromion process), the lower
      trapezius muscle (one fourth of the distance from the thoracic spine to the inferior angle of
      the scapula when the arm is fully flexed in the sagittal plane), and the lower serratus
      anterior muscle (over the muscle fibers anterior to the latissimus dorsi muscle when the arm
      is flexed 90° in the sagittal plane) [Perotto, 1994]. Verification of signal quality will be
      investigated for each muscle by having the subject perform a resisted contraction in manual
      muscle test positions specific to each muscle of interest. The FASTRAK sensors will next be
      attached with adhesive tape to the sternum and to the skin overlying the flat superior bony
      surface of the scapular acromial process. A third sensor will be attached to the distal
      humerus between lateral and medial epicondyles with adhesive tape. These surface sensor
      placements are believed to have fewer skin movement artifacts. A fourth sensor will be
      attached to an object according to the tested functional tasks. In addition, another sensor
      attached to a stylus will be used to manually digitize palpated anatomical coordinates.
      Kinematic and EMG data will then be collected for 5 seconds in this resting seated posture.
      Subjects will then be asked to perform the battery of function-related tasks.

      The order of function-related tasks will be randomized. Once the subjects are familiar with
      the functional tasks, synchronized kinematic and EMG data from 3 trials for each testing task
      will be collected. Subjects will be given approximately 2 to 3 minutes of rest between
      practice and test conditions. All subjects will be queried regarding the need for additional
      rest to prevent fatigue. Sensors will not be removed and replaced between trials. Data
      reduction will follow the method we presented in a previous published study [Lin et al.,
      2004].

      Data analysis:

      Reliability:

      Descriptive statistics including means and standard deviations will be calculated for each
      trial and for each tester. For the intratester reliability of each measure by the same
      tester, data from the two test days, which will be 3 to 5 days apart, will be used to
      calculate kappa statistics. For the intertester reliability of each measure by the two
      testers, data within the test session, which will be at most 20 minutes, will be used to
      calculate kappa statistics.

      Validity:

      All the measures used in the calculation of Pearson correlation or Spearman's rho correlation
      coefficients will be individual trial measures. For the intratester or intertester
      reliability of measures (hand-to-scapula, hand-to-opposite-scapula, and modified Kibler's
      LSST positions 1 and 2), and the measured outcome on trial 1, tester 1 will be used. The
      average of the test-retest result will be used in the correlation analysis. Pearson
      correlation or Spearman's rho correlation coefficients will be calculated, and the
      correlation matrices will be examined for evidence of convergent and discriminative validity
      among pain, disability, and function-related measures in patients with SD.

      Biomechanical characteristics of the battery of function-related tests:

      Principle axis factor analysis will be performed on the kinematic measurements and muscular
      EMG activities to characterize the factor loading of each task. The kinematic measurements
      (dependent variables) will include reliable angular variable from peak scapular upward
      rotation, peak scapular tipping, peak scapular protraction, peak humeral elevation, peak
      scapular elevation, plane of humeral elevation, and humeral rotation during the testing
      tasks. The muscle EMG (dependent variables) will include reliable mean RMS percentages from
      the upper trapezius, lower trapezius, and serratus anterior during the tasks.
