  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is for various types of malignancies which may depend on certain enzymes (tyrosine
      kinases) for growth. The objective of this study is to assess to what extent imatinib
      mesylate blocks these enzymes and to assess the effect on the malignancy.

      Condition

      Diverse malignancies either associated with or thought to be associated with activated
      tyrosine kinase enzymes including hypereosinophilic syndrome systemic mastocytosis chronic
      myelomonocytic leukaemia, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans and other diseases.

      Not included:

      Patients with chronic myeloid leukemia, some other types of leukemias (abl-mutated) some
      types of gastrointestinal stromal tumours (c-KIT-positive), some systemic mastocytosis (if
      c-KIT D816V mutation), brain, prostate, breast or lung cancers.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Malignancy likely related to an activated tyrosine kinase enzyme sensitive to imatinib
             mesylate.

          2. Spread of the disease to the rest of the body (confirmed by tissue sample) beyond the
             skin.

          3. Malignant tissue showing activation of certain tyrosine kinases (ABL, ARG, KIT
             (CD117), or PDGF-R alpha or beta) &amp; preferably within 6 weeks of entry.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Certain leukaemias (abl-mutated), some gastrointestinal stromal tumours
             (c-KIT-positive) or certain systemic mastocytosis (if c- KIT D816V mutation).

          2. A primary prostate, breast, lung or brain tumour,

          3. Patient has previously been treated with imatinib mesylate except where treatment was
             more than 6 months previously and there is no suggestion of clinical resistance nor
             lack of response.

        Other protocol-defined inclusion / exclusion criteria may apply.
