  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim of the study is to assess the impact of the factors ´bed rest´ and ´hypocaloric
      nutrition´ on endothelium-dependent vasoreactivity in healthy volunteers.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a randomized, four-phase cross-over study the effect of simulated microgravity (13 days of
      bed rest), energetic restriction (-25%, fat reduced), and their combination on
      endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilation will be compared with ambulatory control
      conditions. Using venous occlusion plethysmography cumulative intraarterial dose-response
      curves to endothelium-dependent (acetylcholine) and -independent (sodium nitroprusside)
      vasodilators will be constructed in 10 healthy male volunteers before and on day 13 of each
      of the four intervention periods.
