  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brachytherapy, or Transperineal implantation of the prostate (TPIP), is a recognized form of
      treatment for localized cancer of the prostate. TPIP has been used at the British Columbia
      Cancer Agency (BCCA) since 1998. As part of the treatment, some patients also require hormone
      therapy for 6 months. This is given as injections of a drug called an LHRH agonist. The LHRH
      agonist is made either as short-acting (1-month) or long-acting (3 month) injections. The
      LHRH agonist lowers testosterone levels, which helps make delivery of TPIP easier, and more
      effective.

      There are specific guidelines regarding the use of LHRH agonist treatment with brachytherapy,
      however there is no policy whether short-acting or long-acting LHRH agonists should be used.

      Analysis of results from BC has shown that there seems to be a delay in the time in which
      testosterone levels return to normal in men who receive the long-acting LHRH agonist compared
      with the short-acting LHRH agonist, however this is not known for sure.

    <textblock>
      The suppression of testosterone to castrate levels has a definite advantage in terms of
      prostate volume downsizing, disease control and ease of Brachytherapy, in this patient
      population. The improved potency preservation rate seen with brachytherapy, when compared to
      other treatments such as radical prostatectomy or external beam, may be an important
      determinant in the patient's choice of treatment modality. Hence, testosterone recovery
      should be an important endpoint to consider in this patient population since prolongation of
      testosterone suppression may also delay the return of erectile function.

      In order to compare the impact of LHRH agonist preparations on the rate of testosterone
      recovery, we propose a randomized clinical trial using one versus three-month Leuprolide
      preparations in patients otherwise suitable for our Brachytherapy Program.

      The primary objective of this study is the median time to testosterone recovery in patients
      receiving 6 X 1-month or 2 X 3-month LHrH preparations and TPIP as radical treatment for
      limited stage prostate cancer.

      In this context, testosterone recovery is defined as the return to the lower limit of normal
      for the patient's age group as well as return to pre treatment levels.

      Analysis will mainly focus on time to testosterone recovery as defined by return to the lower
      limit of normal for the patient's age group as well as return to pre treatment levels. The
      lower limits of normal are defined as 5.8nmol/L and 5.5nmol/L for &lt; 50 and &gt; 50 years old

      Changes in PSA level, QOL and erectile function will also be recorded

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        All patients who elect to undergo brachytherapy for the treatment of adenocarcinoma of the
        prostate and who are otherwise recommended treatment with LHRH agonist. All patients must
        have a confirmed histological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate and elect to be
        treated with transperineal implantation of the prostate.

        Eligible patients will have confirmed clinical stage T1 or T2 (UICC 1997 staging system)
        with

          1. PSA &gt; 10 but &lt; 15 and Gleason score &lt; 7, OR

          2. PSA &lt; 10 and Gleason score = 7 OR

          3. Prostate volume &gt; 50cc as measured on trans rectal ultrasound

        While criteria 1 and 2 are mutually exclusive, criteria 3 can be present alone or in
        combination with criteria 1 OR 2.

        Otherwise patients should be able to give informed consent and have a life expectancy. 2
        years.
