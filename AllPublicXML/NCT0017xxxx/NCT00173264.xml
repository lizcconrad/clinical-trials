  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the monoclonal protein in patients with
      tuberculosis and monoclonal gammopathy has anti-tuberculous activity, and whether genes
      coding their monoclonal proteins show characteristic mutations.

      Monoclonal immunoglobulins arise from abnormal proliferation of a single clone of plasma
      cells. They are composed of a single light and/or heavy chain class, in contrast to
      polyclonal immunoglobulins. They may occur in malignant lymphoproliferative diseases, such as
      multiple myeloma, Waldenstromâ€™s macroglobulinemia, lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia,
      amyloidosis, or more benign conditions such as monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined
      significance (MGUS). Recently we have observed monoclonal gammopathy occurring in patients
      with tuberculosis. Whether tuberculous infection plays a role in the production of monoclonal
      protein, and whether the monoclonal immunoglobulins possess anti-tuberculous activity are
      unknown. In the current project we plan to study: (1) whether the monoclonal immunoglobulin
      developed in patients with tuberculosis reacts with tuberculous antigen (using ELISA), and
      (2) whether the VH gene sequence analysis of such patient shows different mutation patterns
      (indicating the presence of intraclonal mutation variation) or not. If there is no
      intraclonal mutation variation, it suggests that the plasma cell clone is not under current
      exposure to the mutator, and the production of monoclonal gammopathy is probably not related
      to tuberculous infection. If, however, the VH gene sequence analysis shows the presence of
      intraclonal mutation variation, it indicates that the plasma cell clone is continuously under
      the influence of the mutator. In such case the production of monoclonal protein may be
      related to tuberculous infection.
