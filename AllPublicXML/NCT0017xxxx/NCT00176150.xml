  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate whether patients with anorexia nervosa have elevated
      plasma cholesterol levels and, if elevated plasma cholesterol levels influence drug transport
      by the ABC-transporter P-gp (P-glycoprotein, MDR 1/ABCB1). We will isolate peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and total RNA from the blood of patients with anorexia nervosa and
      healthy subjects as control. PBMCs will be used for quantitative cholesterol determination
      and for measuring the activity of P-gp using a FACS (fluorescence-activated cell sorting)
      method (rhodamine123 efflux). Total RNA will be used for quantitative expression analysis of
      P-gp by reverse transcriptase real time PCR.
