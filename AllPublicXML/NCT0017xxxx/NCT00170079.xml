  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smoking is the number one preventable cause of morbidity and mortality in this nation.
      Unfortunately, more than 50% of those who quit following a smoking cessation intervention
      typically relapse within two weeks, with approximately 80% relapsing within six months.
      Therefore, tobacco use can be conceptualized as a chronic condition. As with many chronic
      medical problems, tobacco use interventions may benefit from a step care approach to
      treatment.

      A total of 400 adult smokers will be enrolled in the study. Participants will be randomly
      assigned to one of two treatment conditions consisting of: 1) A State of the Art Smoking
      Cessation Intervention + Recycling or: 2) A State of the Art Smoking Cessation Intervention +
      Step Care. Long term smoking cessation will be assessed by self-report, exhaled carbon
      monoxide levels, and salivary cotinine. The primary endpoint of the study will be smoking
      abstinence rates at two-year follow-up. It is predicted that long-term cessation rates will
      be significantly higher in the step care condition than for those assigned to the recycling
      group.

      A common approach to increasing long-term adherence and control of chronic medical problems
      such as hypertension in both general and preventive medicine is the concept of step care.
      Despite a high degree of interest in applying the step care model to smoking cessation
      (Abrams et al., 1996; Hughes, 1994), little empirical work has been conducted utilizing this
      treatment approach. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term efficacy of a step
      care model for smoking cessation that is disseminable in primary care settings. With that
      introduction, we propose the following specific aims:

      Aim 1: To enroll approximately 400 adult cigarette smokers recruited mainly from primary care
      settings;

      Aim 2: To randomize these participants to: 1) State of the Art Smoking Cessation + Recycling
      or 2) State of the Art Smoking Cessation + Step Care; and

      Aim 3: To evaluate the long-term (24 months post-randomization) relative success of the
      interventions. It is predicted that long-term cessation rates will be significantly higher in
      the step care condition.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Cigarette smokers who are 18 years of age or older, who self-report smoking at least 10
        cigarettes each day, and who are willing to accept random assignment are eligible to
        participate. Potential participants must agree to commit to the study for at least 24
        months, be screened and agree to potentially participate in more intensive interventions to
        help them stop smoking, and agree to not seek other treatment for smoking cessation during
        the treatment phase of the study.
