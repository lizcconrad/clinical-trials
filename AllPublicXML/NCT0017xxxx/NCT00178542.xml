  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to describe characteristics and trends for thrombin
      generation (TG) and thromboelastography (TEG) at 4 time points during the menstrual cycle.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We propose that TG and TEG will be more sensitive than traditional coagulation assays to
      detect physiologic variation in hemostasis, fibrinolysis, and platelet activation throughout
      the menstrual cycle. We expect that TG and TEG will better discriminate patients with vWD
      than traditional coagulation studies during the menstrual cycle. In this study we plan to
      measure TG and TEG in healthy women and women with von Willebrand's disorder during four
      phases of the menstrual cycle. We will compare specific measurements of endogenous thrombin
      generation potential from the TG and fibrinolysis and platelet activation from the TEG with
      standard measures of coagulation, fibrinolysis, and platelet activation markers during the
      menstrual cycle.
