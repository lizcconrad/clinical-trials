  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A study is being conducted by the University of Rochester Cancer Center (URCC) in which
      patients with liver cancer will be treated with high dose conformal radiation therapy. This
      type of radiation uses new techniques which aim the radiation to the sites of disease
      allowing the tumor to receive a high dose and the surrounding normal liver tissue to receive
      a low enough dose that the normal tissue should remain free from injury.

      The purpose of the study is to determine if the conformal radiation therapy is safe,
      tolerable and effective in treating liver cancer and to determine the side effects caused by
      this treatment. A second objective is to determine if the levels of a special type of protein
      (called cytokines) found in the blood are related to this treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have new hepatic lesions suggestive of metastasis, or otherwise biopsy
             proven disease if there is no previously negative scan.

          -  Patients with chemotherapy responsive or resistant disease are acceptable. Primary
             hepatobiliary tumors are also acceptable. In each case, the patient must be deemed
             unresectable by a hepatic surgeon.

          -  Patients with multiple hepatic lesions may be included if they meet the volumetric
             criteria for dose specification. Likewise, patients with metastases to organs other
             than the liver, or patients with residual primary disease may be included if it is
             judged that longevity will be determined by the hepatic disease.

          -  KPS ≥70

          -  Age ≥ 18 years

          -  Bilirubin &lt;2.0 mg/dl, AST &lt; 2.5 x normal, ALT &lt; 2.5 x normal, Platelets &gt; 80,000/mm3

          -  Chemotherapy treatment before or after radiation will be allowed

          -  Informed consent must be obtained., Patient must be judged unresectable by a hepatic
             surgeon, or must have refused surgery

          -  Patient must be able to tolerate radiation treatment as judged by the Principal
             Investigator or co-PI.

          -  Previous Liver resection is allowed

          -  Active disease outside the liver is allowed.

          -  Liver lesion should be visible on CT or MRI.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No active hepatitis or radiographic evidence of diffuse macro-nodular cirrhosis.
             Patients with lesser degrees of cirrhosis, not associated with portal hypertension or
             hepatic failure, are eligible but radiation schedule and total dose will be
             appropriately modified.

          -  Women who are pregnant
