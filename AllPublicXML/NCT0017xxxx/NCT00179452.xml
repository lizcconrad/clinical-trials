      Subjects will keep logs of seizure frequency prior to, during, and following training in a
      yoga regimen. Instruction in the yoga regimen will occur at BIDMC, and home practice
      following classroom instruction will occur as part of the study. Side effects, changes in
      seizure frequency, and quality of life assessments will be performed.
