    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether implementing the Newborn Individualized
      Developmental Care and Assessment Program increases NICU nurses' sensitivity in meeting the
      developmental care needs of preterm infants.

    <textblock>
      Therapies that have brought about sharp decreases in neonatal mortality have not brought
      about similar decreases in neurodevelopmental morbidity for preterm infants. Developmentally
      supportive care is NICU (Neonatal Intensive Care Unit) care that seeks to optimize the
      developmental course and outcomes for preterm infants. In controlled trials, implementation
      of the Newborn Individualized Developmental Care and Assessment Program (NIDCAP) has been
      associated with with positive medical and neurobehavioral outcomes. The purpose of this study
      is to examine the impact of implementing the NIDCAP on the developmental sensitivity of
      nurses caring for preterm infants in a tertiary level NICU in a children's hospital in the
      midwest. The NIDCAP program consists of 1) structured behavioral observations which are
      conducted at regular intervals during the preterm infant's hospitalization, 2) written plans
      which outline specific, individualized interventions to address the infant's unique
      developmental needs which are updated following each observation, and 3) consultations with
      the infant's caregivers to articulate the infant's current needs and plan. A convenience
      sample of 32 NICU nurses will be observed during a routine caregiving episode with one
      preterm infant before and another preterm infant after the implementation of the NIDCAP
      program with preterm infants in the NICU. Following the observations, the nurse's
      developmental sensitivity will be scored using a standardized tool. The nurses' developmental
      sensitivity before the implementation of the NIDCAP program will be compared with their
      developmental sensitivity following NIDCAP implementation. Informed consent will be obtained
      from the nurses participating in the study.
