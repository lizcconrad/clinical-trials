  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific aim of this study is to complete an ongoing randomized controlled trial of the
      efficacy of behavioral intervention compared to STI treatment/HIV counseling alone in
      decreasing risk behavior and incident HIV/STI infections in Mumbai, India.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      India has the second highest number of HIV infections of any country in the world, and the
      epidemic continues unabated. This trial is focused on high risk men attending public STI
      clinics. A proposed 2 and a half year study, this trial will utilize the continuation of a
      randomized controlled trial of a behavioral intervention compared to HIV C&amp;T and STI
      treatment alone targeting HIV uninfected male STI patients. The specific aims are to complete
      the current behavioral intervention trial and to expand the current investigations to
      include: the evaluation of men who have sex with men as well as women and evaluate the use of
      alcohol to the entire sample of recruited men. STI patients will be recruited from three
      sites and if randomized will agree to a 12 month participation commitment. Strategies
      employed in both arms of the trial are simple and the fundamental components of an HIV
      prevention strategy. By demonstrating their effectiveness in India the hope is to encourage
      the public health leadership to adopt them and continue to change drug treatment
      availability.
