  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A study on the fate and elimination of 11-Nor-Delta9-carboxy-9-tetrahydrocannabinol was up to
      now not conducted, except of one single experiment in which (lacking) psychopharmacological
      activity was tested after intravenous infusion of 20 mg in a human individual. In this study,
      however, the authors did not trace the above questions due to analytical and methodological
      deficits.

      Aim of the study is to determine the pharmacokinetics of THCCOOH and THCCOOH-Glu after
      intravenous ad-ministration of 5 mg THCCOOH in healthy individuals

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine the pharmacokinetics of THCCOOH after intravenous administration of THCCOOH (5
      mg) and its formed glucuronide in healthy individuals in order to improve the possibilities
      for the assessment of unfitness to drive. For these purposes the following criteria will be
      studied:

      THCCOOH

        -  Primary: Area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUCtotal) Maximal plasma
           concentrations (Cmax) Time of Cmax (tmax) Terminal elimination half-life (t1/2)

        -  Secondary: Systemic and renal clearance (Cls, CLr) Volume of distribution of (Vc) Formed
           THCCOOH-glu

        -  Primary: Area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUCtotal) Maximal plasma
           concentrations (Cmax) Time of Cmax (tmax) Terminal elimination half-life (t1/2)

        -  Secondary: Systemic and renal clearance (Cls, CLr) Volume of distribution (Vc)
