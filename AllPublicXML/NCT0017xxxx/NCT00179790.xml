  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stem cell transplantation may be used to cure childhood cancers, and other diseases.
      Traditionally, stem cell transplants use high doses of chemotherapy and radiation. This
      regimen may cause significant problems after transplant such as infertility, infection, and
      graft versus host disease (GVHD).

      Reduced intensity transplant (RIT) uses medications which weaken the immune system, allowing
      donor cells to take over. The goal of a RIT is to reduce the risk for complications after
      transplant. Usually medication is used to weaken the immune system, but there are other
      options such as extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) that may be less toxic.

      ECP is currently used for the treatment of GVHD and certain lymphomas. ECP uses a machine
      that filters white blood cells from the blood, treats them with ultraviolet (UV) light, and
      then gives all the cells back to the patient. The patient's immune system becomes weaker,
      allowing the donor cells to replace those of the patient. Studies involving the use of ECP
      for conditioning have shown fewer side effects than the use of medications.

      The primary purpose of this clinical research trial is to evaluate the safety and feasibility
      of ECP as part of a preparative regimen for RIT in children and young adults.

      This study tests the feasibility of a reduced intensity preparative regimen for stem cell
      transplant including extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP), busulfan, and fludarabine in
      patients with leukemia, lymphoma, and certain non-malignant diseases. The current reduced
      intensity protocol includes busulfan, fludarabine, and anti-thymocyte immunoglobulin. ECP is
      currently used in diseases such as chronic GVHD and cutaneous T cell lymphoma. The mechanism
      of ECP has not been defined. It is hypothesized that exposure of white blood cells to
      ultraviolet light with 8-methoxypsoralen initiates an apoptotic cellular cascade. Apoptotic
      cells are recognized and removed by the reticuloendothelial system, initiating the secretion
      of anti-inflammatory cytokines and the reduction of proinflammatory cytokines. Antigen
      presenting cells then regulate immune responses through the induction of tolerance.

      Here we incorporate the use of ECP, fludarabine, and busulfan in the preparative regimen,
      followed by ECP as prophylaxis for acute graft versus host disease. We hypothesize that
      photopheresis is safe and feasible, and patients will have similar rates of engraftment with
      less GVHD as those treated with current reduced intensity protocols. The use of ECP prior to
      transplant provides immunosuppression promoting host engraftment. Furthermore, the
      introduction of ECP following transplant may be able to induce tolerance thereby reducing
      rates of GVHD.
