  <brief_title>VALORY Study of Valsartan/Hydrochlorizide for Patients Who do Not Respond Adequately to Olmesartan Medoxomil</brief_title>
  <official_title>An Open,Multicenter Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of a 4 Week Therapy With Valsartan/Hydrochlorothiazide 160/25 (Fixed Dose Combination of Valsartan 160 mg Plus HCTZ 25 mg) in Patients Not Adequately Responding to a 4 Week Monotherapy With Olmesartan Medoxomil 40 mg or Combination Therapy With Olmesartan Medoxomil 20 mg Plus HCTZ 12.5 mg</official_title>

      To evaluate the efficacy of valsartan 160 mg/HCTZ 25 mg in patients not adequately responding
      to monotherapy with olmesartan medoxomil 40 mg or combination therapy with olmesartan
      medoxomil 20 mg plus HCTZ 12.5 mg by testing the hypothesis that valsartan 160 mg/HCTZ 25 mg
      significantly reduces the trough mean sitting diastolic blood pressure (MSDBP) after a 4-week
      treatment in the nonresponder population.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Females must be either post-menopausal for one year, surgically sterile or using
             effective contraceptive methods (e.g. barrier method with spermicide, intra-uterine
             device, hormonal contraceptives).

          -  Patients with essential hypertension:

               -  At Visit 1, untreated patients should have a MSDBP &gt;100 mmHg and &lt; 110 mmHg and
                  treated patients need to have a MSDBP &lt; 110 mmHg. Untreated patients can be
                  included as soon as the safety laboratory parameters are available, but not at
                  the day of Visit 1. This inclusion visit will be recorded as Visit 3 in the CRF.

               -  At Visit 2, patients previously treated for hypertension need to have a MSDBP â‰¥
                  100 mmHg and &lt; 110 mmHg for entrance into the first treatment phase. Patients
                  previously treated for hypertension who have a MSDBP &lt; 100 mmHg at Visit 2 will
                  continue the wash-out phase and will be again evaluated with regard to BP
                  criteria at Visit 3. Untreated patients do not perform Visit 2.

               -  At Visit 3, which is not performed for patients who entered the first treatment
                  phase already at Visit 2, patients need to have a MSDBP &gt;100 mmHg and &lt; 110 mmHg
                  for entrance into the first treatment phase.

               -  At Visit 4, all patients need to have a MSDBP &gt;90 mmHg for entrance into the
                  second treatment phase.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  MSDBP &gt;110 mmHg or MSSBP &gt;180 mmHg

          -  Pregnant or nursing women

          -  Inability to completely discontinue all antihypertensive medications safely for a
             period of up to 2 weeks, as required by the protocol

        Other protocol-defined exclusion criteria may apply.
