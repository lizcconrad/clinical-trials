  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More and more colorectal surgeons believe that surgical resections of hepatic metastases from
      colorectal cancer is the only chance for cure of patients. The five-year survival for
      patients with hepatic metastasis from colorectal cancer after surgical resection is
      approximately 30 %. However, most hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer were inoperable.
      With the progress of chemotherapy, for example, the combination of the 5-Fu, leucovorin, and
      oxaliplatin, some surgeons advocated that approximately 20% of inoperable liver metastases
      will be converted to operable case, thus providing the long-term survival for patients. In
      this study, we made a phase Ⅱ clinical trial regarding the use of the Folfox-4 regimens in
      the neo-adjuvant treatment of inoperable hepatic metastases. Our aims is to evaluate the
      tumor response rate for this regimen, the rate of resectability of liver metastases,
      progression free survival and overall survival of patients. In addition, the difference
      between the reports from Western and Oriental countries will be analyzed. We believe this
      study will provide new perspectives regarding the most beneficial treatment modalities for
      the patients with hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer.
