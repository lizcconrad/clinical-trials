  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are:

        1. To examine molecular and biochemical changes, associated with the relaxation response
           (RR) that can counteract the effects of stress in healthy adults.

        2. To compare genomic, molecular and biochemical parameters between healthy adults with a
           long term meditative practice and those with no experience in meditation.

      Since stress is a factor in the development of many health conditions, a further
      understanding of the mechanisms of the RR should be developed. The project is designed to
      determine how the RR can improve the quality of life that has been adversely affected by
      stress.
