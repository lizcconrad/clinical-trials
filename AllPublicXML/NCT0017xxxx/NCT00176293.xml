  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess disease response to Doxil in patients with
      hormone refractory prostate cancer with or without dexamethasone pre-treatment.

      Study Design:

      We will perform an open labeled, parallel, randomized phase II study using a two-stage design
      to determine if there is sufficient anti-tumor activity in either arm to warrant further
      study. Assumptions made in this study: an unacceptable overall response rate is &lt;/= 10% &amp; we
      will pursue further study if the overall response rate is &gt;/= 30%. Fifteen patients will be
      randomized in the first phase (to both Arm 1 and Arm 2). No further patients will be accrued
      if &lt;2/15 responses are noted in a given arm. Ten additional patients will be enrolled if &gt;/=
      2/15 responses are observed. If there are &gt;/= 5/25 responses then further studies will be
      pursued with that regimen. We will determine the overall incidence &amp; severity of toxicities
      in both arms.

      Treatment:

      Arm 1: Doxil: Dose: 50 mg/m2, IV (in the vein) on day 5 of each 28 day cycle. Arm 2: Doxil:
      Dose: 50 mg/m2, IV (in the vein) on day 5 of each 28 day cycle. Arm 1 only: Dexamethasone:
      Dose: 12 mg twice a day by mouth on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 of each 28 day cycle.

      Number of Cycles for both Arm 1 &amp; 2: until progression or unacceptable toxicity develops.

      Primary Objectives:

      To assess the anti-tumor activity of Doxil by assessing response rates in patients with
      hormone refractory prostate cancer with or without dexamethasone pre-treatment.

      Secondary Objectives:

      To assess and estimate in patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer treated with Doxil
      with or without pre-treatment dexamethasone: 1) overall survival 2) toxicity, 3) quality of
      life parameters, 4) dose intensity administered in both treatment groups.

      Study Design:

      We will perform an open labeled, parallel, randomized phase II study using a two-stage design
      to determine if there is sufficient anti-tumor activity in either arm to warrant further
      study. Assumptions made in this study: an unacceptable overall response rate is &lt;/= 10% and
      we will pursue further study if the overall response rate is &gt;/= 30%. The overall response
      rate for this study will be based on the total number of responses observed defined as:
      complete responses + partial responses (both by RECIST)+biochemical responses (in patients
      with no measurable target lesions a &gt;/= 50% decrease in PSA for &gt;/= 4 weeks). Fifteen
      patients will be randomized in the first phase (to both Arm 1 and Arm 2). No further patients
      will be accrued if &lt;2/15 responses are noted in a given arm. Ten additional patients will be
      enrolled if &gt;/= 2/15 responses are observed. If there are &gt;/= 5/25 responses then further
      studies will be pursued with that regimen. We will determine the overall incidence and
      severity of toxicities in both arms.

      Treatment:

      Arm 1: Doxil: Dose: 50 mg/m2, IV. Frequency: day 5 of each 28 day cycle. Arm 2: Doxil: Dose:
      50 mg/m2, IV. Frequency: day 5 of each 28 day cycle. Arm 1 only: Dexamethasone: Dose: 12 mg
      bid po. Frequency: days 1,2,3,4,5 of each 28 day cycle.

      Number of Cycles for both Arm 1 and 2: until progression or unacceptable toxicity develops.
