  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study proposal, the investigators will extend their previous studies and examine the
      kinetic cytotoxic activity with concordant expression of inhibitory natural killer (NK)
      receptors (iNKR) on activated T cells. The inhibitory role of cytokines will be defined by
      utilizing the investigators' previously established models of mixed lymphocytes and tumor
      cells coculture to analyze the expression and activity of cytokines involved in the
      regulation of iNKRs on cancer-encountered T cells.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In our extended studies, we have directly examined the expressions of various inhibitory
      natural killer cell Receptors (iNKRs) on Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) derived from
      human Cervical cancer (CC) by triple-color flow cytometry with combination of different
      surface markers. We found up-regulated expression of certain iNKRs (CD94/NKG2A) in TILs and
      in mixed lymphocyte-cancer cell cocultures. In our previous studies, we demonstrated that
      certain cytokines, including IL-10, TGF-beta (Sheu et al, Journal of Immunology, 2001,
      167:2972-2978), and IL-15 (Sheu et al, Cancer Research, 2005, 65:2921-2929) can be expressed
      by CC cells. We further demonstrated that activated T cells bear iNKRs which inhibit
      cytotoxic activity. iNKRs are proposed to restrain the T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated
      cytolysis. We found that CC cells had altered HLA-A, -B, and -C molecules in a cancer
      microenvironment. The acquisition of both NK-like activity and expression of iNKRs by these T
      cells is parallel to prevent damage to normal host cells. However, there is also limited
      knowledge about the regulatory role of iNKR expression in T cell cytotoxicity.
