  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study will assess whether AAB-001 is safe, well tolerated and effective for use
      in patients with Alzheimer's Disease. AAB-001 is a new drug that is not available outside
      this study. AAB-001 is an antibody (a type of protein usually produced by white blood cells
      to destroy other substances in the body). In Alzheimer's disease a protein called amyloid
      gathers in the brain and is thought to cause symptoms like memory loss and confusion. It is
      hoped that AAB-001 will attach to the amyloid protein in your brain and help your body to
      remove it.
