  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hot flashes occur in three quarters of menopausal women, and can negatively impact quality of
      life. Interest has arisen in isoflavones, found in rich supply in soy products, as therapy
      for hot flashes. The study examines the effect of a new soy supplement, as compared to a
      placebo, in menopausal women on hot flash symptoms.

    <textblock>
      Hot flashes occur in 75% of menopausal women and impact quality of life. Interest has arisen
      in isoflavones, found in rich supply in soy products, as therapy for hot flashes. The effect
      of a daidzein-rich isoflavone-aglycone supplement from soy germ fermentation with Koji
      fungus, on the severity and frequency of hot flashes in postmenopausal women is being
      examined in a randomized, placebo controlled, double-blinded clinical trial. The study is a
      13 week trial in which subjects record their hot flash frequency and severity in a diary.
      Subjects are given 40 mg or 60 mg of isoflavones (or placebo) once a day. This
      isoflavone-aglycone extract (Agly-Max TM, Nichimo, Shinagawa, Tokyo, Japan) is a product
      prepared from soybean germ fermentation with Koji fungus (Aspergliius awamori) producing
      ÃŸ-glycosidase efficiency, followed by ethanol and water extraction and purification by using
      a proprietary extraction procedure. The product is rich in daidzein (70% daidzein, 10%
      genistein, and 20% glycitein).
