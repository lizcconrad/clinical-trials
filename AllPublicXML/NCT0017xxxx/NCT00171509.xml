  <brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Cyclosporine Microemulsion Given Once a Day in Adult Stable Liver Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Multicenter, Randomized Open-label Pilot Study to Explore the Benefit of a Conversion From a Twice a Day Administration of Cyclosporine Microemulsion to a Once a Day Administration and to Identify the C2 Ranges to Target After Conversion in Stable Liver Transplant Recipients</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether cyclosporine microemulsion given once a day
      instead of twice a day benefits kidney function, blood pressure, lipid profile and glucose
      control in stable liver transplant recipients. The study also aims to identify the target
      ranges of levels of cyclosporine microemulsion in the blood.
