  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MEK is a critical member of the MAPK pathway involved in growth and survival of cancer cells.
      PD-325901 is a new drug designed to block this pathway and kill cancer cells. The purpose of
      this study is to study the effectiveness of PD-325901 in patients with non-small cell lung
      cancer. PD-325901 will be given by mouth as a pill twice a day, CT scans will be done and
      biopsies of a tumor and a blood sample will be taken before treatment to examine the how
      genes affect tumor response to the study medication. Blood samples will be taken to measure
      the amount of drug in the blood.

      This study was terminated prematurely on 23 March 2007 due to safety issues (ocular and
      neurological toxicity observed in another PD-0325901 study, A4581001) as well as lack of
      objective responses

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically documented non-small cell lung cancer with metastases (Stage IV or
             recurrent disease) or locally advanced (Stage IIIB) with malignant pleural effusion
             with no expectation of further effects of prior anticancer therapy, and resolution of
             all acute toxic effects

          -  Adequate renal, liver, and bone marrow function, determined within 2 weeks prior to
             the first treatment and an ECOG status of &lt;=1.

             systemic anticancer therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No parathyroid disorder or history of malignancy associated hypercalcemia

          -  No ongoing radiation therapy or radio-cytotoxic therapy within prior 4 weeks; No
