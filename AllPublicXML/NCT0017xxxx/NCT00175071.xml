  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study is designed to assess the effect of a conventional cooking oil
      (hydrogenated oil) and a reformulated fat low in trans fatty acids on cardiovascular disease
      risk factors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is known that in subjects with high cholesterol levels that substitution of hydrogenated
      fat (high in trans fat) with vegetable oil results in higher levels of total and LDL
      cholesterol (&quot;bad&quot; cholesterol). There has been tremendous interest within the food industry
      to identify cooking fats that have the physical properties necessary to make shelf stable
      products and have textural characteristics similar to existing products but that also
      favorably affects risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD) such as LDL cholesterol
      levels and inflammatory markers. The current study is designed to assess the effect of a
      conventional cooking oil (hydrogenated oil) and a reformulated fat low in trans fatty acids
      on cardiovascular disease risk factors.

    <description>30 subjects will consume each of the two diets in randomized order for 5 weeks each. Diets will be designed to maintain body weight; will have 30% of energy as fat which 2/3 or 20% of energy will be either the conventional or reformulated fat. Blood lipids and C reactive protein (CRP) as well as indicators of how lipids are processed in the blood will be measured at the end of each dietary phase.</description>
