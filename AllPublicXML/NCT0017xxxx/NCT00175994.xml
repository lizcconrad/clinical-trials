      The purposes of this study are:

        -  To determine the absolute bioavailability of voriconazole after a single oral dose (400
           mg voriconazole [VFEND brand]) in comparison to intravenous (i.v.) administration (400
           mg VFEND, equivalent to two 10 mg/ml-infusates, each containing 200 mg voriconazole
           [VRC]) in healthy individuals stratified according to the three predominant CYP2C19
           genotypes

        -  To investigate the possible pathways of metabolism and their modulation according to
           genetic polymorphism of CYP2C19 after i.v. and oral administration of VRC.

      As CYPs are mainly involved in VRC metabolism it is likely that also gut wall metabolism by
      CYPs occurs. However, no substantial first pass metabolism of VRC has been reported. In
      humans the VRC metabolism has not been studied systematically. It is therefore important to
      assess VRC metabolism on its own and in addition the influence of CYP2C19 genetic
      polymorphisms on the formation of the different VRC metabolites.
