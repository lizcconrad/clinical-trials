  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with coronary artery disease can reduce their chance of having a heart attack by
      making healthy lifestyle choices (diet, exercise, quitting smoking,etc.). There are also many
      medications that have been proven to reduce the risk of heart attacks and may even help
      people live longer. This study will look at different ways of improving the use of these
      beneficial medications to enhance the quality of care for people with this condition.

      BACKGROUND: Despite the abundant evidence base for secondary prevention, practice audits
      consistently demonstrate substantial &quot;care gaps&quot; between this evidence and clinical reality
      such that many patients with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) are not offered all possible
      therapies for the prevention of myocardial infarction or death. For example, even after an
      acute myocardial infarction, almost one fifth of patients continue to smoke; over half with
      hypertension or hyperlipidemia have poorly controlled pressure or lipid levels; and proven
      therapies such as statins, ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers and antiplatelet agents are
      under-prescribed.

      Multiple barriers are often responsible for the lack of implementation of proven efficacious
      therapies and traditional means of educating practitioners (journal articles, CME,
      conferences, etc) are usually ineffective in altering practice. Clearly novel interventions
      to improve the quality of prescribing are needed. Local opinion leaders are trusted by their
      peers to evaluate medical innovations and thus influence practice patterns within their
      community. Few controlled studies, however, have evaluated their effect on changing
      prescribing practices for common conditions such as CAD.

      HYPOTHESIS: This trial will test 2 quality improvement interventions. The principle
      hypothesis is: does a one-page evidence summary endorsed by local opinion leaders increase
      the provision of secondary prevention therapies in patients with CAD compared to usual care?
      The secondary hypotheses are: does the same intervention but without local opinion leader
      endorsement improve the provision of secondary prevention strategies in patients with CAD
      compared to usual care? Does local opinion leader endorsement increase the effectiveness of
      the quality improvement intervention?
