  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with heart failure are limited in their exercise capacity due to skeletal muscle
      alteration and an impairment of peripheral perfusion. Regular physical exercise training has
      been shown to partially correct these peripheral maladaptations in patients with stable heart
      failure, which was associated with an improvement in exercise capacity. However, it is
      unknown so far, whether regular physical activity also exerts beneficial effects in patients
      with severe chronic heart failure.

      Aim of the trial is therefore to assess the effects of aerobic exercise training on exercise
      capacity, muscle maladaptations and peripheral perfusion in patients with severe chronic
      heart failure according to NYHA class III b.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 36 patients with severe chronic heart failure are prospectively randomized to
      either 3 months of aerobic ergometer training or a sedentary control group.

      Before and after the intervention period maximal exercise capacity is assessed by
      ergospirometry, endothelial function is determined by high-resolution A-mode ultrasound, and
      muscle mass is determined by CT. Skeletal muscle biopsies are obtained at begin and after 3
      months and are analyzed for markers of muscle catabolism/anabolism.
