  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The standard therapy in cases such as yours is surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy or
      hormonal therapy alone or in combination. The main purpose of this study is to evaluate
      whether radiosurgery alone affects your quality and length of life. A second purpose of this
      study is to determine if the levels of special types of protein (called cytokines) found in
      the blood are related to your quality of life during your course of treatment and follow-up.

      In this research study high dose stereotactic body radiation therapy will be directed at the
      site of metastasis. This treatment will be given once a day, 5 times a week (Monday through
      Friday) for one to four weeks depending on the location and size of the disease to be
      treated. Blood for the cytokine tests will be drawn before your therapy starts, weekly during
      therapy and at the follow-up visits as stated in the next paragraphs. Two to four tablespoons
      of blood will be removed each time.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Age ≥ 18 years

        KPS ≥ 70

        Palliative: Disease most likely to be life limiting, is definable, and treatable to a
        sterilizing dose according to protocol criteria.

        The size of the lesion must be such that it can be safely treated to sterilizing radiation
        doses according to the rules in the protocol

        Previously treated lesions are not eligible unless the prescribed dose can be safely
        delivered. Previously enrolled patients can be retreated to new lesions if they still meet
        protocol requirements.

        Informed consent must be obtained.

        Pregnancy test must be negative for women of child bearing potential.

        Out of state patients are eligible, if communication with the referring physicians is
        expected to be adequate to address the primary aim. The secondary aim (blood cytokines) is
        optional for out-of-state patients.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Technical inability to achieve required dose based on safe dose constraints required for
        radiosurgery

        Women who are pregnant or nursing..

        Failure to meet inclusion requirements

        Contraindications to radiation.

        Patient should not be eligible for primary disease specific radiosurgical protocols
