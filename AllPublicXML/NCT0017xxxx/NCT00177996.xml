      This research study is being conducted to find out if certain individuals benefit from taking
      medication for their depression with a low dose of the antidepressant medication Zoloft.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Health System are currently
      recruiting men and women, ages 18 to 60, to examine the effectiveness of the FDA-approved
      medication sertraline (Zoloft) for major depression.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. Each group will begin and
      continue taking Zoloft at different doses. A physician will follow eligible participants
      weekly for approximately 12 weeks

    <description>The study was a double-blind study in which subjects diagnosed with major depression complicated by lifetime panic spectrum symptomatology were randomized to either high (but still within the standards of normal clinical practice) or low dose titration schedules of Sertraline hydrochloride. The doses and titration schedules used in this arm (Sertaline high dose titration) are consistent with recommended FDA guidelines.</description>
