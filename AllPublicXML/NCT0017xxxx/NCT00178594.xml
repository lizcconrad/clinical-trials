  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study will be to assess the coagulation system in-vitro in a variety of
      bleeding and clotting disorders using the ROTEG analyzer and the thrombin generation assay.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory study involving blood coagulation assays in a select group of
      individuals. The ROTEG is a newly developed coagulation analyzer which allows the continuous
      assessment of whole blood coagulation from the formation of the first fibrin fibers and
      activated platelets, to the formation of a three-dimensional whole blood clot until the
      eventual dissolution of the clot. This device will not be used as a diagnostic or procedure
      tool. No recommendations regarding interpretation of the results or implications for future
      treatment will be provided.
