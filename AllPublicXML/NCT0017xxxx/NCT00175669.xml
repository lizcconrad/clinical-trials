      The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of Botox and casting to placebo and
      casting for reducing toe walking problems in children who are idiopathic toe walkers.

      Patients who have been seen by one of the 5 paediatric orthopaedic surgeons at British
      Columbia's Children's Hospital and have been referred to the Shriner's gait lab for
      assessment of idiopathic toe walking will be eligible for the study.
