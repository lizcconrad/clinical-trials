    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand changes in brain chemical signals when people take
      antidepressants called sertraline (Zoloft速) and bupropion (Wellbutrin SR, Zyban 速). Spinal
      fluid is used to measure chemical levels of dopamine, serotonin, and other chemicals thought
      to be involved in depression. The study has potential to help understand and treat
      depression.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  AGE RANGE: 18 to 50 years.

          -  WEIGHT: within 20% of ideal weight, as specified in the 1983 Metropolitan Height and
             Weight Tables. Patients who deviate from these ranges may be reviewed on an individual
             basis by the Investigator. This criterion is necessary because of mechanical risks of
             poor access in overweight individuals, and because of physiologic risks in underweight
             individuals.

          -  SEX DISTRIBUTION: both men and women (self or partner surgically sterilized, or using
             double barrier method). To the extent possible, women will have CSF sampling at the
             same point in their menstrual cycles, ideally during the follicular phase.

          -  RACE: any

          -  HEALTH: healthy, ambulatory depressed or healthy adults; must show clear capacity to
             form consent based on a strong understanding of the potential risks and benefits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of significant hepatic, gastrointestinal, renal, respiratory, endocrine,
             hematologic, neurologic, psychiatric, or cardiovascular system abnormalities, history
             of deep venous thrombosis (DVT), thrombophlebitis, coagulopathy.

          -  Pregnancy.

          -  Patients with a known or suspected history of alcohol or drug misuse and/or a positive
             urine drug screen.

          -  Patients who are unwilling or unable to abide by the requirements of the study or who
             violate the prohibitions and restrictions of the study.

          -  Any condition which would make the patient, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             unsuitable for the study.

          -  Patients who have taken any unapproved prior or concomitant medications.

          -  Patients who have donated blood within one month of the study.

          -  Patients with serious medical illness, history or signs/symptoms of lumbar spine/disc
             disease or significant laboratory findings.

          -  Recent participation in other studies.

          -  Patients with histories of migraine will be considered individually, and warned of the
             risk of headache following spinal tap.

          -  Patients who smoke regularly, would experience withdrawal while hospitalized for 5
             days, or who cannot abstain from tobacco for the entire duration of the study.

          -  Patients who present significant suicide risk, e.g. with a history of highly impulsive
             suicide attempts.
