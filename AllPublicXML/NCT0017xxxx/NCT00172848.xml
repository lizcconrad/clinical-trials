      The purpose of this study was to discuss the relation of mastery, social support and
      depression in patients with depressive disorder. Cross-sectional quantitive study and
      purposive sampling method were designed. Data collection and analysis was conducted through
      structural questionnaires (including demographics, social support scale, mastery scale, CESD
      scale) at a medical center in Taipei. Results showed that patients with depression whose
      degree of depression was negative correlated with mastery and social support, and mastery was
      positive correlated with social support. Regression statistics results showed that mastery,
      social support, age, loss of jobs can predict degree of depression up to 60 percent. The
      mastery was strongest independent predictable factor to degree of depression, and had partial
      or total mediate effects to age, loss of jobs, financial condition, and social support. The
      result of this study suggested that clinically the care of patients with depression should
      focus on their confidence in mastery and provide strategies to promote their confidence in
      mastery, which can effectively reduce the degree of depression of those patients.
