  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is to compare the immune response of different influenza vaccines given by two
      different routes of administration in healthy adults ages 18 to 64 years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, partially blinded trial to compare the safety and
      immunogenicity of intramuscularly versus intradermally administered influenza vaccine in
      healthy 18-64 year old adults. Subjects will have blood drawn immediately prior to and
      approximately three to four weeks after vaccination. After the completion of the trial, all
      subjects will be offered influenza vaccine of the 2005-2006 formulation.
