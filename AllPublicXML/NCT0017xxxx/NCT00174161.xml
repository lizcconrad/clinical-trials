      The purpose of these series research project is to investigate the prevalence, symptoms
      cluster and characteristic; establish the systemic symptom management nursing strategies
      (PMS-SMP); determine short-and long-term effectiveness of PMS-SMP. To enhance the health
      related quality of life of women with Perimenstrual syndrome. Simultaneously, the PMS-SMP
      offers a research and clinical based protocol to demonstrate the independent nursing role and
      practice care model. The 3-year series research process will include three research domains.

      Symptoms are the most common reason people seek health care. Although the menstrual cycle, a
      normative process, but 10~15% of western women experience sever recurring symptoms associated
      with the menstrual cycle that can be considered a chronic illness. There are many
      interventional researches focus on this issue in western countries. There is not only lack of
      evidence base prevalence of perimenstrual syndrome, but also never found any nursing
      intervention project focusing on women with perimenstrual syndrome.

      Content analysis, descriptive statistics(percentage, mode, medium, quartile, rank),
      Chi-square, One way ANOVA, MANCOVA, and Step-Wise regression will be applied to examine the
      research finding. Although focused on perimenstrual symptoms relief and improve the health
      related quality of life of women with perimenstrual symptoms, these strategies are generally
      health promoting and can be applied to other womenâ€™s health conditions.
