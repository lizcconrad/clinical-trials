      This PPG entitled “A Study on Psychopathological Progress of Early Schizophrenia-like
      Disorder (SOPRES)” is designed to study the “Progress of Psychopathology” of pre-psychotic
      state of schizophrenia (SCH) using a prospective follow-up design. Based on the
      neurodevelopment hypothesis of schizophrenia, the neurobiological dysfunctions, such as
      cognitive impairment, neurophysiological dysfunction, neuroanatomical pathology, is the core
      pathology. The pathology may exist prior to onset of psychotic symptoms, and at post
      psychotic state. It also presents in the first-degree relatives. SCH is mainly with a gradual
      mode of onset, ranging from pre-schizotypal (or pan-neurotic state), schizotypal, prodromal
      to frank psychotic SCH (DSM-IV criteria) state.

      Up to the present time, there are arbitray criteria for diagnosing schizotypal disorder and
      frank psychiatric schizophrenia, but the valid clinical assessment method of pre-schizotypal
      and prodromal state is still controversial. The psychopathological progress from
      pre-schizotypal to frank psychotic SCH state is still unclear. In this SOPRES, we intend to
      establish a set of valid clinical assessments for defining the cases of early SCH-like
      disorder [ESLD], to examine the clinical progression, such as conversion rate of psychosis
      from non-psychotic state in a prospective longitudinal follow-up; to validate the clinically
      defined cases of ESLD with different dimensions of neurobiological studies, including niacin
      skin flush test, neuropsychological, neurophysiological (such as prepulse inhibition [PPI],
      P50 inhibition [P50I]), and magnetic resonance spectrometry (MRS) and Diffusion Tensor
      Imaging (TDI); to demonstrate the validity of the ESLD using the family
      genetic-epidemiological data and to explore the awareness, reaction, coping strategy, social
      stigma, and help seeking process of the patients and the families of ESLD.

      In order to achieve these goals, we designed this PPG of SOPRES, which comprises of 4
      inter-locked projects and one core unit. Project No.1 is the “Clinical Phenomenological
      Follow-up Study of ELSD: Clinical Validity”; Project No. 2 is the “Validity Study of
      Neurobiological Tests of ELSD”; Project No. 3 is the “Validity Study of Family Genetic Study
      of ELSD”; and Project No. 4 is the “Awareness and Pathways of Help Seeking of ELSD”. The only
      one core unit is designed for the purposed of monitoring research progress, communication
      among researchers such managing PPG research meeting, data management, and budget management
      and other research-related administrative secretary work. These 4 projects are integrated
      study approaches by means of (1) using the same samples; (2) study different levels of
      psychopathology, including clinical symptoms, neurobiological impairment, family genetic
      data, and psychosocial variables; and (3) mutual hypothesis testing.

      We expect that this SOPRES research will create a new frontier of SCH research in the fields
      of early intervention of SCH for preventing the recurrence of frank psychotic state of
      schizophrenia, and will provide the background for improving treatment outcome and quality of
      life of SCH.

      Project No: 1 Title: A Study of Psychopathological Progress of Early Schizophrenia-like
      Disorder specific aims are 1) To elicit the psychopathology of identified Early
      Schizophrenia-like Disorder (ESLD) and to categorize into 3 groups of pre-schizotypal,
      schizotypal, and prodromal ESLD. 2) The reveal the prevalence of different neurobiological
      impairment (studied in Project No.2) in 3 groups of these identified ESLD subjects. 3) The
      stability of psychopathology of 3 groups of identified ESLD. 4) The process of conversion and
      conversion rates of psychotic state from non-psychotic state in a 2-year follow-up

      Study procedures:

        1. Recruitment:

           The high-risk group of schizophrenia will be recruited by referral from psychiatric
           outpatient clinics in Northern Taiwan, referral from school counseling room in Taipei
           City and Taipei County, and subjects with known family history from our previous
           schizophrenia genetic study, which has a size of 850 families. As we have good
           collaborative works with several psychiatric hospitals and psychiatric departments of
           general hospitals, it is expected that 100 subjects could be assessed from the
           outpatient referral. The increasing needs of psychiatric consultation from school system
           give us a chance to recruit 50 subjects by school referral (school counseling system).
           Our previous family genetic studies in schizophrenia have already recruited 850
           families. As the relatively risk of schizophrenic spectrum disorders (schizophrenia and
           schizotypal disorder) is much higher in families with schizophrenic patients, and in our
           experiences the families of schizophrenic patients often expressed worries about
           developing the illness themselves, it is expected that 100 subjects could be assessed
           from this population.

           The school surveillance will be conducted in three selected senior high schools and
           three colleges in Taipei metropolitan aiming at subjects fitting our recruiting
           indicators, including cognitive decline, affective symptoms, social isolation, and
           school failure (CASIS). A pilot study will be conducted in initial 5-10 nominated
           candidate students to cross check the validity and applicability of each screening
           methods. There are 75,084 senior high school students in Academic Year 2003-2004 in
           Taipei City. We plan to survey the teachers of 3000 students to from 3 senior high
           schools (around 1000 students each), representing schools with highly-academic-,
           vocational-, and mixed-orientation. Another 3000 students will be recruited from 3
           colleges by administering freshman self-report questionnaire. It is expected that 100
           subjects could be identified as subjects with early schizophrenia-like clinical
           presentations.

           The general public will be recruited by respondents to our study ads co-sponsored by the
           Mental Health Foundation (MHF) framed in terms of highlighting awareness of early
           cognitive deficits and prevention from severe mental disorders (Caring Brain and Worry
           Free Program). As the PI had recruited subjects for “brain bank” by public advocacy and
           the Mental Health Foundation already had annual surveys regarding the general public’s
           mental health conditions and subjective well-being with good response rate and the
           results have been broadcast on major media. Based on the highly expected credit of the
           MHF, we expect to identify and recruit 50 subjects from this channel.

           The normal control will be recruited from the subjects’ schoolmates or friends not
           meeting our recruitment criteria, matched by age, gender, and education. We need 200
           normal control subjects based on a two to one ration between the study subject and the
           normal control.

        2. Referral criteria:

      Outpatient group: suspected “latent” or “beginning of” schizophrenia based on psychiatrists’
      clinical experiences; school referral group: problematic students unable to be explained by
      common conduct problems or psychosocial issues from teachers’ perspectives (un-understandable
      emotional, behavioral, interpersonal, or academic problems); family study group: siblings or
      offspring of schizophrenic patients exhibiting symptoms or behavioral patterns warrant
      family’s attention (something reminding them about their schizophrenic relatives).

      3) Recruitment criteria: (CASIS) Cognitive deficits: subjectively poor concentration; decline
      of intelligence; inefficient learning; rigid thinking; Affective symptoms: unexplainable
      depressiveness, anxiousness, fearfulness, obsession, or hypochondriacal ideas; social
      isolation: having less than two close friends; generally withdrew, distant, aloof, or
      isolated; frequent absence without identifiable causes; school failure: markedly
      deterioration of academic performance or quitting school.

      Subjects presenting at least two of the above conditions (one of cognitive deficit and at
      least one of the remaining three) will be screened for psychotic-prone symptoms by the Latent
      Schizophrenia Screening Sheet (LSSS) (necessary to have cognitive deficit) of 26 items (6
      dimensions) including thoughts, perceptions, inappropriate behaviors, affective symptoms,
      interpersonal relationship, and neurotic symptoms. Subjects respond “sure” for any item of
      the LSS will be recruited for further assessments.

      Anticipated Results: The cross-sectional and longitudinal progress of psychopathology of ESLD
      will be revealed. The comprehensiveness and the domains of psychopathology of ESLD will be
      elicited. The progressing process of the psychopathological domains will be characterized.

        1. The validity of subgrouping of ESLD into pre-schizotypal, schizotypal and prodromal
           types will be determined.

        2. We’ll reveal the pattern of aggravation of symptomatic level as time goes by: more
           subjects progress to the severer level during the 2-year follow-up (i.e., from
           pre-schizotypy to schizotypy, from prodrome to SCH, etc; few subjects could “drift back”
           to the milder symptomatic level (i.e., from prodrome to schizotypy or from schizotypy to
           pre-schizotypy, etc).

        3. To determine some specific items in the screening tools, i.e., LSS, SOPS, for better
           positive predictive values than the others.

        4. The sensitivity and specificity of the screening tools will be examined using
           neurobiological indicators (Project No.2) by constrast validity testing.

      Project No: 2 Title: Neurobiological Study of Early Schizophrenia-like Disorder (ESLD)
      Specific Aims: Based on the neurodevelopmental hypothesis of schizophrenia (SCH), it is
      assumed that clinically identified pre-psychotic state of SCH, termed as Early
      Schizophrenia-like Disorder (ESLD)(Project No.1), may have impaired neurobiological
      functions. Our previous family-based studies also supported that some neurobiological
      markers, such as sustained attention deficits, were potential endophenotypes of schizophrenia
      (see background below). Therefore, in Project No.2 of the Study on Psychopathological
      Progress of ESLD (SOPRES) Program, we plan to adopt multi-level approaches to investigate the
      potential neurobiological changes in patients with ESLD. The approaches include certain
      specific neuropsychological, neurophysiological and neuroimaging measurements.

      The specific aims of neuropsychological study are as follows: 1) to examine whether
      individuals with ESLD evidence controlled processing dysfunction of neurocognition; 2) if
      true, to further explore whether such dysfunction involving neurocognitive domain is simplex
      or multiplex in nature; 3) to determine whether neurocognitive controlled processing
      measure(s) used in the present study can be a useful screening tool for ESLD and further for
      early detection of schizophrenia.

      The specific aims of the other dimensions of neurobiological studies are:

        1. To clarify the prevalence of impaired flush response to Niacin skin patch in ESLD and to
           assess the predictive validity of Niacin skin test in the progression of schizophrenia;

        2. To reveal the prevalence of two brain inhibitory functions (i.e. prepulse inhibition of
           startle (PPI) and P50 event-related potential (ERP) suppression) in ESLD and the change
           along clinical course of those ESLD subjects;

        3. To measure the regional changes of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in hippocampus
           and frontal lobe in subjects with ESLD, and define the predictive validity in the
           follow-up course.

        4. To measure the connectivity and diffusion anisotropy between the hippocampus and frontal
           lobe by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in subjects with ESLD, and define the predictive
           validity in the follow-up course.

        5. To evaluate the possibility of skin niacin response/MRS/DTI/P50/PPI as endophenotypes in
           further genetic research of schizophrenia.

      The importance of the specific inhibitory measures also resides in the fact that they are
      understood at neurobiological (and in some cases, molecular) levels, based on extensive human
      and animal model studies.

        1. P50 Suppression:

           P50 suppression is an important endophenotype of schizophrenia. P50 suppression occurs
           when two clicks are presented with a 500 msec interstimulus interval. The impaired
           suppression of the P50 to the second stimulus has been reported in a number of studies
           in chronic schizophrenia patients, both medicated and unmedicated, first-episode
           patients, and first-degree relatives of schizophrenics, as well as schizotypal
           individuals.

           Impaired P50 suppression is extensively studied using anatomical and molecular genetic
           and other neurobiological studies. These findings support that P50 suppression
           impairment is a possible endophenotype of information processing deficits in
           schizophrenia.

        2. Prepulse inhibition (PPI):

      PPI of the startle response is an operational measure of preattentive sensorimotor gating.
      The term startle modification refers to the changes in the startle reflex, induced by various
      stimulus modalities, when the startle-eliciting stimulus is preceeded by a (usually weak)
      stimulus called a prepulse. It is stable over time in both normal subjects and schizophrenia
      patients.

      Deficits in PPI have been consistently identified in schizophrenia, and PPI is an excellent
      candidate endophenotype in schizophrenia since PPI deficits occurred in schizophrenia
      patients, and schizotypal personality disorder patients.

      To study the presence and change of impaired PPI and P50 suppression in ESLD may help us
      clarify the stability of the impairment along the disease course and the validity of using
      the PPI and P50 test as a screening tool for pre-psychotic state of schizophrenia.

      Project No: 3 Title: Family Genetic Study of Early Schizophrenia-like Disorder I. Specific
      Aims: Genetic high-risk (HR) approach, in which subjects with one or more affected relatives
      were recruited since infancy or early childhood, has been the most commonly adopted one to
      address the early detection of schizophrenia (1). However, as pointed out in a recent review
      (2), there are two major limitations of these studies. First, because the majority of these
      genetic high-risk studies were started 30-40 years ago, many of them used methods that are
      outdated and sometimes focused on less relevant subjects in their assessments. Second, only
      approximately 10% of the HR children develop schizophrenia, making the predictions concerning
      vulnerability indicators unprecise. Recently an alternative approach called clinical
      high-risk or ultra-high-risk has been advocated, in which adolescents or young adults
      referred for mental health evaluation with attenuated psychotic symptoms or behavioral
      problems commonly observed in the HR children were recruited for prospective follow-ups (3,
      4). In this PPG, we propose an approach that combines both genetic HR and clinical HR to
      enrich the recruitment of subjects at increased risk of developing early schizophrenia-like
      disorder (ESLD).

      Moreover, the interpretation of the contrast between HR subjects and normal controls or
      between HR with onset of schizophrenia and HR without onset of schizophrenia tends not to be
      straightforward. Any neurodevelopmental disturbances can be distributed in two independent
      dimensions: a genetic-environmental causal continuum and an early-to-late maturation
      expression continuum (5). A factor that is present in an HR subject but absent in normal
      controls is not necessarily of genetic origin. One way to distinguish is to examine whether a
      similar deficit is present in other non-HR sibling of the HR proband. However, previous HR
      studies tended to measure only the HR subject in each family.

      In this component project, we propose to adopt a family-genetic approach to provide more
      information for the interpretation of the contrast between HR of different severity and
      normal controls or between HR with progression to a more severe stage and HR without such
      progression. The specific aims of this component project are as follows:

      Aim 1:To assess to what extent the psychopathological features identified in the probands of
      pre-schizotypal ESLD, schizotypal ESLD, prodromal ESLD, or early schizophrenia are also
      present in their first-degree relatives.

      Aim 2: To assess to what extent the neurodevelopmental or neurobiological impairment
      identified in the probands of pre-schizotypal ESLD, schizotypal ESLD, prodromal ESLD, or
      early schizophrenia are also present in their first-degree relatives.

      Aim 3: To assess to what extent the conversion in psychotic-like state of the three groups of
      ESLD probands can be explained by the presence of psychopathological, neurodevelopmental, or
      neurobiological features observed in their first-degree relatives.

      The probands of the three groups of ESLD (pre-schizotypal ESLD, schizotypal ESLD, and
      prodromal ESLD), early schizophrenia, and normal controls will be recruited by the Component
      Project 1 of this PPG. On the basis of these probands, this Component Project will recruit
      their first-degree relatives to participate in the study. Part of these probands will have
      neurobiological assessment conducted in Component Project 2. Part of the family identified in
      this Component Project will be evaluated for help-seeking behavior. In these joined efforts,
      we will be able to decipher the psychopathological pathways for both genetic and
      environmental etiological factors.

      Core Unit Code No: A Title: Core Unit of A Study on Psychopathological Progress of Early
      Schizophrenia-like Disorder (CUSOPRES) This PPG of Study on Psychopathological Progress of
      Early Schizophrenia-like Disorder (ESLD) [SOPRES] is composed of 4 inter-related projects:
      (1) A Phenomenological Prospective Follow-up Study of ESLD; (2) A Neurobiological Study of
      ESLD; (3) Family Genetic Study of ESLD; (4) Awareness and Pathways to Care in ESLD.

      The study samples participate all these four projects. The major hypothesis of the SOPRES was
      based on neurodevelopmental etiological hypothesis of schizophrenia. The hypothesis testing
      is interrelated among three projects No.1, No.2 and No.3. The projects No.4 is supplementary
      to other 3 projects. This SOPRES belongs to a translational study. Project No.4 is essential
      to bridge the process for clinical application of this SOPRES.

      Based on these predicted research activities commonly needed for these four projects of this
      PPG, an efficient Core Unit of this SOPRES (CUSOPRES) is mandatory for carrying out the
      research work smoothly. There are several sections of research-related work of this CUSOPRES

        1. Administrative Coordination of this SOPRES:

      This CUSOPRES has to coordinate the regular research meeting, to make record of this research
      meeting. Literature related to this SOPRES PPG has to be collected and to be distributed to
      all research participants. It has to monitor the reality of the progress of this SOPRES. The
      progress of sampling, data collection, data check, setting up computer data file has to be
      monitored weekly. Report of research progress has to be done and has to be distributed to all
      main researchers. All the filing system of this SOPRES has also to be done by this CUSOPRES.

      2. Budget management: Some proportion of the budget are commonly used in three projects. Each
      project also has its own budget schedule. The salary system of all research assistant has to
      be scheduled and managed clearly. This budget is of government grant. Detailed descriptions
      and records of budget expenditure are critically demanded by the regulatory and census system
      of the government. The expenditure every year must to be regulated to meet the requirement of
      research activity. This CUSOPRES has to manage all these works. A full time business
      assistant is necessary.

      3. Training of Research Assistants and Participant Researchers: This PPG OF SOPRES will
      recruit research assistants (RA) for sampling, for data collection and data management. In
      Taiwan, the job of RA is always in a temporary basis. They (RA) come and go. All these RA’s
      enrolled have to receive a through training for their work to guarantee high training of data
      collection and data management. All participant young researchers of all different
      disciplines also have to arrange training program related to the SOPRES research activities.
      This training program has to be arranged, scheduled and managed by the CUSOPRES.

      4. Manuscript Preparation and Submission. Other than collecting new data, this PPG also have
      abundant data bank of previous psychopathological studies. As stated in the preliminary work
      of these three projects, these data has to be analyzed along the progress of data collection
      of this SOPRES. These continuous data analysis will create many drafts of paper manuscripts.
      Thus, this SOPRES PPG will have many manuscripts preparations for submitting to international
      and/or domestic journals. Typing, editing, and the preparation of these manuscripts are part
      of the work of this CUSOPRES. This is one important supporting function of CUSOPRES.

      5. Data management and Data Analysis After preliminary management of data collected from the
      study subjects, all research data have to be set up in suitable computer data bank. Data
      cleaning is important work. Integrated data analyses of this SOPRES are unique of this SOPRES
      PPG. Other than independent analysis of the specific project itself, coordinated and mutual
      data matching analysis is unique of this SOPRES. The clinical definition of ESLD will be
      validated by concurrent psychopathological data (Project No.1) and follow-up data, and will
      be validated by all different dimensions of neurobiological data (Project No.2). The
      clinically defined ESLD will also be validated by family genetic data. Most importantly,
      heterogeneity of ESLD will also be explored using statistical maneuvers and then, will
      receive further validation study.

      Data Structure and Statistical data analysis

      Figure1 illustrates the possible data relationship and statistical analysis tools and data
      analysis strategies to be involved in and incorporated into the project. Structure of data
      sets to be collected by four component projects is very complicate in nature:

        1. . Data sets to be collected by all four projects are inter-correlated and dependent.
           Subjects may be stratified by various relationships among all four projects.

        2. . Data sets are highly multidimensional. Each program project employees multiple
           interviewing and measurement tables. Subjects match different criteria may have
           different sets of measurements.

        3. . These measurements have different scales: ratio, interval, ordinal, nominal.
           Multivariate variables with different scales will be studied simultaneously.

        4. . Some of the subjects/measurements combinations may have longitudinal pattern with
           follow-up studies.

        5. . Data sets collected by Project 3 may be of dependent nature – samples are clustered as
           families.

      Due to the high complexity of the data structure involved, the core unit has the following
      strategies to handle the statistical data analyses for all different
      project/subject/table/variable combination and situation:

        1. . Descriptive statistics and various exploratory data analysis (EDA) tools will first be
           used to study the basic distribution structure for all the subjects/variables collected.
           This provides the researchers most of the univariate distributions and some of the
           associations structure of tables.

        2. . Generalized association plots (GAP), developed by Dr. Chun-houh Chen (Chen 2002) for
           our previous projects, will also be used to explore the basic clustering structure of
           subjects and grouping structure of variables and the interaction patterns of the
           subject-clusters with variable-groups for each individual data table and combination of
           tables. This provides us an overall picture of data structure for all the
           subjects/tables involved.

        3. . Many conventional multivariate statistical analysis tools will be employed to conduct
           further exploratory analyses and some confirmatory studies for the data.

        4. . Various statistical testing procedures will also be used to verify and answer some of
           the hypotheses generated and proposed by all four component projects. The results may
           lead to new or modified hypotheses. Statistical analyses and hypothesis testing
           procedures will be performed again to verify the new hypotheses.

        5. . Various statistical and epidemiological genetic analysis tools are to be used for
           analyzing the familial data generated by project 3.

        6. . Latent class model (LCM) developed by Dr. Huang (Huang &amp; Bandeen-Roche 2004, Huang
           2005) can be used to study subject clustering pattern for various project/table
           combination.

        7. . CateGAP, longGAP, canoGAP will be applied to study the categorical, longitudinal, and
           canonical relationship data structure respectively.

        8. . New statistical methodologies and data analysis procedures suitable for analyzing
           specific data pattern to be generated by all four projects will be developed by the
           statisticians of the core unit when there is the need.

      6. International and Domestic Communication Related to academic activities of this SOPRES,
      this SOPRES focuses on the up-to-date psychopathological study issue. All participant
      researchers of this SOPRES have abundant communication with other academic institutes or
      personnel for academic interests. This CUSOPRES has to manage all these communications.

      7. The GENOP research team of this SOPRES program has also done the positional cloning study
      in order to find the vulnerability gene of schizophrenia in an independent molecular genetic
      study on SCH. We have found 12 potential candidate vulnerability genes up to now. In the
      coming years, there will be risk mutations identified in these vulnerability genes. These
      risk mutations will be as the direct genetic marker to validate the different groups of ESLD.
      This core unit will hire one assistant of bachelor degree to do blood sample collection and
      DNA extraction, as well as lymphocyte immortalization by EBV transformation.

      8. Summary and Significance

      This PPG of “A Study on Psychopathological Progress of Early Schizophrenia-like Disorder
      (SOPRES)” was designed to validate Early Schizophrenia-like Disorder (ESLD) defined
      clinically, using neurodevelopmental-associated core psychopathology. The SOPRES will recruit
      subjects of potential cases of ESLD using clinical psychopathological data obtained by
      self-report and face-to-face interview approach. Three groups of ESLD will be defined: (1)
      pre-schizotypal (or pan-neurotic), (2) schizotypal and (3) prodromal groups. These three
      groups represent three steps of psychopathological progress of ESLD. Using prospective
      follow-up design, the conversion rates of these three groups converted into successive group
      and into frank psychotic state of schizophrenia will be revealed. These clinically defined
      cases will be validated using neurobiological indicators, such as neuropsychological,
      neurophysiological, niacin skin flushing test, neurochemical, neuroanatomical indicators
      (Project No.2) as well as family genetic epidemiological data (Project No.3). The subtypes of
      ESLD will also be delineated using these validation procedures. The awareness, reaction and
      coping strategy of the patients and the family care-givers will be elicited as well. This
      SOPRES is 5-year study design, which includes 4 study periods: (1) half year preparation, (2)
      2 years of case recruitment, (3) 2 years of follow-up and (4) half year ending and data
      management.

      The psychopathology of schizophrenia has been well studied in the past decade. The SOPRES is
      a translational study design to examine the psychopathological progress of the pre-psychotic
      state of schizophrenia based on neurodevelopmental hypothesis of schizophrenia. This SOPRES
      is, thus, of high academic merit in the study of schizophrenia psychopathology. This SOPRES
      will demonstrate the successful application of basic neurobiological study data on clinical
      condition of ESLD.

      This SOPRES will successfully set up a battery for valid diagnostic assessment of ESLD
      covering multidimensional psychopathology and it will also reveal the psychological progress
      of ESLD. This valid diagnostic assessment of ESLD will identify cases of ESLD from the cases
      with school failure, job difficulty, and of anxiety-depressive disorders in general
      psychiatric clinics. This will be helpful for avoiding the undesirable clinical condition of
      mis-diagnosis and mis-treatment. This will also substantiate the background for the
      development of further frontier of early intervention of ESLD. As schizophrenia is a
      devastating disease for the patient himself/herself, the family and the society. It also
      carries heavy psychosocial stigma. The result of SOPRES will be very helpful for building up
      early, intervention of schizophrenia, and will contribute a lot in reducing the cost of
      schizophrenia. The SOPRES study results regarding the awareness and coping strategy of the
      patients and the family will provide useful empirical data for developing psychosocial
      service for the ESLD.

      This SOPRES study will provide the learning experience for participating researchers,
      including research assistants in the area of developing diagnostic assessment, combing
      clinical psychopathology and neurobiological pathology of early pre-psychotic state of
      schizophrenia. This experience will cultivate the future professional persons in the research
      area of preventive psychiatry.

      9. Institutional Environment and Resources

      This PPG of SOPRES will be carried out with the main researcher center located at the
      Department of Psychiatry, National Taiwan University Hospital and College of Medicine,
      National Taiwan University. There are main psychiatric hospitals affiliated with this
      research center. Massive case and family recruitment in local and nationwide programs for
      molecular genetic study of schizophrenia has been carried out by this research center and the
      affiliated hospitals. This research center has been doing psychopathological study on
      schizophrenia in its academic tradition. This research center is one part of the active
      medical campus of the National Taiwan University. Multidisciplinary team related to
      neurobiological study has been organized for years. These neurobiological studies of
      neuropsychological, neurophysiological and neuroimaging fields and neurobiological technology
      have been well developed. This university medical campus is very active in collaborating with
      other research sections as shown by this PPG of SOPRES. The Department of Imaging, Department
      of Neurology, Department of Nursing, and Department of Psychiatry, College of Medicine;
      Department of Psychology, College of Science, Department of Social Worker, College of Social
      Science, Institute of Epidemiology, College of Public Health of the same University are
      integrated with this PPG. The active research centers of statistical science located in
      Academia Sinica, and National Chiao Tung University, as well as Institute of Anthropology,
      National Tsing Hua University are also integrated into this PPG of SOPRES. These institutions
      are all engaged in biomedical research actively and also encouraging researchers to pursuit
      incultidisciplinary collaborative research too. The clinical phenomenological study,
      follow-up study, genetic laboratory, the neuropsychological, neurophysiological, the
      neuroimaging technique, and statistical technology are well equipped and well developed in
      these collaborative research centers and well mastered by these participating researchers.

      Besides, this research center is the leading center of psychopathological study and service
      in the area of adolescent Psychiatry. There was wide and intensive connection between this
      research center and schools. Besides, this research center has also been involved with public
      mental health promotion through Mental Health Foundation (MHF). These intensive connections
      and wide resources are crucial for the successful case recruitment of ESLD targeted by this
      SOPRES program.
