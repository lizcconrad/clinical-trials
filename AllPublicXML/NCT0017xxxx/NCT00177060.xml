      The hypothesis is that topical opioids will hasten wound healing in humans.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is based on our published data that morphine is a powerful stimulant of angiogenesis and
      our preclinical study of wounds in rats which demonstrate that topical opioids (morphine,
      hydromorphone and fentanyl) hasten healing of punch biopsy wounds. This study will focus on
      hydromorphone which was more powerful than morphine as a wound-healer in the rat study.
