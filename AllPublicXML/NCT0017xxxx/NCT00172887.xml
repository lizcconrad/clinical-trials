  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The quantity and quality of inpatient services for persons with psychiatric illness have been
      enhanced in the last two decades. Following the enforcement of nationwide health insurance
      and the Physically and Mentally Disabled Citizens Protection Act, the financial pressure of
      medical care for psychiatric patients is relieved, and actions related to the protection of
      patients' human rights have been taken. Nonetheless, problems related to psychiatric illness
      are not limited to symptoms. Patients' daily functions are affected and it causes continuous
      pressure on the family. Currently, psychiatric care places more emphasis on inpatient
      services. Once the patient is discharged from the hospital, related psychiatric services are
      not widely available, which leads to symptom exacerbation, repeated hospital admissions,
      increased burden to the family, etc. A provision of continuous long-term care that meets the
      various needs of psychiatric patients is a critical issue in current psychiatric care.

      Based on a three-phase needs assessment model, the purpose of the study is to evaluate the
      needs of long-term care for psychiatric patients. The first phase will identify the current
      status of needs from the perspectives of patients and the family, psychiatric professionals,
      and the system. The second phase will identify the goals of long-term care for psychiatric
      patients. The goals will be identified by a nominal group, composed of experts related to the
      field of psychiatric long-term care. The third phase will determine the objectives of
      long-term care services for psychiatric patients. That is to determine the proper contents of
      long-term care services for the patients based on the goals identified in the previous phase.

      The three-phase needs assessment will be carried out in a two-year period. The results of the
      study will provide important information to the future planning of long-term care for
      psychiatric patients.
