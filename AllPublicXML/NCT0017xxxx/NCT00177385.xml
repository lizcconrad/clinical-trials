  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see whether protecting sleep quality in later life is
      important in continued healthy aging. The value of education in healthy sleep practices along
      with reducing time in bed each night by going to bed 30 minutes later, and of healthy dietary
      practices will be tested for their effects on sleep quality, health, and well being.

      The goal of this project is to test the efficacy of restricting time in bed and education in
      healthy sleep practices for maintaining or even enhancing sleep consolidation and depth in
      subjects aged 75+ who are at risk for decay in sleep quality and daytime well being; to
      determine the associated benefits for health; and to examine the persistence of such effects
      for 12 months beyond the end of the 18-month intervention. This project focuses not on
      pathology but on prevention of sleep decay and preservation of sleep in individuals who have
      already evidenced successful aging.
