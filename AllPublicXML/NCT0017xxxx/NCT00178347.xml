  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irradiation of any tissue creates changes in that tissue. Ionizing radiation imparts charges
      to the tissue as it interacts with tissue components, changing the tissue structure. The
      specific type of modification also depends to some extent upon the type of tissue irradiated.
      It has been shown that it is possible to read the tooth enamel irradiation record using
      techniques such as electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), or electron spin resonance (ESR).

      It is proposed to examine radiation responses in approximately one hundred (100) human teeth.
      This would include teeth free of, as well as those containing, amalgam (silver) restorations.
      For the first group, teeth that have already been collected (pre-existing pathological
      specimens) would be used. These teeth were surgical/pathological discards collected without
      identifiers by the dental providers.
