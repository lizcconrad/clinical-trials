    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether Music Therapy interventions can be used as
      supportive therapy for patients undergoing weaning from mechanical ventilation. The music
      will support the procedure by serving as a stimulus for relaxation and/or pain and anxiety
      management.Music used is varied according to subject's preferences.

      Music therapy interventions will be used as supportive therapy for patients undergoing
      weaning from mechanical ventilation. The music will support the procedure by serving as a
      stimulus for relaxation and/or pain and anxiety management. The intervention will consist of
      40 - 50 minutes of active music therapy and improvisation in which the music is used as a
      distraction from the hospital setting and the procedure taking place. The intervention will
      end with 5 to 10 minutes of discussion of music activities/selections to be used between
      music therapy sessions. The intervention is individualized and can be modified accordingly to
      the subject's preferences.
