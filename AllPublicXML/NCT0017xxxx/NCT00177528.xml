      This research study is to evaluate the safety and usefulness of venlafaxine-XR in the
      treatment of major depression in the elderly.

      The primary objective of this pilot study is to evaluate the safety of venlafaxine extended
      release formulation (XR) in the treatment of geriatric non-psychotic depression. This pilot
      study's specific aims are to assess the safety of venlafaxine XR in the geriatric population,
      to estimate the response rate of older depressed subjects treated under open conditions and
      to evaluate pharmacokinetic characteristics that may impact on safety and outcome.
