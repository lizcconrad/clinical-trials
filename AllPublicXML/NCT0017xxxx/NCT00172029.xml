    <textblock>
      The aim of this prospective, randomized, open-label, multicentric clinical study is to assess
      the effícacy and tolerability of zoledronic acid 4 mg IV infused over 15 minutes every 4
      weeks for a total of 6 infusions, in combination with standard or reduced dose radiotherapy
      in patients with breast cancer and metastatic bone disease associated with pain.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female patients aged ≥ 18 years.

          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of breast cancer with at least one bone metastases.

          -  Radiologically documented solitary or multiple osteolytic or osteoblastic lesions in
             axial skeleton or in the extremities in which radiotherapy is indicated.

          -  Pain and/or analgesic score ≥ 3 (see section 3.5.2) at the bone site to be irradiated.

          -  ECOG performance status ≤ 2.

          -  Life expectancy more than 6 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients in whom the target lesion(s) is not detectable by conventional techniques
             (i.e. X-rays MRI or CT scan).

          -  Presence of pathological fracture in the target lesion(s).

          -  Prior irradiation of the painful area(s) to be irradiated.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to zoledronic acid or other biphosphonates.

          -  Previous treatment with bisphosphonates for the current disease; any treatment with
             biphosphonates for other indications should anyway have been discontinued at least two
             years before randomization into the study.

          -  Skeleton-related complications (e.g., pathological fractures, orthopedic intervention
             to treat or stabilize an osteolytic defect, spinal cord compression) during the last 3
             weeks prior to the first infusion of trial medication.

          -  Change in anticancer therapy within the 2 weeks prior to screening assessments and/or
             test treatment start.

          -  Patients with severe renal function (serum creatinine &gt; 400 umol/l or &gt; 4.5 mg/dl or
             calculated creatinine clearance ≤ 30 ml/minute) or with prior renal transplantation.
             Creatinine clearance will be calculated using the following formula:

        Creatinine clearance = (140-age[yr])(body weight [kg]) x 0.85 (72) (serum creatinine
        [mg/dL]) or Creatinine clearance = (140-age[yr])(body weight [kg]) x 0.85 (0.814) (serum
        creatinine [µmol/L])

          -  Corrected (adjusted for serum albumin) serum calcium concentration &lt; 8.0 mg/dl (2.00
             mmol/L).

          -  Patients with clinically symptomatic brain metastases

          -  Bone metabolism disorder, e.g. Paget disease, primary hyperparathyroidism

          -  Serious intercurrent illness other than breast cancer that can interfere with the
             evaluation of the effect of the therapy.

          -  Pregnancy and lactation.

          -  Women of childbearing potential not on an effective form of contraception.

          -  Known history or present abuse of alcohol or drugs (accepted social alcohol usage will
             not exclude the patient)

          -  Patients who, in the opinion of the investigator, are unlikely to cooperate fully
             during the study.

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.
