    <textblock>
      This study is designed to develop our understanding of the efficacy and safety of using
      lumiracoxib in the treatment of patients with acute gout. This is a multi-center,
      double-blind, randomized, parallel group study comparing a single daily dose of 400 mg
      lumiracoxib with the established dose of indomethacin 50 mg taken three times a day in terms
      of efficacy
