      Study Objective:

        -  To examine the perceptions of time spent at the bedside; perceptions of bedside manner;
           and patient perceptions of the provider-patient interaction offered by emergency
           providers when they sit versus when they stand during the initial evaluation.

      This project is clinically relevant research different from prior Emergency Department (ED)
      satisfaction studies since this study will contribute information about factors that could
      increase patient satisfaction with his/her provider in the ED setting. This research may
      guide specific guidelines for quality improvement efforts. The investigators hypothesize that
      patients will perceive that the emergency providers are at the bedside longer, demonstrate
      better bedside manner, and have better provider-patient interactions when they sit versus
      when they stand. Additionally, the investigators hypothesize that providers who sit will
      perceive that they are at the bedside longer than those who stand for the same period of
      time.

      Methods: A convenience sample of adult patients will complete a 5-item questionnaire
      concerning the perceived time spent with the emergency provider and the qualities of the
      provider-patient interaction. Emergency providers will be randomly assigned to either sit or
      stand during the initial evaluation. The providers will complete a 4-item questionnaire.
      These data will be compared to the actual time spent in the evaluation, measured in seconds,
      using a stopwatch. These data, combined with demographic data obtained from the patient
      chart, will be analyzed to examine whether there are statistically significant differences in
      patient perceptions and satisfaction.
