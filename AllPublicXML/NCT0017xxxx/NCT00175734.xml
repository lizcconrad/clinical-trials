    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to document relevant and related clinical changes associated
      with different hemoglobin concentrations in diabetic hemodialysis patients.

      Hypothesis: The expansile capacity of blood vessels is affected by different hemoglobin
      concentrations in diabetic hemodialysis patients.

    <textblock>
      Vascular disease is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic
      kidney disease (CKD), of which a large proportion is diabetic. Diabetics have complex and
      multiple reasons for vascular disease, and there is accumulating evidence of associated poor
      endothelial cell function, particularly in those with kidney disease. One important mechanism
      through which this might occur relates to changes in shear rate and stress resulting from
      different viscosity levels. Such fluctuations are increasingly recognized to affect
      endothelial cell function and hence vessel-wall adaptability in both the short and long term.

      Little is known of the consequence of different shear effects on endothelial cell function at
      various hemoglobin levels in kidney disease. There is some evidence to suggest however that,
      in the presence of micro-vascular disease, a relative anemia, with associated lower viscosity
      and shear stress, may be of benefit compared to higher hemoglobin levels.

      Diabetics account for almost 40% of dialysis patients worldwide, and are the fastest growing
      component of the epidemic of CKD. Thus, an understanding of optimal treatment targets for
      anemia therapy, and the impact of different target levels of hemoglobin on vascular wall
      function is imperative.
