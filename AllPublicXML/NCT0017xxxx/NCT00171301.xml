  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To allow patients treated with deferasirox in the core study to continue iron chelation
      therapy for 2 years or until the drug became locally commercially available. To evaluate the
      long-term safety and efficacy of deferasirox by measuring treatment success, change in liver
      iron content (LIC) and change in serum ferritin levels. Safety was mainly assessed by
      incidence of adverse events (AEs)and clinically significant lab parameters.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Iron accumulation is an inevitable consequence of chronic blood transfusions and results in
      serious complications in the absence of chelation treatment to remove excess iron.
      Deferasirox (Exjade, ICL670) is an oral chelator with high iron-binding potency and
      selectivity. This extension study aimed at collecting efficacy and safety data during 2 years
      of treatment with deferasirox in the extension study or until deferasirox became commercially
      available in the countries where the centers were located, whichever came first. The
      population comprised of β-thalassemia patients with transfusional hemosiderosis who could not
      be satisfactorily treated with deferoxamine or deferiprone.

    <description>Success was defined as the percentage of participants with decreased liver iron content (LIC) at the end of extension study compared to core baseline (BL) LIC. Success Criteria: For participants with Baseline LIC from 1 - &lt;7 mg Fe/g dw, success was achieved if LIC level maintained at 1 - &lt;7 mg Fe/g dw. For participants with Baseline LIC ≥7 - &lt;10 mg Fe/g dw, success was achieved if LIC dropped to between 1 and &lt; 7 mg Fe/g dw. For participants with Baseline LIC ≥10 mg Fe/g dw, success was achieved if LIC dropped by at least 3 mg Fe/g dw. LIC was measured by biopsy or magnetic resonance imaging.</description>

    <description>Liver MRI or Liver Biopsy was performed at the core study baseline (BL) and then 1 year and 2 years in the core study, baseline of the extension study and time of discontinuation from the extension visit (end of study). Liver iron content (LIC) is reported in milligram Iron per gram dry weight (mg Fe/g dw).
Absolute change in LIC from core study baseline to the end of the extension study is presented for participants with the following two core study baseline LIC levels: 1-&lt;7 mg Fe/g dw and ≥7 mg Fe/g dw.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Treatment Success From Core Baseline (BL) to Extension End of Study, by Baseline LIC Level and Age</title>
        <description>Success was defined as the percentage of participants with decreased liver iron content (LIC) at the end of extension study compared to core baseline (BL) LIC. Success Criteria: For participants with Baseline LIC from 1 - &lt;7 mg Fe/g dw, success was achieved if LIC level maintained at 1 - &lt;7 mg Fe/g dw. For participants with Baseline LIC ≥7 - &lt;10 mg Fe/g dw, success was achieved if LIC dropped to between 1 and &lt; 7 mg Fe/g dw. For participants with Baseline LIC ≥10 mg Fe/g dw, success was achieved if LIC dropped by at least 3 mg Fe/g dw. LIC was measured by biopsy or magnetic resonance imaging.</description>

      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The terms and conditions of Novartis' agreements with its investigators may vary. However, Novartis does not prohibit any investigator from publishing. Any publications from a single-site are postponed until the publication of the pooled data (i.e., data from all sites) in the clinical trial.</restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>An internal review revealed major Good Clinical Practice violations at 2 sites in Saudi Arabia: 602 for core + extension, 601 for 2-yr extension. Therefore data was excluded (completely for 602 + partly for 601) from analyses.</limitations_and_caveats>
