  <brief_title>A Study to Compare Ocular Safety and Tolerability of Eye Drops Containing Prednisolone Acetate in Patients With Intraocular Inflammation After Cataract Surgery</brief_title>
  <official_title>Multi-center, Randomized, Double Masked, Vehicle Controlled Phase IV Study to Compare the Efficacy, Ocular Safety and Tolerability of a Two Day Treatment With Eye Drops (0.5% Prednisolone Acetate, One Drop Four Times Per Day) in Patients With Intraocular Inflammation After Cataract Surgery, Followed by an Open Label Observational Period of 12 Days</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective was to demonstrate that two days of treatment with 0.5% prednisolone
      acetate eye-drops after cataract surgery are superior to vehicle in reducing the flare in the
      anterior chamber of the operated eye.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient gave written informed consent.

          -  Patient had undergone cataract surgery according to standard surgical procedures (see
             Appendix 2 to the Protocol).

          -  Patient showed flare in anterior chamber of ≥ 20 photons/msec on Day 1 as compared to
             the preoperative value measured at screening

          -  Patient gave written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Ophthalmologic conditions

          -  Operation not performed according to the standard procedures.

          -  Any eye condition which urgently requires treatment with NSAIDs or corticosteroids.

          -  History of intraocular surgery in the operated eye.

          -  Any laser therapy or cryotherapy in the operated eye in the 90 days preceding surgery.

          -  Any previous episode of uveitis in the operated eye.

          -  Clinically significant trichiasis or other clinically relevant concurrent
             inflammatory/ infective eye disorders (e.g. conjunctivitis, episcleritis) except mild
             forms of seborrheic blepharitis.

          -  Severe dry eye syndrome.

          -  Glaucoma.

          -  Any other clinically significant disorder of the operated eye.

          -  Contact lens wearer during the treatment period. Systemic conditions

          -  Hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients of the trial medication.

          -  Diabetes mellitus (even if currently controlled).

          -  Severe systemic dysfunction (cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic, renal or endocrine).

          -  Rheumatoid arthritis.

          -  Subjects with history of malignancy of any organ system, treated or untreated, within
             the past five years, whether or not evidence of local recurrence or metastases exists,
             are excluded, with the exception of localized basal cell carcinoma of the skin.

        Prohibited concomitant medication

          -  Treatment of the eye (to be operated on) with local anti-inflammatory drugs during 14
             days preceding surgery and during the trial.

          -  Systemic use of corticosteroids 4 weeks preceding the surgery and during the trial.
             Inhaled corticosteroids are allowed if stable 4 weeks preceding the trial and during
             the trial. Topical corticosteroids to treat dermatological diseases are allowed, too.

          -  Chronic systemic use of NSAIDs 4 weeks prior to the trial and during the trial, but
             occasional use (≤ 2 times per week) of NSAIDs or OTC painkillers to treat minor
             conditions was acceptable. Low dose aspirin for cardiovascular prophylaxis was
             allowed.

        Other prohibited conditions

          -  Pregnant or lactating women or of childbearing potential unless adequate birth control

          -  Patient's repeated participation in this trial.

          -  Any medical or laboratory condition which, in the Investigator's opinion, would

             protocol.

          -  participation in another clinical study within 4 weeks prior enrolment;

          -  have hematological diseases such as aplastic anemia, panmyelopathy, or hemolytic
             icterus; with severe dysfunction of the liver;

          -  any medical or laboratory condition which, in the Investigator's opinion, would
             preclude the participant from adhering to the protocol or completing the trial per
             protocol;

          -  subjects with history of malignancy of any organ system, treated or untreated, within
             the past five years, whether or not evidence of local recurrence or metastases exists,
