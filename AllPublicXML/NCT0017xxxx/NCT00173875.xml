    <textblock>
      The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a promising target for anticancer therapy
      because it is expressed or highly expressed in a variety of tumors, including
      NSCLC.Furthermore, high levels of EGFR expression have been associated with a poor prognosis
      in lung cancer patients in several studies. EGFR-targeted cancer therapies are currently
      being developed; strategies include inhibition of the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of
      the receptor by small molecules such as gefitinib (Iressa [ZD1839]; AstraZeneca, Wilmington,
      DE). Iressa is an orally active, selective EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks signal
      transduction pathways implicated in the proliferation and survival of cancer cells.
