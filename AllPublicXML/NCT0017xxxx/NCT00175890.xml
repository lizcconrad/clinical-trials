  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of levetiracetam used as adjunctive treatment in
      pediatric subjects age 1 month to less than 4 years with partial onset seizures. Subjects
      will be evaluated with 48 hour inpatient video electroencephalograms (a selection and an
      evaluation). Other neuropsychological clinical assessments will be performed during the 34
      day length of the study.

    <time_frame>48-hours in Evaluation Period and 48-hours in Selection Period</time_frame>
    <description>Responder Rate is defined as the number of subjects with a ≥ 50 % reduction from baseline in their Average Daily Frequency (ADF) for partial onset seizures divided by the total number of subjects. If a subject had &lt; 24 hours of usable Evaluation video-EEG time (including zero time available) and withdrawal from the study with reasons linked to lack or loss of efficacy, the subject was counted as a non-responder.</description>

    <description>Responder Rate is defined as the number of subjects with a ≥ 50 % reduction from baseline in their Average Daily Frequency (ADF) for all seizure types divided by the total number of subjects. Subjects who withdrew or dropped out before the first 24 hours Evaluation video-EEG with reasons linked to lack of efficacy were considered as non-responders.
