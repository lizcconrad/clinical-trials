  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-center, 2 treatment,
      3-­way crossover. Subjects will be randomly allocated to a treatment sequence – AAB, ABA or
      BAA. The two treatments will be:

        -  Treatment A: 500 mg nicotinic acid (Niacor(R))

        -  Treatment B: Niacor(R) Placebo

      Each trial period will last one day, there will be a wash-out period of at least 2 days
      between each trial period. Five to seven days after study day 1 of trial period 3 there will
      be a final safety examination.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Good state of health physically and mentally

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Treatment with any other investigational product in the last 60 days before the day of
             randomization into the study

          -  Regular use of medication in the last 60 days before the day of randomization into the
             study except of oral contraceptives in female participants

          -  Treatment in the 60 days before the day of randomization into the study with any drug
             known to have a well-defined potential for toxicity to a major organ, or any substance
             which is known to induce or inhibit hepatic drug metabolism (including general
             anesthetics)

          -  Any drug intake (including over-the-counter remedies) in the 2 weeks before the day of
             randomization into the study, unless the investigator considers a drug intake to be
             clinically irrelevant for the purpose of this study

          -  Any acute or chronic illness or clinically relevant findings in the pre-study
             examination

          -  Presence, history or sequelae of gastrointestinal (e.g. peptic ulcer), liver or kidney
             disease, or any other condition known to interfere with the absorption, distribution,
             metabolism or excretion of drugs

          -  History of hypersensitivity to the investigational product

          -  History or presence of abnormalities of the vascular bed

          -  History or presence of a dermatologic disease or skin lesions, particular in the area
             chosen for flush measurement

          -  History of allergy or hypersensitivity to other drugs or to food constituents

          -  History of other allergic diseases or hypersensitivity, unless the investigator
             considers it to be clinically irrelevant for the purpose of this study

          -  Blood donation of &gt; 400 ml in the 60 days before the day of randomization into the
             study

          -  Smoking

          -  Positive result in urine screen for drugs of abuse or in alcohol breath test

          -  Known or suspected to be drug-dependent, including consumption of &gt; 30 g alcohol per
             day

          -  Pregnancy or lactation

          -  Subject is the investigator or any sub-investigator, research assistant, pharmacist,
             study coordinator, other staff or relative thereof directly involved in the conduct of
             the protocol

          -  Mental condition rendering the subject unable to understand the nature, scope, and
             possible consequences of the study

          -  Subject unlikely to comply with protocol, e.g., uncooperative attitude, inability to
             return for follow-up visits, and unlikelihood of completing the study
