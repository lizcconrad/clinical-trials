  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the pharmacokinetics of Kaletra™ (HIV protease
      inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir) in different body compartments and to assess the role of
      four different drug transporters (MDR, MRP1, MRP2 and BCRP) in the tissue distribution of the
      two protease inhibitors. The latter will be studied by comparing intracellular concentrations
      of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with total and free plasma concentrations in
      healthy individuals. These effects will be studied after single dose (day 1), during steady
      state (day 3), and during chronic treatment (day 14).

      Objective:

      Measurement of AUC, Cmax, tmax, t1/2 and clearance (Cl) of the protease inhibitor Kaletra™
      (lopinavir and ritonavir) each in the plasma of healthy individuals

        -  establish free and total plasma - blood cell concentration-relationship

        -  establish free and total plasma - saliva concentration-relationship

        -  establish blood cell concentration - drug transporter expression-relationship
