  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Erythema Toxicum Neonatorum (ETN) is a common skin finding that affects healthy full-term
      babies. Several authors have commented on the possible relationship between ETN and the
      development of atopic conditions, such as atopic dermatitis or respiratory disease later in
      life. There is a paucity of research addressing this issue.
