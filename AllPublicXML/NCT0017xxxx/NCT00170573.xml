  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) formulation has been approved for the treatment of
      recurrent ovarian cancer (ROC). Toxic skin reactions were reported as being the dose-limiting
      toxicity and have an impact on patients' quality of life (QoL). The primary aim of this study
      was to optimise the toxicity profile by choosing a biweekly schedule of PLD Furthermore, QoL
      was investigated. Secondary objective of this study was to evaluate the response rates of
      this new regimen.
