    <textblock>
      This study will determine the efficacy of a medication switch to Aripiprazole for the
      treatment of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder in patients with moderate to high
      symptoms of social anxiety. Specifically the study will test the possibility that a
      medication switch to Aripiprazole reduces symptoms of social anxiety in this patient
      population.

      Although research has shown that social anxiety is very common among patients suffering from
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, it is rarely diagnosed and treated in this patient
      population. This study will determine the efficacy of a medication switch to Aripiprazole for
      the treatment of schizophrenia in patients with moderate to high symptoms of social anxiety.
      Specifically the study will test the possibility that a medication switch to Aripiprazole
      reduces symptoms of social anxiety in this patient population. In addition, the study will
      test the possibility that Aripiprazole significantly improves social adjustment, quality of
      life and level of functioning in these patients. The study may also assess the ability of
      Aripiprazole to reduce sexual dysfunction.
