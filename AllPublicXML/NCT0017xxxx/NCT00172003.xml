    <description>Zoledronic acid, dosage according to calculated creatinine clearance, administered as a 15 minute infusion every 3 weeks for 12 months. Study infusion visits should occur not earlier than the scheduled visit and no later than 3 days after the scheduled visit. The dose of zoledronic acid in patients with baseline creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min was recommended to be 4 mg infused over no less than 15 minutes.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A histologically confirmed diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma with none, one or, at
             maximum, 2 of the following risk factors:

               1. Karnofsky performance status less than 80%

               2. Lactate dehydrogenase greater than 1.5 times upper limit of normal

               3. Hemoglobin less than lower limit of normal

               4. Absence of nephrectomy

          -  Patients must have evidence of at least one cancer-related bone lesion. If diagnosis
             of bone metastases in bone scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-QuickScan is
             unclear radiographic (X-ray, computed tomography [CT] or MRI) confirmation of at least
             one focus is required.

          -  ECOG performance status of 0, 1 or 2.

          -  Life expectancy of ≥ 6 months

          -  Adequate liver function - serum total bilirubin concentration less than 1.5 x upper
             limit of normal value

          -  Patient has given written informed consent prior to any study-specific procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Only patients who received 3 or less applications of an i.v. Bisphosphonate in the
             past are eligible

          -  Previous radiation therapy to bone (including therapeutic radioisotopes such as
             strontium 89) is allowed. However, other loci of bone metastasis must be present,
             which were not treated with radiation therapy and thus can be assessed for primary and
             secondary endpoints.

          -  Abnormal renal function as evidenced by a calculated creatinine clearance &lt; 30
             ml/minute. Creatinine clearance (CrCl) is calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault
             formula: CrCl = [140-age (years)] x weight (kg) {x 0.85 for female patients} [72 x
             serum creatinine (mg/dL)]

          -  Corrected (adjusted for serum albumin) serum calcium concentration &lt; 8.0 mg/dl (2.00
             mmol/L) or ≥ 12.0 mg/dl (3.00 mmol/L)

          -  Patients with clinically symptomatic brain metastases

          -  History of diseases with influence on bone metabolism such as Paget's disease and
             primary hyperparathyroidism

          -  Severe physical or psychological concomitant diseases that might impair compliance
             with the provisions of the study protocol or that might impair the assessment of drug
             or patient safety, e.g. clinically significant ascites, cardiac failure, NYHA III or
             IV, clinically relevant pathologic findings in ECG.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to Zometa® (zoledronic acid) or other bisphosphonates

          -  Pregnancy and lactation

          -  Women of childbearing potential not on a medically recognized form of contraception
             (i.e., oral contraceptives or implants, intrauterine device [IUD], vaginal diaphragm
             or sponge, or condom with spermicide)

          -  Use of other investigational drugs (drugs not marketed for any indication) within 30
             days prior to the date of study inclusion

          -  Use of other investigational drugs (drugs not marketed for any indication) within 30
             days prior to the date of study inclusion

          -  Participation in another trial

          -  Known history or present abuse of alcohol or drugs (accepted social alcohol usage will
             not exclude the patient)

          -  Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, are unlikely to cooperate fully
             during the study

          -  Current active dental problems including infection of the teeth or jawbone (maxilla or
             mandibular); dental or fixture trauma, or a current or prior diagnosis of
             osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), of exposed bone in the mouth, or of slow healing after
             dental procedures.

          -  Recent (within 6 weeks) or planned dental or jaw surgery (e.g. extraction, implants)

        Other protocol-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria may apply.
