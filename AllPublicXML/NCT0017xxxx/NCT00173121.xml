  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      From last decades, because of lacking the powerful quantitative methods, such as real-time
      qPCR, there is no environmental monitoring data about enterovirus transmission. If the major
      transmission routes and risk factor are still not clear, it will be very hard for making the
      prevention and control strategies. Today, the most popular prevention suggestion for children
      is keeping them away from crowded public places during the peak contagious season, because
      enteroviruses are easily transmitted through aerosols over a distance of meters, and even
      between separated rooms (Chang et al., 2004). However, adults may as easily be infected, but
      don』t have any disease symptoms or carry the virus home. Another recommendation is washing
      hands to avoid contact of hands or anything else with the mouth and nose, as it is through
      contact of viruses with the mucosal membranes in the mouth and nasal passages that infection
      occurs. However, these actions did not be great helpful for preventing enterovirus infection
      and spread. Understanding and disrupting the major transmission pass way of enterovirus could
      be more effective than just keeping personal hygiene. Therefore, an applicable environmental
      monitoring program is needed for understanding the transmission routes and risk factor of
      enterovirus infection. In this study, we will monitor enteroviruses in hospital, household
      and kindergarten. For the environmental monitoring of enteroviruses, we will apply
      traditional plaque assay, real-time quantitative PCR and combine with questionnaire-based
      interviews to understand the infectious types and concentration of enterovirus from indoor
      air, surface and water for recognizing the transmission routes of enterovirus and the
      relationships between virus concentration and the symptoms of the cases.

      Environmental Monitoring Program for Enterovirus (1) Case Collection. The studies cases
      include patients who were suspected of having enterovirus illnesses, such as HFMD and
      herpangina. Institutional review board approval was obtained from the Hospital for this study
      and informed consent was obtained from all patients or their parents. (2) Questionnaire.
      questionnaire based interviews were used to collect information about the family members,
      including demographic data, the number of bedrooms in the house, amount of contact time with
      the patient, presence and pattern of current or recent signs and symptoms. (3) Patient and
      culture samples. Laboratory evidence of enterovirus infection was defined as the isolation of
      enterovirus from a throat , and rectal swab sample. (4) Environmental Sampling. (a) Air
      sampling. For the filter/real-time qPCR assay, the air in each ward was filtered through a
      37-mm-diameter Nuclepore filter (Costar, Cambridge, MA), which is a track-etched
      polycarbonate filter consisting of a polycarbonate membrane with straight-through pores of
      uniform size (0.4 μm). The filters were supported by cellulose pads and loaded into open-face
      three-piece plastic cassettes. The pump and filter apparatus were placed within 1 m from the
      patient’s bed on an adjacent nightstand. (b) Surface sampling Regarding surface sampling,
      surfaces of environment and equipment were sampled with moistened sterile cotton swabs.
