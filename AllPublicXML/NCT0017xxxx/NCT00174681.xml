      Primary objective:

      The primary objective of this trial is:

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of initiating Lantus in combination with oral antidiabetics
           drugs compared to oral antidiabetic treatment optimised by enhancing hygienic and
           dietary measures in type 2 diabetics whose blood glucose control is acceptable but not
           optimal on maximum oral treatment, based on the number of patients achieving a HbA1c
           value &lt; 7% at the end of treatment.

      Secondary objectives:

      The secondary objectives of this trial are to compare between the two treatment groups:

        -  The variation in HbA1c between baseline and end of trial.

        -  The frequency of episodes of symptomatic hypoglycaemia (diurnal and nocturnal), severe
           hypoglycaemia (diurnal and nocturnal) and asymptomatic hypoglycaemia.

        -  Mean blood glucose levels at different times of the day.

        -  The variation in weight and lipid in each group between baseline and end of trial.

        -  The incidence of adverse events.

        Inclusion criteria :

        Subjects fulfilling all of the following criteria will be eligible for inclusion in the
        trial:

          -  Type 2 diabetes

          -  24 ≤ BMI ≤ 35 kg/m2

          -  7 % ≤ HbA1c ≤ 8 %

          -  Treated with OAD for at least 2 years

          -  Treated with at least two oral antidiabetics including one sulphonylurea at the
             maximum tolerated dosages and metformin at the maximum tolerated dosages

          -  Not treated with a glinide or thiazolidinedione.

          -  Capable of performing blood glucose self-monitoring and a self-injection of insulin.

          -  Funduscopy within the previous year at the time of inclusion.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patient with any of the following criteria will not be included in the trial:

          -  Type 1 diabetics

          -  Insulin-treated type 2 diabetics or having previously received long-term insulin, or
             treated with a thiazolidinedione or glinide

          -  Fasting blood glucose &lt; 1.20 g/l.

          -  Pregnancy (non-menopausal women must have a pregnancy test before the inclusion visit
             and effective contraception).

          -  Lactation.

          -  History of hypersensitivity to the investigational product or to drugs with similar
             chemical structures.

          -  Systemic treatment with corticosteroids irrespective of the dose and irrespective of
             the previous or anticipated duration of treatment.

          -  Treatment with another product under development in the 2 months preceding the date of
             inclusion in the study.

          -  Subject likely to receive treatments prohibited in the protocol during the trial.

          -  Cardiovascular, hepatic, neurological, endocrine or any other disease making it
             difficult to carry out the protocol or interpret the results.

          -  Proliferative or rapidly progressive or unstable retinopathy for at least 6 months
             after treatment by surgery or laser, or requiring surgery or laser in the 3 months
             following inclusion in the study.

          -  Hepatic impairment:ALT and/or AST more than three times the upper limit of normal at
             the initial assessment.

          -  Renal insufficiency:Serum creatinine &gt;177 µmol/l (&gt;20 mg/l) or creatinine clearance
             &lt;60 ml/min.

          -  Previous or current history of alcohol or drug abuse.

          -  Mental state rendering the subject incapable of understanding the nature, objectives
             and possible consequences of the trial.

          -  Inability to undertake blood glucose self-monitoring and the injection of insulin
             alone.

          -  Subject unable to accept the restrictions of the protocol (uncooperative, unable to
             attend the follow-up visits and probably incapable of completing the trial).

          -  Subjects deprived of freedom by an administrative or judicial decision.

        The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's
        potential participation in a clinical trial.
