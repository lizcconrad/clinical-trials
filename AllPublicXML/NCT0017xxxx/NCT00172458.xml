  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vertebral artery stenosis (VAS) decreases posterior brain perfusion, causing vertebrobasilar
      insufficiency (VBI). It is also an important embolic source to the posterior brain. The most
      frequently involved location is the proximal part of the vessel, including the ostium.
      Various surgical procedures have been described for the treatment of proximal VAS with
      symptoms refractory to medical therapy, but all are technically difficult with high operative
      mortality and morbidity.

      Endovascular intervention has been described as an alternative to surgery. Balloon
      angioplasty is limited by elastic recoil and dissection. The restenosis rates reported in the
      literature varied, as high as 75 %. Stenting offers salvage following unsuccessful balloon
      angioplasty, and primary stenting have been shown to be safe and effective with lower
      restenosis rate. Coronary equipments are ideal for ostial VAS, considering the size of the
      artery and location of the lesion. Recently, Albuquerque et al. reports a relative high
      restenosis rate in a longer follow-up duration. Restenosis seems to become an important issue
      regarding the patientsâ€™ quality of life. However, there is no clinical parameter to predict
      restenosis of VAS. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical results of our
      series of symptomatic ostial VAS treated exclusively with tubular balloon expandable coronary
      stents. We sought to identify predictors of restenosis.

      This is a clinical observation study. Only chart review and angiographic review will be
      performed.
