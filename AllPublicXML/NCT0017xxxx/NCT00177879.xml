      This study will determine the usability of a website for people with schizophrenia versus
      other websites designed for the same purpose.

      The objective of this study is to test and compare the usability of a website developed as
      part of a NIMH-funded project (see IRB #0208128), versus four other online websites in a
      effort to continue to improve website design elements and maximize usability by those
      identified with schizophrenia, a disease that produces cognitive impairments.

      Prior usability testing done to evaluate a website developed as part of a NIMH-funded project
      (see IRB #0208128) was used to develop a website designed specifically to meet the needs of
      those with cognitive deficits. Generally, the website was well received. However, an implicit
      component of this project was to make quantitative statements comparing the website developed
      in this project to other existing websites for individuals with schizophrenia, in order to
      maintain and improve the usability of the website. As such, it is important to test the
      usability of this website versus other websites to continue to improve design elements and
      ease of use for those with serious mental illness.
