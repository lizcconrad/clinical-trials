    <textblock>
      In the present study, we assessed the relation between diastolic dysfunction and myocardial
      fibrosis in hypertensive patients without diabetes mellitus. A total of 20 medically treated
      ambulatory non-diabetic hypertensive patients with normal left ventricular (LV) systolic
      function were enrolled into this study. Myocardial fibrosis was evaluated by serum
      concentrations of amino-terminal propeptides of type I and III procollagen (PINP and PIIINP).
      All patients underwent examinations of diastolic function by echocardiography and
      technetium-99m (99mTc) radionuclide ventriculography. There were 8 patients with PINP ≦53
      μg/l (group 1) and 12 patients with PINP &gt;53 μg/l (group 2). Patients in group 2 had
      significantly lower LV peak filling rate (PFR; 3.2 ± 0.3 vs. 2.5 ± 0.2 end-diastolic
      volume/s) and shorter time to PFR ( 257 ± 41 vs. 174 ± 22 ms). Besides, the group 2 patients
      also had lower right ventricle PFR (1.9 ± 0.2 vs. 1.5 ± 0.1 end-diastolic volume/s) and
      shorter time to PFR ( 221 ± 29 vs. 154 ± 29 ms). Echocardiographic parameters for LV
      diastolic dysfunction (E/A ratio of mitral flow, deceleration time of E flow, velocities of
      pulmonary venous flow [retrograde A wave, systolic /diastolic velocity ratio], isovolumetric
      relaxation time, Tei index) were all comparable between two groups. In multiple regression
      analysis, LV time to peak filling rate was the only parameter that independently predicted
      serum PINP level (p&lt;0.05). In conclusion, elevated serum PINP level reflected LV diastolic
      dysfunction in hypertensive patients without diabetes.
