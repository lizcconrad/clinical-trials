      Primary objectives:

        -  To compare Disease-Free Survival (DFS) of an adjuvant treatment with docetaxel given
           either sequentially or in combination with doxorubicin and followed by CMF to
           doxorubicin alone or in combination with cyclophosphamide and followed by CMF in
           operable breast cancer patients with positive axillary lymph nodes.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To compare DFS of an adjuvant treatment with doxorubicin followed by docetaxel followed
           by CMF to doxorubicin followed by CMF in operable breast cancer patients with positive
           axillary lymph nodes

        -  To compare DFS of an adjuvant treatment with docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin
           followed by CMF to doxorubicin in combination with cyclophosphamide followed by CMF in
           operable breast cancer patients with positive axillary lymph nodes

        -  To compare DFS of an adjuvant treatment with doxorubicin followed by docetaxel followed
           by CMF to doxorubicin in combination with docetaxel followed by CMF in operable breast
           cancer patients with positive axillary lymph nodes, (sequential mono-chemotherapy versus
           polychemotherapy).

        -  To compare overall survival of treatment arms.

        -  To compare toxicity of treatment arms.

        -  To evaluate pathologic and molecular markers for predicting efficacy.

        -  Socioeconomic data will be collected in order to be able to perform a socioeconomic
           analysis by country, when needed.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically proven breast cancer. Interval between definitive surgery that includes
             axillary lymph node dissection and registration must be less than 60 days. A
             representative sample of the primary tumor (either blocks or slides) must be sent to
             the operational office, for central pathology reviews, after patients randomization.

          -  Definitive surgical treatment must be either mastectomy or breast conserving surgery,
             with axillary lymph node dissection (not sampling) for operable breast cancer
             (clinical T1-3, N0-1, M0). Margins of resected specimen from definitive surgery must
             be histologically free of invasive adenocarcinoma and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).
             Lobular carcinoma in-situ does not count as a positive margin. Patients with
             histologically-documented infiltration of the skin (pT4) will not be eligible.
             Patients who have a breast conserving procedure with a positive margin may become
             eligible if they subsequently undergo adequate resection or mastectomy with clear
             margins.

          -  Histologic examination of the tumor: invasive adenocarcinoma with at least one
             axillary lymph node (pN1) showing evidence of tumor among a minimum of eight resected
             lymph nodes. All nodes must be examined by the pathologist. The determination of ER
             (estrogen receptor) and PgR (progesterone receptor) is mandatory and results must be
             known by the end of chemotherapy in order to decide whether hormonal therapy is
             indicated (Biochemical or immunohistochemical methods required ; ER and/or PgR
             positivity should be in accordance with the policy in use at each participating
             center. Each center will specify its own policy).

          -  Age &gt; or = 18 years and age &lt; or = 70 years. The upper age limit is not meant to be
             exclusionary but rather is based on the lack of safety data for women &gt; 70 years of
             age.

          -  Karnofsky Performance status index &gt; or = 70 %.

          -  Normal cardiac function must be confirmed by LVEF (MUGA scan or echocardiography). The
             result must be above the lower limit of normal for the institution.

          -  Laboratory requirements: (within 14 days prior to registration)

               -  Hematology

                    -  Neutrophils &gt; or = 2.0 x 109/L

                    -  Platelets &gt; or =100 x 109/L

                    -  Hemoglobin &gt; or = 10 g/dL

               -  Hepatic function

                    -  Total bilirubin &lt; or = 1 UNL

                    -  ASAT (SGOT) and ALAT (SGPT) &lt; or = 1.5 UNL

                    -  Alkaline phosphatase &lt; or = 2.5 UNL

               -  Renal function

                    -  Creatinine &lt; or = 150 µmol/L (1.5 mg/dL)

                    -  If creatinine is borderline, the calculated creatinine clearance should be &gt;
                       or = 60 mL/min (Cockcroft formula).

          -  Complete staging work-up within 3 months prior to registration. All patients will have
             bilateral mammography, chest X-ray (PA and lateral) and/or CT-scan, abdominal
             ultrasound and/or CT scan, bone scan (in case of positive bone scan suspicious for
             metastases, bone X-ray (or bone CT-scan for spine) on hot spots is mandatory to rule
             out the possibility of metastatic hot spots). Other tests may be performed as
             clinically indicated.

          -  Patients must be accessible for treatment and follow-up. Patients registered on this
             trial must be treated and followed at a participating center which could be a
             Principal or a co-investigator's site. In case patient moves during the follow-up,
             every effort should be done to follow the patient in a participating center.

          -  Negative pregnancy test (urine or serum) within 7 days prior to registration for all
             women of childbearing potential. Patients of childbearing potential must implement
             adequate non-hormonal measures to avoid pregnancy during study treatment(chemotherapy,
             radiotherapy and hormonal therapy).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior systemic anticancer therapy for breast cancer (chemo-immuno-hormonotherapy).

             metastatic(M1) breast cancer.Patients with inoperable residual axillary nodal disease
             or with supraclavicular nodes.

          -  Pre-existing motor or sensory neurotoxicity of a severity ³ grade 2 by NCI criteria.

          -  Other serious illness or medical condition:

               -  congestive heart failure or unstable angina pectoris, previous history of
                  myocardial infarction within 1 year from study entry, uncontrolled hypertension
                  or high-risk uncontrolled arrhythmias

               -  history of significant neurologic or psychiatric disorders including psychotic
                  disorders, dementia or seizures that would prohibit the understanding and giving
                  of informed consent

        A past or current history of ipsilateral ductal in situ or lobular in situ (ipsilateral or
        contralateral) breast carcinoma is not a criterion of exclusion.

          -  Chronic treatment with corticosteroids unless initiated &gt; 6 months prior to study
             entry and at low dose (&lt; or = 20 mg methylprednisolone or equivalent).
