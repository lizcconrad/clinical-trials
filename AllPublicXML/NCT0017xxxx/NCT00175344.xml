    <textblock>
      All patients undergoing breast cancer surgery are left with scars which can significantly
      affect their physical and psychological well being. Patients with breast cancer, motivated to
      optimize healing and function, have inquired about the advisability of scar massage after
      surgery. Although this is a popular technique advocated by physiotherapists and massage
      therapists to improve pain, range of motion, and scar pliability, there is currently no
      scientific research to prove the benefits and/or risks of scar massage in breast cancer
      patients. We propose to study the effect of scar massage on pain, arm function, scar
      formation, and quality of life in patients with breast cancer. Patients who have had breast
      cancer surgery and who have been referred to the BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver Island Centre
      will be offered participation in this research study. To objectively evaluate the effects of
      scar massage, those who agree to participate will be randomly assigned to one of two groups.
      One group will be taught to perform self-massage of the scars as soon as the scars have
      adequately healed. The massage should be done about 10 minutes each day for a total of 6
      months. The other group will not be taught self-massage and will be asked to not massage
      their breast scars. In both groups, we will monitor pain, upper body range of motion, scar
      characteristics and quality of life using standardized criteria for 2 years from the time of
      surgery. Problems with infections or blood or fluid accumulation at the scar areas will also
      be monitored. After 2 years, the information collected will be analyzed and compared to see
      if there are differences in pain, function or quality of life between the two groups. The
      results from this study will provide scientific proof of whether or not scar massage after
      surgery is beneficial for patients with breast cancer.

      This is a prospective randomized controlled trial design. Women who have undergone breast
      cancer surgery (breast conserving surgery or mastectomy) and who meet the eligibility
      criteria specified will be offered study participation. After obtaining informed consent,
      subjects will be randomized between two cohorts: scar massage (intervention group) versus no
      scar massage (control group). The primary outcome is scar-related pain (scored using the
      McGill Pain Questionnaire Short Form). The secondary outcomes are: upper body range of
      motion, physical parameters of the scar (pliability, scar height, vascularity and
      pigmentation scored using the Vancouver Scar Scale), lymphedema (evaluated by arm
      circumference measurements) and quality of life (using the Functional Assessment of Cancer
      Therapy (FACT)-B breast cancer-specific instrument).

      A sample size of 143 patients per arm was estimated to detect a 30% difference in the primary
      outcome of postoperative scar-related pain between the intervention and the control groups
      with 80% statistical power.
