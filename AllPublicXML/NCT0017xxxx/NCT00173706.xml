  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study designed to test the hypothesis that treatment with L-carnitine will improve
      the quality of life and some specific symptoms and signs in patients with renal failure
      submitted to hemodialysis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      L-Carnitine is a naturally occurring compound that facilitates the transport of fatty acids
      into mitochondria for beta-oxidation. A lack of carnitine in hemodialysis patients is caused
      by insufficient carnitine synthesis and particularly by the loss through dialytic membranes,
      leading in some patients to carnitine depletion with a relative increase of esterified forms.
      Many studies have shown that L-carnitine supplementation leads to improvements in several
      complications seen in uremic patients, including cardiac complications, impaired exercise and
      functional capacities, muscle symptoms, increased symptomatic intradialytic hypotension, and
      erythropoietin-resistant anemia, normalizing the reduced carnitine palmitoyl transferase
      activity in red cells.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients with the following criteria will be eligible for participation in this study:

          1. Male or female adults over 18 years of age

          2. On hemodialysis for at least one year

          3. Interdialysis weight gain &lt; 5%

          4. Bicarbonate dialysis 3 times per week

          5. Modality of dialysis unchanged for 3 months prior to entry into the study (concerning
             dialysis-time and mode: bicarbonate, acetate dialysis)

          6. Have one of the following symptoms and signs that have not responded to diet or
             pharmacological intervention:

               1. persistent weakness affecting daily life

               2. malnutrition

               3. anemia (hemoglobin [Hb] &lt; 12 g/dl; hematocrit [Hct] &lt; 30%)

               4. experiencing intradialytic complications (cramping, muscular pain, hypotension,
                  hypertension, head-ache)

          7. On regular treatment with vitamin B12 and folates

          8. Normal iron status (ferritin &gt; 100 ng/ml; transferrin saturation [TSAT] &gt; 20%)

          9. Informed consent obtained

         10. Patients with diabetes mellitus are allowed to enter the study if they have stable
             glycaemic control on diet or pharmacological treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:
