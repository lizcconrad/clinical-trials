    <textblock>
      Our experience suggests that further research with alemtuzumab is attractive in islet
      transplantation. Therefore, in this study we propose to combine alemtuzumab induction
      pre-transplant, with tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil maintenance immunosuppression
      post-transplant. In the critical early phase post transplant, we anticipate that this regimen
      will prove to be more effective in control of autoimmunity or rejection events, and have a
      more desirable side-effect profile, than previously tested combinations of induction and
      immunosuppressive agents.

      This trial is a single-center, prospective, open-label study in 12 Type 1 diabetic
      participants receiving an islet-alone transplant along with alemtuzumab induction therapy
      followed by combination tacrolimus and MMF maintenance immunosuppression. Participants will
      receive 1 to 3 infusions of pancreatic islets of sufficient quantity to attain insulin
      independence.

      The primary objective of this protocol is to assess the safety of a treatment regimen
      utilizing alemtuzumab induction and a combination of tacrolimus and MMF maintenance
      immunosuppression in adult Type 1 diabetic participants receiving their first islet
      transplant.
