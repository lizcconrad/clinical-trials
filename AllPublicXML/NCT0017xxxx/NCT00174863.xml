          -  No distant metastases as evidenced by bone scan (+ or - centered X-Ray or MRI), and
             spiral thoracoabdominopelvic CT scan.

          -  Effective castration throughout the study. Any prior anti-androgen therapy should be
             stopped with documented continued elevation of PSA 4 weeks after the cessation of
             flutamide (6 weeks for bicalutamide).

          -  Serum testosterone levels &lt; 50ng/dL at the time of progression and throughout the

          -  Extensive metabolizer by CYP2D6 genotyping.

          -  Karnofsky Performance Status &gt; or = to 70% and life expectancy &gt; 6 months.

          -  Adequate hematological, renal and liver function.

          -  Signed written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Poor metabolizers by CYP2D6 genotyping.

          -  Prior palliative radiotherapy or any prior chemotherapy or experimental therapy.

          -  More than one line of any prior anticancer treatment with estrogen (estrogen or
             estramustine) if discontinued at least 4 weeks before study entry.

          -  Concomitant administration of biphosphonate or chronic corticosteroids.

          -  Presence of progressive symptoms not adequately controlled with non opioid medications

          -  Concomitant use of medications known to be cytochrome P450 2D6 inhibitors as listed in
             protocol appendice

          -  Previous malignancies except if there has been a disease-free interval of at least 5
             years and except curatively treated non-melanoma skin cancer

          -  Other serious illness or medical condition, which would not permit the patient to be
