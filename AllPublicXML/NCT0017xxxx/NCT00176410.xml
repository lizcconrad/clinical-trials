  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is evidence that the degenerative changes leading to aortic stenosis are caused by a
      chronic inflammatory process. Furthermore the development of aortic stenosis is partially
      dependent on typical cardiovascular risk factors. An inflammatory process as well as those
      risk factors are amenable for medical therapy. As such the use of statins (HMG CoA reductase
      inhibitors) would be an appealing concept to reduce both those risks for development of
      aortic stenosis. Aim of this study is to evaluate the usefulness of statin therapy on the
      progression of aortic stenosis.

      This study will be a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-armed clinical trial
      trial to test the influence of statin therapy on the progression of calcified aortic stenosis
      in patients with asymptomatic mild to moderate aortic stenosis. After completion of all
      baseline investigations patients will be randomly assigned to the verum group (fluvastatin
      group) or to the control group (placebo group). Patients in the verum group will receive
      fluvastatin in a starting dose of 40 mg per day. The dose should be increased up to 80 mg per
      day. The treatment should be continued until the study end (24 months). Follow up
      investigations will be performed after 6, 12, and 18 months. After 24 months the final
      investigations will be performed.
