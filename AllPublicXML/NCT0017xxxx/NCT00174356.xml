        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  At least one target lesion that is unidimensionally measurable as defined by Response
             Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST ; Appendix B.2 ) and has not been
             previously irradiated; a tumor that expresses at least one member of the erbB family
             of receptors (as determined by immunohistochemical evaluation by a Sponsor-designated
             core laboratory)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior chemotherapy, biologic therapy, immunotherapy, treatment with Herceptin, or
             treatment with investigational agents (including CI 1033); hormonal therapy within 28
             days prior to baseline disease assessment (to exclude the possibility of a
             hormone-withdrawal response); prior definitive radiation therapy to the primary cancer
             site; not yet recovered from the acute effects of surgery or palliative radiotherapy;
             brain metastases.
