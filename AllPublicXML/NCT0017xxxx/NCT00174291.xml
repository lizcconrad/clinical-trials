      -  To evaluate the effect of increasing the growth hormone dose on the statural response

        -  To assess the value of early treatment during the course of arthritic disease by
           comparing the height acquired in the medium term by children in the two groups: treated
           from the start, or 1 year to 15 months after the diagnosis of CJA, or treated for 4
           years after the diagnosis

      This trial terminated on 10-Jun-2011 due to prolonged issues with drug accountability and
      data collection discrepancies. The decision to terminate was not based on any safety

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Annual Rate of Growth Standard Deviation Score (SDS) at Year 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Year 3</time_frame>
    <description>Annual rate of growth SDS was obtained by measuring the annual growth rate, subtracting chronological age- and gender-appropriate mean annual growth rate and dividing the result by standard deviation of that mean (as obtained from chronological age- and gender-specific population reference data). SDS indicated how many standard deviations higher (in case of positive SDS) or lower (in case of negative SDS) participant's value was relative to the mean of the reference population.</description>

    <description>Annual rate of growth SDS was obtained by measuring the annual growth rate, subtracting chronological age- and gender-appropriate mean annual growth rate and dividing the result by standard deviation of that mean (as obtained from chronological age- and gender-specific population reference data).

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Height Standard Deviation Score (SDS) at Year 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Year 3</time_frame>
    <description>Height was measured using a wall mounted device (example, Harpenden stadiometer). Height SDS was obtained by measuring the height, subtracting chronological age- and gender-appropriate mean height and dividing the result by standard deviation of that mean (as obtained from chronological age- and gender-specific population reference data). SDS indicated how many standard deviations higher (in case of positive SDS) or lower (in case of negative SDS) participant's value was relative to the mean of the reference population.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Predicted Height Standard Deviation Score (SDS) at Year 3</title>
        <description>Predicted height was calculated according to Greulich and Pyle using Bayley Pinneau method. Predicted height SDS was obtained by calculating the predicted height, subtracting chronological age- and gender-appropriate mean predicted height and dividing the result by standard deviation of that mean (as obtained from chronological age- and gender-specific population reference data). SDS indicated how many standard deviations higher (in case of positive SDS) or lower (in case of negative SDS) participant’s value was relative to the mean of the reference population.</description>

        <population>FAS included all participants who received at least 1 dose of study treatment and had at least 1 post-baseline height measurement. Here, N (number of participants analyzed) signifies those participants who were evaluable for this measure.</population>
