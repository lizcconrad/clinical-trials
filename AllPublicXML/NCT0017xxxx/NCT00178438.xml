      The purpose of this study is to determine the best role for capsule endoscopy in diagnosing
      Crohn's disease.

    <textblock>
      Wireless capsule endoscopy (CE) is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved technology
      that allows viewing of the entire small-bowel. Capsule endoscopy involves swallowing a
      pill-sized camera that sends images to a data recorder worn on a vest. Because Crohn's
      disease (CD) often involves the small bowel, we would like to find out if capsule endoscopy
      is useful in diagnosing small-bowel Crohn's disease. Current methods for diagnosing
      small-bowel Crohn's disease include colonoscopy, esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD),
      enteroscopy (ENT), single contrast barium small-bowel follow through (SBFT), and double
      contrast small-bowel enteroclysis (SBE), but these tests are unable to identify the presence
      or extent of small-bowel disease in many patients.
