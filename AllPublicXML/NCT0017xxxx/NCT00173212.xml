  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adenomyosis refers to the presence of endometrial glands and stroma that is haphazardly deep
      within the myometrium. However, the etiology and pathologic mechanism responsible for
      adenomyosis are not yet very well known. Our previous results revealed that the expression of
      killer inhibitory receptors on natural killer cells was decreased in eutopic endometrium in
      women with adenomyosis. It implies that the formation of adenomyosis might be due to abnormal
      endometrial tissues, but not the aberrant local immunological dysfunction in myometrium. Our
      further investigation revealed that in vitro coculture of macrophages and endometrial stromal
      cells (ESCs) increase the expression of IL-6 mRNA in ESC, which might further enhance the
      proliferation of ESC and subsequently result in the formation of ectopic endometrial implants
      in adenomyosis.

      Abnormal cell proliferation has been generally found in the tumorigenesis, including the
      formation of endometriosis. Adenomyosis is considered to have a similar pathophysiology with
      endometriosis, and it must be interesting to examine whether there is abnormal cell
      proliferation in the eutopic endometrium of adenomyosis. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was found
      to promote proliferation of ESCs via induction of TNF-a and IL-8 expression, whereas IFN-g
      significantly inhibited ESCs proliferation. Therefore, whether abnormal cell proliferation
      occurs under the effects of LPS and IFN-g in the eutopic endometrium of adenomyosis needs
      further clarification.

      Adenomyosis preferentially affects women between the ages of 35 and 50 years, and the
      symptoms subside gradually after menopause. It is well known that there is a close
      conjunction between estrogen and adenomyosis. Estradiol (E2) was demonstrated to induce
      endometrial cell proliferation, whereas medroxyprogesterone (MPA) inhibited endometrial cell
      proliferation via antagonizing estrogenic effects. Experiments to investigate these steroid
      effects on ESC proliferation in vitro in the eutopic endometrium of adenomyosis are of
      clinical relevance.

      In this study, we try to collect endometrial tissues from women with and without adenomyosis,
      and then purify ESCs from endometrium. ESCs are cultured for 2 days with the supplement of
      LPS, IFN-gamma, Estradiol, MPA and Estradiol+MPA. Quantification of cell proliferation was
      done with Cell Proliferation Assay Kit and immunocytochemical detection of Ki-67, in an
      attempt to examine the cell proliferation of ESCs in women with adenomyosis.

      Eutopic endometrium was obtained and separated into single endometrial stromal cell (ESC) in
      women with adenomyosis (study group) and without adenomyosis (control group).

      ESCs are cultured for 2 days with the supplement of LPS, IFN-gamma, Estradiol, MPA and
      Estradiol+MPA.

      Quantification of cell proliferation was done with Cell Proliferation Assay Kit and
      immunocytochemical detection of Ki-67.
