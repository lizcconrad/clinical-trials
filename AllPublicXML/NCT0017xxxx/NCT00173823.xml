  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the reports of the United States Renal Data System (USRDS), there is a 25%
      annual mortality rate with nearly 50% of all reported maintenance hemodialysis (HD) patient
      deaths attributed to atherosclerosis-related complications. Although traditional risk factors
      of cardiovascular disease (CVD) are common in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients, they
      alone may be insufficient to account for their high prevalence of CVD. Recent evidence
      demonstrated high plasma homocysteine levels have been established as a risk factor of
      chronic inflammation and atherosclerosis in patients with ESRD.

      Malnutrition and inflammation was associated with poor quality of life, morbidity and
      mortality. We, the researchers at National Taiwan University Hospital, hope to establish the
      best predictive profile of HD patient outcome. Thus, we establish several protocols to
      complete this work.
