  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of a single oral dose
      of NPS 1776 in the acute treatment of migraine pain and associated symptoms.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Migraine, the most common cause of recurrent severe or disabling headache, is diagnosed on
      the basis of a clinical history of intermittent headache with autonomic, constitutional, and
      neurologic disturbances.

      Many antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) have demonstrated efficacy as acute and/or prophylaxis
      therapy for migraine, even though the mechanism of action of the various AEDs is poorly
      understood.

      NPS 1776, isovaleramide, is a neutral aliphatic amide. The mechanism by which NPS 1776 exerts
      its therapeutic actions in nonclinical animal models of disease is unclear. The same is true
      for many antiepileptics on the market today. NPS 1776 does not appear to bind directly to
      various CNS receptor centers, although it shows a broad range of anticonvulsant activity in
      multiple animal models of seizures. This broad profile of anticonvulsant activity is similar
      to that of valproic acid (VPA), and may also predict NPS 1776 efficacy in the treatment of
      migraine.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of migraine for at least a year prior to screening.

          2. Experiences 2-10 migraine headaches per month (with at least 24 hours between
             episodes) and no more than 15 headache days per month in the 3 months prior to
             screening.

          3. Ability and willingness to arrive at the investigator's center within 1 hour (±5 min)
             of migraine pain onset (defined as pain that is consistent with the subject's usual
             migraine and is of at least moderate severity).

          4. Ability and willingness to abstain from taking medications not allowed by the protocol
             and to meet phone and check-in criteria.

          5. Ability and willingness to undergo a comprehensive urine toxicology screen for both
             licit and illicit drugs.

          6. Ability and willingness to complete a migraine-history diary from screening to
             treatment with study drug and a migraine-treatment diary from discharge through the
             remainder of the 24-hour period following study-drug treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Unstable or uncontrolled significant metabolic, hepatic, renal, hematological,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, urological, neurological (except migraine headaches), or
             psychiatric disorders.

          2. Severe or acute cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, uncontrolled hypertension,
             or basilar or hemiplegic migraines.

          3. History of hypersensitivity, allergies, or nonresponse to valproic acid.

          4. Have taken VPA or other AED in the 30 days prior to screening, or are taking a
             migraine prophylaxis treatment other than a stable dose of propranolol or tricyclic
             antidepressant.

          5. Migraine attacks that in the investigator's opinion are associated with intractable
             nausea and/or vomiting.

          6. Any acute or chronic condition that in the investigator's opinion would limit the
             subject's ability to complete and/or participate in this clinical study or would place
             the subject at increased risk.

          7. Have newly started or changed the dose of either feverfew or magnesium (above 200 mg,
             the amount in common daily supplements) within 3 months prior to screening.
