  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alopecia areata is an autoimmune condition resulting in hair loss and complete baldness
      (alopecia totalis). Published evidence says that it is mediated by T-lymphocytes. Plaquenil
      is an anti-inflammatory drug approved by the FDA for malaria, lupus erythematosus, and
      rheumatoid arthritis. It has an effect on T-lymphocyte mediated inflammation, making it a
      logical choice for a treatment trail for alopecia areata.

      Alopecia areata is a high prevalence autoimmune disease with significant consequences.
      Alopecia areata is a tissue restricted autoimmune disease directed at the hair follicle,
      resulting in hair loss. Patients frequently suffer severe psychiatric consequences. This is
      especially true of girls and young women who become bald. The incidence of alopecia areata in
      the USA (Minnesota is 20.2 per 100,000 person-years with a lifetime risk of approximately
      1.7%. There is no significant gender difference. The disease is often chronic with a
      remitting, relapsing course. Although it responds to immunosuppression, generalized
      immunosuppression has significant morbidity and treatment is frequently frustrating and not
      successful. New treatment options are essential. With evidence that alopecia areata is a
      T-lymphocyte mediated autoimmune condition it has become a model system for the study of
      pathogenesis and treatment of T-cell mediated autoimmunity and as such is a model for a host
      of additional T-cell mediated autoimmune conditions.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        1. Severe alopecia areata: &gt;75% loss of scalp hair or alopecia areata totalis: 100% loss of
        scalp hair above with or without loss of body hair (alopecia universalis) 2. Group I (8
        subjects): Duration of disease less than 1 year 3. Group II (8 subjects): Duration of
        disease greater than 1 year 4. At least 18 years old 5. Able to give consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        1. Coexisting significant systemic disease that would increase risk of hydroxychloroquine
        (e.g. renal disease, liver disease, alcoholism, anemia, blood dyscrasia, psoriasis,
        porphyria) 2. Systemic immunosuppressive therapy within 3 weeks (e.g. prednisone,
        cyclosporin, azathioprine) 3. Immunosuppressive conditions (e.g. HIV infection, cancer
        immunotherapy genetic immunodeficiency 4. Medications with potential interaction to
        hydroxychloroquine (e.g. liver toxins, bone marrow toxins) 5. Pregnancy, or breast feeding
        6. Women of child bearing potential not able or willing to use two methods of contraception
        at least one of which is not a hypersensitivity to 4-aminoquinolone compounds (chloroquine
        and hydroxychloroquine) 9. Glucose-6-phosphate deficiency.
