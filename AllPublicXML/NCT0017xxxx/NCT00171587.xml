    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, dose limiting toxicity,
      and maximum tolerated dose of vatalanib administered orally once daily in combination with
      capecitabine in patients with advanced cancer. The study is also designed to determine the
      effect of vatalanib on the pharmacokinetics of capecitabine and the effect of capecitabine on
      the pharmacokinetics of vatalanib, and to describe the anti-tumor activity of this
      combination regimen.

             study only)

          -  Patients with histologically confirmed metastatic solid tumors or colorectal cancer
             presenting with metastatic disease and who received up to four prior chemotherapies
             for metastatic disease (for dose expansion phase of the study only)

          -  Measurable or non-measurable disease as determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in
             Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria

          -  Age &gt;= 18 years old

          -  Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) of &gt;= 70

          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1.5 x 10^9/L

          -  Hemoglobin (Hgb) &gt;= 9 g/dl

          -  Platelets &gt;= 100 x 10^9/L

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST/SGOT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT/SGPT) &lt;= 3.0 x
             upper limit of normal (ULN)

          -  Serum bilirubin &lt;= 1.5 x ULN

          -  Serum creatinine &lt;= 1.5 x ULN and 24-hour creatinine clearance &gt;= 50 ml/min

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 3 months

          -  Written informed consent obtained according to local guidelines

        Exclusion Criteria:

             (for dose escalation phase of the study only)

          -  Patients who have received chemotherapy less than 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or
             mitomycin-C and 2 weeks for vincristine) prior to entry on this study or who have not
             recovered from side effects of such therapy

             measurable disease.

          -  Major surgery within 2 weeks prior to entry on this study or patients who have not
             recovered from side effects of such therapy
