  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although clinical decision tools (CDTs) exist for a variety of treatments, CDTs designed to
      support personalized breast reconstruction decisions, particularly about type and timing of
      reconstruction, are lacking. The objective of this proposal is to develop and pilot test a
      clinical decision tool that provides personalized risk information and reflects patients'
      preferences and clinical needs.

    <description>-The investigators will recruit patients who are scheduled for a plastic/reconstruction consultation. Investigators will also identify patients who have completed a mastectomy, or are scheduled for one, and are considering reconstruction, but don't have an appointment with a plastic/reconstructive surgeon. A study team member will call the patient to determine their interest and ask them to come to their scheduled appointment 30 minutes early to meet a coordinator. Patients will be randomized using computer random assignment. If the patient does not have an appointment, she will schedule a convenient time to complete study procedures with research staff. Patients will interact with the decision tool. They will be asked to answer a survey. After the appointment, for those who have clinical appointments, the team will collect information about the duration of the consultation and measures of shared decision making. Patient participation time is expected to be approximately 30 minutes.</description>

The investigators will also identify patients who have completed a mastectomy, or are scheduled for one, and are considering reconstruction, but do not have an appointment with a plastic/reconstructive surgeon. A study team member will phone the patient to determine their interest and ask them to come to their scheduled appointment 30 minutes early to meet a coordinator. Patients will be randomized using computer random assignment. Patients will interact with the usual care surgical information booklet. They will be asked to answer a survey containing several questions. After the appointment, the team will collect information about the duration of the consultation and outcome measures. Patient participation time is expected to be approximately 30 minutes.</description>

Provides detail about breast reconstruction, asks participant questions about health and medications to personalize risks for breast reconstruction outcomes
The tool also goes into pros/cons of breast reconstruction, talks about differences between types of reconstruction, helps people weigh when to have reconstruction (immediate vs. delayed), shows participant different pictures of breast reconstruction outcomes, and assesses patients' knowledge and preferences for reconstruction.</description>
