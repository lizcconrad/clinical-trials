  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Every year 75000 new-born babies are hospitalized in neonatology yard in France with about
      60000 born prematurely.

      Studies showed that parents presence is good for the baby development , decrease the stress
      due to hospitalization.It's also efficient for the attachment between the baby and parents.

      Although the team try to settle a good atmosphere to establish this link and let parents take
      their position,it seems that the time taken to stay with the baby is less moreover the night.

      The aim of the study is to evaluate the time of presence to find tools to increase this time
      in the neonatotology yard
