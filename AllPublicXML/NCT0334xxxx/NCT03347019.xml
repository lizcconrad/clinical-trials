  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate the efficacy of an accelerated
      rehabilitation regime for patients undergoing early arthroscopic stabilization for first-time
      anterior dislocation in terms of clinical outcome, return to play data and recurrence rates.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traditional rehabilitation regimes post arthroscopic stabilization commonly stipulate a
      period of immobilization of between 2 weeks and 6 weeks.This is apparently embedded in
      practice and is reportedly based on tissue healing times. However early mobilisation would
      allow good clinical results in terms of clinical outcome, return to play data and recurrence
      rates.

    <measure>3 Dimensional Kinematic Analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>at sixth months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Scapular kinematic measurements were conducted by using three-dimensional electromagnetic system (Motion MonitorÂ® Skeleton Analysis System, Innovative Sports Training Inc, Chicago, USA). The three-dimensional electromagnetic system consists of motion monitor software, transmitters and sensors integrated into this software (Flock of Birds System).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>at sixth months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Pain was assessed by using numeric Visual Analogue Scale at rest, at night and during daily living activities. In numeric Visual Analogue Scale 0 represents &quot;no pain&quot;, 10 represents &quot;unbearable pain&quot;</description>

    <measure>First Functional Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>at sixth months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>1. The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand Questionnaire (DASH) is a 30-item questionnaire that looks at the ability of a patient to perform certain upper extremity activities and that measures an individual's ability to complete tasks, absorb forces, and severity of symptoms.This questionnaire is a self-report questionnaire that patients can rate difficulty and interference with daily life on a 5 point Likert scale.DASH Questionnaire will be calculated by using DASH Scoring Formula</description>

    <measure>Second Functional Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>at sixth months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>2. The American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Shoulder Score (ASES) is used to measure shoulder pain and functional limitations.The scores range from 0 to 100 and the highest score represents improvement in shoulder function after treatment interventions and to check the patient's ability to tolerate or perform the activities of daily living.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Third Functional Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>at sixth months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>3. Constant-Murley Shoulder Score (CONSTANT) is a 100-points scale composed of individual parameters.These parameters define the level of pain and the ability to carry out the normal daily activities of the patient.The Constant Score was introduced to determine the functionality after the treatment of a shoulder injury.The test is divided into four subscales: pain (15 points), activities of daily living (20 points), strength (25 points) and range of motion (40 points).The higher the score, the higher the quality of the function.</description>
