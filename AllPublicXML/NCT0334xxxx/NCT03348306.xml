      Introduction

      AntiPhospholipid antibody Syndrome (APS) is an acquired autoimmune disorder defined by the
      presence of persistent thrombosis or obstetric manifestations together with the presence of
      persistent antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). Patients are young and at high risk of
      recurrence. The current challenge is the identification of patients at high risk of organ
      damage that directly impact morbidity and mortality.

      Small vessels thrombosis can be asymptomatic but detectable by MRI. Apart from APS, it was
      shown that the detection of asymptomatic ischemic events identify patients at risk for
      symptomatic ischemic events. Demonstrating this in patients with APS would prevent thrombotic
      complications.

      The investigators' hypothesis is that a significant proportion of patients with APS would
      have asymptomatic organ involvement.

      Objectives

      The primary objective is to determine the frequency of asymptomatic target organ (s) (heart,
      brain, kidney) in APS patients.

      Secondary objectives are (i) to determine the frequency of each type of MRI abnormality, (ii)
      to identify the factors associated with asymptomatic target organ lesion, (iii) to describe
      the parameters of echocardiography associated with cerebral and cardiac MRI, and (iv) to
      assess the feasibility of a one-time cardiovascular and brain MRI.

      Methods and analysis

      This is a prospective interventional, cross-sectional, non-randomized, monocentric clinical
      study. The investigators expect to include 50 consecutive patients with APS followed in the
      department of Vascular Medicine at Nancy University Hospital.

      Within 15 days post-inclusion, a one-time cardiac and cerebral MRI will be performed. For
      each patient, the number of target organs involvements will be calculated and the frequencies
      will be compared by Fisher or chi-2 tests.
