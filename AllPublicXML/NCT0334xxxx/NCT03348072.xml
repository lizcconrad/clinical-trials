    <textblock>
      This is a comparative study on the survival and long-term quality of life of Jehovah's
      witnesses having undergone a cardiac surgery and having refused blood transfusions for
      religious reasons. This group will be compared with two other groups having no restrictions
      on this subject.

      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the impact of this decision on survival and
      postoperative quality of life, in the long term.

    <description>Score computed with the &quot;MacNew Heart Disease health-related quality of life instrument&quot;.The MacNew is a valuable tool for assessing and evaluating health related quality of life in heart disease patients. It consists of 27 questions, falling into 3 possible domains: physicial limitation capacity (13 questions), emotional domain (14 questions), social domain (13 questions), symptom related (5 questions). The time frame for the MacNew is the previous two weeks. Scoring of the MacNew is simple: one score in each domain and a global score (4 scores). The maximum possible score in any domain is 7 [high HRQL] and the minimum is 1 [poor HRQL].The global score is calculated as the average over all scored items unless one of the domains is completely missing.</description>
