  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the addition of a structured nurse led patient management programme to
      standard of care in gout patients. Half of the patient will receive the nurse led programme
      in addition to standard of care and the other half will receive standard of care only.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is evidence from other chronic diseases that nurse led care in addition to standard of
      care ameliorates outcomes.

      In gout the primary target is the serum uric acid level (SUA). We intend to demonstrate the
      superiority of a structured nurse led patient management programme over standard of care in a
      randomized controlled study.

      The primary endpoint is the percentage of patients reaching the target SUA level at 6 months
      follow-up.
