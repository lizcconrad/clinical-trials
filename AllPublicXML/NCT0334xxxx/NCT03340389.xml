  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To study the correlations among the dysfunctional lens index (DLI), Lens Opacities
      Classification System III (LOCS III) nuclear opalescence grading score, preoperative
      corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), the objective scatter index (OSI) and Scheimpflug
      based average lens density in age-related cataracts. To investigate the potential of the DLI
      as a novel surgery decision maker via the Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.

      Each patient received a comprehensive eye examination, including corrected distance visual
      acuity (CDVA) preoperatively and the day after surgery, subjective refraction, slit-lamp
      evaluation, noncontact tonometry (TX-F; Cannon, Tokyo, Japan), and dilated fundus
      examination. According to the surgery decision made by the three surgeons based on the slit
      lamp biomicroscopy and CDVA, patients were divided into two groups: Surgical and
      Non-Surgical. The results of the DLI, OSI and average lens density (ALD) were masked to the
      surgeons. The DLI, OSI, average lens density, LOCS III nuclear opalescence grading, and
      preoperative CDVA were obtained. Correlations among these parameters were analyzed. ROC
      curves were used to analyze DLI values to determine a value to separate between surgical and
      non-surgical cataracts.
