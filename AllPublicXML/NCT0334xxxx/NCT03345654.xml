  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This translational project aims to optimize the fitting of hearing aids by development and
      clinical validation of a toolset that guides signal processing choice based on the individual
      auditory and cognitive abilities of the patient. The clinical trial portion of the project
      will validate clinical use of the toolset by comparing a population of patients fit with the
      toolset to those fit using current standard of care. Data will be collected on patient
      outcomes, clinical impact (number of visits needed to adjust the hearing aids) and
      audiologist feedback regarding professional confidence. Clinician feedback will also be
      collected to refine implementation of the clinical application and improve its usability. It
      is hypothesized that hearing aid fittings completed using the clinical toolset will result in
      better patient outcomes, fewer post-fitting visits and a higher level of clinician confidence
      compared to standard-of-care hearing aid fittings.

    <description>We will use a modified set of questions drawn from the Evidence-based Practice Confidence (EPIC) Scale. The full scale has been validated across multiple health disciplines. The clinician rates professional confidence from 0% to 100% in increments of 10%, where 0% indicates the clinician has no confidence in his/her ability (i.e., lowest possible value) and 100% indicates complete confidence in his/her ability (i.e., highest possible value). An example question is: &quot;How confident are you in your ability to continually evaluate the effect of your course of action on your patient's or client's outcomes&quot;?</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  sensorineural hearing loss with pure-tone thresholds 25-70 decibels hearing level (dB
             HL) at octave frequencies between 250 and 4000 Hz, 4 (.5, 1, 2, 3 kHz) frequency
             pure-tone average (PTA) of ≥ 30 dB HL. Listeners will have symmetrical losses, defined
             here as a 4-frequency PTA difference between ears ≤ 20 dB HL.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  conductive loss (air-bone gaps &gt; 10 dB at any frequency and/or abnormal immittance) -

          -  scoring &lt; 23 on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment

          -  Hearing loss exceeding the limits that can be successfully aided with hearing aids
             (i.e., profound hearing loss)

          -  Hearing loss remediated with a cochlear implant (cannot wear hearing aids)

          -  Significant history of otologic or neurologic disorders

          -  Non English speaking participants

          -  Any clinically significant unstable or progressive medical condition

          -  Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, places the participant at
             unacceptable risk if he or she were to participate in the study.
