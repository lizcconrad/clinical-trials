  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the clinical efficacy and neuro-cognitive
      mechanisms of Gaze-Contingent Usic Reward Therapy for social anxiety disorder, compared with
      treatment with SSRIs or waitlist control.

      Attention biases in threat processing have been assigned a prominent role in the etiology and
      maintenance of anxiety disorders. The purpose of this study is to determine whether giving
      gaze-contingent feedback is an effective treatment for social anxiety disorder, compared to
      treatment with SSRI (Escitelopram) and a waitlist control. A secondary purpose is to explore
      the unique neuro-cognitive mechanisms of this treatment, using eye-tracking, MRI and fMRI
      measurements. Participants will be assessed using clinical interviews and self-rated
      questionnaires before, during and after 12 weeks of treatment or wait. Outcome measures will
      be social anxiety symptoms, as well as dwell time on threat in eye-tracking paradigms tested
      in previous studies, and BOLD signals in MRI measurements. Neuro-cognitive mechanisms will be
      explored as potential mediators of clinical efficacy.

    <measure>Change from baseline - the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale - Diagnostic Interview scores</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks into intervention, 1 week after intervention completion and 3 months after intervention completion</time_frame>
    <description>The LSAS is a 24-item scale, each item corresponding to a situation selected on the basis of clinical experience. Each item is rated on a severity scale ranging from 0 to 3 with regard to the passing week, measuring separately two components of social anxiety, specifically, fear/anxiety and avoidance of social interaction and performance situations. Although the assessor may request and ask for further detail and adjust the rating based on clinical experience, this option is not often exercised, and inter-rater agreement is not considered to be a relevant concern.</description>

    <time_frame>At baseline, at weeks 2,4,6,8,10 of the intervention or wait period, 1 week after intervention completion and 3 months after intervention completion</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 17-item self-report measure of social anxiety evaluating fear, avoidance and physiological discomfort. Each item is rated on scale ranging from 0 to 4 with a possible total score of 68.</description>
