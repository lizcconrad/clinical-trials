  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In close collaboration with the Nevada County 4-H Youth Development Program, the Shaping
      Healthy Choices Program was implemented utilizing 4-H teenagers as cross-age teachers for
      younger youth. The 4-H Youth Development Program is an education program of the University of
      California Cooperative Extension that emphasizes learning citizenship, leadership, and life
      skills. The program creates positive opportunities for youth to learn, develop skills, and
      become engaged in their local communities. This is accomplished with combined efforts of
      youth, volunteer leaders, and University staff and faculty through a fun, hands-on learning
      approach to non-formal education. As a requirement to participate in the program, all youth
      had to enroll in 4-H for the 2016-2017 year. Teenagers were initially trained in
      inquiry-based and experiential learning techniques before facilitating the program. Teenage
      teachers collectively lead classroom education, garden activities, and cooking
      demonstrations. Additionally, teenage teachers, UC Cooperative Extension staff, and UC Davis
      students organized and implemented a community health fair for elementary-aged children.

      Measurements were taken on nutrition knowledge, vegetables preferences, civic responsibility,
      program fidelity, and self-efficacy for teaching nutrition. A parent interview was also
      conducted to gauge parental engagement and perception of whether their child had behavior
      changes while participating in the program. Preliminary findings from the parent interview
      show that children were more likely to support and engage in healthy eating practices
      throughout their involvement than they had before the program. Children also have expressed
      interests in continuing their participation in subsequent years. All other data for this
      intervention are currently undergoing analyses.

    <measure>Change in vegetables preferences</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in baseline vegetable preferences for teaching nutrition at post-intervention approximately 6 months later</time_frame>
    <description>Vegetables Preferences task involves displaying a whole vegetable as well as a sample of the vegetable for six different vegetables. One-on-one with a research assistant, youth are asked whether they can name the vegetable and a series of application and qualitative questions about that vegetable. This measurement was only used with the younger youth participants.</description>

    <description>After the initial training, the teenage teachers facilitated the curricula associated with the SHCP, Discovering Healthy Choices and Cooking Up Healthy Choices, approximately twice a month. The curricula can be viewed at http://cns.ucdavis.edu/programs/shcp/curriculum.html. Each activity provided step-by-step instructions that the teenage teachers were asked to follow. Younger youth served as participants for the classroom and garden-based activities.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The research team will recruit and consent youth study participants and their parents
             from members of the Nevada County 4-H Youth Development Program. Youth study
             participants must be ages 14-18 for teenage teachers and 8-13 for younger youth
             participants. Study participants must be able to attend two-hour bimonthly meetings at
             the 4-H office and/or (depending on the activity) Food Bank garden in Grass Valley,
             California. Teenage teachers will also be required to complete ten hours of initial
             training before the start of SHCP implementation. All participants will be required to
             join the Nevada County 4-H Youth Development Program if they are not already a member.
             Teenage teachers' registration fees will be paid for by the research team. Comparison
             youth will be recruited from registered members of the Placer County 4-H Youth
             Development Program. Placer County 4-H club members will also be ages 14-18 for
             teenage comparisons and 8-13 for younger youth comparisons.
