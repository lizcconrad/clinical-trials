  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The general aim of the study is to describe the use of elective pelvic node irradiation (ENI)
      in Italy, in patients with intermediate/high/very high-risk prostate cancer patients
      submitted to adjuvant or radical Radiation Therapy (RT) with or without concomitant Androgen
      Deprivation hormone Therapy (ADT).

      The study aims at the definition of survival, toxicity and QoL data in a representative
      sample of intermediate, high and very high risk prostate cancer patients consecutively
      recruited in Italian Radiation Oncology Center over two years.

      Clinical features and outcomes of the patients included in the study will be assessed as
      better detailed in the following lines:

        1. To define the diffusion of the practice of treating pelvic lymph-nodes in patients
           affected by intermediate/high/very high risk non-metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) among
           Italian Radiation Oncology Centers, submitted to radical or post-operative radiotherapy;

        2. To define the diffusion of the different radiotherapy techniques used to treat pelvic
           nodes and the other features of the radiation treatment;

        3. To register prospectively biochemical and clinical failure, prostate cancer deaths and
           deaths for any cause in the population studied;

        4. To register prospectively the toxicity due to radiotherapy and androgen deprivation
           therapy in patients treated with pelvic nodes radiotherapy;

        5. To compare clinical outcomes and toxicities observed in the different clinical and
           therapeutic subgroups with the corresponding historical data relative to PCa patients
           treated with radiotherapy with or without elective pelvic nodal irradiation, already
           available in the existing AIRO (Italian Society of Radiation Oncology) databases;

        6. To exploit the collected data to define the need and the features of a prospective
           randomized trial evaluating the efficacy of elective pelvic nodal irradiation in
           patients with intermediate/high/very high risk non-metastatic prostate cancer.
