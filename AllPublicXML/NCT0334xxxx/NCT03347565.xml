  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study of adolescent eating disorders (ED) will examine the association of
      temperament-based classifications, brain activation during incentive processing, and ED
      symptoms at time of scan and 1 year later to better understand the neurobiology and symptoms
      of ED. We will recruit 150 females currently ill with an ED and 50 controls ages 14-17 to
      investigate how temperaments reflecting greater inhibition, impulsivity, or effortful control
      correspond to 1) clinical symptoms and 2) the brain's response to anticipation and outcome of
      salient stimuli, and 3) by collecting follow-up clinical data one year later, identify how
      temperament-based subtypes predict ED symptom change (e.g., clinical prediction). Data
      collection will rely on a technology called functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
