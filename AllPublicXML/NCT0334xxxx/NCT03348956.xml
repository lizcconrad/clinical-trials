      This pilot study will attempt to establish the feasibility of using tissue oxygen
      measurements as a potential biomarker for chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN).
      Thirty (30) subjects scheduled to begin taxane-based chemotherapy for breast tumor will be
      assigned to receive an India ink injection under the skin of the foot. The ink will be used
      to make up to five (5) 45-minute &quot;electron paramagnetic resonance&quot; (EPR) oximetry readings
      prior to the start of chemotherapy. Subjects will undergo electrophysiologic assessments
      including electromyography and nerve conduction studies, in addition to a neurological
      examination prior to the start of chemotherapy. Subjects will have the EPR oximetry readings,
      electrophysiologic tests, and neurological examination two more times: at the halfway point
      of their chemotherapy treatment -- or at the onset of CIPN symptoms -- and again after
      chemotherapy has been completed.

    <textblock>
      Therapy with chemotherapeutic drugs can make a huge impact on survival and quality of life in
      patients with cancer. Advances in medical monitoring and the effectiveness of these therapies
      have significantly improved outcomes so that a definitive cure or long-term survival is more
      likely. Cancer survivors are used to dealing with serious side effects of their therapy;
      however, some of the side effects from the chemotherapy drugs persist even after the
      medication course is completed. The impact of these sequelae on quality of survival is
      increasingly being appreciated and forming an important new direction of cancer care. One of
      the more severe side effects of chemotherapy is peripheral neurotoxicity resulting in
      neuropathy or neuronopathy. Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neurotoxicity (CIPN) is one of
      the least predictable and most prolonged sequelae with effects ranging from pain, numbness
      and tingling to diffuse weakness sometimes to the extent of paralysis. It results from damage
      or alteration in function of peripheral nerves usually, but not always, in a length-dependent
      manner. An indirect impact of CIPN includes difficulties with balance and susceptibility to
      falls. There are currently no therapies that have been proven to prevent CIPN. Similarly,
      there are few medications that are known to be effective in the reversing CIPN once it
      develops or effectively treating symptoms of CIPN. Currently diagnosis is based mainly on
      clinical examination and electrophysiological testing to monitor CIPN;identification of
      candidate biomarkers through which disease onset can be identified at an earlier stage and
      which reflect presumed pathophysiologic mechanisms is of paramount importance. There are
      different theories of CIPN pathogenesis. One of the leading hypotheses relates to
      mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress affecting both the dorsal root ganglia neurons
      and supportive endothelial cells of the vasa nervorum. Here at Dartmouth, a specialized
      technique has been developed that allows the non-invasive assessment of tissue oxygen in and
      around peripheral nerve. This technique, called &quot;electron paramagnetic resonance&quot; (EPR)
      oximetry, allows for repeated measurements over time that can be correlated with other
      metrics of peripheral nerve function. Given its relevance to an important pathophysiologic
      mechanism of disease, EPR oximetry may provide an early marker of disease onset. In this
      proposal, the investigators will be testing the hypothesis that this could be a biomarker of
      CIPN. It is hoped that this measurement will (i) reflect the changes that occur on a cellular
      level and that damage nerves, (ii) reflect the damage occurring to nerves more sensitively
      than existing techniques, and (iii) help to better understand the reason the nerves are being
      damaged. It is also hoped that this will be something that can be used in future clinical
      trials.
