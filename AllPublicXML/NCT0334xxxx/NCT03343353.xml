  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Light Emitting Diode (LED) therapy has been investigated in burns and skin ulcers, as it has
      a bactericidal effect and promotes tissue repair. This study aims to evaluate LED therapy at
      different wavelengths in the healing process of graft donor area in adult burn victims.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is a blinded and controlled clinical trial in which burned adult patients will be
      selected, who will be irradiated with red (630 nm) and infrared (940 nm) LEDs at 4J / cm2
      fluency, in the donor area of until complete reepithelialization. Patients included will be
      the donor scalp area, with withdrawal of 0.2 mm. For application of the LEDs, the device will
      be calibrated for wavelength parameters, beam divergence, nominal power and fluency in the
      photobiophysical laboratory of the University of Ribeirão Preto - SP. Three groups will be
      divided: GS = Sham group (will not receive LED irradiation), will only receive routine
      hospital care, GT-V = treatment group with red led, and GT-IV = treatment group with infrared
      led. Patients will be randomized for group distribution. The donor areas will be evaluated by
      infrared thermography, computerized bioimpedance, infrared plethysmography, and Vancouver
      healing scale at two times, the first within a period of up to 24 hours after graft surgery,
      and the second after release of the primary dressing. The evaluations will be carried out by
      an expert evaluator, blind to the groups. For the analysis of the results will be applied
      statistical tests intra and intergroup (p &lt;0.05). This research aims to contribute with a new
      therapeutic method in the control of infections commonly found in cutaneous lesions, as well
      as in the healing process of the skin.

    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This scale evaluates the skin in four questions: pigmentation (3 items), vascularization (4 items), malleability (6 items) and scar height (4 itns). It is in the public domain and will be applied by the researcher to evaluate the donor area. Originally developed in the English language by Sullivan et al. (1990), adapted and validated for Portuguese by Santos, Tibola and Marques (2014). The final score varies from 0 to 13, being the lowest score corresponding to the best result (better quality of the scar). The scores are added to each item, and the lower the score, the better the quality of the scar.</description>

    <description>Quantitative analysis of skin temperature difference. Skin temperature (Celsius Degree). This evaluation seeks to find possible temperature differences between samples. With precision of up to 0.05 ° C, emissivity of 0.98 will be established, with three infrared images in sequence, and the distance between the thermograph and the donor area will be determined after a pilot test for the scalp regions, thus allowing the best framing and resolution of the area to be evaluated. An infrared thermograph model T400 (FLIR, Wilsonville, United States) will be used.
The analysis of the images will be by the software QuickReport, version 1.2.</description>

    <measure>Bioimpedance</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Analysis of the electrical resistance of the skin donor area. The electrical impedance of the tissue in the healthy skin donor region will be evaluated by the Biodynamics 450® bioimpedance instrument (mark, city, state, country), in which the phase angle in the 50 KHz frequency will be obtained. To do this, prior to the examination, the volunteer will remain in the supine position for 10 minutes, in a room with controlled temperature (22 ± 2ºC) and humidity of 50%. The measurements will be collected by four electrodes that will be coupled 1 cm from the edge of the lesion, for further processing and analysis, being this a relevant parameter to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment in the process of wound healing (Moore et al., 2011). The impedance between the electrodes will be expressed in kiloohms (KΩ).</description>
