  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aim is to assess polyethylene glycol (PEG) coated collagen patch (Hemopatch) on the
      quality of drainage after surgery, the length of hospital stay, the number of reoperations
      due to haemorrhage and treatment cost. The study will be conducted in 200 patients undergoing
      Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG) with the use of extracorporeal circulation and
      Internal mammary Artery (IMA) harvesting. Traditional method of haemostasis will be applied
      in 100 patients and Hemopatch will be additionally used in 100 subjects to prevent
      haemorrhage after IMA harvesting and sternum closure.
