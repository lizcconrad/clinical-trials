    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter study to
      determine the efficacy and safety of luspatercept (ACE-536) versus placebo in adults with
      non-transfusion dependent beta (β)-thalassemia. The study is divided into the Screening
      Period, Double-blind Treatment Period (DBTP) and Post-Treatment Follow-up Period (PTFP).

      It is planned to randomize approximately 150 subjects at a 2:1 ratio of luspatercept versus
      placebo.

      The primary objective is:

      - To evaluate the effect of luspatercept in non-transfusion dependent β-thalassemia-patient
      versus placebo on anemia, as measured by mean hemoglobin concentration in the absence of
      transfusions over a continuous 12-week interval, from Week 13 to Week 24, compared to
      baseline.

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  To evaluate the effect of luspatercept versus placebo on β-thalassemia related symptoms,
           as measured by non transfusion dependent β-thalassemia-patient reported outcome
           (NTDT-PRO) over a continuous 12-week intervals (from Weeks 13 to 24 and from Weeks 37 to
           48) compared to baseline.

        -  To evaluate the effect of luspatercept versus placebo on functional and health-related
           quality of life (QoL) as measured by Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form (SF-36)
           and Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) questionnaires

        -  To evaluate the long-term effect of luspatercept versus placebo on anemia, as measured
           by mean hemoglobin concentration in the absence of transfusions over a continuous
           12-week interval from Week 37 to Week 48, compared to baseline

        -  To evaluate the effect of luspatercept versus placebo on iron overload, as measured by
           liver iron concentration (LIC) and iron chelation therapy (ICT) daily dose

        -  To evaluate the effect of luspatercept versus placebo on iron overload, as measured by
           serum ferritin

        -  To evaluate the duration of erythroid response

        -  To evaluate the effect of luspatercept versus placebo on physical activity measured by
           6-minute walk test (6MWT)

      Safety and Pharmacokinetics (PK) Objectives

        -  To evaluate safety and tolerability of luspatercept, including immunogenicity

        -  To evaluate population pharmacokinetics (PK) of luspatercept in subjects with β-
           thalassemia

      The exploratory objectives are:

        -  To evaluate the effect of luspatercept versus placebo on measures of extra-medullary
           hematopoietic (EMH) masses, bone mineral density, splenomegaly, pulmonary hypertension,
           and leg ulcers, when present

        -  To evaluate the effect of luspatercept versus placebo on the β-thalassemia severity as
           measured by the NTDT severity score system

        -  To examine the relationship of baseline and change in serum Growth Differentiation
           Factor 11 (GDF11) and other related biomarkers with response to treatment with
           luspatercept

        -  To examine the effect of luspatercept on fetal hemoglobin (HbF)

        -  To examine the effect of luspatercept on Health Resource Utilization (HRU)

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects must satisfy the following criteria to be enrolled in the study:

          1. Subjects must be ≥ 18 years of age at the time of signing the informed consent
             document (ICF).

          2. Subject must understand and voluntarily sign an ICF prior to any study-related
             assessments/procedures being conducted.

          3. Subject is willing and able to adhere to the study visit schedule (eg, not scheduled
             to receive hematopoietic stem cell transplantation) and other protocol requirements.

          4. Subject must have documented diagnosis of β-thalassemia or hemoglobin E/
             β-thalassemia. Concomitant alpha globin mutation and/or duplication are allowed.

          5. Subject must be non-transfusion dependent, defined as 0 to 5 units of RBCs received
             during the 24-week period prior to randomization. Note: 1 unit defined for this entry
             criterion as approximately 200 to 350 mL of transfused packed RBCs.

          6. Subject must not be on a regular transfusion program and must be RBC transfusion-free
             for at least ≥ 8 weeks prior to randomization

          7. Subject must have mean baseline hemoglobin ≤ 10 g/dL, based on a minimum of 2
             measurements ≥ 1 week apart within 4 weeks prior to randomization; hemoglobin values
             within 21 days post-transfusion will be excluded.

          8. Subject must have performance status: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
             performance score of 0 to 1.

          9. A female of childbearing potential (FCBP) for this study is defined as a female who:

        1) has achieved menarche at some point, 2) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral
        oophorectomy or 3) has not been naturally postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer
        therapy does not rule out childbearing potential) for at least 24 consecutive months (ie,
        has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months). A FCBP participating in
        the study must:

          1. Have 2 negative pregnancy tests as verified by the Investigator prior to starting
             study therapy. She must agree to ongoing pregnancy testing during the course of the
             study, and after end of study treatment. This applies even if the subject practices
             true abstinence* from heterosexual contact.

          2. Either commit to true abstinence* from heterosexual contact (which must be reviewed on
             a monthly basis and source documented). If a FCBP engages in sexual activity that may
             result in a pregnancy, she must agree to use, and be able to comply during the study
             therapy (including dose interruptions), and for 12 weeks (approximately 5 times the
             mean terminal half-life of luspatercept based on multiple dose pharmacokinetics [PK]
             data) after discontinuation of study therapy.

             10. Male subjects must:

        a. Practice true abstinence (which must be reviewed on a monthly basis) or agree to use a
        condom during sexual contact with a pregnant female or a female of childbearing potential
        while participating in the study, during dose interruptions and for at least 12 weeks
        (approximately 5 times the mean terminal half-life of luspatercept based on multiple-dose
        PK data) following IP discontinuation, even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from enrollment:

          1. Any significant medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that
             would prevent the subject from participating in the study.

          2. Any condition including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which places the
             subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study.

          3. Any condition that confounds the ability to interpret data from the study.

               4. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt; 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 (per Modification
                  of Diet in Renal Disease [MDRD] formula).

         16. Subject has received chronic systemic glucocorticoids ≤ 12 weeks prior to
             randomization (physiologic replacement therapy for adrenal insufficiency is allowed).

         17. Major surgery ≤ 12 weeks prior to randomization (subjects must have completely
             recovered from any previous surgery prior to randomization).

         18. History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions or hypersensitivity to
