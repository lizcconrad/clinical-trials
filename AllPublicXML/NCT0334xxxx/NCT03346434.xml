      This study is a 2-part (parts A and B) phase 2/3 study to evaluate the safety,
      pharmacokinetics (PK) and efficacy of dupilumab in patients 6 months to less than 6 years of
      age with severe atopic dermatitis (AD).

      1. Part A (open-label, single-ascending-dose, sequential cohort phase 2 study):

             -  Primary objective is to characterize the safety and PK of dupilumab administered as
                a single dose in pediatric patients, 6 months to less than 6 years of age, with
                severe AD.

             -  Secondary objective is to evaluate the efficacy and immunogenicity of a single dose
                of dupilumab in patients 6 months to less than 6 years of age with severe AD

        2. Part B (randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled phase 3 study):

             -  Primary objective is to demonstrate the efficacy of multiple doses of dupilumab
                over 16 weeks of treatment when administered concomitantly with TCS in pediatric
                patients, 6 months to less than 6 years of age, with severe AD.

             -  Secondary objective is to assess the safety and immunogenicity of multiple doses of
                dupilumab over 16 weeks of treatment when administered concomitantly with TCS in
                patients 6 months to less than 6 years of age with severe AD
