  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Consecutive patients with ACLF (Acute on Chronic Liver Failure) and septic shock with AKI
      (Acute Kidney Injury) who give written informed consent will be included in this prospective
      trial at ILBS. At baseline s, endotoxin levels, NT-Pro BNP, , urine N-GAL will be done for
      all patients. A 10 ml serum sample will be stored for doing a cytokine profile. Septic shock
      will be defined by the presence of two or more diagnostic criteria for the systemic
      inflammatory response syndrome, proven or suspected infection with hypotension non-responsive
      to adequate fluid resuscitation assessed by no evidence of stroke volume variation on flow
      track and need of a vasopressor to achieve a target mean arterial pressure (MAP) of ≥ 65 mm
      Hg. A record of CVP, IVC diameter and B-lines on ultrasound lung would also be done. Patients
      with age less than 18 years, severe known cardiopulmonary disease (structural or valvular
      heart disease, coronary artery disease, COPD) pregnancy, chronic kidney disease, patients
      already meeting emergency criteria for immediate hemodialysis at the time of randomization as
      specified in the late group, patients transferred from other hospitals who have already been
      on hemodialysis before their arrival in the intensive care unit, extremely moribund patients
      with an expected life expectancy of less than 24 hours, failure to give informed consent from
      family members.
