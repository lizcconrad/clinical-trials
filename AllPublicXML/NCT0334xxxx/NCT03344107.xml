  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      JJ ureteral stents are often positioned at the end of a ureteroscopy and often cause
      important comorbidities. Indeed, up to 80% of the patients complain a deterioration of the
      quality of life. In order to reducing the symptoms to the minimum, the producing companies
      developed different types of stents, hypothetically thinking that modifications in materials
      and designs might reduce patients' discomfort.

      Talking about materials, most ureteral stents are made up of polymers, especially
      polyurethane and its derivatives. Classic ureteral stents have a proximal J and a distal J as
      anchors respectively in the kidney and in the bladder. Different types of ureteral stents
      have been proposed along the years in order to improving the efficacy and reducing the
      complications. As long as the bladder J has been identified as one of the determining factors
      of the low tolerance to stents, other shapes and designs were proposed along the years to
      reduce the impact of the distal end. In particular, one type of stent was designed by
      substituting the distal J with a double loop in order to reducing the bladder impact.

      Literature related to efficacy of bladder double loop in reducing symptoms caused by stent
      positioning and in improving comfort in comparison with a traditional hydrophilic Vortek JJ
      are extremely limited.

      From 2008 an Italian version of USSQ is at disposal in order to evaluating with a standard
      method the symptoms reported by patients after ureteral stent positioning.

      Aim of this study study is comparing prospectively in a randomized way symptoms of patients
      with bladder double loop stent and symptoms of patients with traditional hydrophilic Vortek
      JJ by submitting USSQ to the patients who undergo a RIRS with ureteral sheath and laser
      lithotripsy for renal lithiasis.
