  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose determination study aiming to identify the optimal tamoxifen dose for reducing
      the risk of breast cancer. Instead of following a very large number of women, for many years,
      treated with different doses of tamoxifen and see if they develop breast cancer, the
      investigators will include 1,440 healthy women participating in the mammographic screening
      program at two Mammography units (Unilabs mammography, Lund and Södersjukhuset Breast Centre,
      Stockholm) and measure their change in mammographic density. The change in mammographic
      density is a very good marker of therapy response. Investigators will test if 1 mg, 2.5 mg, 5
      mg and 10 mg reduce the mammographic density to the same extent as 20 mg. In summary Karisma
      2 will be a randomized, double-blinded, six-armed placebo controlled study to identify the
      dose of tamoxifen with the most favourable side effect spectra and with a density reduction
      non-inferior to 20 mg tamoxifen.

In particular, we will test for noninferiority in the proportion of women in the intervention arms (placebo, 1 mg, 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg) who have a density reduction as great as or greater (after 6 months) than the median density reduction in the 20 mg arm.</description>
