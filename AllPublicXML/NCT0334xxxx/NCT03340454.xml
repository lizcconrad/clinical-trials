    <textblock>
      This study will assess the efficacy, adoption, and impact of an integrated intervention to
      improve adherence to recommended stomach cancer prevention guidelines (H. pylori
      test-and-treat) for at-risk Chinese Americans in NYC. The integrated multifaceted
      theory-based intervention involves: 1) a health systems-level intervention using electronic
      health record (EHR)-based tools to facilitate H. pylori test-and-treat strategies; and 2) a
      community-engaged culturally and linguistically adapted CHW-led patient navigation program we
      are currently pilot testing for feasibility and acceptability. Using a 2-arm randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) design, 144 Chinese American patients across NYC safety net hospital
      endoscopy clinics will participate.
