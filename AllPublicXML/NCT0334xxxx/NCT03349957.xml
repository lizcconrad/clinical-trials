  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DcBeads and lipiodol-transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
      using doxorubicin result in about 50% objective response rate at 6 months (Precision V study,
      Lammer et al. CVIR 2010) We previously demonstrated that idarubicin was the most effective
      drug on 3 HCC cell lines (Boulin et al., Anticancer drugs 2009). We tested idarubicin-loaded
      beads in a phase I trial (Boulin et al., Aliment Pharmacol Therapy 2012) and more recently in
      a prospective multicentric phase II trial (IDASPHERE II, Magna Cum Laude CIRSE 2017, B Guiu
      et al.). This trial was stopped at interim analysis because the endpoint was reached.

      Tandem beads are precisely calibrated, of small size, allowing the maximization of ischemic
      effects together with an optimal efficacy of the drug. We previously published that
      idarubicin was able to load fastly in Tandem, with minimal modification of bead diameter and
      a very interesting releasing profile of the drug (Guiu et al., JVIR 2015).

      We used TANDEM combined with idarubicin in our practice for the treatment of HCC by TACE
      (in-label use of beads and the drug).

      No clinical study (even retrospective) has been published so far with TANDEM-IDA (except our
      first paper published in JVIR in 2015, only 4 patients).

      Here we propose to collect the retrospective data of patients treated by TANDEM-IDA, to help
      to design a future multicentric randomized phase II trial
