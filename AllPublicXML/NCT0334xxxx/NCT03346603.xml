  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Between 2013-2014, our study network of U.S. emergency departments, EMERGEncy ID NET, found
      that the rate of fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli was 11.7% among all patients, 6.3% in
      uncomplicated and 19.9% in complicated. ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae were found in 7.7%
      of all cases, 2.6% in uncomplicated and 12.2% in complicated. More recently,
      Enterobactericeae and gram-negative non fermenting bacteria have started to show resistance
      to carbapenems (CREs and CR-NF). Patients hospitalized with UTI and urosepsis represent a
      higher risk population for infections due to multi-drug resistant bacteria and experience
      serious adverse outcomes, including death. EMERGEncy ID NET will conduct a study to determine
      the prevalence of ESBL-producing, CREs and CR-NFs among this high risk population of patients
      admitted for UTI from U.S. emergency departments.

        Patients presenting to the 11 U.S. emergency departments involved in the EMERGEncy ID NET
        study with a urinary tract infection requiring hospital admission.

        The sites are:

        Bellevue Hospital Center, New York; Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA; Hennepin
        County Medical Center, Minneapolis; Johns Hopkins Medical Center, Baltimore; Lewis Katz
        School of Medicine at Temple University, Philadelphia; Maricopa Medical Center, Phoenix;
        Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland; Olive View-University of California at Los
        Angeles Medical Center, Los Angeles; University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center,
        Albuquerque; University of Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson; University of

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age greater than or equal to 18 years;

          2. Admitted to the hospital through the ED;

          3. Primary reason for admission is treatment of UTI with or without sepsis (i.e., ED
             diagnosis of UTI and/or sepsis); and

          4. Provide verbal or written consent to participate in the study or if patient is unable
             to provide consent (e.g., altered mental status), consent obtained from a legal
             authorized representative.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patients will be later excluded if :

               1. they are unable to provide a urine specimen for culture; or

               2. their urine culture yields no growth or is contaminated (see definition of
                  positive urine culture below). Note: If participant's urine culture is
                  contaminated but their blood culture is positive for a uropathogen, they will not
                  be excluded.
