      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a methodology to determine the ability of a denture
      adhesive to restrict food ingress underneath dentures during eating.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single centre, controlled, open label, randomized, three-treatment,
      three-period, cross-over design in participants with full upper and full lower dentures. Each
      treatment period will consist of one day of testing with at least two days between adjacent
      treatment visits. This study will consist of four visits: Visit 1 - Screening Visit; Visit 2
      - Treatment 1 Visit; Visit 3 - Treatment 2 Visit and Visit 4 - Treatment 3 Visit.
      (Participants will use Test product (denture adhesive) applied to the dentures either in a
      pattern consistent with standard application or applied to the dentures in a pattern of
      continuous strips. Participants will also use no adhesive as a control. Participants will
      cross-over between treatments so that all participants will participate in all 3 treatment
      arms. An hour after the participant has worn their denture, they will chew a portion of
      peanuts in a controlled manner. The peanuts that migrate under the denture during this
      chewing procedure will be collected, washed, dried and weighed. Participant will also answer
      a short questionnaire on the procedure and record the number of times their denture dislodged
      during the chewing procedure. The study hypothesis is that this methodology will enable
      comparisons between denture adhesives and no adhesive to demonstrate the effectiveness of
      denture adhesives at restricting food ingress under dentures during eating.

    <time_frame>Upto 9 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be provided with 30-32 grams (g) non-salted peanuts, divided into smaller portions of approximately eight peanut halves. Each portion chewed for approximately 20 seconds (s). After consumption of all peanut, participants will rinse their mouth with water for approximately 5 s. Dentures will be removed and any peanuts remaining in the mouth will be collected using a gauze. Both denture and gauze will be placed in a beaker with hot de-ionized water and sonicated for 30 minutes after which the water will be strained through a standard testing sieve. The collected particles will be washed and air-dried and will be transferred to pre-weighed aluminium weighing pans using a spatula and then will be dried in an oven at 40 degree Celcius (°C) for 5 hours (hrs). The pans will be removed, cooled to room temperature and then weighed to determine the mass of the particles collected from each denture.</description>
