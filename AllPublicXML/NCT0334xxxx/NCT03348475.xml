  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The &quot;Brain Over Binge Recovery Guide&quot; (Hansen, 2016), is a self-help approach that
      incorporates fundamental aspects of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, Dialectical
      Behavioural Therapy, Motivational Enhancement Therapy and addictions treatment. This approach
      has been streamlined into a guided self-help protocol (Binge Focused Therapy, or BFT) that
      can be delivered by undergraduate students with minimal mental health experience in 3 group
      sessions spread over 8 weeks (i.e., Week 1, Week 2, Week 8). The aim of this proof-of-concept
      study is to provide preliminary data to examine whether this approach is feasible and has
      clinical potential for patients with binge eating disorder.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Binge Eating Frequency</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8, 1-year follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported binge eating frequency will be assessed with the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire 6.0 (EDE-Q). Binge eating frequency is measured on item 15 of the EDE-Q.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Binge Eating Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2, Week 8, 1-year follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported binge eating severity will be assessed with the Binge Eating Scale (BES). The BES is a 16-item measure, each item has 3-4 coded responses. The total score ranges from 0-46, where a higher score indicates greater binge eating severity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Remission Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8, 1-year follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Remission defined as 100% reduction in binge episodes in the last 28 days of treatment phase preceding week 8, or in the last 28-days of follow-up phase.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8, 1-year follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Responders defined as â‰¥ 50% reduction in the number of binge episodes from baseline to either of the last two preceding weeks of treatment or follow-up.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in General Eating Disorder Symptomatology</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8, 1-year follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported general eating disorder symptomatology will be assessed using the global score generated from the EDE-Q. The EDE-Q is a 28-item measure that assesses four areas of eating disorder psychopathology (eating concern, shape concern, weight concern, dietary restraint). Each item uses a Likert scale ranging from 0 (lowest frequency/severity) to 6 (highest frequency/severity). The global score ranges from 0-6 where higher scores indicate greater impairment. The global score is obtained using the mean of the four subscales.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Locus of Control of Behaviour</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2, Week 8, 1-year follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported locus of control of behaviour will be assessed using the Locus of Control of Behaviour scale (LCB). The LCB scale is a 17-item measure. Participants respond to each item using a Likert scale ranging from 0 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Total scores range from 0-85, with higher scores indicating a greater degree of externality.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Coping Self-Efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2, Week 8, 1-year follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported coping self-efficacy will be assessed using the Coping Self-Efficacy Scale (CSES). The CSES is a 26-item measure. Each item with be rated using a Likert scale from 1 (cannot do at all) to 10 (certain can do). An average score will be obtained. Higher scores indicate greater coping self-efficacy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Motivation/Confidence/Readiness for Behaviour Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 2</time_frame>
    <description>This will be measured using responses to three Likert-style questions that assess the perceived value of changing binge eating, confidence in ability to change binge eating, and readiness to change binge eating. Each item will be scored on a scale of 1 (not at all important/confident/ready) to 10 (extremely important/confident/ready). Each item will be assessed independently. Higher scores indicate greater motivation, confidence, and readiness.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression, Anxiety and Tension/Stress</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported depression, anxiety, and tension/stress will be assessed using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS). Participants will respond to 21-items each scored on a Likert scale from 0 (did not apply) to 3 (applied very much or most of the time). A total score ranges from 0-126 with a higher score indicating greater impairment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Participant Satisfaction with Intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will respond to 3 Likert-style questions on a scale of 1 (very poor) to 6 (excellent) and several open-ended questions asking about their perceptions of the program. Higher scores indicate greater satisfaction.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Week 3 - 7 Adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Participants' adherence to tracking binge frequency and use of defusion skills (i.e., Homework) between Sessions 2 and 3.</description>
