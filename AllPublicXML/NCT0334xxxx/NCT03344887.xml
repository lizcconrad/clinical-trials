  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The iTADS trial will test an important blood donor characteristic - donor sex - to see
      whether male donor blood leads to a greater benefit for transfusion recipients compared to
      female donor blood.

      The trial will help determine how the investigators can tailor the selection of blood donors
      based on donor characteristics (e.g. sex) to further improve the safety and optimize the
      clinical benefit of blood products in Canada.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have designed an innovative pragmatic randomized trial that will allocate
      transfusion recipients to receive either only male or only female donor transfusions.

      Primary objective:

      To confirm that a transfusion strategy of receiving male donor RBC (Red Blood Cell) units
      only will improve survival compared to a transfusion strategy of female donor RBC units in
      all hospital patients requiring a transfusion.

      Secondary objectives:

        1. To assess effects of male RBC units on major morbidities (cancer, infection, end-organ
           damage)

        2. To assess effects across major patient subgroups (major surgery, intensive care,
           oncology)

        3. To assess the effect of female donor pregnancy history on recipient transfusion outcome

        4. To build capacity to conduct large innovative prospective pragmatic clinical trials in
           transfusion medicine using routinely collected clinical and administrative information.
