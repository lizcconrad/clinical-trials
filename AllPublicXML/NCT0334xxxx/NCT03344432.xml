  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe Trauma Brain Injury (TBIs) is a public health problem and monitoring of Intracranial
      Pressure (ICP) is a determinant key of it prognosis. Within the noninvasive methods to
      estimate the ICP, the measurement of intraocular pressure has been proposed because of its
      biological plausibility (proximity of the eye to the encephalic contend).

      Objective. Correlate intraocular pressure with ICP in children with TBIs and obtain their
      utility values.

      Pressure (ICP) is a determinant key of it prognosis. Within the noninvasive methods to
      estimate the ICP, the measurement of intraocular pressure has been proposed because of its

      Objective. Correlate intraocular pressure with ICP in children with TBIs and obtain their
      utility values.

      Material and methods. Correlation and diagnostic test design study. Inclusion criteria:
      children with TBIs admitted to the emergency room and indication of catheter for ICP
      measurement.

      Exclusion criteria: injury or ophthalmic disease, glaucoma, encephalic death. Intraocular
      pressure was measured with electronic tonometer in both eyes prior to placement of the
      catheter for ICP measurement.

      Correlation was estimated with Spearman's Rho. The utility values of the diagnostic test were
      obtained from an Receiver Operating Characteristic curve.
