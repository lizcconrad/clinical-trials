    <textblock>
      This study is designed to investigate the toxicity and pharmacokinetics (PK) of 2-weekly and
      3-weekly docetaxel in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC). Also, a
      mechanism-based population pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) model will be developed
      to provide a better understanding of the complex relationships between the drug exposure and
      toxicity profiles of docetaxel in mHSPC.

      This pilot study is designed to investigate the toxicity and PK of 2-weekly and 3-weekly
      docetaxel in mHSPC. Furthermore, a mechanism-based population PK/ pharmacodynamics (PD) model
      will be developed to provide a better understanding of the complex relationships between the
      drug exposure and toxicity profiles of docetaxel in mHSPC. In addition, selected
      pro-inflammatory and macrophage-associated cytokines will be collected to assess the
      potential role of these cytokines as the early markers of docetaxel resistance in patients
      with mHSPC. (Cytokines: macrophage inhibitory cytokine 1 (MIC1), interleukin (IL)-1ra, IL-1β,
      IL-4, IL-6, IL-12, and IFNγ). Serological response, defined as a prostate-specific antigen
      (PSA) level of &lt;0.2 ng/mL at 12 months, and progression-free survival at 12 months are
      selected as the secondary clinical endpoints of the study.

    <measure>Comparison of the neutropenia toxicity rate over time between the 2-weekly docetaxel dosing regimen and the 3-weekly docetaxel dosing regimen in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.</measure>

    <description>Toxicity rate in each arm will be estimated based on a one-sided 90% confidence interval. Assuming at most a 31% neutropenia rate, a sample of 16 patients per arm will provide a one-sided 90% confidence interval upper limit equal to 50%.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of the pharmacokinetics (PK) parameter 'AUC0-inf' (area under the curve from zero to infinity)' between the 2-weekly docetaxel dosing regimen and the 3-weekly docetaxel dosing regimen in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 0.25, 0.75, 3, 6.5, and 24 hours post first docetaxel infusion; and, at the end of docetaxel infusion of the last cycle (a cycle is 2 weeks for the 2-weekly regimen, 3 weeks for the 3-weekly regimen)</time_frame>
    <description>AUC from zero to infinity (AUC0-inf) will be determined using the following equation:

    <time_frame>up to 12 months after the first docetaxel dose</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse event data and corresponding toxicity grades during the days of treatment will be summarized for each docetaxel dosing arm.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed prostate cancer with
             EXTENSIVE metastatic disease and have been on androgen deprivation therapy for &lt;90
             days. Hormonal therapy must not have commenced more than 90 days prior to study.

             Definition of extensive disease: Metastases involving at least one lesion in any bony
             structures beyond the vertebral column and pelvic bone or any involvement with
             viscera. In the absence of visceral lesion, there must be four or more bone lesions.
             Patients with disease limited to vertebral column and/or pelvis alone with or without
             lymph node or lymph node only disease involvement are not eligible for this trial.

          2. Age ≥18 years.

          3. ECOG performance status ≤2 (Karnofsky ≥60%).

          4. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below within four weeks
             prior to the study:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL

               -  Platelets ≥100,000/mcL

               -  Total bilirubin less than ULN

               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤1.5 × institutional upper limit of normal

               -  Alkaline phosphate ≤2.5 x ULN

               -  Creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/min calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault formula:
                  Creatinine clearance for male (mL/min) = (140-age)*(body weight in kg)/(72 x
                  serum creatinine in mg/dl)

          5. If a patient has had major surgery, the patient must be longer than four weeks post
             surgery and must have recovered from all toxicity prior to beginning protocol study.

          6. Peripheral neuropathy with Grade ≤1

          7. Patients may be enrolled if they have had prior palliative radiation therapy. However,
             this has to have been commenced within 30 days of starting androgen deprivation.

          8. Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.

          2. Patients with known brain metastases are excluded from this clinical trial because of
             their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction
             that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.

          3. History of hypersensitivity to docetaxel or polysorbate 80.

          4. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social dysfunction that could impair the ability of
             the patients to participate in the study or interfere with interpretation of study
             results.

          5. Docetaxel is a CYP3A4 substrate and caution should be taken with its use and any drugs
             known to interact with it. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing,
             it is important to regularly consult a frequently updated list such as
             http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx; medical reference texts such as
             the Physicians' Desk Reference for this information. As part of the
             enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of
             interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be
             prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal
             product. Appendix B contains a list of known drugs that are contraindicated or have
             major interactions with docetaxel.

          6. HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of
             the potential for PK interactions with docetaxel. In addition, these patients are at
             increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy.
             Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination
             antiretroviral therapy when indicated.

          7. Patients with prior docetaxel chemotherapy.
