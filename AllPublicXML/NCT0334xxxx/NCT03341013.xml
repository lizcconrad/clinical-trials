    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open label, cross-over, two-period, pilot study in healthy adult
      subjects to evaluate the bioequivalence between formulation 2 and formulation 3 of MEDI0382
      after a single subcutaneous (SC) dose. The study will be conducted at a single US center.
      Each subject will be randomized to receive a single 100 μg (or equimolar equivalent) SC dose
      of both formulation 2 and 3 of MEDI0382 on two different in-house periods separated by a
      washout period of 7 days. Formulation 3 of MEDI0382 has not been administered to humans
      previously. Blood samples for PK analyses of MEDI0382 concentrations will be taken predose
      and at 11 time points up to 48 hours after dosing (Days 3 and 12). Bedside plasma glucose
      levels will be monitored before meals and at bedtime during Days 1 and 10 and will be
      measured prior to breakfast on Days 2 and 11.

      This is a randomized, open label, cross-over, two-period, pilot study in healthy adult
      subjects to evaluate the bioequivalence between formulation 2 and formulation 3 of MEDI0382
      after a single subcutaneous (SC) dose. The study will be conducted at a single US center.
      Each subject will be randomized to receive a single 100 μg (or equimolar equivalent) SC dose
      of both formulation 2 and 3 of MEDI0382 on two different in-house periods separated by a
      washout period of 7 days. Formulation 3 of MEDI0382 has not been administered to humans
      previously.

      Subjects will receive the same absolute amount of MEDI0382, when dosed with either
      formulation 2 or formulation 3. Formulations of MEDI0382 will be administered via SC
      injection in the abdomen of subjects. Subjects will be in the study for a maximum of 59 days,
      which includes a screening period of up to 21 days. On Day 1, subjects will admitted to the
      clinic and will be randomized to receive formulation 2 and formulation 3 in one of two
      sequences; subjects randomized to sequence 1 will receive formulation 2 on Day 1 and
      formulation 3 on Day 10 and subjects randomized to sequence 2 will receive formulation 3 on
      Day 1 and formulation 2 on Day 10.

      On Day 3, subjects will be discharged from the clinic and a 7-day washout period will follow.
      Subjects will return to the clinic on Day 10 to receive the second dose of investigational
      product and will remain in-house for 3 days. After discharge on Day 12, subjects will return
      on Day 38 for the end of study visit. Blood samples for PK analyses of MEDI0382
      concentrations will be taken predose and at 11 time points up to 48 hours after dosing (Days
      3 and 12). Bedside plasma glucose levels will be monitored before meals and at bedtime during
      Days 1 and 10 and will be measured prior to breakfast on Days 2 and 11.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy subjects age 18 through 45 years at the time of screening.

          2. Provision of signed and dated written informed consent prior to study-specific
             procedures.

          3. Body mass index between 19 and 30 kg/m2 (inclusive) at screening

          4. Good general health as judged by the investigator, based on medical history, physical
             examination including 12-lead ECG, vital signs, and blood and urinary laboratory
             assessments.

          5. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at
             screening and randomization and must not be lactating.

          6. Females of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a nonsterilized male
             partner must use at least one highly effective method of contraception (see Section
             10.2 for definition of females of childbearing potential and for a description of
             highly effective methods of contraception) from screening and must agree to continue
             using such precautions through to the end of the study. It is strongly recommended for
             the male partner of a female subject to also use a male condom plus spermicide
             throughout this period. Cessation of contraception after this point should be
             discussed with a responsible physician. Periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and
             the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of contraception.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of, or any existing condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would
             interfere with evaluation of the investigational product, put the subject at risk,
             influence the subject's ability to participate, or affect the interpretation of the
             results of the study

          2. Impaired renal function, defined as s-creatinine ≥ 130 µmol/L

          3. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2

          4. Blood pressure and heart rate in supine position outside the ranges of 90-140 mmHg
             systolic, 50-90 mmHg diastolic and heart rate 40-100 beats/min following a 10-minute
             rest period.

          5. Any clinically significant abnormal ECG, as judged by the investigator

          6. Active hepatitis B, measured by positive tests of surface antigen HBsAg and/or active
             hepatitis C, measured by positive hepatitis C virus antibody tests

          7. Positive human immunodeficiency virus antibodies

          8. Known or suspected allergy to MEDI0382, any component of the formulation, or related
             products

          9. Use of any prescription or nonprescription medication, except for paracetamol,
             hormonal contraceptives, and vitamins within the last 72 hours prior to check-in

         10. History of alcoholism or drug abuse during the last 12 months

         11. Smoking of cigarettes or other tobacco products

         12. Habitual excessive consumption of methylxanthine-containing (theophylline, caffeine or
             theobromine) beverages and foods (coffee, tea, soft drinks such as red bull, cola,
             chocolate) as judged by the investigator

         13. Blood donation within the last 3 months

         14. Participation in any other trial investigating other products or involving blood
             sampling within the past 30 days

         15. Potentially noncompliant or uncooperative, as judged by the investigator

         16. Substance dependence likely to impact subject safety or compliance with study
             procedures

         17. Psychiatric illness such that subjects have been committed to an institution by way of
             official or judicial order

         18. Involvement of any AstraZeneca, MedImmune, the contract research organization, or the
             study site employee or their close relatives
