      The purpose of this project is to investigate the effectiveness of the Home-Based Mental
      Health Evaluation (HOME) program, which is an innovative and culturally-relevant suicide
      prevention intervention for Veterans aimed at increasing treatment engagement and decreasing
      suicide risk following psychiatric hospitalization, a period of heightened suicide risk.

      The purpose of this project is to investigate the effectiveness of the Home-Based Mental
      Health Evaluation (HOME) program, which is an innovative and culturally-relevant suicide
      prevention intervention for Veterans aimed at increasing treatment engagement and decreasing
      suicide risk following psychiatric hospitalization, a period of heightened suicide risk. The
      research project employs a multi-site two-arm interventional trial design to study the
      effectiveness of the HOME program. Effectiveness of the treatment will be evaluated by
      comparing Veterans receiving the HOME program at two active treatment sites, Denver and
      Philadelphia Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMCs), to with those receiving
      care at two control sites, Houston and Portland VAMCs. The current protocol describes
      procedures as they will occur at all sites, including those completed locally at the Denver
      VAMC, which is the lead site for the study.

    <masking_description>The blind assessor will administer follow up measures. In order to keep the assessor blind to participant status (active vs. control), research staff will facilitate phone calls. To monitor blinding, the blind assessor will record if participants inadvertently un-blind themselves during the assessment and also record their guess to which treatment condition (active versus E-CARE)participants were allocated.</masking_description>

    <description>Access to participants' VA electronic medical record will be utilized to address the hypothesis that Veterans participating in the HOME program will be significantly more likely to engage in treatment and or care more quickly. Data collection may be facilitated by VA's Compensation and Pension Record Interchange (CAPRI) and VA's Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW).</description>

    <description>Access to participants' VA electronic medical record will be utilized to address the hypothesis that Veterans participating in the HOME program will be significantly more likely to attend more outpatient appointments.

    <description>Compared to the E-CARE group, Veterans participating in the HOME program will report significantly lower suicidal ideation scores on the Scale for Suicidal Ideation. The Scale for Suicidal Ideation (SSI) will be used to measure this outcome.</description>

    <description>Prior to discharge from the inpatient unit, the HOME program provider or another member of the research team, will meet individually with the Veteran to provide further information regarding the HOME program intervention. Efforts are made to schedule the initial phone call and home visit that occur during the first week after discharge. Following the home visit, the HOME provider may continue to have weekly contact with the Veteran via the telephone or in person until he or she is disenrolled following engagement in outpatient care. &quot;Engaged in care&quot; is defined as attendance at two individual outpatient mental health appointments or engagement in equivalent or elevated care as determined by the PI. All clinical contacts with the Veteran may include the following: suicide risk assessment, review and modification of the Veteran's safety plan, review and modification of the discharge plan, involvement of the Veteran's support system, and facilitation of engagement in outpatient care.</description>
