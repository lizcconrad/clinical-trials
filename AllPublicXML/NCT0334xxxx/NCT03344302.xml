  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cesarean delivery is defined as fetal birth through incisions in the abdominal wall and the
      uterine wall. This definition does not include removal of the fetus from the abdominal cavity
      in the case of uterine rupture or in the case of an abdominal pregnancy The guidelines of the
      Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists on caesarean section recommend a slow
      intravenous bolus dose of 5 IU of oxytocin after delivery of the infant. Intravenous oxytocin
      has a short half life (4-10 minutes); therefore the potential advantage of an oxytocin
      infusion at caesarean section is in maintaining uterine contractility throughout the surgical
      procedure and immediate postpartum period, when most primary haemorrhage occurs
