      To analyze a multi-center observational study database. to select adult non-traumatic
      in-hospital cardiac arrest. Review and recored end-tidal carbon dioxide in per minute.
      Arrange them in different time line. one is in resuscitation time. The other is the time line
      which the beginning time is the time of starting appearing stable end-tidal carbon dioxide
      wave.To compare predictive power of end-tidal carbon dioxide between different time line
      during resuscitation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        adult non-traumatic in-hospital cardiac arrest patients Exclusion Criteria:1) surrogate
        decision of Do-Not-Resuscitate (DNR) during CPR; 2) out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA)
        patient; 3) trauma as the main reason for medical treatment; 4) child or adolescent
        patients; 5) Petco2 value was not recorded effectively; 6) delay from initial CPR to
        starting to record Petco2 exceeded 30 min; and 7) screening by qualified experts. More than
        three experienced physicians thought that the patient's Petco2 value was too extreme to
        agree with his/her medical history, and the value was seen as an error and was excluded
