  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Head and neck cancer surgery presents the challenge of tumour resection in close proximity to
      critical structures such as the carotid arteries and optic nerves. The need for precise
      localization within complex 3D anatomy has motivated the development of image-guidance
      systems that account for tissue deformation and excision through the use of intraoperative
      cone-beam CT (CBCT). A prototype mobile C-arm for intraoperative flat-panel CBCT has been
      developed at UHN in collaboration with Siemens Healthcare to provide low-dose 3D images with
      sub-mm spatial resolution and soft-tissue visibility. Extensive investigation in
      pre-clinical/clinical H&amp;N, otology, orthopaedic, lung, and spine surgery has demonstrated the
      benefit of intraoperative CBCT for improved target ablation, localization accuracy, and
      critical structure avoidance.

      Prospective clinical trial in CBCT-guided H&amp;N surgery will be conducted to evaluate the Zeego
      robotic platform for CBCT. Patient accrual will span a wide range of surgical procedures in
      otolaryngology, including cancer resection and anatomical reconstruction in the mandible,
      maxilla, sinuses, skull base, and temporal bone. The effect of intraoperative imaging and
      surgical guidance on logistical considerations of time, workflow, and compatibility with the
      OR environment will be evaluated through the use of in-room audio/video recordings, human
      factors engineering methods, and expert feedback questionnaires obtained from the surgeons,
      nurses, and anesthetists involved in each case. This clinical investigation will help to
      further define indications for CBCT-guided H&amp;N surgery, and serve to enable the development
      of surgical task-specific imaging protocols.

      For each patient enrolled in this study, the following administrative information will be
      compiled and maintained by the Principal Investigator at Princess Margaret Hospital:

      Consent Form: The signed consent form. (Note that the Consent Form is the only information
      collected in this study that is not anonymous. All subsequent information is identified by an
      arbitrary Code # that can not be directly or indirectly traced back to the individual
      patient.) Clinical Summary: A brief summary provided by the Clinical Co-Investigator and/or
      Surgical Fellow regarding the patient's illness and prescribed surgical treatment plan. The
      Clinical Summary is anonymous with respect to patient identity and will be identified by an
      arbitrary Code #. The Summary will include age, weight, height, sex, diagnosis, stage, habits
      (viz., smoking and alcohol consumption), results of physical examination, and relevant
      medical history (e.g., prior surgery). This will also include medical history related to
      suitability for IV contrast (see the form included with the protocol).

      Procedure Log: A summary log of the surgical procedure and imaging studies, when and where
      they were carried out, and relevant notes regarding the surgical and imaging procedures
      therein e.g., success or failure of the treatment plan or imaging system, etc. The Procedure
      Log is also anonymous and identified by an arbitrary Code #.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The study will include patients with tumors or other masses in the following sites,
             nasal cavity, sinuses, nasopharynx, parapharyngeal space, deep parotid salivary
             glands, oral cavity, oropharynx, and skull base. Cases considered in this study will
             include lesions in one or several of these sites.

        The patients are intended to undergo surgical treatment for their disease. The patients
        should have a complete and detailed medical record. Subjects must be at least 18 years of
        age. Subjects must sign and be given a copy of the written Informed Consent Form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with unresectable lesions, where surgery is not the treatment of choice.

        Patients who are not able to consent by themselves or grasp the implication of the study.

        Subjects participating in any other clinical trial during the time of this clinical
        investigation and that may have an impact on this evaluation.

        Subjects may be excluded from this study at the discretion of a Clinical Co-Investigator,
        if they are enrolled in other studies that will result in combined radiation exposure
        exceeding standard of care.

        Subjects who are pregnant, lactating, or planning to become pregnant during the period of
        the evaluation.
