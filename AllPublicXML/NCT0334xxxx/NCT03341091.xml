  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the feasibility and the preliminary effects of a simplified 10-step
      Tai-chi programme (a dyadic approach) on the mobility performance of people with mild to
      moderate dementia.

      Four community health centres were recruited and each was randomised to either the
      intervention group (Tai-chi) or the control group. Tai-chi group received a 16-week 10-step
      simplified Tai-chi training programme in which additional measures were implemented to
      enhance participants' engagement. The control group took part in group recreational
      activities organized by the community centres.

      It was hypothesized that the Tai-chi group would outperform the control group regarding their
      mobility performance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Four community health centres that provide dementia care services were recruited through
      convenience sampling. Each was viewed as one cluster and was randomized to either the Tai-chi
      or the control group, based on computer-generated random numbers prepared by an independent
      statistician.

      Participants allocated to the Tai-chi group took part in the 16-week 10-step simplified
      Tai-chi programme, which was derived from the traditional Yang style and has been proven to
      be effective in enhancing older people's balance and mobility. Each week, the dyads attended
      two 1-hour sessions of centre-based Tai-chi training and practised at least three 30-minute
      Tai-chi sessions at home. Additional measures targeted cognitively impaired people were
      implemented to promote engagement, including the adoption of multiple sensory cues, slow and
      relaxed practice, a dyadic approach, and positive emotional motivation techniques.

      Participants allocated to the control group took part in group recreational activities such
      as watching movies or listening to music, which was organized by the community centres with
      similar frequency and duration of the Tai-chi sessions that were organized for the Tai-chi
      group. The control group participants were instructed to continue their usual lifestyles and
      levels of physical activity.

    <intervention_model_description>A two-arm parallel (single-blinded) cluster randomised controlled trial involves two groups of participants (Tai-chi and the control group). Four community health centers that provide dementia care services were recruited through convenience sampling and each was viewed as one cluster and was randomised to either the Tai-chi or the control group, based on computer-generated random numbers. So during the trial, participants in one group receive Tai-chi group programme &quot;in parallel&quot; to participants in the other group, who took part in group recreational activities and continue their usual lifestyles and levels of physical activity.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The engagement of participants with dementia when attending the Tai-chi training sessions was assessed by four items extracted from the Menorah Park Engagement Scale. The four items are constructive engagement, passive engagement, self/other engagement, and non-engagement. Each item was rated on a three-point Likert scale (i.e., 0 = &quot;not observed&quot;, 1 = &quot;up to half the observation&quot;, and 2 = &quot;more than half of the observation&quot;). In addition, Engagement was also rated by the Tai-chi master on a 4-item scale (i.e. engagement during class, following proper steps, satisfaction with participants' learning progress, and satisfaction with participants' performance) based on the Tai-chi instructor's in-class observation. Each item was quantified on a 10-point Likert scale, with higher scores representing a greater degree of engagement.</description>
