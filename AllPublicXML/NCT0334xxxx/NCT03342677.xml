  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic liver disease including cirrhosis is one of the most important factors in the
      multi-step progression of hepatocarcinogenesis, from benign regenerative nodules to early
      hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) and finally to overt HCCs. Early diagnosis of HCC,
      differentiation from benign hepatocellular nodules, and surgical resection of the tumor or
      transplantation of the liver provide the best chance for long-term survival. Several studies
      have evaluated MRI enhanced with superparamagnetic iron oxide, gadolinium-based contrast
      material, or both, for the detection and differential diagnosis of focal hepatic lesions.
      However, the differentiation of HCC from benign and or borderline hepatocellular nodules
      remains difficult, particularly in patients with cirrhosis, because of the architectural
      distortion of liver parenchyma and the development of cirrhotic nodules, ranging from benign
      regenerative nodules to overt HCC, with overlapping imaging features. Recently, gadoxetic
      acid (gadoliniumethoxybezyl-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid; PrimovistÂ®, Bayer Health
      Care Pharmaceuticals), a gadolinium-based paramagnetic contrast agent that produces both
      dynamic and liver-specific hepatobiliary MRI studies has gained widespread use. Some studies
      have showed that gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI allows the accurate detection and
      characterization of HCC. Investigators plan to assess this in particular as it is a question
      of great relevance. Execution of well conducted prospective studies will also clarify
      inclusion of Gd-EOB-DTPA enhanced MRI as the technique of choice in evaluation of patients at
      risk for HCC.
