  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who are candidates for resection
      of metastases. This study will be conducted sequentially with 2 cohorts: 1.) Monotherapy
      Cohort and 2.) Combination Cohort

      Pre-metastatectomy

        -  Monotherapy Cohort: The first 10 subjects will receive Atezolizumab 840 mg IV on Day 1
           and Day 15 of each 28-day cycle.

        -  Combination Cohort: The next 15 subjects will receive Atezolizumab 840 mg IV on Day 1
           and Day 15 and Cobimetinib 60 mg PO on Days 1-21 of each 28-day cycle. Note: Cobimetinib
           must be held for the 7 days prior to metastatectomy.

      All subjects will be treated for 2 cycles (8 weeks) prior to metastatectomy

      Metastatectomy

      Subjects will undergo liver metastatectomy within 42 days of completion of Cycle 2 of
      pre-metastatectomy treatment. No study treatment is administered while the patient is healing
      after surgery.

      Post-metastatectomy

      Once the patient has healed from the surgery, adjuvant treatment may be administered at the
      discretion of the treating physician. Restaging following standards of care for this setting.
