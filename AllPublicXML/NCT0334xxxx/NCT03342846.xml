  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to compare high versus low frequency rTMS on motor dysfunction in PD.
      Forty patients with PD participated in the study.

      The patients were randomly assigned into two groups; the first group received 1Hz and the 2nd
      one received 20 Hz rTMS daily for 10 days 5 sessions every week. The doctors who assess the
      patients clinically is blind for the frequency of rTMS, also patients don't know which type
      of stimulation they received. The patients were followed up before and after the 10 sessions
      and one month later.
