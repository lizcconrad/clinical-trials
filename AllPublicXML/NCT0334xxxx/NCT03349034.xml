  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Head and neck oncologic surgery often requires the use of free tissue transfer, or
      microvascular reconstruction, to reconstruct defects created by tumor resections. Although
      there are several techniques for the reconstruction of defects, resection of large tumors
      leave defects that require the transfer of vascularized tissue from one part of the body to
      repair the defect. For example, the removal of a segment of diseased mandible requires free
      tissue transfer containing the component parts - skin, muscle, and bone - to reconstruct the
      deficit created by the resection of the tumor. Over the years, microvascular surgeons have
      focused their attention on maximizing the success of these technically difficult surgeries.
      However, now, with free flap reconstruction rates in excess of 95%, surgeons are afforded the
      opportunity to turn their focus toward the morbidities associated with these surgeries. While
      much has been published about donor site wound healing, pain control in the post-operative
      period has largely been neglected in the head and neck reconstruction literature. Systemic
      analgesia with opioids is standard of care, which has been shown to lead to increased
      confusion, significantly increased length of stay and increased risk of pulmonary
      complications. In addition, it has been shown that early mobilization and optimal wound care
      can decrease donor site morbidity.

      In this study the clinical team aims to better control donor site pain utilizing local,
      targeted analgesia to relieve pain at the donor site for osseocutaneous free-flaps. To reduce
      confounding and bias, the study will be a double-blind prospective randomized placebo
      controlled trial wherein patients undergoing osseocutaneous free flap surgery will be
      randomized to receive continuous infusion of ropivacaine or normal saline (placebo) via local
      continuous infusion catheter, which will be placed intraoperatively at the time of donor site
      closure. Patients' pain will be monitored for the first 48hrs after surgery. Donor site and
      global pain at rest will be evaluated every 8 hours for the first two postoperative days
      using a visual analogue pain scale (VAS). Essentially, there is a 100 millimeter line drawn
      on a piece of paper, with &quot;no pain&quot; marking the left end of the line and &quot;worst pain&quot; marking
      the right end of the line. Subjects mark with a pen along the line where pain is felt fits
      along that continuum. A researcher then measures how far along the line that mark is placed
      and then it is recorded. Median daily opiate use via PCA will also be tracked. Donor
      site-specific range of motion and strength will be assessed with a formal physical therapy
      evaluation on post-operative day 2 or soonest non-holiday weekday. Information on patient
      satisfaction, time to ambulation, and length of stay will also be collected. Subgroup
      analysis will be performed.

      Procedures involved in this study include:

      - Intraoperatively, following procurement of the fibula or scapula bone graft and at the time
      of surgical wound closure, all patients will receive the placement of a continuous infusion
      catheter into the donor site wound bed. The infusion reservoir will be connected to a
      catheter-based On-Q pump, and the catheter will be placed in the donor site. A stab incision
      separate from the surgical wound will be used to bring the catheter through the skin.
      Patients will be randomized to receive 6 ml/hr of 0.2% Ropivacaine or 6 ml/hr of normal
      saline via the infusion reservoir. The catheter will be left in place with continuous
      infusion for first 48 hours of the post-operative period. The catheters will be removed by
      the housestaff on POD2. There is minimal risk to removing the OnQ catheter. Any opening in
      the skin will be covered with gauze to allow primary healing. Solutions of saline and
      ropivacaine will be prepared and made available for infusion by the Mount Sinai Pharmacy.
      Solutions will be blinded, and identical in appearance. Patients will be assigned to
      ropivacaine or saline intervention by the research pharmacy through coded envelopes.
      Patients, physicians, nurses, and research personnel will be blinded to treatment assignment.
      Every 8 hours for the first 48 hours, patients will be asked to complete a visual analogue
      scale (VAS) for reporting their pain. The VAS will be performed six times over the course of
      the 48hrs. These will be performed during regular flap check monitoring, to ensure patients
      are not disrupted additional times throughout the day for this study. Patients will otherwise
      receive standard of care pain management, including Tylenol 650 q6hr standing as well as a
      dilaudid PCA set to low-dose, opioid na√Øve. On post-operative day 2 patient will receive a
      physical therapy evaluation.

      Prior to discharge from the hospital, the study subjects will be asked to complete a brief
      survey (APS-POQ-R Pain Survey) regarding their experience, with regard to pain management.

Outcomes are tracked and assessed for the first 48 hours post-operatively - median post-operative pain assessed via VAS every 8 hours, total analgesic used (all patients receive Tylenol 650 and dilaudid PCA post-operatively), physical therapy outcomes assessed on post-operative day two, and a patient satisfaction survey.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Pain will be assessed every 8 hours for the first 48 hours using a visual analogue pain scale at rest. A visual analogue pain scale is a a validated pain measure. Essentially, there is a 100 millimeter line drawn on a piece of paper, with &quot;no pain&quot; marking the left end of the line and &quot;worst pain&quot; marking the right end of the line. Subjects mark with a pen along the line where pain is felt fits along that continuum. A researcher then measures how far along the line that mark is placed and then it is recorded.
Time of extubation is considered time zero. Then every 8 hours after that time, the subject has his/her pain assessed. A total of 6 pain assessments will be performed in the 48 hour period. A separate visual analogue scale is performed at each time point for global/overall pain and local, donor-site specific pain. The median pain score will be used for primary statistical analysis.</description>
