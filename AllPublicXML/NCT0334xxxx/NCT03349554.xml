  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to constitute a proof of concept study for a larger study
      investigating the effect of mindfulness on anxiety and agitation in Parkinson's disease (PD)
      based on the results of a preliminary feasibility.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuropsychiatric and behavioral non motor symptoms are common in PD often requiring
      hospitalization and/or specific drug management. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR)
      programs have proved to be efficacious in PD both for the management of motor and non-motor
      symptoms. This is however the case only in out-patients and by using standardized 8 weeks
      programs. The team has experienced in the hospitalization unit that methods derived from the
      MBSR program such as the &quot;body scan&quot;, administered by the paramedical personnel, is of great
      help for the non-pharmacological management of anxiety and agitation in PD, avoiding physical
      contention in many cases. Based on this experience the study aims at evaluating the
      feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a simple and standardized administration of the &quot;body
      scan&quot; meditation in the management of anxiety and agitation in PD admitted in the unit since
      less than 48h.
