  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To our knowledge, no studies in Nepal have reported the feasibility of performing the Pelvic
      Floor Muscle Training (PFMT) in Nepalese women. The aim of the study is to develop and
      implement a Pelvic Floor Muscle(PFM) physiotherapy program based on information, education
      and exercise in order to prevent or reduce Pelvic organ prolapse(POP) and Urinary
      Incontinence (UI) in pregnant Nepalese women

      The women will receive information (leaflet, video, posters) and instruction/guidance on PFM
      exercise. Following this, the women are advised to perform daily home PFM exercise Women will
      record their home PFM exercises using an exercise diary. Further, pre and post study design
      will be conducted to assess the change in PFM activation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PFM supports the bowel, bladder and uterus. Pelvic floor dysfunction can lead to
      gynecological problem like POP and UI. POP is the downward displacement of uterus from its
      normal anatomical position and UI is the involuntary leakage of urine.

      In Nepal, the prevalence of POP is 10% in women of reproductive age and and reported UI is
      60% and 50.6% from two studies. POP risk factors include early marriage, high parity,
      squatting during delivery, prolonged labour, increasing age, menopause, hysterectomy,
      smoking, obesity, heavy lifting, and early return to work after parturition. High reports of
      POP and UI could be due to the exposure to these potential risks factors in Nepalese women.
      Women in Nepal play a significant role in agricultural and household work and are exposed to
      these risks factors daily. Studies have shown that besides longer days with work, women have
      less time for sleep and leisure. One of the main work related health problems for Nepalese
      women is physical effect of chronic overwork due to women's triple roles and subordinate
      position in the family.

      The government of Nepal created a fund to provide free surgery to women with POP in 2008.
      Surgery is a common treatment for POP, however 58% report an occurrence of recurrent prolapse
      after surgery and 29% report re-operations. PFM exercise has Level I evidence for treatment
      (Stage 1 &amp; 2) or prevention of POP. Women diagnosed with POP in Nepal, have 69.1%
      first-degree prolapse while the remaining 30.9% suffer from second and third-degree prolapse.
      Women's reluctance to seek treatment might be lack of family support, high costs for travel,
      food and lodging and ineffective treatment. Moreover, the health facilities are poor in rural
      areas as the infrastructure is weak, with few roads and commonly in poor condition which
      makes it more difficult. The PFM exercise does not need any instrument and can be done at
      home/workplace. PFM exercise for the treatment of POP (stage 1 &amp; 2) and UI was popularized by
      Kegel exercise. The use of PFM exercise is based on two functions of the PFM, support of the
      pelvic organs and a contribution to the sphincter closure mechanism of the urethra.

      This project will investigate the feasibility of a cost effective physiotherapy program based
      on information, education and exercise, hopefully to help improve the health outcome of
      Nepalese women. The feasibility study will be essential for a future cluster randomized
      controlled study.

      Hence, the aim is to assess the feasibility of performing PFM in pregnant women to help
      prevent or reduce POP and UI in Nepal.

Questionnaire data and clinical measurements(strength of PFM by Electromyograph biofeedback) will be registered at baseline and and follow-up at week 37 of pregnancy.
The treatment program will include
1) Information, education material (leaflets, posters and videos) and individual/group exercise on PFM exercise on the 1st day of the visit. Counseling about the importance of performing PFM exercise will be provided.Women are advised to perform home PFM exercise and record in the exercise diary.</description>

    <description>All the women will receive information and instruction/guidance exercise individually and in groups (leaflet, video, posters) on PFM exercise on the first day of their visit. Following this, the women are advised to perform daily home exercise which includes 10 sec hold X 10 times X 3 sets with 2 mins rest in between . Women will record their home PFM exercises using an exercise diary. During the follow up, women will attend the PFM exercise in a group or individual led by a Physiotherapists (to motivate and to ensure women are performing the PFM exercises correctly). Exercise diary will be collected in every follow up so that the information is retained even if the women discontinued or deviate from intervention protocols.</description>
