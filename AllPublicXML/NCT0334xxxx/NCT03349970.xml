  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) has become a standard monitoring tool during cardiac
      surgery. It allows continuous accurate assessment of heart structures and function without
      interfering with the surgery and the anesthetics. The imaging of cardiac structures is used
      to direct optimal surgical intervention and assess surgical results. Cardiac output (CO) is
      the result of stroke volume (SV) multiplied by the heart rate.

      Measurement of cardiac output (CO) is used to quantify the performance of the left ventricle.
      It is commonly achieved using a pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) (also known ad Swann-Ganz
      catheter). A known amount of saline solution is injected in the proximal part of the catheter
      and the variation of blood temperature detected at the tip. Cardiac output is measured based
      on the duration and degree of temperature change. This method remains an accepted gold
      standard. TEE allows measurement of cardiac output using a number of different 2D and 3D
      imaging modalities. Although current guidelines identify the Method of the Disks(MOD) as the
      gold standard other technique could potentially be more precise. In this study, the
      investigators want to assess the accuracy of four different TEE methods to measure cardiac
      output compared with Thermodilution as a standard of care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The measurement of the LV performance, as reflected by measuring cardiac output (CO), is an
      important component of hemodynamic assessment during cardiac (and non-cardiac) surgery. It
      has become standard of care in guiding fluid management and inotropic therapy in both the
      operating room (OR) and the intensive care unit (ICU) in most centres, and is considered by
      far the most understood and commonly communicated parameter of cardiac performance, in
      addition to being consistently shown as a predictor of patients' outcome.

      Several methods have been used to measure CO. The most commonly used is via thermodilution
      (PAC), but its invasive nature and potential for serious complications led to the utilization
      of the non-invasive methods, such as those based on TEE.

      Since the establishment of the role of TEE in the setting of hemodynamic monitoring during
      cardiac surgery, various ways of quantifying LV function have been utilized. The method
      recommended by current guidelines is a volumetric calculation via the method of disks
      (modified Simpson's method, MOD). Recent advances in ultrasound technology and software
      development allow the utilization three-dimensional (3D) volumetric assessment and speckle
      tracking for cardiac deformation.

    <description>we will compare the SV measurements obtained by PAC thermodilution technique to those obtained by different TEE methods in 60 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and/or aortic valve (AV) or aortic surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in 2 different cardiac centres. The LV cardiac deformation, expressed as global longitudinal strain (GLS) will be calculated off-line from the acquired images. We will also determine the intra and inter-observer reproducibility of each TEE method.</description>
