    <textblock>
      A multicenter, phase 3, long-term extension trial of TransCon hGH administered once-weekly in
      children with growth hormone deficiency (GHD) who previously participated in a phase 3
      TransCon hGH trial. Approximately 400 children (males and females) with GHD will be included.
      All study participants will receive TransCon hGH. This is a global trial that will be
      conducted in, but not limited to, the United States, Poland, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Armenia,
      Russia and Australia.
