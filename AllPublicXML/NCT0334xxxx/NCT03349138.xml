  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaulates the addition to the standard theraphy of enriched sensorimotor training
      by means of robotic glove therapy, or functional electrical stimulation in the treatment of
      chronic stroke patients with upper limb motor impairments. All the patients receive the
      conventional physiotherapic treatment. Supplemental to the conventional treatment, patients
      are evenly split in four groups to provide different treatments for an equivalent amount of
      time. Patient in the first group receive supplemental conventional therapy; patients in the
      second group receive robotic glove therapy; patients in the third group receive functional
      electrical stimulation; patients in the fourth group receive robotic glove treatment and
      functional electrical stimulation in different sessions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke very frequently impacts on patients' motor function, and particularly on upper limb
      movements. Limited hand functionality is a major negative outcome after stroke, negatively
      affecting patients' recovery and independence, with major impact on rehabilitation.However,
      standard motor rehabilitation outcome is often suboptimal, because insufficient or
      non-specific treatment is provided. Robotic hand mobilization and functiona electrical
      stimulation grasp rehabilitation each improve motor capabilities in grasp impaired patients,
      but they do so by different mechanisms.

      Robotic hand mobilization achieves grasp rehabilitation by providing passive mobilization of
      the affected limb if the subject does not react to the designed task.

      Functional electrical stimulation achieves grasp rehabilitation by inducing localized muscle
      contraction, that is by providing an electrical field able to stimulate both sensory afferent
      pathways and lower motor neurons in the targeted volume.

conventional treatment (27 treatments)
functional electrical stimulation (27 treatments)

    <time_frame>baseline; 9 weeks; 13 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>19-items outcome measure divided into 4 sub-tests (grasp, grip, pinch, and gross arm movement). Performance on each item is rated on a 4-point ordinal scale ranging from:
3: Performs test normally
2: Completes test, but takes abnormally long or has great difficulty
1: Performs test partially
0: Can perform no part of test</description>

    <measure>Motor Activity Log</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline; 9 weeks; 13 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Semi-structured interview to assess arm function. Individuals are asked to rate Quality of Movement and Amount of Movement during 30 daily functional tasks. Target tasks include object manipulation (e.g. pen, fork, comb, and cup) as well as the use of the arm during gross motor activities (e.g. transferring to a car, steadying oneself during standing, pulling a chair into a table while sitting). Items scored on a 6-point ordinal scale (0 not used, 6 as good as before).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Box &amp; Blocks Test</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline; 9 weeks; 13 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>It assesses unilateral gross manual dexterity. Individuals are seated at a table, facing a rectangular box that is divided into two square compartments of equal dimension by means of a partition. One hundred and fifty, 2.5 cm, colored, wooden cubes or blocks are placed in one compartment or the other. The individual is instructed to move as many blocks as possible, one at a time, from one compartment to the other for a period of 60 seconds.To administer the test, the examiner is seated opposite the individual in order to observe test performance. The test is scored by counting the number of blocks carried over the partition from one compartment to the other during the one-minute trial period. Both arms are tested.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Ashworth Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline; 9 weeks; 13 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It measures spasticity. It consists of a test resistance to passive movement about a joint with varying degrees of velocity. Scores range from 0-5; a score of 0 indicates no resistance, 5 indicates rigidity. Target muscles: Wrist flexor and extensor, fingers and thumb flexor and extensor</description>
