    <measure>TID beliefs in parents</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Parents will report their opinions towards 4 sentences: 1) Tobacco companies are a respectable industry; 2) the tobacco industry does everything it can to get young people to smoke; 2) the tobacco industry use many tactics to resist tobacco control regulations; 4) the tobacco industry deceived the public for financial interests. All the 4 questions have 5 options from definitely yes to definitely no. The options will be recoded into 0-4 or 4-0, as appropriate, with higher scores indicating more negative attitudes towards the industry. A sum of scores from the 4 questions will be deemed a measurement of TID beliefs.</description>

    <measure>Tobacco related communication reported by parents</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Parents will report whether they said the following to children in the past 30 days: 1) harm of smoking 2) harm of secondhand smoking 3) criticise smoking behaviour 4) approve tobacco control measures. Each of the messages will be analyse as a binary outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Parents will report whether they said the following to children in the past 30 days: 1) harm of SSB 2) certain kind of drinks contain sugar 3) don't drink or drink less SSB. Each of the messages will be analyse as a binary outcome.</description>

    <measure>Intention to smoke in children</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Two questions will be used to assess this outcome: 1) do you think you will smoke in the next 12 months? 2) If one of your good friends offers you a cigarette, will you smoke it? Response options are definitely not/probably not/probably yes/definitely yes. Those choosing options other than &quot;definitely not&quot; for either of the questions will be deemed having intention to smoke; the other students will be deemed having no intention to smoke.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Home exposure to secondhand smoke in children reported by children</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>One question will be asked: 1) On how many of the past 7 days did someone smoke near you at home? (Options 0 day/1/2/3/4/5/6/7). The responses will dichotomised into a binary indicator of secondhand smoke exposure (no/any) and analysed as an outcome.</description>

    <measure>Parents' support for tobacco control</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Parents will report their opinions towards 4 sentences: 1) government should adopt plain packaging; 2) government should impose stronger regulation on tobacco; 3) government should strengthen the prevention of the harm of tobacco. The options were strongly support/support/neutral/oppose/strongly oppose. The options will be recoded into 4-0, with higher scores indicating stronger support for tobacco control. A sum of scores from the 4 questions will be deemed a measurement of parents' support for tobacco control.</description>

    <measure>Negative attitude towards smoking in parents</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Parents will be asked &quot;your attitude towards smoking is&quot; with options of very positive/positive/neutral/negative/very negative. The options will be dichotomised as very negative vs others (negative/neutral/positive/very positive) for analysis.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Past 7-day consumption of SSB and water in children reported by children</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Children will be asked &quot;On how many of the past 7 days did you drink SSBs?&quot; and &quot;On how many of the past 7 days did you drink water?&quot; For both questions, the options were 0/1/2/3/4/5/6/7 days. These two variables will be analysed as both binary (No (0 day) vs any (1/2/3/4/5/6/7 days)) and continuous variables.</description>
