  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Wound complications, such as salivary-cutaneous fistulas and skin necrosis, result in
      significant patient morbidity and death. Head and neck wounds are complicated because of
      multiple tissue layers, critical structures and variable vascularity. When vascularity is
      compromised, wounds do not heal and can lead to life threatening haemorrhage or morbid
      infections. The field of microsurgical reconstruction has developed and expanded over the
      last 20 years to specifically ameliorate these issues. The challenge is that the vascularity
      of the microsurgical transplant or the recipient tissue bed can have areas of decreased
      vascularity that cannot be appreciated by the surgeon's intraoperative exam alone. Surgeons
      would be able to make better decisions with respect to the vascularity if there was an
      imaging technique that could indicate the vascular supply of the tissues undergoing surgical
      reconstruction.

      Laser-assisted indocyanine green fluorescent dye angiography (LA-ICG) using the SPY System
      (Novadaq Technologies Inc., Richmond, British Columbia, Canada) is an intraoperative vascular
      imaging technique that improves the ability of a surgeon to assess the vascular supply in the
      surgical bed. This tool, which is approved by Health Canada for reconstructive surgery, has
      been used extensively in breast reconstruction and gastrointestinal procedures with
      encouraging results. The ability to address ischemic tissues intraoperatively could
      potentially decrease the rate of devastating wound complications in head and neck surgery
      patients. The objective of this observational study is to assess the effectiveness of LA-ICG
      in head and neck reconstructive procedures to reduce the rate of skin necrosis and fistula.

      This is a prospective, observational study in patients undergoing head and neck surgery with
      reconstruction. Patients will be identified preoperatively by the participating surgeons.
      Eligible patients will be &gt;18 years of age with head and neck oncologic or traumatic
      reconstructive needs requiring surgical reconstruction of the soft tissues or bony structures
      of the head and neck who consent to use of ICG and the SPY System intraoperatively. Defect
      types to be included in the study are any hypopharyngeal defect (i.e. Total laryngectomy,
      total laryngectomy with partial pharyngectomy), tracheal defects, oral cavity defects at risk
      for devascularized mucosa, or large skin defects requiring rotation-advancement flaps for
      closure. Donor types to be included are pedicled locoregional muscle flaps including
      pectoralis muscle flaps, cervicofacial skin advancement flaps, infrascapular and
      suprascapular flaps, and any free flap used to reconstruct the defects mentioned previously.
