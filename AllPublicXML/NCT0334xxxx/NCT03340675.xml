  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a devastating X-linked disease which leads to loss of
      ambulation between ages 7 and 13, respiratory failure and cardiomyopathy (CM) at any age, and
      inevitably premature death of affected young men in their late twenties. DMD is the most
      common fatal genetic disorder diagnosed in childhood. It affects approximately 1 in every
      3,500 live male births across all races and cultures, and results in 20,000 new cases each
      year worldwide.Significant advances in respiratory care have unmasked CM as the leading cause
      of death. As there are yet no specific cardiac treatments to extend life, the current study
      aims to address this unmet medical need using a new therapeutic strategy for patients with
      DMD.

      This is a phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple dose study to
      determine the safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of two doses of oral ifetroban in
      subjects with DMD. DMD patients who meet the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion
      criteria will receive oral ifetroban or placebo once daily for 12 months. Subjects will be
      enrolled onto one of three treatment groups, low-dose ifetroban, high-dose ifetroban or
      placebo. Each dose level will be evaluated by eight subjects with early stage (7-15 yo) DMD
      and eight subjects with advanced stage (16+ yo) DMD as there may be differences in the amount
      and rate of drug absorption. Each subject treated will be evaluated for first-dose and
      steady-state exposure PK. All subjects who receive treatment will be assessed for safety. All
      subjects with at least one efficacy assessment post-baseline will be evaluated for efficacy.
      Blood and urine will be collected for standard and novel cardiac biomarkers.

    <description>The 23 items PedQL measure these core dimensions of health as delineated by the World Health Organization, as well as role (school) functioning. Items measured include 1) Physical Functioning (8 items), 2) Emotional Functioning (5 items), 3) Social Functioning (5 items), and 4) School Functioning (5 items). Each item is measured on a 5 point Likert scale with 0 indicating never and 4 indicating almost always. The Likert scores are reversed scored and linearly transform to a 0-100 scale with 0=100, 1-75, 2=50, 5=25, and 4=0. A higher score indicates better health-related quality of life.</description>
