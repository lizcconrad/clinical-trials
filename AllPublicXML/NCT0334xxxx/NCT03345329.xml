  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than ninety percent of adults in Taiwan are suspected to carry periodontal disease,
      which causes bad breath, swollen and bleeding gums, plaque and even tooth loss. Half of the
      patients, however, are ignorance these clinical syndromes because of no obvious pain. In this
      study, the investigators selected six periodontal disease-associated bacteria strains,
      including Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), Actinobacillus
      actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), Tannerella forsythia (Tf), Treponema denticola (Td) and
      Prevotella intermedia (Pi) as diagnostic markers. Using real-time PCR and MALDI Biotyper, the
      investigators will establish the database of oral microorganisms in Taiwanese people,
      providing periodontal disease clinical markers of high-risk groups and the basis for personal
      medicine of therapy in the future.

    <measure>The change of PSR score, GI, PI, and oral bacteria strains between periodontal disease patients and healthy people after receiving periodontal therapy and using mouthwash</measure>
    <time_frame>9 month</time_frame>
    <description>To compare the value of PSR score (0-4 point), GI (0-4 point), and PI (0-5 point) with periodontal disease patients older than 60 years of age, periodontal disease patients younger than 60 years of age and healthy people after receiving periodontal therapy and using mouthwash. Oral bacteria strains are also compared with these groups.</description>
