    <textblock>
      This study evaluates use of DISCSS vis SCS. Thirty (30) patients with back pain greater than
      leg pain who were candidates for Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) and have successfully
      completed a percutaneous trial with a commercially available SCS system will be trialed with
      a 3-4 day exposure to the investigational DISCSS™ device. The trial will be conducted at 3-5
      U.S. centers. The percutaneous trial leads from the commercial system will be connected to
      the External Pulse Generator of the DISCSS™ Trial System and the patients will be trialed for
      an additional three-four days.

    <textblock>
      This investigation will be performed as a prospective, multicenter, open-label feasibility
      study. Thirty (30) patients with back pain greater than leg pain who were candidates for
      Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) and have successfully completed a percutaneous trial with a
      commercially available SCS system will be trialed with a 3-4 day exposure to the
      investigational DISCSS™ device. The trial will be conducted at 3-5 U.S. centers. The
      percutaneous trial leads from the commercial system will be connected to the External Pulse
      Generator of the DISCSS™ Trial System and the patients will be trialed for an additional
      three to four days. The investigational product for this feasibility trial will be the
      DISCSS™ system, not the commercially available trial SCS system. Exposure to the commercially
      available trial SCS system will be considered background therapy. The purpose of the
      background therapy phase is to establish baseline pain levels and determine patients'
      eligibility to continue to the investigational phase of the trial using the DISCSS™ SCS phase
      of the trial. Pain assessment and complications data from the commercial spinal stimulation
      system will be collected during the background therapy phase. The pain and complications data
      from the background therapy phase will not be analyzed in terms of the study endpoints.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age greater than 21 years and less than 80 years
