  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) has emerged over the past decade as a
      post-transcriptional regulator of the LDL receptor (LDL-R). PCSK9 acts as an endogenous
      natural inhibitor of the LDL-R pathway. Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) directed against PCSK9,
      such as Alirocumab, are the most common method of PCSK9 inhibition.

      The goal of the present study is to assess, in the context of type 2 diabetes, a situation
      associated with an increased post-prandial hyperlipemia, whether PCSK9 inhibition with
      Alirocumab affects postprandial intestinal lipoprotein metabolism.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recently, human monoclonal antibodies directed against PCSK9 have been shown to be effective
      in reducing LDL cholesterol. Besides the liver, little is known about the role of PCSK9 in
      the small intestine, a tissue where it is expressed at a high level. Preclinical studies in
      mice indicate that PCSK9 inhibition reduces post-prandial hyperlipemia.

      Here, the investigators will test the effect of PCSK9 inhibition with alirocumab, a PCSK9
      mAb, on post-prandial hyperlipemia in 24 patients with type 2 diabetes. The investigators
      will perform a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial with alirocumab
      75 mg every two weeks.

      In the cross-over design, two periods of 10-weeks treatment (i.e. 5 injections) will be
      separated by a 10-week wash-out period to avoid carry-over effect. The primary endpoint will
      be the total area under the post-prandial triglycerides concentration-time curve from
      meal-time until 8h (AUC0-8h) after a standardized meal test. As secondary endpoints, the
      investigators will explore the effect of alirocumab on plasma lipids, markers of cholesterol
      absorption and synthesis, and glycemic parameters.

      This study will help to decipher the function of PCSK9 on intestinal lipoprotein metabolism
      in human and to determine whether alirocumab can reduce post-prandial hyperlipemia, which is
      an independent cardiovascular risk factor. From a patient perspective, this study will give
      some important clues for the management of cardiovascular disease.
