    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study comparing endocuff-assisted colonoscopy to standard colonoscopy.
      The goal of this study is to evaluate the interest of second-generation Endocuff Vision (ECV)
      to improve Adenoma detection rate and / or Polyp detection rate as the Mean Number of Polyps
      (average number of polyps) in routine colonoscopy.

      This is a prospective comparative study, on 2000 patients, 1000 in each group (with and
      without ECV)

      This is a prospective study comparing endocuff-assisted colonoscopy to standard colonoscopy.
      The goal of this study is to evaluate the interest of second-generation Endocuff Vision (ECV)
      to improve Adenoma detection rate and / or Polyp detection rate as the Mean Number of Polyps
      (average number of polyps) in routine colonoscopy.

      Number of patients:

      2000 patients, 1000 in each group (with and without ECV). To limit the risk of bias, the
      investigators will random two teams of 12 endoscopists matched in number, volume of activity
      and Adenoma Detection Rate (evaluated over a period of the year preceding the study).

      Both periods of study will be approximately 3-4 months in length. In order to achieve a
      perfect balance between the two groups of patients, an inclusion tracking chart will be
      initiate and will be carefully controlled. Rebalancing will be done for both periods of study
      to obtain 500 patients per group and per period (= 2000 patients included).

      Inclusion of 500 consecutive colonoscopies in each team of investigators, a &quot;colonoscopy with
      ECV&quot; team, a &quot;colonoscopy without ECV&quot; team then switch and inclusion of 500 new consecutive
      colonoscopies in each team, ie 2000 colonoscopies in total.

      The selection of the team that will begin with ECV (Team A) and the team that will finish
      with ECV (Team B) will be chosen at random before the start of the study.

      A comparison of the two colonoscopy groups with ECV vs without ECV will be made for each team
      (the investigator will be his own control) and then on the overall population after the end
      of the trial.
