  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, Sorafenib is the only drug therapy to have demonstrated a benefit in overall
      survival in patients with advanced or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma. However, this
      treatment causes many adverse effects that may limit its prescription.

      Under these conditions, predicting and therefore potentially preventing the adverse effects
      of sorafenib is a major issue in the management of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma
      treated with this drug.

      Currently, there is little data available on the correlation between the pharmacokinetics of
      sorafenib and the side effects of this drug in patients treated for hepatocellular carcinoma.

      Investigators propose an observational cohort study evaluating the correlation between
      residual plasma concentration of sorafenib and the risk of severe adverse effects (grades
      3-5) in treatment in patients treated for hepatocellular carcinoma on cirrhosis.

      This study should include 60 patients over an expected duration of 12 months. The aim of this
      work is to determine whether there is a correlation between the residual plasma concentration
      of sorafenib and the occurrence of severe adverse effects (grades 3-5) at treatment in
      patients treated for hepatocellular carcinoma on cirrhosis as well as potential influence of
      the etiology of cirrhosis on this relationship. The ultimate ambition is to be able to
      anticipate and thus prevent these adverse effects in order to increase the safety of the drug
      and potentially its effectiveness.
