      The hypothesis was to check whether baseline anti-E1E2 antibodies could predict virological

    <textblock>
      Presence of anti-E1E2 antibodies was previously associated with spontaneous cure of hepatitis
      C virus (HCV). The hypothesis was to check whether baseline anti-E1E2 antibodies could
      predict virological outcome in HCV-infected patients receiving direct-acting antiviral
      treatment
