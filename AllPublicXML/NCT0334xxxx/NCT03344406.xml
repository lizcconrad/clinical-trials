  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are chronic inflammatory conditions
      involving the small airways with airflow limitations resulting from genetic and environmental
      interactions. Currently, there are no existing subject diaries with evidence of
      responsiveness to measure the daily symptoms of asthma. Therefore, there is a need to either
      develop a new symptom diary to characterize subject burden of asthma symptoms or modify/adapt
      an existing tool from a related disease area for use in subjects with moderate to severe
      asthma. The E-RS in COPD (E-RS: COPD®) questionnaire was developed as a measure of daily
      respiratory symptoms associated with COPD. The fixed dose combination of fluticasone furoate/
      umeclidinium/ vilanterol (FF/UMEC/VI) administered via the ELLIPTA® dry powder inhaler (DPI)
      has been developed for the treatment of asthma. This cross-sectional, qualitative study is
      designed to understand the symptoms and disease experience of subjects with moderate to
      severe asthma. This study will also evaluate underlying concepts that are most important to
      asthmatic subjects compared to symptoms and concepts included in the E-RS: COPD and two
      supplemental asthma items (wheeze and shortness of breath with physical activity).
      Approximately 32 subjects will be included in the study and interviewed via telephone. Each
      interview including time for consent, qualitative interview, and completion of case report
      forms (CRFs) is expected to last approximately 60 to 90 minutes. Subjects will be expected to
      complete a daily diary for the next 7 days, following the initial telephone interview. E-RS:

    <description>A semi-structured interview guide will introduce and direct the discussion during the interview session. It will be used to elicit concepts of moderate to severe asthma symptoms and impacts as well as to assess the overall comprehension of the E-RS: COPD and supplemental asthma items. The interview guide is also designed to elicit from subjects how they used the provided response options to answer each item and provide them the opportunity to report if there are missing categories or if they could not respond to the item with the given response option.</description>

    <measure>Number of subjects completing E-RS questionnaire in COPD</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 7 days</time_frame>
    <description>The E-RS: COPD questionnaire consists of 11 items from the 14 item exacerbations of COPD (EXACT-PRO) instrument. The 11-items will be scored on a 5-point scale ranging from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;extreme&quot;. Items of the E-RS: COPD will capture information related to respiratory symptoms such as breathlessness, cough, sputum production, chest congestion, and chest tightness. The daily recording of information with the E-RS: COPD will allow assessment of underlying day-to-day variability of a subject's symptoms.</description>
