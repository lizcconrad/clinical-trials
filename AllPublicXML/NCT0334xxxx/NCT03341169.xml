  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to confirm if myocardial protection effect can be obtained by
      intravenous administration of glutamine in patients undergoing aortic valve replacement with
      severe aortic stenosis (who are at high risk for ischemia-reperfusion injury). As a
      prospective double blinded randomized placebo-controlled trial, the investigators detect and
      compare the degree of myocardial damage(with CK-MB and Troponin T) and myocardial protection
      (through hsp 70 expression in atrial tissue), cardiovascular index, inflammatory reaction,
      and clinical manifestation.
