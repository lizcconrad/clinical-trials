  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is not yet a standardized system of human embryonic culture in vitro. In addition,
      technical improvements continually appear. The investigators recently carried out a study in
      which it shows that the grouped embryo culture at low oxygen tension (5% O2) in a benchtop
      incubator shows better success rates than individual culture at atmospheric oxygen tension
      (20% O2) in a conventional incubator. For these reasons, the investigators have decided to
      continue this research line to evaluate the efficacy of a new ART station with a closed
      environment in comparison of an open flow cabinet. This new system keeps a controled
      environment maintaining a carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration of 6% and a temperature of 37
      degrees. A prospective randomized study will be carried out in which the manipulation of the
      gametes and pre-embryos of the patients will be carried out in open laminar flow cabinets or
      in a closed station that maintain the CO2 and temperature conditions.
