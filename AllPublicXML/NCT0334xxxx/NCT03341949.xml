  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic renal disease (CKD) is defined as a decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and
      / or proteinuria or albuminuria (a protein present in urine). Albuminuria is considered a
      marker of endothelial dysfunction. Proteinuria and / or albuminuria are recognized as
      cardiovascular risk factors in both diabetic and non-diabetic populations, independently of
      GFR. It is also a marker of progression of kidney disease. cluster of differentiation 146
      (CD146) is an endothelial adhesion molecule with preferential localization in the junction.
      Soluble CD146 (or CD146s). CD146s is a biomarker of endothelial dysfunction that is easy to
      assay. The increase in CD146 levels was described during the MRC, especially in diabetic
      patients with significant proteinuria. In two independent cohorts of patients with CDR,
      CD146s did not correlate with creatinine or GFR but appeared to correlate with proteinuria.

      The aim of our study is to determine whether the blood concentration of CD146s is correlated
      with proteinuria independently of GFR. For this purpose, we propose this study in the kidney
      nephrology and transplantation center of Conception Hospital, with the objective of
      highlighting the link between proteinuria and serum CD146 levels in patients with CKD,
      whatever their renal function and / or underlying pathology. 205 patients will be included
      over two years with dosing of CD146s and proteinuria at the same time. These 205 patients
      will be recruited at each stage of the CKD (41 in each arm). CD146s could be a new biomarker
      predicting the risk of renal function impairment or cardiovascular risk independent of renal
      function.
