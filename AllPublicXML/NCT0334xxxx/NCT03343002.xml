  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fentanyl is a commonly used drug for the prevention of emergence agitation and reduction in
      postoperative pain in children receiving tonsillectomy. However, fentanyl can cause
      postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), which is a main target side effect that medical
      staff strives to prevent. However, recent meta-analysis showed that the incidence of PONV may
      be different depending on the time of administration of fentanyl. However, the research
      design of patients enrolled in each study, such as the age, the name of the operation, and
      the method of anesthesia, is not identical. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of fentanyl in patients undergoing tonsillectomy with a prospective
      randomized controlled trial. Secondary outcomes include incidence and severity of emergence
      agitation and anesthesia recovery time, postanesthesia care unit (PACU) time, side effects.
