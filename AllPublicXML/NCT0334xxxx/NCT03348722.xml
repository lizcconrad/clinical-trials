  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the START project is to evaluate the acceptability, the safety and the
      cost-effectiveness of a population based program of active surveillance for patients newly
      diagnosed with a localized, low risk, prostate cancer.
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Comparative effectiveness research project. All newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients
      fulfilling the low risk definition, resident in Piedmont or in Valle D'Aosta regions, will be
      invited to participate. All enrolled patients will receive full and clear information about
      their prognosis together with a balanced synthesis of the benefits and risks of the available
      treatments (active surveillance or radical treatments).

      Specific objectives are:

        -  To estimate, at a population level, the proportion of newly diagnosed prostate cancer at
           low risk, eligible for active surveillance, the proportion of those accepting to be
           enrolled in a cohort of active surveillance and the risk of abandoning the program
           during follow-up.

        -  To compare the patients' and physicians' characteristics of those accepting to be
           managed within the active surveillance program with those preferring a radical treatment
           (either surgery or radiotherapy).

        -  To compare, at a population level, the clinical outcomes, quality of life and costs
           associated to different treatment choices.
