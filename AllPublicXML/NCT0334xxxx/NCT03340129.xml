    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, open label, non-randomised study of ipilimumab and nivolumab, with
      salvage radiotherapy, in adult patients with melanoma brain metastases. All patients will be
      in a single systemic treatment group at study entry and will receive 12 weeks of ipilimumab
      and nivolumab, followed by nivolumab monotherapy until confirmed disease progression, drug
      toxicity or death. Patients may be treated beyond progression if their treating clinician
      believes there is clinical benefit to do so.

      At brain MRI scans between 6 and 12 weeks after starting systemic therapy, patients who have
      RECIST-determined intracranial disease progression will receive salvage radiotherapy.
      Patients with fewer than 5 progressing metastases will receive stereotactic radiotherapy and
      patients with 6 or more progressing metastases will receive whole brain radiotherapy.

      The main aims of the study are to determine the objective response to systemic treatment and
      the intracranial progression free survival for patients who require salvage radiotherapy.
      Adverse events, neurocognitive function, quality of life and the study of tissue and blood
      biomarkers will also be examined.

      1. BACKGROUND The ABC study (NCT02374242) is a phase II clinical trial recruiting 3 cohorts
           of patients with melanoma brain metastases. Two cohorts were patients who were
           asymptomatic from the brain metastases and local treatment naïve. A 3rd cohort included
           patients with a poorer prognosis who may have had one or more of: failed prior local
           therapy for brain metastases where disease has progressed per RECIST; have neurological
           symptoms related to brain metastases and / or have leptomeningeal disease concurrently
           with brain metastases. Patients received immunotherapy with either nivolumab alone or
           nivolumab combined with ipilimumab. Recruitment of 76 patients is complete and the
           preliminary results have been presented in 2017. Nivolumab together with ipilimumab is a
           proven treatment combination and in the ABC study, shown to be more effective than
           nivolumab alone in melanoma brain metastases. The combination will therefore be used in
           this trial. In addition, findings from pre-clinical and clinical research provides
           evidence supporting the ability of radiotherapy to induce anti-tumour immune responses
           and augment the efficacy of anti-PD1 checkpoint blockade in melanoma and provide
           mechanistic rationale for clinical trials of combined therapy in the definitive and
           metastatic setting.

        2. STUDY DESIGN This current protocol builds on the ABC study and will assess the clinical
           outcomes of the combined modalities of immunotherapy with radiotherapy to the brain, in
           patients who progress on combined ipilimumab and nivolumab in the first 6 to 18 weeks of
           treatment. In the ABC trial, early results showed that 50% of patients who were
           treatment naïve and received ipilimumab with nivolumab, had a partial or complete
           response in the brain assessed by imaging at 6 to 12 weeks. By delaying the decision to
           administer salvage radiotherapy until 6 to 18 weeks, a significant proportion of
           patients will avoid the toxicities associated with the addition of radiotherapy.

           The main aim of this study will be to measure the effect of immunotherapy +/-
           radiotherapy on intracranial disease control. The study will recruit 155 patients with
           asymptomatic, untreated melanoma brain metastases and all will be treated with
           combination ipilimumab and nivolumab at the doses and duration approved by worldwide
           regulatory authorities. As in the ABC study, imaging of intracranial and extracranial
           disease will be performed at weeks 6, 12 and 18 from commencing systemic study
           treatment.

        3. CRITERIA FOR SALVAGE RADIOTHERAPY

           Patients who demonstrate intracranial disease progression per RECIST criteria, between
           week 6 and week 18, will receive either stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or whole brain
           radiotherapy (WBRT):

             -  SRS for progression in the setting of 5 or fewer intracranial lesions

             -  WBRT for progression in the setting of 6 or more intracranial lesions

           The size or volume of the lesions will not be considered in the treatment choice.
           Radiotherapy will be delivered concurrently with immunotherapy, which may continue
           beyond week 6 imaging and continue beyond week 18 imaging if the circumstances described
           in Section 7 are met.

           Some patients treated with immunotherapy may develop pseudo progression of disease (by
           conventional response criteria). Differentiating between disease progression and
           pseudo-progression, perilesional oedema, necrosis and intralesional haemorrhage at
           imaging between weeks 6 and 12 may require discussion at a multidisciplinary forum.

        4. NEUROCOGNITIVE FUNCTION AND QUALITY OF LIFE Neurocognitive impairment is a concern in
           the setting of radiotherapy delivered for brain metastases. The addition of
           immunotherapy for enhanced local disease control and survival may augment the risks.
           Quality of life (QoL) assessment is therefore an important objective in clinical trials
           studying the effects of new interventions, where side effects and tolerability are as
           important as clinical benefit. It is important to understand what cognitive problems
           exist before treatment, to establish a baseline by which the effect of treatment is
           judged, and to determine whether different treatment regimens improve neurocognitive
           function due to better tumour control, slow the expected neurocognitive deterioration
           due to the tumour, or have more or less short- and long-term neurotoxicity. This aspect
           of patient evaluation, in addition to survival and time to tumour progression, will
           yield better risk-versus-benefit assessments and provide a basis for improving
           interventions. A number of tools will be used to assess neurocognitive function and
           quality of life related to brain disease.

           The Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) is a commonly used examination for measuring gross
           neurocognitive function (NCF) in patients with brain metastases. The test can be
           administered by trained staff in minutes and can provide some insight into the overall
           neurological functioning of the patient. Questions are designed to screen the patient's
           visuo-constructional and language skills, memory, orientation in time and space, and
           ability to calculate and sustain attention.

           The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) questionnaires are commonly used to
           assess cancer-related QoL issues. The FACT-Brain (FACT-Br) module provides an additional
           set of disease-specific questions pertaining to brain neoplasms and is completed by the
           patient.

           The EORTC QLQ-C30, an internationally validated cancer-specific QOL-instrument, assesses
           various facets of functioning, symptoms common in cancer patients and global QOL. The
           Brain Cancer Module (EORTC QLQ-BN20 is a 20-item supplement for the QLQ-C30 to assess
           neurological related quality of life and neurological symptoms and is being utilised in
           the main ABC study. Among the symptoms captured by neurocognitive tests are
           communication deficits and memory problems. In these cases, a patient-rated QoL tool may
           not capture the true effects of the disease or the intervention to treat it. The EORTC
           QLQ-C30 comprises six functional scales (physical functioning, cognitive functioning,
           emotional functioning, social functioning and global quality of life) as well as nine
           symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting, dyspnoea, insomnia, appetite loss,
           constipation, diarrhoea, and financial difficulties). Both C30 and BN20 modules have
           been validated for assessing health-related quality of life and symptoms in patients
           with brain cancer.

           Anecdotally, the partner or carer of a patient reports different observations of the
           impact of disease and treatment, and therefore capturing these provide an additional
           insight of the impact of disease and treatment on neuro-cognition. The EORTC QLQ C30 and
           BN 20 can be modified for the collection of proxy-ratings in the third person, instead
           of the first person self-rating version. Proxy-ratings obtained from the 'significant
           other' is a useful measure, if a patients' ability to report on his QOL diminishes due
           to physical or cognitive deterioration.

           General health status will also be measured using the EQ-5D. The EQ-5D is a standardized
           instrument for use as a measure of self-reported health status. The EQ-5D comprises 5
           dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety) and a
           visual analogue rating scale (VAS). The utility data generated from the EQ-5D is
           commonly used in cost effectiveness analyses.

           This current study will utilise the above tools, together with the ECOG performance
           status and adverse event profile, in order to assess the costs and benefits of adding
           radiotherapy to immunotherapy in patients with melanoma brain metastases. In particular,
           the neurological adverse event profile will be recorded, including the incidence of
           radionecrosis, intracranial haemorrhage, seizure, cerebral oedema and cognitive
           dysfunction. Comparisons will be made with reported rates for patients with brain
           metastases receiving radiotherapy only.

        5. CORRELATIVE BLOOD AND TISSUE BIOMARKER STUDIES Some patients may not benefit from
           radiation therapy and immunotherapy combinations. Therefore, biomarkers predictive of
           response. or the lack of it. are needed. Extensive correlative analyses of tumoral and
           peripheral blood immunologic changes will be essential to a better understanding of the
           mechanistic interactions between these 2 treatment modalities.

           To address this, blood and tissue samples will be obtained. Blood will be collected at
           baseline, at 2 weeks of treatment and then 6 weekly to examine serum chemokines,
           cytokines, inflammatory markers, lymphocyte and T cell subsets and myeloid derived
           suppressor cells and to assess correlation with disease response or progression. All
           Cohorts will be included in this study, as will the 3 Cohorts in the main ABC study.

           In patients with sufficient archival melanoma tissue from metastatic sites, a baseline
           tumour PD-L1 level, immune markers and genetics of response and resistance will also be
           measured. If available, tumour tissue following progression of accessible extracranial
           disease and / or craniotomy will also be tested for immune and genetic markers.

        6. CONTINUED SYSTEMIC TREATMENT IN CASES OF PROGRESSIVE DISEASE

           The application of traditional RECIST criteria (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid
           Tumors) in patients treated with immunotherapy may lead to premature discontinuation of
           treatment in a patient who will eventually respond to treatment or have prolonged
           disease stabilization. Disease progression may occur in extracranial lesions whilst
           patients may continue to have disease stabilisation or response of their intracranial
           melanoma disease, and vice versa. The patterns of response to treatment with these
           immunotherapy agents differ from those with molecularly targeted agents or cytotoxic
           chemotherapy in several important respects:

             -  Patients may have a transient worsening of disease, manifested either by
                progression of known lesions or the appearance of new lesions, before disease
                stabilizes or tumour regresses. Therefore caution should be taken in abandoning
                therapy early. In general these delayed responses are not observed in patients with
                rapidly progressive, symptomatic disease.

             -  Responses can take appreciably longer to become apparent compared with cytotoxic
                therapy. Continued disease regression is frequently observed well after completion
                of the initial induction period.

             -  Some patients who do not meet traditional criteria for objective response can have
                prolonged periods of stable disease that are clinically significant.

           An evaluation of data from ipilimumab phase II clinical trials in advanced melanoma
           found patients characterized as PD at week 12 (by WHO criteria), either by an increase
           in tumour burden and/or the appearance of new lesions, subsequently experienced an
           objective response or SD (relative to baseline) without the addition of non-ipilimumab
           anticancer therapy. Examination of biopsies taken from patients receiving ipilimumab
           demonstrated that in some small unmeasurable lesions noted at baseline, an increase in
           size may be interpreted as PD, when instead, this may be due to inflammation due to T
           cell infiltration.

        7. CONTINUED TREATMENT WITH NIVOLUMAB Patients who are found to have RECIST defined
           intracranial or extracranial progression (or both) from 12 weeks onwards, and who do not
           have clinical signs or symptoms of progression, may continue on nivolumab and must have
           a confirmatory scan within 4 to 6 weeks. The date of the original assessment of
           progression will be used to record progression, and not the date of the confirmatory
           imaging. Continued immunotherapy treatment is permitted if the treating clinician
           determines that the patient is still clinically benefiting from immunotherapy and the
           patient is willing to continue drug treatment. Consideration may be given to stable or
           good response extra- or intra- cranially with concurrent progression in the other as a
           scenario that may warrant further treatment.

             brain as well as up to 5 extracranial target lesions). There is no upper limit
             restriction in the number of brain metastases, provided the remaining eligibility
             criteria are met.

          4. Brain metastases must be untreated with any modality of radiotherapy or systemic
             treatment. Previous surgery for melanoma brain metastases is permitted. Neoadjuvant or
             adjuvant systemic drug treatment, if completed more than 12 months from the time of
             enrolment, is permitted. Prior immunotherapy in any form or timepoint is not permitted
             in any circumstances.

          5. Asymptomatic from brain metastases at study entry. Resolved neurological symptoms are
             permitted.

          6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0-2.

          7. A life expectancy &gt; 30 days.

          8. Able to undergo MRI with Gadolinium contrast agent. CT of the brain is not an
             acceptable alternative should patients be unable to safely undergo a contrast MRI.

          9. Adequate haematological, hepatic and renal organ function as defined by:

               1. White cell count ≥ 2.0 × 10x9/L

               2. Neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 × 10x9/L

               3. Haemoglobin ≥ 90 g/L

               4. Platelet count ≥ 100 x 10x9/L

               5. Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN

               6. Alanine transaminase ≤ 3.0 x ULN

               7. Aspartate aminotransferase ≤ 3.0 x ULN

               8. Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN). If serum creatinine is
                  &gt; 1.5 x ULN, calculate creatinine clearance using standard Cockcroft-Gault
                  formula. Creatinine clearance must be 40ml/min to be eligible.

         10. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum pregnancy test
             within 7 days of the first dose of study treatment and agree to use effective
             contraception from 14 days prior to commencing study treatment, throughout the
             treatment period and for 23 weeks * after the last dose of study treatment. Effective
             contraception includes:

               1. Intrauterine device with a documented failure rate of less than 1% per year.

               2. Vasectomised partner who is sterile prior to the female partner patient's
                  commencement of study treatment and is the sole sexual partner for that female.

               3. Double barrier contraception: male condom and occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                  cervical / vault caps).

             Women who are not of childbearing potential are defined as any female who has had a
             documented hysterectomy, bilateral oopherectomy or bilateral tubal ligation or any
             female who is post-menopausal (≥ one year without menses and &gt;50 years of age in the
             absence of hormone replacement therapy).

         11. Men with any female partner of childbearing potential must agree to use effective
             contraception from 14 days prior to commencing study treatment, throughout the
             treatment period and for 31 weeks* after the last dose of study treatment. Effective
             contraception includes:

               1. Documented vasectomy and sterility

               2. In the partner - intrauterine device with a documented failure rate of less than
                  1% per year

               3. Double barrier contraception: male condom and occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                  cervical/vault caps).

                    -  These durations have been calculated using the upper limit of the half-life
                       for nivolumab (25 days) and are based on the protocol requirement that WOCBP
                       use contraception for 5 half-lives plus 30 days and men who are sexually
                       active with WOCBP use contraception for 5 half-lives plus 90 days.

             Exclusion Criteria:

         12. Melanoma brain metastasis greater than 40mm.

         13. Evidence of leptomeningeal disease, with the exception of pathological findings seen
             at a previous resection of brain disease, but with no evidence of leptomeningeal
             disease elsewhere at the time of resection or at study entry.

         14. History of, or current ocular melanoma (patients with mucosal and acral melanoma are

                  systemic corticosteroids is permitted during radiotherapy if the patient
                  experiences radiation related symptoms but this should be tapered per standard
                  clinical practice as soon as possible and before the next infusion of study drug
