    <textblock>
      Introduction: Preeclampsia (PE) and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) are two major
      pregnancy complications, related to a chronic utero-placental hypoperfusion. Nowadays, there
      isn't a screening or diagnostic test in clinic for utero-placental vascularization
      deficiency. Since 2004, 3D Power Doppler angiography has been used for the evaluation of
      utero-placental vascularisation and three vascular indices have been calculated: the
      vascularisation index (VI), flow index (FI) and vascularisation-FI (VFI). A high intra and
      inter-observer reproducibility and its potential interest for placental function study were
      reported. The investigator's main hypothesis is that these 3DPD indices could provide
      predictive values for PE and/or IUGR occurrence much higher than those observed with the
      currents other markers.

      Objectives: The main objective of this study is to determine differences in 3DPD indices at
      first trimester between pregnancies defined at their outcome as uncomplicated pregnancy, PE
      (mild and severe) and IUGR in nulliparous women.

      Methods and analysis: This is a prospective study. The investigators expect to include 2200
      women in 3 French centers: CHRU of Nancy, Paris-APHP Port-Royal, and Strasbourg.

      The nulliparous pregnant women will be recruited during their 1st trimester consultation for
      routine Down syndrome screening (11-13+6 GW). Especially for the study, the 3DPD and Uterine
      Artery Doppler (UAD) acquisition, which last less than 10 min, will be included in the
      current routine 11-13+6 GW ultrasound screening for Down syndrome. Also, additional blood
      samples will be taken for biomarker analysis (PAPP-A and P1GF) and biological collection.
      Utero-placental vascularization indices (VI, FI, VFI) will be quantified using VOCALÂ®
      software. For each subgroup (uncomplicated pregnancy, PE and IUGR) mean values in 3DPD
      indices will be computed and compared using a pairwise t test with a Bonferroni correction p
      value adjustment.
