  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis is a common immune mediated inflammatory skin disease characterized by red heavily
      scaled plaques. Anthralin (1,8-dihydroxy-9-anthrone) which was introduced over 80 years ago
      has shown excellent efficacy in the management of psoriasis.Although anthralin is remarkably
      effective in the management of psoriasis, its side effects are equally disturbing. Its use is
      messy as it stains the skin, clothing, and any furniture that it may come in contact with.
      Further, anthralin has irritating, burning, brown discoloration and necrotizing effect on the
      normal and the diseased skin. This troublesome profile has discouraged wide-spread use of the
      drug.

      Ethosomes are attractive vesicular carriers mainly composed of phospholipids, ethanol and
      water. The intriguing features of ethosomes are due to their high ethanol content which
      facilitate their penetration through stratum corneum and target deep skin layers. This is
      advantageous over conventional liposomes which have limited penetration through the skin and
      remain confined in the upper layer of the stratum corneum. Compared to liposomes, ethosomes
      had greater retention of methotrexate into the skin for a longer period of time, suggesting
      better therapeutic outcome.

      Psoriasis is a common immune mediated inflammatory skin disease characterized by red heavily
      scaled plaques. Anthralin (1,8-dihydroxy-9-anthrone) which was introduced over 80 years ago
      has shown excellent efficacy in the management of psoriasis.Anthralin mechanism of action
      involves inhibition of the proliferation of keratinocytes. Further, accumulation of anthralin
      inside the mitochondria impairs energy supply to the cell, probably due to the free radicals
      resulting from oxidation of the drug. Anthralin also interferes with the replication of DNA
      and slows down the extreme cell division that occurs in psoriatic plaques. Although anthralin
      is remarkably effective in the management of psoriasis, its side effects are equally
      disturbing. Its use is messy as it stains the skin, clothing, and any furniture that it may
      come in contact with. Further, anthralin has irritating, burning, brown discoloration and
      necrotizing effect on the normal and the diseased skin. This troublesome profile has
      discouraged wide-spread use of the drug.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PASI combines the assessment of the severity of psoriatic lesions and the area affected into a single score in the range 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease). PASI will be measured before and after treatment to assess the efficacy of therapy.Steps in generating PASI score
Divide body into four areas: head, arms, trunk, and legs .
Generate an average score for the erythema, thickness, and scaling for each of the 4 areas , each graded on a 0-4 scale (0 = clear, 1= slight,2= mild, 3=moderate, 4=severe).
Sum scores of erythema, thickness, and scale for each area.
Generate a percentage for skin covered with psoriasis for each area and convert that to a 0-6 scale (0 = 0%; 1 =,10%; 2 = 10-,30%; 3 = 30-,50%; 4 = 50-
,70%; 5 = 70-,90%; 6 = 90-100%).
Multiply score of item (c) above times item (d) above for each area and multiply that by 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 for head, arms, trunk, and legs, respectively.
Add these scores to get the PASI score.</description>
