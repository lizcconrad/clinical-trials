  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of oral psilocybin in migraine
      headache. Subjects will each receive a dose of placebo and a dose of psilocybin approximately
      14 days apart. Subjects will be randomized to the order of treatment and they will be
      randomized to receive either low or high dose psilocybin. Subjects will maintain a headache
      diary prior to, during, and after the treatments in order to document headache frequency and
      intensity, as well as associated symptoms, in both the short and long-term.
