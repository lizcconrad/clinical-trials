  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Determine whether premedication with midazolam influences the effect of povidone-iodine
      ophthalmic prep solution on respiration in children undergoing strabismus surgery with
      general anesthesia.

      Hypothesis: Premedication with midazolam causes apnea after instillation of povidone-iodine
      solution into the eye

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is randomized, double blind, and placebo controlled. Group A (65 subjects) will
      receive midazolam (0.5 mg/kg, maximum dose: 15 mg) in a flavored oral syrup 20 to 30 minutes
      prior to induction of anesthesia. Group B (65 subjects) will receive a flavored oral syrup
      (placebo) 20 to 30 minutes prior to induction of anesthesia. Anesthesia for both groups of
      patients will follow clinical care. After an adequate depth of anesthesia is obtained,
      ophthalmic iodine-povidone prep solution will be instilled in the eyes. This prep sequence is
      standard of care for this surgery. After instillation of the prep solution, the effect on
      respiration will be noted. Apnea is defined as cessation of spontaneous ventilation for 10
      seconds or more. Physiologic parameters to be recorded are heart rate, blood pressure,
      arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2), end-tidal CO2, respiratory rate, tidal volume, inspired
      sevoflurane concentration, expired sevoflurane concentration, and duration of apnea, if it
      develops.

    <description>The iPhone stopwatch application will be used and its 'lap button' feature to collect the respiration peak intervals (in seconds) for 5 breaths. Specifically, at the patient's peak inspiration (as seen on the capnography), the study member will start the stopwatch and proceed to hit the 'lap' button for the next 5 consecutive inspiration peaks. These data intervals will be recorded on the data sheet after the 5 breaths are over, as the intervals are conveniently stored and numbered below the stopwatch in the app</description>

    <description>Group A will receive three drops of povidone-iodine ophthalmic solution in each eye, with the right eye to receive the drops first. The eye drops will be administered by the study anesthesiologist. After application of either solution to the eyes of the patient, any change in ventilation can be detected and timed by observation of the capnography (end-tidal carbon dioxide) and direct observation of the chest wall with use of the iPhone stopwatch feature again. The capnograph is a standard monitor of respiration used during the administration of general anesthesia. Data collected at this time will include whether or not there was a change in respiration, what this change in respiration was, if assisted ventilation was required, how long assisted ventilation was required (if applicable), HR, BP, RR, SaO2 , ETCO2, InspSevo, and ExpSevo. This study intervention and data collection will take less than 5 minutes.</description>
