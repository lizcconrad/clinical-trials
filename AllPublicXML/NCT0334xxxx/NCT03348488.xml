  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Haemodynamic instability during haemodialysis has long been linked to poor
      cardiovascular outcomes. It does not always reflect overall hydration but rather plasma
      volume depletion, with a delay in plasma refill from other body compartments, and
      vasodilatation, mediated by endothelial factors. Our understanding of these processes remains
      largely incomplete. Despite our ability to monitor relative blood volume during haemodialysis
      our knowledge concerning the factors affecting plasma refill remain incomplete. This may be
      due to variations observed between individuals. Understanding the pattern of fluid shifts
      variation between the different body compartment and the factors affecting these behaviours
      in different individuals or at different hydration states could be a vital component of our
      management of intradialytic haemodynamic instability but also overhydration.

      Aims and Objectives: The aim of this study is to describe plasma refill rate, during
      haemodialysis using a non-invasive, continuous, real-time data capture during
      ultrafiltration. The study will attempt to describe different refilling phenotypes in the
      study population and seek association with biochemical and haematological parameters linked
      to variability in refilling rates.

      Methodology: This study will attempt to describe variations in the plasma refill rate of
      prevalent dialysis patients during their normal haemodialysis treatment and during a session
      of 3 hours of haemodialysis preceded by 1 hour of isolated ultrafiltration using the in-built
      blood volume monitoring module of their haemodialysis machine and the TMON software that
      collects continuous, real-time data by interfacing with the computer network. To achieve
      this, a bolus of 100-300ml of intravenous dialysis replacement fluid will be administered at
      the beginning of each of the 2 studied sessions.
