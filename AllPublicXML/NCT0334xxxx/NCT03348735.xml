      Evaluation of topical treatment with lidocaine 5% patch (daily administration) or capsaicin
      8% patch (periodic administration - upon reoccurrence of pain symptoms) in adult patients
      suffering from localized neuropathic pain (LNP) across a wide variety of etiologies, with a
      duration between 1 and 12 months (subacute to chronic neuropathic pain (NP)).

      A multicentre, randomized, open-label comparative trial evaluating topical treatment options
      versus oral systemic treatment in adult patients suffering from localized neuropathic pain
      (LNP) syndromes. A wide variety of peripheral neuropathic pain syndromes will be included
      such as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), post-surgical NP/post-traumatic NP/scar pain,
      post-amputation NP, post-radiation therapy NP, complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) type 1.
      In contrast to most (or even all) commercial clinical studies we will not limit the inclusion
      to one or two distinct neuropathic pain syndromes such as post-herpetic neuralgia (inclusion
      based on etiology of the neuropathic syndrome). In this pragmatic trial we will however
      include all patients suffering from a clinical neuropathic syndrome with distinct clinical
      features such as hyperalgesia/allodynia, presence of spontaneous positive sensory phenomena
      and lasting for more than 3 months without making any exclusion based on etiology. Initial
      pain intensity indicates the presence of either moderate or severe pain in these adult
      patients (NRS 4/10).

    <description>Oral treatment with pregabalin (75mg capsules) will be used at optimized doses to best match clinical practice in Europe. In European clinical practice, up-titration of the dose is often carried out over a longer time-period. This study thus includes up-titration schedule for pregabalin over a period of 4 weeks. If patients develop side-effects during the intake/uptitration of pregabalin this treatment can be stopped and switched to gabapentin (300mg capsules). Gabapentin will always be the back-up treatment for failed systematic treatment with pregabalin. Dose of gabapentin will be uptitrated to maximum 1200mg per day.</description>
