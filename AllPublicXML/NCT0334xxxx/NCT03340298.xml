    <textblock>
      This parallel feeding trial was carried out in Isfahan, Iran between January 2016 till July
      2016. Overweight and obese participants referred to nutrition clinic , were recuruited
      through explanation of the study and completion of the written consent form for admitted
      ones. The sample size was calculated based on the formula by considering α (type 1
      error)=0.05 and β(type 2 error)= 0.20 , d=25 and SD= 2.6 according to the published article,
      was obtained 17 . Therefore , according to the formula 17 subjects were needed in each group
      ,considering the probable dropouts, we assigned 25 subjects for each feeding group to meet
      the adequate power. Before beginning of the trial all baseline levels of FBS, Plasma Insulin,
      TG, Total Cholestrol, LDL-C, HDL-c and hs-CRP was measured and anthropometric assessment like
      height, weight , weistcircumistance and also systolic and diastolic Blood pressure was
      performed as well.All three groups used high fiber food items consist of 35 grams fiber per
      day.Whole grain intervention group provided 25 gram from whole grain products and 10 gram
      from fruits and vegetables .In contrary , Fruits and Vegetables group provided 25 gram fiber
      from fruits and vegetables as main supplier and the remaining 10 grams from whole grain
      sources.In the third group equal proportion from both sources was provided (15 gram from
      whole grain and 15 gram from fruits and vegetables). Required energy intake was calculated
      based on Harris-Benedict formula and decreased energy intake for 0.5 kilogram weight -loss in
      each week was considered for subjects. A dietitian calculated energy requirement for all
      participants separately,then based on macronutrient component of 55% of energy intake from
      carbohyderate, 15% from protein and 30% from fats, the servings number for each food groups
      was obtained and was given to individuals. clinic. In two other intervention groups the same
      procedure was conducted as well.To implement a diverse diet for each 3 groups in addition to
      exchange list, a list of containing food groups and subgroups was provided. Every two weeks
      all subjects were assessed for food intakes and anthropometric measurements.Participants were
      requested to do physical activity and food intakes record between visit intervals.Assessment
      of anthropometric and biochemical indices was performed both before and at the end of trial

    <measure>change of waist circumference</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The narrowest part of Waist was considered for measuring waist circumference where is between the last rib and the iliac crest to the nearest 0.1 cm over light clothing .</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>change of BMI</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>BMI was calculated as body weight (Kg)/ height 2 (m).We used a standard mercury sphygmomanometer to measure participants</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>change of blood pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Blood pressure after resting for 15 minutes. The measurement was performed three times in the sitting position with 1 minute intervals and the average of three measurements was considered as final blood pressure.Systolic blood pressure was defined as the appearance of the first sound and diastolic blood pressure was defined as the disappearance of the sound.(Korotkoff phase 5).All Subjects were asked to avoid coffee, tea and all caffeine containing materials before blood pressure.</description>

    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Fasting blood glucose was measured by enzymatic colorimetric method using glucose oxidase on the day of blood collection.Blood Specimens were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes in order to separate plasma and samples were stored at -70 C until analysis</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>change of lipid profiles</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Total cholesterol level and serum TG analysis was done using a Selectra 2 auto-analyzer (Vital scientific, Spankeren ,The Netherlands.) by an enzymetic colorimetric method with cholesterol esterase and cholesterol oxidase and glycerol phosphate oxidase.(Parsazmoun,Tehran ,Iran). HDL-C determination was done after precipitation of apolipoprotein B containing lipoporotein withphosphotungstic acid. LDL-C was calculated by Friedewald ´s formula when the TAG level was lower than 400 mg/dl ; otherwise , LDL-C was determined by an enzymatic method</description>
