    <textblock>
      Muscle strength is the amount of force generated by muscle contraction. It could be measured
      in isometric, isotonic or isokinetic activity, either manually or using a dynamometer.

      The isometric dynamometer is a validated and cheap tool that could be used to measure Maximal
      Voluntary Isometric Contraction (MVIC) and Maximal Electrical Induced Contraction (MEIC). It
      is claimed that higher MEIC values will result in more force gained.

      If a current is more tolerated it will be easier to achieve better MEIC values. Tolerance to
      an electrical stimulation could be measured with the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). A ratio
      between Normalized MEIC / VAS is often used, implying that the current is better with a
      higher ratio.

      Muscle fatigue is defined as a temporary loss or decrease in force-generating ability due to
      previous contractions. It is claimed that medium frequency neuromuscular electrical
      stimulation (NMES) generates more fatigue than low frequency currents.

      Aussie current is a newer medium-frequency alternating current which consists in a sinusoidal
      waveform, 1 KHz carrier frequency.

      Neo-Russian current is also a medium-frequency current with a rectangular biphasic
      symmetrical waveform, 2,5 KHz carrier frequency.

      Rectangular Biphasic symmetrical (RBS) waveform is a type of Low Pulsed Current (LPC),
      claimed to be better than classical Russian Current.

      Purpose:

      As it has been claimed that LPC is better in MEIC and tolerance, the aim of this study is to
      compare it with two newer medium frequency currents in terms of MEIC, tolerance and fatigue.

      Methods:

      Thirty male subjects, right leg dominant, will receive randomly the 3 types of electrical
      stimulation. Before that, the MVIC will be measured for data normalization.

      The MVIC and MEIC will be measured with an isometric dynamometer. In both measurements,
      subjects will be asked to perform three reps (5 sec work x 120 sec rest) and the best one
      will be used.

      To apply Aussie electrical stimulation, an Aussie Sport (Ibramed) will be used. To apply
      Neo-Russian, a Neurodyn III (Ibramed) will be used. To apply RBS, a Genesy (Globus) will be
      used.

      The VAS will be used to assess tolerance to each treatment. A ratio between MEIC and VAS will
      be calculated.

      One week later, the subjects will receive, randomly, a fatigue protocol that consists in 21
      reps of electrical stimulation with the three types of current. The data will be normalized
      with the MVIC and the reps equal or below 50 % of the first rep will be considered as a
      fatigue rep.
