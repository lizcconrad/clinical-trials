        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient 18 years and older and premenopausal (based on gynecological history i.e.
             still menstruating; no significant estrogen deficiency symptoms)

          -  Diagnosis of uterine fibroids documented by ultrasound and relevant symptoms reported
             by the patient (e.g. heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pressure)

          -  Patients for whom hysterectomy for the treatment of symptomatic uterine fibroids is
             planned

          -  Patients who are otherwise healthy as shown by medical history, physical and
             gynecological examinations, and laboratory test results

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Contraindications for the progesterone receptor modulators (PRM) vilaprisan or
             ulipristal acetate

          -  Use of medication that might interfere with the conduct of the study or the
             interpretation of the results (e.g. continuing use of hormonal contraceptives,
             tranexamic acid or other treatments for heavy menstrual bleeding, progesterone
             receptor modulators, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist, anticoagulants, moderate
             and strong CYP3A4 inducers and moderate and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors within a defined
             time period before treatment starts.
