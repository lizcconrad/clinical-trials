  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study provides participants with two diets that vary in their glycaemic index values
      (low vs. high), whilst also measuring cognitive performance and mood.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Therefore, the current study introduces cognitive testing into study procedures. Participants
      will consume the favourable and unfavourable conditions (each containing three meals) on
      separate days following a crossover, randomised, couterbalanced design. The primary dependent
      variable is cognitive function, whilst secondary measures include glucose and mood. It is
      hypothesised that the favourable meal profile will be associated with cognitive and
      physiological benefits relative to the unfavourable meal profile.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in cognitive performance between time points assessed</measure>
    <time_frame>This was tested 9 times a day, with two days, giving a total of 18 times. Each battery of four tasks lasted approximately 15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>A participants performance over four cognitive tasks</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Glycaemic profile</measure>
    <time_frame>This was measured 23 times a day, for two days, giving a total of 46 times</time_frame>
    <description>Glucose concentration levels</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mood (alertness, anxiety and contentment) using the Bond-Lader (1974) Visual Analogue Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>This takes approximately 5 minutes to complete. Participants were tested six times a day. There were two test days. Giving a total of 12 times, or approximately 60 minutes of mood scale completion.</time_frame>
    <description>This was comprised of three mood sub-factors; alertness, anxiety, contentment. The VAS provides participants with 16 lines (100mm in length). At each end of every line are two words opposite in meaning, for example 'alert' and 'drowsy'. A participant marks each line closer to the word they feel at that current time. The minimum score is 0 and the maximum is 100, measured in millimetres.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleepiness</measure>
    <time_frame>This takes approximately 30 seconds to complete. Participants were tested six times a day. There were two test days. Giving a total of 12 times, or approximately 6 minutes overall.</time_frame>
    <description>This was measured on a custom Visual Analogue Scale. Participants were presented with a 100mm line. At one end the word 'sleepy' appeared, and at the other end 'not sleepy' was present. Participants indicated how sleepy they felt by marking the line closer to the word they currently felt. Scores fell between 0 and 100.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hunger</measure>
    <time_frame>This takes approximately 30 seconds to complete. Participants were tested six times a day. There were two test days. Giving a total of 12 times, or approximately 6 minutes overall.</time_frame>
    <description>This was measured on a custom Visual Analogue Scale. Participants were presented with a 100mm line. At one end the word 'hungry' appeared, and at the other end 'not hungry' was present. Participants indicated how hungry they felt by marking the line closer to the word they currently felt. Scores fell between 0 and 100.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fullness</measure>
    <time_frame>This takes approximately 30 seconds to complete. Participants were tested six times a day. There were two test days. Giving a total of 12 times, or approximately 6 minutes overall.</time_frame>
    <description>This was measured on a custom Visual Analogue Scale. Participants were presented with a 100mm line. At one end the word 'full' appeared, and at the other end 'not full' was present. Participants indicated how full they felt by marking the line closer to the word they currently felt. Scores fell between 0 and 100.</description>
