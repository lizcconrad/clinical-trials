  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This unique NMR instrument is the first of its kind, and the most advanced system that is
      capable of brain, torso and extremity imaging in humans at such a high magnetic field. It
      will be transformative in performance relative to 7Tesla, and significantly expand the
      capabilities of multinuclear MRI, fMRI, morphological imaging, MRS etc. in the human brain
      and body.

      In addition, to the known and potential benefits of performing anatomic and functional
      imaging studies at 10.5T, there are also known short-term side effects associated with
      subjecting humans to such high magnetic fields. This protocol will study the magnitude and
      variability of the short term and long term physiological, cognitive and vestibular effects
      while also assessing the feasibility of acquiring the types of data needed for translating
      research protocols onto this higher field strength scanner.
