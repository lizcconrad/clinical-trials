    <textblock>
      This 5-year study evaluates the effects of a 10-week group-based linguistically translated
      and culturally adapted cognitive-behavioral stress and self-management (C-CBSM) intervention
      on symptom burden and health related quality of life (HRQoL) in Hispanic men treated for
      localized prostate cancer (PC). About 80% PC cases are diagnosed as early disease and have a
      5- and 10-year survival rate of almost 100% and 99%, respectively. Most patients receive
      active treatment (~70%) leading to prolonged treatment-related side effects and dysfunction
      persisting well beyond primary treatment. Survival is offset by chronic side effects such as
      sexual and urinary dysfunction, pain and fatigue that can lead to poor psychosocial
      functioning, impaired intimacy and social functioning, and masculinity concerns. Hispanic PC
      survivors report lower physical and social functioning, poorer emotional well-being and
      greater sexual and urinary dysfunction, even after accounting for SES and disease severity.
      This sequela can lead to elevated glucocorticoid release and inflammatory cytokines that have
      a direct effect on these symptoms and can interfere with physiological pathways necessary for
      recovery of sexual and urinary functioning. The investigators have shown that CBSM reduces
      symptom burden and improves HRQoL in bilingual Hispanic PC survivors. In a pilot study
      conducted by the investigators, it was shown that a linguistic translation of CBSM with
      attention to sociocultural processes improved symptom burden and HRQoL in Spanish monolingual
      PC survivors. The investigators have also shown that CBSM is associated with reduced
      glucocorticoid resistance and inflammatory gene expression pathways in breast cancer
      survivors. The investigators propose to (a) deliver a culturally adapted C-CBSM intervention
      in Spanish that places greater emphasis on salient sociocultural determinants of symptom
      burden and HRQoL in Hispanics (e.g., fatalistic attitudes, family interdependence, perceived
      discrimination, machismo), (b) incorporate a neuroimmune model of symptom regulation and
      management, and (c) test the efficacy of C-CBSM, relative to standard non-culturally adapted
      CBSM, in two diverse Hispanic communities (Chicago &amp; Miami). The investigators will test the
      aims in 260 Hispanic men post-treatment for localized PC with elevated symptom burden in a 2
      x 4 randomized design with condition (C-CSBM vs. CBSM) as the between groups factors, and
      time (baseline, 3 months post-intervention &amp; 6- and 12-months post intervention) as the
      within groups factor.

    <textblock>
      Available evidence suggests that culturally adapted psychological interventions and
      treatments are valuable and needed. Integrating sociocultural components into EBTs can help
      achieve desired outcomes in specific populations. In conditions such as asthma, diabetes, and
      HIV/AIDS culturally adapted EBTs have proven to be effective, and in depression, culturally
      adapted CBT programs show superior effects relative to standard treatment. However, there are
      very few culturally adapted EBTs for cancer survivors. In Hispanic BC survivors,
      linguistically translated and community-engaged stress management and peer-support
      interventions have shown feasibility and some preliminary efficacy. In Hispanic BC survivors,
      physical activity interventions delivered in a culturally sensitive manner reduce distress,
      while adapted psychoeducational interventions decrease depressive symptoms. Although
      promising, available studies have multiple conceptual and methodological limitations, and the
      vast majority only have involved a linguistic translation. A linguistic translation is
      limited in that language does not fully address cultural patterns, behaviors, frames of
      reference/world view, belief systems and other factors, does not imply cultural competence
      and therefore limits the potential of therapeutic gains. In fact, in cultural competent care,
      by definition, a cultural adaptation involves &quot;adaptation of interventions to meet culturally
      unique needs&quot;. Consequently, there are significant gaps in understanding the efficacy of
      culturally adapted treatments: (a) cultural adaptation has generally involved a linguistic
      translation, or racial/ethnic pairing of interventionist, with no or very limited attention
      to cultural and social norms; (b) rarely have studies addressed how culture impacts provision
      and acquisition of EBT skills; (c) the vast majority of culturally adapted treatments have
      been paired against usual care, wait-list or other inert conditions thus limiting our
      knowledge on whether the cultural adaptation or the standard EBT mechanisms impacted observed
      outcomes; and (d) the utility and incremental efficacy of adapted interventions, relative to
      standard EBTs, remains unknown.

      Among cancer survivors, psychosocial processes (e.g., stress, anxiety, isolation) coupled
      with ongoing monitoring and symptom burden can promote dysregulation of neuroendocrine (e.g.,
      cortisol) and immune (e.g., pro-inflammatory response) mechanisms, psychological and physical
      symptoms (e.g., pain, fatigue) and disease activity. For example, low social support,
      repressive coping and anxiety are associated with disruptions in diurnal cortisol output and
      reduced glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity. , Cancer-related stress is also associated with
      cortisol dysregulation, and stress-modulated alterations in cortisol are related to
      disruption in immune function and cancer progression. BC patients with altered cortisol
      patterns show greater inflammatory cytokine responses. Stress-related disruptions in
      glucocorticoid sensitivity promote a shift from a Th1, to a Th2 pro-inflammatory response
      that can promote or exacerbate symptom burden and negatively impact HRQoL. Although limited
      to BC survivors, stress management interventions that improve psychosocial adjustment impact
      physiological mechanisms (e.g., cortisol, inflammatory markers) with salutary effects on
      physical symptoms (e.g., fatigue, pain), HRQoL and disease activity. Very limited work has
      assessed these patterns in PC survivors.
