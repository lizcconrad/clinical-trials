  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study provided 24 healthy subjects with two diets that varied in their glycaemic index
      values. One condition was a low GI diet, whilst the other was a high GI diet. Glucose
      concentrations and mood were measured throughout each test day.

      Therefore, the aim of this study is to feed to participants meals which differing in their
      glycaemic index across the course of a day, and thus produce different glycaemic responses.
      The outcome variables will be blood glucose levels and subjective mood. The purpose of this
      study is to identify the appropriate times (according to glycaemic response) at which
      cognitive functioning should be tested. Importantly, this study is also the first step to
      characterizing glycaemic and cognitive profiles associated with food consumption over a whole
      day (breakfast, lunch, snack) rather than just one meal (e.g. breakfast), ranging from the
      most favourable (stable glucose regulation) to the least favourable (variability; many peaks
      and troughs).

    <time_frame>Assessed at 0 (baseline), 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120 mins after each meal. With 3 meals in a day this totaled 21 assessment point for each day, giving 42 assessment points to compare overall. Data will be reported for the duration of this 3 year PhD award.</time_frame>

    <measure>Mood (alertness, anxiety and contentment) measured by Bond &amp; Lader (1974) Visual Analogue Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>This was measured 6 times a day (every 90 minutes starting at 0 minutes/baseline), giving a total of 12 times. Each time last approximately 5 minutes, giving a total of 60 minutes overall. Data will be reported for the duration of this 3 year PhD award.</time_frame>
    <description>The Bond &amp; Lader VAS provides participants with 16 lines measuring 100mm each. At the ends of each line are two words opposite in meaning. For example, 'alert' and 'drowsy'. A participants marks on the line closer to the word they currently feel. The score from each line is out of 0 to 100.</description>
