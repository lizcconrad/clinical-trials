      This research trial studies how well Oncology Research Information Exchange Network (ORIEN)
      works in improving genetic screening rate in patients with cancer. Implementation of Progeny
      Genetic Pedigree and Family History Questionnaire software across all ORIEN member
      institutions may add value and utility for recognizing and caring for patients with an
      inherited susceptibility to cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Measure the change in uptake of cancer genetic referrals and genetic testing in the ORIEN
      system of cancer centers implementing the Progeny Family History Questionnaire (FHQ).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Follow and estimate utilization of preventive health behaviors among Progeny FHQ users
      across all institutions.

      II. Compare utilization of preventive health behavior between Progeny FHQ risk identification
      and genetic testing.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients take Progeny Genetic Pedigree and Family History Questionnaire. Results are reviewed
      by the site specific research coordinator and/or genetic counselor to assess whether a
      patient fulfills criteria for referral to the site specific cancer genetics clinic for
      further evaluation.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 6 months after disclosure of genetic
      testing results.
