      An Open Label Extension (OLE) study to assess the safety of long-term treatment with a 4 mL
      intra-articular injection of Ampion ™ in adults with pain due to severe osteoarthritis of the
      knee

      Patients enrolled in AP-003-C Main Study will be offered the option to roll-over to the open
      label extension study at the final visit of the Main Study (Week 12).

      Approximately 171 subjects with knee pain due to severe osteoarthritis of the knee (KL IV)
      may enroll in the 40-week OLE study. The OLE Study allows for a 60-day screening window from
      Week 12 of the Main Study for enrollment in the Extension study. Extension study visits will
      include 9 visits: Week 12 in-office visit (Day 84± 60 days), a 24-hour post-injection
      follow-up call, Week 24 in-office visit (Day 168 ± 7 days), a 24-hour, post-injection
      follow-up call, Week 36 in-office visit (Day 252 ± 7 days), a 24-hour, post-injection
      follow-up call, Week 48 in-office visit (Day 336 ± 7 days ), a 24-hour, post-injection
      follow-up call, and a Week 52 final visit (Day 364 ± 7 days ).

          6. Study knee must have a clinical diagnosis of OA and supported by radiological evidence
             (Kellgren Lawrence Grade IV) as assessed in the AP-003-C Main Study.

          7. Moderate to moderately-severe OA pain in the study knee (rating of at least 1.5 on the
             WOMAC Index 3.1 5-point Likert Pain Subscale), as assessed in the AP-003-C Main Study

          8. Moderate to moderately-severe OA function in the study knee (rating of at least 1.5 on
             the WOMAC Index 3.1 5-point Likert Function Subscale), as assessed in the AP-003-C
             Main Study

          9. WOMAC A, 5-point Likert pain subscale &lt;1.5 in the contralateral knee, as assessed in
             the AP-003-C Main Study

         10. Ability to discontinue NSAID ± 72 hours before/after injections (in-office visits).
             Low-dose Aspirin (81 mg) is allowed during the study but must not be taken at least 24
             hours prior to in-office visits.

             efficacy measure

         12. Any pharmacological or non-pharmacological treatment targeting OA started or changed 4
             weeks prior to entry into the OLE study, or likely to be changed during the duration
