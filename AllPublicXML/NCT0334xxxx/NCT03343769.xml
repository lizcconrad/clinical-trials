  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The quality of life of elderly citizens is to a great extent related to the maintenance of
      independence. The risk of falling and the loss of autonomy are two frequent problems
      associated with ageing. Although the impact of falls on functional outcomes and
      morbi-mortality in the elderly is well-established, the pathophysiological mechanisms
      underlying these falls are poorly understood. To better assess the risk of falling, numerous
      studies have investigated the use of dynamic and static posturography. These studies sought
      to characterise populations of fallers and non-fallers using parameters from postural
      analysis. Nonetheless, a new concept may emerge: weakening of the ankle movement muscles may
      be implicated in the age-related deterioration of posture. Even though it has been shown that
      this decrease occurs earlier and is more severe in fallers, the direct relationship between
      the strength of ankle movement muscles and balance parameters in elderly fallers has not yet
      been established. The existence of such a relationship would make it possible on the one hand
      to facilitate screening for those with a risk of falling, and on the other hand to enrich our
      understanding of the pathophysiology of the risk of falling. The perspective would therefore
      be to propose programmes focused on the strengthening of these deficient muscles.
