  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ATRIL is a multi-centric, double-blind randomized, two-arm controlled study. 42
      SpinoCerebellar Ataxia type 2 (SCA2) patients, both gender, at least 18 years of age will be
      included.

      Riluzole 50 mg will be administered (per os) twice a day, versus one group with placebo for
      12 months.

      Riluzole (Rilutek®) is a benzothiazole drug, market approved, for Amyotrophic Lateral
      Sclerosis (ALS). It delays the onset of ventilator-dependence or tracheostomy in selected
      patients and may increase survival.

      Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) will be used at M0, M6 and M12. To
      assess primary criterion, the percentage of patients with a decrease of at least 1 point of
      the SARA score between the inclusion visit, and Visit 3 (Months 12) will be calculated.

    <textblock>
      Inherited cerebellar ataxias are genetically heterogeneous neurological disorders. They are
      characterized by ataxic gait and cerebellar dysarthria that progresses over time with loss of
      ambulation and speech. The mutations by expansions of CAG triplets in the genes ATXN1 (SCA1),
      ATXN 2 (SCA2), 3 (SCA3), CACNA1A (SCA6), ATXN 7 (SCA7), and TBP (SCA17) are responsible for
      50% of hereditary forms There is no curative or preventive treatment. This phase III study is
      a multi-centric, double-blind randomized, two-arm controlled study (one group with 50 mg
      Riluzole twice a day versus one group with placebo), to measure the efficacy of treatment
      with riluzole in SCA2 patients during 12 months. Amelioration is defined by a 1 point
      decrease of the SARA score.
