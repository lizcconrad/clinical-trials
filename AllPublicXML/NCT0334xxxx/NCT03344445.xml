  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We made up a video which showed the type, the method, the risk, and the benefit of all
      anesthesia with words, pictures, and image. A study nurse will ask the will of patients. The
      patients enrolled in the study will be randomly divided into traditional group(control group)
      and study group(study group). The study group will watch the video at first, then our
      anesthesiologist visit the patient. The control group will receive traditional
      anesthesiologist visit. After doctors' visit, the patients have to complete a test and a
      questionnaire. The patients who don't participate in the study will have traditional visit
      and no test.
