  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Soccer is an intermittent sport including a high number of powerful actions such as
      accelerations, decelerations, changes of direction, jumps and impacts that incorporate a
      strong eccentric component and may therefore lead to skeletal muscle damage. Indeed, match
      activity is associated with the onset of muscle damage and an acute inflammatory response
      that result in attenuated performance for as long as 1 to 3 days. In competitive soccer
      though, multiple matches are performed within a small-time frame resulting in inadequate
      muscle recovery and reduced field performance. Supplementation with milk proteins following
      intense exercise protocols has been shown to stimulate protein synthesis and facilitate
      muscle recovery. Thus, the aim of the present investigation is to examine the effects of milk
      protein supplementation on muscle recovery and soccer-specific performance during an
      in-season microcycle with two matches performed three days apart.

      In a double-blind, cross over, repeated measures design 20 men soccer players will receive
      either placebo (PLA) or milk protein isolate (PRO, 80% casein-20% whey) throughout recovery
      following two matches performed three days apart. On match days, players will receive a dose
      immediately after the match (PLA vs PRO: 25g of protein) and then at 3h (PLA vs PRO: 30g of
      protein) and 6h (PLA vs PRO: 25g of protein) post-match. On each day of the remaining days,
      players will consume a single dose of PLA or PRO (20g of protein) with breakfast. All players
      will participate in regular in-season training following matches. Field activity during both
      matches and daily practices will be monitored using GPS devices. Heart rate will be
      continuously recorded during each match and training session. Blood samples will be collected
      at baseline as well as 2 hours after the first match, daily for three days after the first
      match, 2 hours after the second match and daily for 3 days after the second match.
      Performance (isokinetic strength, 20-m speed, repeated sprint ability) and muscle soreness
      will be assessed at baseline daily for 3 days after both matches. Muscle biopsies from vastus
      lateralis will be collected at baseline and one day after each match.
