  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this retrospective, monocenter, observational study is to evaluate the changes in
      GMFCS levels of children with cerebral palsy (CP) who received repeated Botulinum Toxin-A
      (BoNT-A) injections in the lower limb(s) with an integrated treatment approach in Kocaeli
      University Department of PMR and Izmit Rehabilitation Center.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is generally agreed that children with CP reach their gross motor potential by the age of
      3.5-5 and a child or young person over the age of 5 years will not improve their GMFCS level.
      BoNT-A is an important treatment in children with CP because it is safe in young children and
      allows combined treatment. The reduction in muscle tone by this selective treatment provides
      an opportunity to allow and optimize the effects of other treatments including orthoses,
      casting, conventional therapies and activity based functional trainings. For this reason,
      BoNT-A injections are always combined with other therapies in Kocaeli University Department
      of PMR and Izmit Rehabilitation Center. Adjunctive treatments in this department consists of
      serial casting, orthotics, physical therapy, occupational therapy, cognitive rehabilitation,
      special educational programs, non invasive brain stimulation with transcranial direct
      current, neurofeedback, biofeedback, electrical stimulation and other physical therapy
      modalities, activity based models including functional ambulatory training, constraint
      induced therapy, bilateral therapy, hippotherapy, music therapy by singing or playing
      percussive instruments or moving and dancing to music, and robotic rehabilitation.
      Individualized intensive combined treatment plan was applied by an appropriate neurorehab
      team to each patient within the department as a half day or full day program usually for 3
      weeks starting 1 week or 10 days after BONT-A injections. In thÄ±s retrospective, monocenter,
      observational study a software database program will be developed and all the present data
      about the demographic and clinic properties of the patients, all information about BoNT-A
      injections including safety and applied adjunctive treatments will be entered and reviewed.
