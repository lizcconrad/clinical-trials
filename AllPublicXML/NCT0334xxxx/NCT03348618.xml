  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the use of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) at a dose of
      1g/Kg/body weight given every three weeks for 6 infusions in pediatric subjects ages 4 - 16
      years with moderate to severe PANS. The study will compare biomarkers and behavioral scales
      before treatment, after the last infusion, and 2 months after treatment.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      IVIG at an immunomodulatory dose of 1 g/Kg body weight has been known to induce suppression
      of systemic inflammation and has been used in the treatment of autoimmune diseases. It has
      been proven beneficial in inflammatory conditions affecting the nervous system.

    <measure>Change in Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-IV, Child, Parent Versions (ADIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measurements at baseline and one week after last treatment (19 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>ADIS Child and Parent Interviews are designed to diagnose children with emotional disorder, where anxiety is a prominent component. Problem behaviors and diagnoses include school refusal behavior, separation anxiety, social phobia, specific phobia, panic disorder, agoraphobia, OCD and PTSD. Assessment of ADHD allows for differentiation of inattentive type, hyperactive-type, and combined type.</description>

    <time_frame>Measurements at baseline and one week after last treatment (19 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The scale is a clinician-rated, 10-item scale, each item rated from 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (extreme symptoms) (total range, 0 to 40), with separate subtotals for severity of obsessions and compulsions.</description>

    <time_frame>Measurements at baseline and one week after last treatment (19 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The CY-BOCS rating scale is designed to rate the severity and type of symptoms in patients with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Ratings of the characteristics of obsessive or compulsive ideation and actions on a scale of 0 - 4, with 0 as none and 4 as extreme.</description>
