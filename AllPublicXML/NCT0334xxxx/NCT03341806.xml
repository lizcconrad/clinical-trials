  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to characterize the safety and tolerability of avelumab in
      combination with Laser Interstitial Thermal Therapy (LITT) for blood barrier disruption in
      patients with recurrent glioblastoma.

      This is an open label, non-randomized Phase I study of intravenous avelumab every 2 weeks to
      be administered after real-time MRI-guided LITT therapy for patients with a first recurrence
      of a glioblastoma.

      The primary objective of the study is to characterize the tolerability and safety profile of
      avelumab in combination with MRI guided LITT administered to patients diagnosed with
      recurrent GBM.

      Part A, the initial cohort of patients will be treated with intravenous avelumab alone. Part
      B, patients will receive avelumab in combination with MRI-guided LITT to characterize the
      tolerability and safety of the combined treatment.
