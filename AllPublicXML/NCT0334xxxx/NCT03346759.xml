  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The vaginal microbiota is the community of bacteria in the vagina. The composition of the
      vaginal microbiota (which bacteria are present and how many of each are present) is known to
      affect vaginal health and contribute to the development of bacterial vaginosis (the largest
      cause of vaginal discharge and malodor, and the most common vaginal disorder). It is also
      known that the composition of the vaginal microbiota changes across a menstrual cycle with
      the largest changes happening during a woman's period. However, it is not know how tampon use
      affects vaginal microbiota composition. This study is being done to learn what effect tampon
      use has on vaginal microbiota composition during a woman's period and between periods.
