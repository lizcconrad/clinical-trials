  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been reported that insulin basal rate reduction initiated at exercise onset can reduce
      the hypoglycemic risk during exercise. However, another potentially more efficient strategy
      to prevent exercise-induced hypoglycemia could be to reduce insulin basal rate a certain time
      prior to exercise. The objective of this study will be to compare the efficacy of two
      strategies to prevent exercise-induced hypoglycemia during a 60-minute exercise at moderate
      intensity: 1) reduce insulin basal rate 40 minutes prior to exercise; 2) reduce insulin basal
      rate 90 minutes prior to exercise.

    <description>Participants will be admitted at the research center at 14:00. At 14:30, participant's insulin basal rate will be reduced by 80%. At 16:00, participants will perform a 60-minute exercise on a stationary bicycle at 60% of their maximal cardiorespiratory capacity (VO2 max). During the exercise period, muscle oxygenation and muscle oxygen extraction will be measure by near infrared spectroscopy. Glucose levels will be measured every 10 minutes during the exercise period. At 17:30, the participant will be discharged.</description>

          3. The subject will have been on insulin pump therapy for at least 3 months.

          4. Last (less than 2 months) HbA1c ≤ 10%.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinically significant microvascular complications: nephropathy (estimated glomerular
             filtration rate below 40 ml/min), neuropathy or severe proliferative retinopathy as
             judged by the investigator.

          2. Recent (&lt; 3 months) acute macrovascular event e.g. acute coronary syndrome or cardiac
             surgery.

          3. Abnormal blood panel and/or anemia.

          4. Ongoing pregnancy.

          5. Severe hypoglycemic episode within two weeks of screening.

          6. Other serious medical illness likely to interfere with study participation or with the
             ability to complete the exercise periods by the judgment of the investigator (e.g.
             orthopedic limitation).

          7. Failure to comply with team's recommendations (e.g. not willing to change pump
             parameters, etc.).
