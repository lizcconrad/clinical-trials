  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study of the infusion of haploidentical NK cells with IL-2 in 5 HIV+
      individuals who are on stable ART with full HIV suppression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Potential subjects will be screened to determine eligibility. Immediately after consent and
      screening, an HLA-haploidentical donor will be identified and will complete eligibility
      screen and consent. At Day -7 the subject will undergo an inguinal lymph node biopsy and
      colonoscopy to obtain ileal and rectal biopsies. Blood samples will be obtained to measure
      chimerisms, plasma HIV RNA, and inflammatory cytokines. PBMCs will be obtained to sort into
      CD4 subsets and measure frequencies of HIV RNA and DNA. On Day -1, the donor will undergo
      apheresis and donor cells will be obtained and incubated overnight with IL-2. On Day 0
      subjects will start aspirin and be infused with IL-2 activated NK cells. Subjects will
      receive 6 million units of IL-2 just after the infusion and they will be monitored on the
      Phase 1 Unit for 24 hours. Plasma will be obtained at 2 hrs, 4 hrs and the following morning
      and stored for measures of inflammatory markers. The subject will return to the outpatient
      clinic on days 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 after the infusion for administration of 6 million units of
      IL-2 and to obtain plasma and PBMC for measures of inflammatory markers and changes to the
      virus reservoir. On day 14 the subject will stop taking ASA and blood will be obtained to
      measure frequencies of HIV RNA and DNA. On day 21 will have a lymph node biopsy and
      colonoscopy to obtain ileal and rectal tissues. The patient will then be followed until day
      100 post NK cell infusion. Subjects will return every 2 weeks for a toxicity assessment,
      blood draws, and viral level testing. Study participation will end after day 100.

               -  Stable ART for at least 12 months.

               -  Screening plasma HIV RNA levels below level of quantification (&lt;40 to &lt;50 copies
                  RNA/mL depending on the assay) for ≥ 6 months (a total of 3 measurements above
                  the level of detection but &lt; 500 copies/ml will be allowed if each detectable
                  measure is separated by at least 1 year)

               -  Screening CD4 count ≥500 cells/µl

               -  Laboratory tests (CBCD, CMP, Mg, Phosphorus, PT/PTT, TSH/T4,) performed within 14
                  days of study enrollment. All laboratory results (unless otherwise specified)
                  must be Grade 1 or normal based on the DAIDS Adverse Event Grading Scale
                  (Division of AIDS (DAIDS) Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric
