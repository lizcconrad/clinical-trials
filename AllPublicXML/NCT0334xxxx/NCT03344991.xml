      Infants with an estimated gestational age &lt; 36 6/7 weeks at delivery who have been in an
      incubator in the newborn ICU for at least 24 hours will be randomized to either standard
      protocol of open crib or mylar-lined cardboard cot for the duration of the hospital stay.
      Axillary temperatures will be taken 1 hr, 6 hrs, and 24 hours after being placed in the cot
      or crib, and then once every 24 hours. All other care is provided as standard of care.

    <textblock>
      Following parental consent, preterm infants with an estimated gestational age &lt; 36 6/7 weeks
      at delivery who have been in an incubator in the newborn ICU for at least 24 hours will be
      randomized to to transfer either standard protocol of open crib or mylar-lined cardboard cot
      when their temperatures are stable for transfer. The infants will remain in the cot or crib
      for the duration of the hospital stay. Axillary temperatures will be taken 1 hr, 6 hrs, and
      24 hours after being placed in the cot or crib, and then once every 24 hours. All other care
      is provided as standard of care, including WHO warm chain thermoregulation guidelines of
      early and exclusive breastfeeding, appropriate bundling and Kangaroo Mother Care as
      continuously as possible.

      If at any point a babies becomes moderately (32.0-35.9° C) or severely hypothermic (&lt; 32.0°
      C), an extra blanket will be added to their bodies and a hat placed on their heads.
