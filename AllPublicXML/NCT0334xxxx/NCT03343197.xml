    <textblock>
      Study to evaluate the suppression of 2-HG (2-hydroxyglutarate) in IDH-1 mutant gliomas in
      resected tumor tissue following pre-surgical treatment with AG-120 or AG-881.

    <textblock>
      A phase-1, multi-center study in recurrent non-enhancing gliomas with IDH1 R132H mutation for
      patients who require surgery. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the suppression of
      2-HG by comparing the concentration of 2-HG in resected tumors from IDH1 mutant glioma
      subjects following AG-120 or AG-881 treatment with the 2-HG concentration in untreated,
      control tumors. The safety, tolerability, PK/PD, and anti tumor activity data from the study
      in subjects with recurrent non-enhancing Grade 2/3 LGG with an IDH1 R132H mutation for whom
      surgical resection is indicated will identify the recommended dose of AG-120 and AG-881 for
      future studies in glioma.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Be ≥18 years of age.

          2. Have histologically or cytologically confirmed recurrent Grade 2 or 3 LGG
             (oligodendroglioma or astrocytoma according to World Health Organization 2016
             classification).

          3. Have documented IDH1 R132H gene mutation by local testing and known 1p19q or ATRX

          4. Have central confirmation of primarily non-enhancing disease by MRI with less than or
             equal to 5 mm slice thickness and up to 1 mm interslice gap on either 2D T2 weighted
             image, 3D T2 weighted image, or FLAIR, with at least 1 non-enhancing tumor measuring
             1×1×1 cm.

          5. Be candidates for clinical resection but for whom surgery is not urgently indicated
             (eg, for whom surgery within the next 2-4 months is appropriate).

          7. Have expected survival of ≥12 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             AG-120 or AG-881 or have received an investigational agent &lt;14 days prior to their
             first dose of AG-120 or AG-881. In addition, the first dose of AG-120 or AG-881 should
             not occur before a period of ≥5 half-lives of the investigational agent has elapsed.

          2. Have had radiation within 6 months of the first dose of AG-120 or AG-881. (Note: Prior
             biopsy or surgery is allowed.)

          3. Have received any prior treatment with an IDH inhibitor.
