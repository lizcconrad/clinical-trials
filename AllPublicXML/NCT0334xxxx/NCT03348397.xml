  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary homografts are standard substitutes for right ventricular outflow tract
      reconstruction in congenital heart surgery. Unfortunately shortage and conduit failure
      secondary to early calcifications and shrinking are observed particularly for small sized
      conduits in younger patients. In neonates, Contegra® 12mm could be a valuable alternative,
      but conflicting evidence exists. This retrospective study compared the outcome of these two
      conduits in a newborn population.
