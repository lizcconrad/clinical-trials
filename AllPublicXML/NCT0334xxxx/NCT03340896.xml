  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compare the survival without laryngeal dysfunction 2 years after the end of
      treatment, obtained by chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy or chemotherapy with cisplatin
      administrated during radiotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In patients with tumors classified as T3 or T4 larynx and hypopharynx, the usually
      recommended treatment was total laryngectomy.This intervention allows to obtain locoregional
      disease control in 75% of cases, without laryngectomy

      TPF arm followed by radiotherapy was validated in a Phase III (GORTEC 2000-01), it will be
      the standard treatment.

      The RTOG study concluded that chemotherapy administrated during radiotherapy became a
      standard of laryngeal preservation.

      Taking together all these considerations, it is necessary to perform a direct comparison in a
      randomized trial to further test this hypothesis. Chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy will
      be the standard arm. It hopes to increase the survival rate from 52% to 65% in the
      experimental arm.
