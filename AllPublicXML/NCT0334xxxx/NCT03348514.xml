  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human, Phase I, multicenter, open label, dose escalation study to evaluate
      the DLTs and MTD and to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of CPX-POM administered
      IV in patients with any histologically- or cytologically-confirmed solid tumor type.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will initially employ an accelerated escalation design, with a single patient
      enrolled in each cohort (i.e., Single-Patient Cohorts). The initial patient will receive
      CPX-POM at a starting dose of 30 mg/m2. Doses will be escalated (doubling), until a ≥Grade 2
      toxicity (with the exception of alopecia), is encountered. Subsequently that and all
      subsequent cohorts will follow a classical &quot;3 + 3&quot; dose escalation design.

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ciclopirox phosphoryloxymethyl ester (CPX-POM) administered intravenously (IV) and establish the CPX POM dose recommended for further investigation.
A DLT will include some Grade 3 or 4 AEs if deemed related to study drug. In addition, any patient who is unable to receive 80% of the expected dose of CPX-POM (i.e., patients who are unable to receive at least 4 of the 5 scheduled doses) because of AEs will be considered to have a DLT.
In order to identify any DLTs, safety assessments including AEs, physical examinations, vital signs, and clinical laboratory tests will be conducted during each study visit through Day 22.
The MTD is defined as the dose BELOW that dose which causes DLTs in ≥33% of patients.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria Include:

          1. Patient has histologically- or cytologically- confirmed metastatic or advanced-stage
             solid malignant tumor that is refractory to standard therapy. Patients should only be
             included if no therapy exists or if they have already received all standard therapies
             that would be potentially curative or might provide significant benefit.

          2. Patient may have received up to 4 prior lines of cytotoxic chemotherapy or
             immunotherapy for their metastatic disease (e.g., docetaxel + doxorubicin ±
             cyclophosphamide), and also may have received additional prior endocrine therapy, as
             appropriate (e.g., for breast or prostate cancer), or non-myelosuppressive therapy
             (e.g., bevacizumab, trastuzumab).

          3. Patient has experienced progressive disease during or following or was intolerant of
             their most recent treatment regimen. Supporting information about prior progressive
             disease will be collected, if available.

          4. Patient is male or female aged ≥18 years.

          5. Patient provided signed and dated informed consent prior to initiation of any study
             procedures.

          6. Patient has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0
             (fully active, able to carry out all pre-disease activities without restriction) or 1
             (unable to perform physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out
             work of a light or sedentary nature), as assessed on Composite International
             Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), before the first dose of CPX-POM.

          7. Patient has adequate renal function (creatinine ≤1.5 × the upper limit of normal
             [ULN]) or a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of ≥50 mL/min).

          8. Patient has adequate hepatic function, as evidenced by a total bilirubin ≤1.5 × ULN,
             aspartate transaminase (AST), and /or alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤3 × ULN or ≤5 ×ULN,
             if due to liver involvement by tumor.

          9. Patient has adequate bone marrow function, as evidenced by hemoglobin ≥9.0 g/dL in the
             absence of transfusion within the previous 72 hours, platelet count ≥100×109cells/L,
             and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1.5×109 cells/L.

         10. Patient has no significant ischemic heart disease or myocardial infarction (MI) within
             6 months before the first dose of CPX-POM. The eligibility of patients with
             ventricular pacemakers for whom the QT interval may not be accurately measurable will
             be determined on a case-by-case basis by the Sponsor in consultation with the Medical
             Monitor.

         11. Patient and his/her partner agree to use adequate contraception after providing
             written informed consent through 3 months after the last dose of CPX-POM, as follows:

               1. For women: Negative pregnancy test during Screening and at CIDI and compliant
                  with a medically-approved contraceptive regimen during and for 3 months after the
                  treatment period or documented to be surgically sterile or postmenopausal.

               2. For men: Compliant with a medically-approved contraceptive regimen during and for
                  3 months after the treatment period or documented to be surgically sterile. Men
                  whose sexual partners are of child-bearing potential must agree to use 2 methods
                  of contraception prior to study entry, during the study, and for 3 months after
                  the treatment period.

         12. Patient is willing and able to participate in the study and comply with all study
             requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria Include:

        Patients who meet any of the following exclusion criteria are not to be enrolled in this
        study

          1. Patient has a history of risk factors for torsade de pointes (e.g., heart failure,
             hypokalemia, family history of long QT syndrome) or requires the use of concomitant
             medications that prolong the QT/QTc interval during study participation (refer to the
             following for examples: http://www.azcert.org/medical-pros/drug-lists/drug-lists.cfm).

          2. Patient has an abnormal cardiac appearance/heart size, as evidenced by chest X-ray or
             computed tomography (CT) scan.

          3. Patient has an uncontrolled or severe intercurrent medical condition.

          4. Patient underwent major surgery within 4 weeks before the first dose of CPX-POM or
             received cancer-directed therapy (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormonal therapy,
             biologic or immunotherapy, etc.) or an investigational drug or device within 4 weeks
             (6 weeks for mitomycin C and nitrosoureas) or 5 half-lives of that agent (whichever is
             shorter) before the first dose of CPX-POM. A minimum of 10 days between termination of
             the investigational drug and administration of CPX-POM is required. In addition, any
             drug-related toxicity, with the exception of alopecia, should have recovered to ≤Grade
             1.

          5. If female, patient is pregnant or breast-feeding.

          6. Patient has evidence of a serious active infection (e.g., infection requiring
             treatment with intravenous antibiotics).

          7. Patient has an important medical illness or abnormal laboratory finding that, in the
             Investigator's opinion, would increase the risk of participating in this study.

          8. Patient is taking warfarin.

          9. Patient has a history of other malignancy treated with curative intent within the
             previous 5 years with the exception of adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or
             carcinoma in situ of the cervix. Subjects with previous invasive cancers are eligible
             if the treatment was completed more than 5 years prior to initiating current study
             treatment, and there is no evidence of recurrent disease.
