      PURPOSE: To determine the prognostic properties of a comprehensive evaluation of body
      composition and physical function in patients with GI-HEP cancer from point of diagnosis and
      throughout the treatment trajectory.

      GI-HEP: Patients with tumors of the upper gastrointestinal or hepatobiliary tract,
      specifically tumors of the esophagus, gastro-esophageal junction, stomach, primary tumors of
      the liver or biliary tract, as well as colorectal liver metastasis or tumors of the pancreas.

      RATIONAL: Patients diagnosed with GI-HEP cancer are faced with poor prognosis. The treatment
      is demanding and associated with severe deconditioning potentially leading to worse
      prognostic outcomes. To what extend patients body composition at the point of diagnoses, as
      well as changes in body composition throughout the cancer continuum is associated with cancer
      outcomes is currently not well-described, specifically if this should be part of standard
      clinical evaluation in order to optimize therapy-efficacy. Recent findings suggest that
      pathophysiological alterations in skeletal muscle mass and function can have significant
      implications for the risk of disease progression and long-term prognosis.

      Blood samples will be immediately analyzed for plasma biochemistry and a 10 ml plasma sample
      will be frozen and stored in a study specific biobank.

      As an optional procedure (amendment), we will collect biological tissue from tumor (1mg),
      muscle (200 mg) and fat (200 mg) biopsies during surgery, from which RNA will be extracted
      and used to assess small RNA and gene expression by microarray technology and quantitative
      PCR. For the optional procedure, patients will sign additional separate informed consent
      before any biopsies are taken. This material will be stored in a study specific biobank until
      the study is completed, expected 31.12.2022
