  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multi-center study designed to assess the accuracy of VIVO™ in determining the location of
      a PVC/VT foci in comparison to an electroanatomical mapping system.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The VIVO accuracy study will assess the accuracy of locating a PVC/VT foci by pacing known
      anatomical locations and comparing the VIVO outcome to that of the Carto system
      (Biosense-Webster).
