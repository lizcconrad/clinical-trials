  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical study to evaluate safety and pharmacokinetics (primary objectives) and efficacy
      (secondary objective) of ET1402L1-CART-cells in patients with AFP+ HCC
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The molecular target for ET1402L1-CART is alpha fetoprotein (AFP), which is expressed on
      60-80 percent of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). ET1402L1-CART is a second generation
      (CD28/CD3ζ) chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) engineered with a human single-chain variable
      antibody fragments (scFv) against the anti-HLA-A02/AFP complex. This clinical study evaluates
      the safety and pharmacokinetics of ET1402L1-CART-cells in patients with HCC who have no
      available curative therapeutic options and a poor overall prognosis.

      Patients with lesion(s) localized in liver will be enrolled in the IA arm, with the
      ET1402L1-CART-cells administered via intrahepatic artery catheter. Patients with extrahepatic
      metastasis will be enrolled in the IV arm, with the ET1402L1-CART-cells administered through
      intravenous infusion.
