      This study will be conducted in two stages: 1) safety validation and 2) dose expansion

        1. Safety Validation Cohort: The first portion of the study will preliminarily establish
           the tolerability of the combination of pembrolizumab, oxaliplatin and capecitabine. Five
           (5) subjects will be enrolled and their safety data after 21 days of treatment will be
           reviewed before additional subjects are enrolled. Subjects on this portion of the study
           will only be enrolled at the Duke Cancer Institute.

        2. Dose Expansion Cohort: The second portion of the study (ie. phase II) will enroll 30
           subjects. In the dose expansion cohort, the first cycle will be modified to allow one
           week of pembrolizumab monotherapy before starting capecitabine and oxaliplatin (XELOX)
           chemotherapy, which will allow analysis of biomarkers related to pembrolizumab. Subjects
           on this portion of the study will be enrolled at the Duke Cancer institute and select
           external collaborating institutions.

      The primary objective of this trial is to describe the progression free survival (PFS)
      associated with the combination of pembrolizumab, oxaliplatin and capecitabine (pembrolizumab
      +XELOX) in all patients with previously untreated metastatic esophagogastric adenocarcinoma.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically and/or cytologically documented and radiographically measurable (by
             RECIST 1.1) adenocarcinoma of the esophagus or stomach (HER2-positive or negative)
             that is metastatic/recurrent and not amenable to potentially curative treatment

          -  No prior chemotherapy for metastatic/recurrent disease. Prior adjuvant or neo-adjuvant
             treatment with a fluoropyrimidine or fluoropyrimidine based regimen is allowed only if
             it is completed at least 6 months prior to the start of study drug, whether given
             alone or with radiation therapy. Patients who have received prior neo-adjuvant therapy
             (chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy) which did not contain 5-FU or capecitabine and
             have been diagnosed with metastatic disease (with no previous treatment in the
             metastatic setting) are eligible. No 6-months window is required for these patients.
             In the setting of metastatic disease requiring local palliation, only radiosensitizing
             doses of 5-FU or capecitabine monotherapy are permitted.
