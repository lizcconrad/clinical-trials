  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several open-label trials have shown the therapeutic promise of deep brain stimulation (DBS)
      in treatment-resistant depression (TRD). However, the results of placebo-controlled trials
      have been mixed.

      Here the investigators will explore whether active DBS in habenula for TRD will result in
      better symptom improvement than sham DBS. This study will also use structural and functional
      MRI to identify the brain network changes between pre-operative, post operative active DBS
      and shame DBS.
