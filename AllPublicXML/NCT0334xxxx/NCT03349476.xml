      This prospective, multicenter observational study will examine the ability of model based
      fast anatomical mapping (mFAM) to create left atrial (LA) geometry for atrial fibrillation
      ablation.

      Specifically, the study will assess the following issues in atrial fibrillation ablation:

        1. Accuracy of map (defined as the distance between the ablation points and the surface of
           the mFAM geometry)

        2. Left atrial geometry creation time

        3. Fluoroscopy time

      The clinical team will hypothesize that this approach will lead to accurate LA geometry
      creation more rapidly and using less fluoroscopy than standard techniques

    <description>The mFAM Workstation is a computerized system used to reconstruct the shape of the left atrium of the heart, by fitting a parametric shape model to points data acquired by a catheter.
The mFAM Workstation uses recorded catheter positions and other data inputs collected from various types of multi-electrode catheters and generates output data files that can be displayed as a 3D anatomic structure.</description>

    <description>Specifically, the mFAM Workstation accesses stored data of recorded electronic heart activity that has been obtained by conventional electrophysiological methods, using multi-electrode catheters placed in the heart (data inputs) for collection. Using proprietary software algorithms, the mFAM Workstation analyzes these data inputs and generates 3D anatomical structure.
mFAM improves on the FAM functionality by applying a model-based approach for reconstruction of left atrial chamber anatomy</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥ 18 years

          -  Have AF as follows:

               1. Paroxysmal AF - defined as AF that is non-sustained (terminate without electrical
                  or pharmacologic cardioversion) lasting &lt; 7 days.

               2. Persistent AF - defined as AF that is sustained &gt; 7 days. Episodes of AF which
                  are terminated by electrical or pharmacologic cardioversion after ≥ 48 hours of
                  AF, but prior to 7 days, should also be classified as persistent AF episodes.

          -  Are planned to undergo a first catheter ablation procedure (prior typical atrial
             flutter is allowed)

          -  Have the ability to understand the requirements of the study and sign the informed
             consent form.

          -  Are willing to adhere to study restrictions and comply with all post-procedural
             follow-up requirements

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Rheumatic heart disease,

          -  Current intra-cardiac thrombus

          -  Class IV HF

          -  Unable to sign consent

          -  Unstable angina

          -  Recent cerebral ischemic events

          -  Contradiction to anticoagulation

          -  Prior cardiac surgery
