    <textblock>
      AIO-YMO/TRK-0416 (DURATION) is a open-label, treatment stratified and randomized phase II
      study of Durvalumab, frail or elderly patients with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC with no
      targetable molecular alterations (EGFRwt; ALKtransl-) and not amenable to cisplatinum-based
      standard-combination chemotherapy but eligible for at-least mono-chemotherapy with
      gemcitabine or vinorelbine.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of sequential therapy
      consisting of standard of care mono- or combination chemotherapy followed by durvalumab in
      comparison to standard of care mono- or combination chemotherapy in frail/elderly patients.

             systemic treatment (e.g. active surveillance, operation without need for adjuvant
             treatment) and malignancies treated with curative intent and with no known active
             disease &gt;2 years befor the first dose of study drug and of low potential risk for
             recurrence, e.g. adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or lentigo maligna
