  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People staring at computer screens for long hours, blinking less frequently, or having
      long-term contact lens wear are prone to dry eye disease (DED). DED is a multifactorial
      disease accompanied by inflammation of the ocular surface. Further, DED may degrade vision
      and is associated with depression and have an adverse impact on patient's quality of life.
      Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY) incorporates standardized collection of breathing techniques
      followed by Automatic Self Transcending Meditation (ASTM) may help reduce stress, depression,
      and anxiety, enhance quality of life and help decrease inflammation of the ocular surface in
      patients diagnosed with DED. SKY followed by ASTM has been shown to significantly reduce
      cortisol - cause of inflammation. Thus, the investigators will be studying the effect of SKY
      plus ASTM on inflammation markers in DED patients and will assess their quality of life. The
      investigators plan to conduct a single-center pilot RCT. Patients with DED will be randomized
      to SKY followed by ASTM plus Usual care (UC) or UC alone to assess changes in inflammation of
      the ocular surface and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). HRQOL is a vital construct
      focusing on impact of health on quality of life. Along with HRQOL the investigators will
      measure changes in extent of depression and anxiety. Additionally, majority of current
      ophthalmic literature describes changes in clinical variables whilst lacking information on
      HRQOL. Thus, there is a high necessity to assess if there is an association between HRQOL and
      routinely measured clinical data. Through this study the investigators shall attempt to
      correlate HRQOL with clinical data.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Prevalence of dry eye disease (DED) ranges from 3.5% to 33.7%1 2 and increase
      with age. Inflammation and its consequences (tear film composition changes and instability)
      have been found to be present in all stages of DED. An increased concentration of
      inflammatory cytokines was measured in the tear fluid of patients with Sjogren syndrome (an
      autoimmune disease). Further, DED is associated with decreased productivity, absenteeism from
      work, depression, and has an adverse impact on patient's quality of life. Odds of a DED
      patient suffering from depression is 2.9 and anxiety is 2.8. Yoga - a practice to help
      improve health and well-being - has also been the subject of clinical studies globally. Two
      central aspects of yoga practice are physical postures and breathing exercises. These
      breathing exercises aim to focus the mind, facilitate relaxation and enhance wellness.

      Evidence further suggests beneficial effects of a standardized collection of breathing
      techniques called Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY) on individuals suffering from depression. SKY
      includes three-stage breathing with Victory breath (slow deep breathing that consists of 4 to
      6 breaths per minute), Bellow's breath (forceful rapid deep breathing that consists of 20 to
      30 breaths per minute), and a rhythmic breath technique. SKY followed by Automatic Self
      Transcending Meditation (ASTM) involves breathing exercise followed by meditation. ASTM
      utilizes a specific sound value mantra to draw attention inward and permit the mind to
      experience a restful but alert state of consciousness. It helps quiet the mind and induces
      physiological and mental relaxation whilst the eyes are shut. ASTM may help with depression,
      anxiety, stress, and may enhance quality of life. SKY followed by ASTM may reduce cortisol -
      cause of inflammation and have an anti-inflammatory potential for DED patients. Thus, the
      investigators will be studying the effect of SKY plus ASTM on inflammation markers in DED
      patients and will assess their quality of life. Key goal of proposed research is to evaluate
      inflammation, HRQOL, depression, anxiety of patients with DED in SKY followed by ASTM and
      usual care (UC) versus UC alone from baseline to 12 weeks.

      Primary Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that in patients with dry eye disease in
      SKY + ASTM + UC may lead to significant reduction in inflammation and improvement in HRQoL
      compared to UC alone from baseline to 12 weeks.

      Secondary Hypotheses: The investigators hypothesize that in patients with DED 1) HRQoL is
      associated with regularly measured clinical variables 2) SKY + ASTM + UC leads to significant
      improvement in depression and anxiety symptoms at 12 weeks compared to UC alone.

    <description>Health Related Quality of LIfe (HRQoL) is an essential measure of quality of life related to health. HRQoL will be measured using time trade-off (TTO) questionnaire. HRQoL varies between 0 and 1 where the score of 1 represents perfect health and 0 represents death.</description>

    <description>Visual related quality of life measured using National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire-25 (NEI VFQ-25). The most widely used instrument in vision-related functioning is the NEI VFQ-25. It was designed specifically for a clinical setting and consists of 12 domains: general health, general vision, visual pain, near activities, distance activities, social functioning, mental health, role difficulties, dependency, driving, colour vision and peripheral vision. The shorter 25-item version questionnaire is widely used in different groups of patients and shown to be internally consistent, reproducible and responsive in glaucoma patients. The NEI VFQ-25 scores have a closer relationship to clinical outcomes, in comparison to generic instruments. The scores range from 0 to 100 where higher score represents better vision related quality of life.</description>

    <description>Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) will be used to measure depression. It is one of the most common validated tools used to measure depression in research to identify depressive symptoms. Additionally, it is a brief standardized valid tool for assessing depressive symptoms. Possible range of scores is zero to 60, with the higher scores indicating the presence of more depressive symptoms.</description>
