  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pneumaglide is a device designed to facilitate intubation. Patients who are undergoing a
      surgical procedure under general anesthesia and will require placement of endotracheal tube
      will be screened and upon fulfilling the inclusion criteria will be randomized to PneumaGlide
      group or non-PneumaGlide group. After induction of anesthesia PneumaGlide device will placed
      in the mouth of the Pneumaglide assigned subject. The time for intubation will be measured
      from the time that the laryngoscope is inserted into the mouth until the trachea is
      successfully intubated and compared between the groups. Oxygen saturation drop below 90% and
      also gastric secretion spillage will be compared between two groups as well.

      Patients who is undergoing a surgical procedure under general anesthesia and will require
      placement of endotracheal tube will be screened. If the patient meets the inclusion criteria
      and does not have any exclusion criteria, after an informed consent is obtained he or she
      will be randomized to Pneumaglide group or non-Pneumaglide group . Patients characteristics,
      anthropometric data and comorbid conditions wil be questioned and collected into data
      collection tool forms. Airway difficulty will be assessed by the range of motion for atlanto
      axial joint (head flexion and extension), temporomandibular joint (mouth opening),
      thyromental distance and mallampati classification for visualisation of uvula, tonsillar
      pillars and soft palate. After induction of anesthesia PneumaGlide device will placed in the
      mouth of the pneumaglide assigned subject. The patients in non-pneumaglide will not have
      Pneumaglide insertion. Laryngeal grading of the airway difficulty will be determined in both
      groups and the degree of difficulty will be graded from I-IV based on visibility of the vocal
      cords. The time will be measured using a an electronic timer from the time that the
      laryngoscope is inserted into the mouth until the trachea is successfully intubated. The
      spillage of of gastric contents will also be assessed by direct visualization at the time of
      intubation. Oxygen Saturation will be monitored throughout the case and any events with
      oxygen saturation levels &lt; 90% will be recorded and compared in the two study arms. All
      Categorical variables will be analyzed using Fisher's exact test and the numerical values
      with normal distribution pattern will be analyzed with t-tests and expressed as mean Â±
      standard deviation. Numerical variables in which the normality is rejected will be analyzed
      using non-parametric test Wilcox Sum Rank and will be expressed as median [Interquartile
      Range]. Upon completion of the surgery, two Likert-based questionaires will be filled out.
      One questionaire is completed by the person who performed intubation for the ease of use, and
      the level of comfort during its use. The second questionaire is handed to the patient at the
      time of their discharge from the Ambulatory Surgery Unit and will accompany a self addressed
      envelope. The patients will be asked for the presence of cough, shortness of breath, sore
      through, any unrecognized injury to the lip or mucosa of the mouth. The patients will be
      instructed to complete and mail their questionaire along with their mailing address.

    <description>After induction of anesthesia PneumaGlide device will be placed in the mouth of the pneumaglide assigned subject. The patients in non-pneumaglide will not have Pneumaglide insertion. Laryngeal grading of the airway difficulty will be determined in both groups and the degree of difficulty will be graded from I-IV based on visibility of the vocal cords. Grade I is full visibility of glottis, grade II is partial visibility of glottis, grade III is when only epiglottis seen, none of glottis seen, and finally grade IV is when neither glottis nor epiglottis seen. Accordingly higher values represent worse grade. The time will be measured using a an electronic timer from the time that the laryngoscope is inserted into the mouth until the trachea is successfully intubated.</description>

    <description>The device is designed to facilitate intubation and reduce the time to intubation. It works with traditional glidescope to make the process of intubation easier. In this study patients scheduled for surgery and intubation, will be randomized to two groups. The intervention group will be intubated with the help of the pneumaglide. Yet, the other group will receive standard intubation. We aim to evaluate the efficacy of the Pneumaglide to improve the ease of intubation in unskilled clinicians and skilled clinicians during difficult and routine intubations</description>
