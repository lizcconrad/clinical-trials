  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is practical evidence but no scientific investigations that persons with severe
      disorders of consciousness can profit from animal-assisted therapy regarding their level of
      awareness.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of animal-assisted therapy on brain
      activity of inpatients at REHAB Basel with severe disorders of consciousness.

      To do so, the frontal brain activity of 20 the inpatients at REHAB Basel in a minimally
      conscious state is investigated via near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Moreover, 20 healthy
      participants are included as control subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each participant will be measured in 6 sessions. Sessions take place three times a week for 2
      weeks (leading up to a total of 3 experimental sessions and 3 control sessions), each lasting
      for about 15 minutes.

      Each session consists of 5 phases, with an animal present in three of them. In the beginning,
      waiting (with no stimulus presented) serves as baseline measurement. Second, an animal is
      watched, then the animal is placed on the patient's lap and in the fourth condition, the
      patient can stroke the animal with the help of the present therapist. After, there is again a
      waiting condition.

      Control sessions are comparable sessions but with a spikey massage ball or a robotic fur pet
      (e.g. fur real) instead of a live animal as stimulus.

      Measurements are: brain activity (near-infrared spectroscopy, NIRS), skin conductance (EDA),
      heart rate and heart rate variability assessed via EKG during the sessions and the BAVESTA
      score as well as a questionnaire for the investigators after each session. For further
      behavior analysis all sessions are videotaped.

    <description>The BAVESTA generates a score to assess function deficits in patients with severe disorders of consciousness. The scale ranges from 0 to 5 in total with a higher score indicating higher functioning in patients.
Subscales of vegetative regulation, attention, orientation, emotional reactivity, verbal and nonverbal communication, motor activity and information processing are reported.</description>

    <measure>A visual analogue scale (VAS) questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The visual analogue scale is filled out by the technician after the sessions. Each the attention, emotional reactivity, motor activity and information processing are measured via a semantic differential using a scale ranging from 0 to 160.</description>

    <description>All sessions are videotaped and then analyzed via behavioral coding and quantified as count variables. The variables motor activity, eye gaze, emotional reactions and communication are presented as the total number of displayed behavior percentaged to the duration of a session.</description>
