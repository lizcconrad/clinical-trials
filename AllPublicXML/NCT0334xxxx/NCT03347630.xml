  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The role of MRI in the management of esophageal cancer remains unclear and poorly studied.
      Recent technical advances suggest that MRI may become a powerful technique for the initial
      assessment of esophageal cancer, but also for the evaluation of response to neo-adjuvant
      treatment before surgery.

      This imaging study will be performed prospectively and consecutively in 60 patients included
      over a 18-month period in patients w√Æth newly diagnosed esophageal cancer.

      The aim of this study is to assess the accuracy of MRI to visualize esophageal tumors, to
      assess tumor burden and potential contact with adjacent structures as well as associated
      lymph nodes. If chemotherapy or radio-chemotherapy treatment is indicated before surgery, we
      will also evaluate whether MRI helps us to better evaluate the response to this treatment in
      comparison to PET-scan or echo. endoscopy which are the examinations currently performed to
      evaluate the effectiveness of these treatments.

      The images of the MRI exams will be interpreted by 1 expert radiologist with no knowledge of
      the other imaging modalities and transmitted to the doctors in charge for possible
      consideration for the treatment.

      Patients will then be followed for one year according to clinical management standards to
      study the data on treatment complications and cancer progression at one year.

      The main risk is the administration of a gadolinium chelate-based MRI contrast product used
      routinely. There is also a risk that the results of the MRI may influence the treatment
      initially planned for example by canceling a surgical procedure.

      The study will be proppsed consecutively to all patients with a histologically proven
      diagnosis of esophageal cancer.

      An MRI examination including morphological sequences (without and with injection of a
      gadolinium chelate) functional and dynamic will be carried out in all the patients for
      initial staging in addition to other diagnostic procedure performed in clinical routine in
      this indication that are the endo-ultrasonography, CT and PET scanner.

      In patients for whom neo-adjuvant treatment with chemotherapy or radio-chemotherapy will be
      decided and started, a second MRI will be performed 4 to 6 weeks after the end of the
      neo-adjuvant treatment.

      The images of the MR exams will be interpreted by 1 expert radiologist blinded from data of
      other imaging modalities and transmitted to the doctors in charge of the patient for possible
      consideration for the treatment.

      Patients will then be followed for one year according to regular recommandation to assess
      mortality / morbidity and PFS at 1 year.
