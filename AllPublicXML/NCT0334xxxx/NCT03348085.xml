      1. purpose of study: optimal minute could be the prediction of successful weaning and
           become the new weaning parameter.

        2. study design: inclusion criteria: investigators will perform this study at our
           respiratory care center. Patients who had been maintained on mechanical ventilator in
           excess of 3 weeks before respiratory care center admission and all previous weaning
           attempts had ailed.

           Exclusion criteria: Patients do not have spontaneous breath. Terminal cancer stage and
           unstable hemodynamics condition.

        3. study duration: 2016/01/01~12/31

      Investigators will preform this study at our respiratory care center. Initially,
      Investigators collected all physiological parameters and baseline characteristics of patients
      with prolong mechanical ventilator. Investigators use Gold-Galileo ventilator and patients
      use adaptive support ventilation mode. In adaptive support ventilation, the clinician enters
      a target minute volume , using a parameter called minute ventilation percentage. The minute
      ventilation percentage setting be initially set at 100% (the 100%minute ventilation setting),
      which provides a target minute ventilation of 0.1 L/min/kg of ideal body weight .
      Investigators observed respiratory frequency of patients, the minute ventilation percentage
      was increased every 5 min until the mandatory breath began to appear and spontaneous rate is
      zero. If the minute ventilation percentage had exceeded 250%, but patients do not have
      mandatory rate appeared, the optimal minute ventilation of the patient is means above 250%.
      Investigators also measure other weaning parameters. Finally, Investigators analyze the
      prediction of optimal minute ventilation as a weaning parameter.

        All patients are included in this study if they had been maintained on mechanical
        ventilation in excess of 3 weeks before respiratory care center admission, and all previous
        weaning attempts had failed.

        Patients are eligible for respiratory care center admission : hemodynamics stability, no
        vasoactive drug infusion for 24 hours or more before transfer, stable oxygen
        requirements(FIO2&lt;40%,PERP&lt;10 cmH2O), no hepatic failure, no requirement for surgical
        intervention within the 2 weeks, .
