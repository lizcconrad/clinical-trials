    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the role of Mavoglurant in clarifying the
      neurobiology of alcoholism risk. This is a 1-site, randomized, within subjects,
      counterbalanced double-blind study of a single dose (200mg) of Mavoglurant and placebo.

      This project explores the effects of 1 dose of AZQ056, an experimental non-competitive
      antagonist to metabotropic glutamate receptor-5 (mGlur5) developed by Novartis, in a
      double-blind, randomized, counterbalanced manner on alcoholism risk-relevant tasks.

      Drug/placebo will be administered on 2 separate visits separated by 1 week. More
      specifically, this project examines 4 functional MRI tasks related to different aspects of
      reward and/or impulsivity-related behavior in different contexts, compares the underlying
      neural circuitry across tasks, and uses a pharmacologic probe of the glutamatergic system to
      examine N-methyl-D-Aspartate and Dopamine (NMDA/DA) interactions.

      The combined measures provide the opportunity to advance our understanding of specific
      aspects of brain function related to familial alcoholism vulnerability in an already well
      characterized population as some members evolve into alcohol abuse. In addition, as well as
      conventional within-task analyses, functional network connectivity and allied approaches will
      be used to examine brain networks across the above tasks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects will be first screened toxicologically for drugs of abuse (and for women of
             childbearing age, pregnancy) by urine testing, any positive test results in exclusion.

          -  Participants will be able to understand the procedures as judged by their ability to
             clearly repeat back to the PI or his designee correctly, the purpose and content of
             the planned research, and willingly agree to participate.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. a diagnosis of DSM-IV psychiatric disorder

          2. report of psychotic disorder in a 1ยบ relative, auditory or visual impairment that
             interferes with test-taking

          3. prenatal exposure to alcohol plus currently meeting criteria for features of fetal
             alcohol syndrome
