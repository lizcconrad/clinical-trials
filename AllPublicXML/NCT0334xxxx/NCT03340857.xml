  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to encourage oncology patients to continue effort
      retraining after their release from rehabilitation and recuperative care facilities with
      physical activity sessions and therapeutic education using an intelligent electric bicycle
      (VELIS)
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The benefit of physical activity in oncology is now clearly established. Physical activity
      has its place at all stages of the fight against cancer in primary, secondary and tertiary
      prevention.

      Rehabilitation and recuperative care facilities may be a first step for patients with
      significant deconditioning, but long-term benefits are essential.

      Nevertheless, the post rehabilitation and recuperative care facilities transition period is
      for these patients a temporary period during which they may loose part of the benefit of
      effort retraining and physical reconditioning.

      The investigators believe that it is necessary to go beyond the &quot;physiological&quot; efficiency to
      identify and overcome the patient's stereotypes regarding physical activity, to customize and
      adapt the programs to each patient, and to bring quickly the notion of pleasure and success
      in the practice of physical activity. Electrically assisted bicycles can reach most of these
      goals provided that they are adapted.

      The objective of this project is to set up and evaluate, thanks to a monocentric pilot study,
      a process of continuation of exercise retraining through physical activity and therapeutic
      education sessions for the promotion of physical activity, focusing on the use of
      electrically assisted bicycles, in continuation of an exercise retraining in rehabilitation
      and recuperative care facilities.
