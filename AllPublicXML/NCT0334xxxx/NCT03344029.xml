      This was a blind-observer, monocenter, randomized, comparative, Phase IV study designed to
      evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of the Sanofi Pasteur Shenzhen Trivalent Influenza
      Vaccine (SP Shz TIV) versus the Trivalent Influenza Vaccine manufactured by Hualan Biological
      Engineering Inc (Hualan TIV) comparator in healthy Chinese participants aged 18 to 59 years.

      This study is designed to demonstrate the non-inferiority of the immune response in terms of
      geometric mean titers (GMTs) and seroconversion rates for the 3 strains (A/H1N1, A-H3N2, and
      B) after a single dose of either the SP Shz TIV or Hualan TIV. Vaccine immune responses will
      be assessed on Day 0 (pre-vaccination) and Day 28 post-vaccination. Solicited reactions will
      be collected from Day 0 up to Day 7 after vaccination, unsolicited non-serious adverse events
      (AEs) will be collected from Day 0 up to Day 28 post-vaccination, and serious AEs will be
      collected from Day 0 up to 6 months post-vaccination.
