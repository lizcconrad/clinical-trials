    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 open label, one-sequence, crossover study to evaluate the effect of
      MEDI0382 on PK and PD of warfarin and esmolol in healthy subjects. The safety and
      tolerability of MEDI0382 in combination with warfarin and esmolol will also be evaluated.
      Following screening, the study consists of 2 5-day inpatient stays followed by outpatient
      visits.
