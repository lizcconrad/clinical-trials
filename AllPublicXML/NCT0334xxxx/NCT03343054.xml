  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open label, dose escalation, safety, preliminary efficacy and
      pharmacokinetic (PK) study of single agent talazoparib in sequential cohorts of adult
      patients with advanced solid tumors who are resistant to standard therapy or for whom no
      standard therapy is available. Successive cohorts of patients will receive escalating doses
      of talazoparib on an outpatient starting from 0.75 mg/day. This study will evaluate 2 dose
      levels; 0.75 mg and 1.0 mg. Treatment with investigational product will continue until either
      disease progression, patient refusal, or unacceptable toxicity occurs. The proposed doses,
      schedule(s), and PK time points may be reconsidered and amended during the study based on the
      emerging safety and PK data.

      In the study overall, up to 18 (minimum 3) patients are expected to be enrolled depending on
      the observed DLTs.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histological or cytological diagnosis of locally advanced or metastatic solid tumor
             that is resistant to standard therapy or for which no standard therapy is available.
