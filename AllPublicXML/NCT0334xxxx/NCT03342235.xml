      Study Objectives To compare the efficacy and safety of surgical treatment (PRK) versus
      non-surgical treatment of anisometropic amblyopia in children who have failed conventional
      treatment due to non-compliance or non-response.

      Synopsis of Study Design

      The study consists of two phases:

        1. A Patching Run-In Phase during which all participants are treated for at least 8 weeks
           with continued refractive correction (with spectacles and/or contact lenses) and
           patching prescribed 42 hours per week (averaging 6 hours daily) until no further
           improvement over 2 consecutive visits at least 4 weeks apart or the vision no longer
           meets eligibility criteria.

        2. A Randomized Trial Phase, beginning after no further VA improvement in the patching
           run-in phase and qualifying amblyopia is still present, during which the participant is
           assigned to either surgery with PRK and patching prescribed 2 hours per day or to
           non-surgical treatment with continued refractive correction (with spectacles and/or
           contact lenses) and patching prescribed 2 hours per day.

      The study is evaluating the efficacy of surgical treatment with PRK versus non-surgical
      treatment of anisometropic amblyopia in children who have failed conventional treatment. The
      primary analysis will be a treatment group comparison of the change in BCVA in the amblyopic
      eye at the 8-month primary outcome visit. For participants wearing a contact lens, the BCVA
      will be the visual acuity tested in the contact lens rather than in spectacles (or trial
      frames).

             months and optical correction of refractive error prescribed for at least 6 months.
             Prior treatment does not have to be continuous. Compliance with prescribed treatment
             does not influence eligibility but the best effort at compliance is expected from both
             the patient and provider.

          7. Corneal thickness &gt;500 microns (&gt;510 microns within the previous 7 months, or corneal
             thickness between 500 and 510 microns within the last 2 months).

          8. Central corneal thickness must be enough to allow the treatment dose needed while
             leaving a residual corneal thickness of ≥ 375 microns.

          9. IOP ≤ 22 mm Hg within 7 months of enrollment

         10. Investigator believes that the participant has achieved maximum improvement in
             amblyopic-eye VA with conventional treatment.

         11. Investigator is willing to prescribe patching, and parent and child are willing to
             attempt patching for at least 8 weeks for 42 hours per week (averaging 6 hours daily)
             in the Patching Run-In Phase.

         12. No rigid gas permeable lens (including OrthoK) worn in the past 2 months

         13. Soft contact lens is currently worn, has been attempted within the past 4 months, or a
             contact lens fitting exam (paid for by the study) is scheduled or the investigator
             does the contact lens fitting on the same day as enrollment.

         14. Parent understands the protocol and is willing to accept randomization (if child meets
             eligibility criteria after Patching Run-In Phase).

         15. Parent has a phone (or access to phone) and is willing to be contacted by Jaeb Center
             staff or other study staff during the next 36 months.

         16. Relocation outside of area of an active PEDIG site for this study without the next 36
             months is not anticipated.

          5. Previous ocular condition that may predispose the eye to be treated for future
             complications, for example:

               -  Corneal disease (e.g., herpes simplex, herpes zoster keratitis, keratoconus or
                  suspicion of keratoconus based upon family history, slit lamp exam, retinoscopy,
                  or corneal topography (if able), recurrent erosion syndrome, corneal melt, or
                  corneal dystrophy)

               -  Established diagnosis of glaucoma
