      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of utilizing Transnasal Esophagoscopy
      as a means of monitoring Eosinophilic Esophagitis patients.

    <textblock>
      A participant with an established diagnosis of EoE who is undergoing Standard of Care
      treatment with a four or less food elimination diet without swallowed steroid medication (to
      optimize statistical chance of finding a trigger food for EoE), is in histological remission,
      and has been recommended as part of Standard of Care to start a single new food introduction
      by the subject's clinical allergist or gastroenterologist will be enrolled in the study.
      14-17 days after the introduction of the clinically recommended single food antigen, a TNE
      will be performed to assess the esophageal mucosa. TNE will be performed every 2 weeks for
      six weeks (3 total TNE) to evaluate recurrence time of mucosal eosinophilia (&gt;15 eos/HPF),
      other histological changes, and patient tolerance to serial TNE. At week 6 a sedated
      esophagoscopy will be offered as an alternative choice to TNE if the participant chooses.
