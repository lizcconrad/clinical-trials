  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project aims to increase HPV vaccination and cervical cancer screening through a
      web-based mobile health education program called, Wheel of Wellness (WoW) and a brief
      negotiated interview (BNI). The in-person BNI and WoW system will provide educational
      resources for participants and their families to learn more about HPV vaccination and
      cervical cancer screening.

      WoW will be tailored to the participant and will be based on the participant's cancer
      screening and HPV vaccine health needs; It will then send custom text messages based their
      concerns and will remind them to schedule and attend their doctor's appointment. The
      researchers will conduct a single armed proof of concept where the participants will be
      actively using WoW. The in-person BNI will empower participants to have positive behavioral
      changes in regards to their health by giving them appropriate health information as well as
      answering their questions and concerns about cervical cancer prevention and screening.

    <intervention_model_description>We are proposing a single arm proof of concept. We will recruit 30 parents/guardians and their age-eligible child for the single arm proof of concept.
For this proof of concept/pilot trial, we will assess the feasibility and impact of WOW to improve provider communication about HPV vaccination and increase the initial and complete vaccination rates for both boys and girls aged 9-17 and to enhance knowledge and awareness about risks and benefits of HPV vaccine among dyads. The power of our proposed pilot for determining intervention effects is limited. However, because we are proposing a proof of concept pilot and feasibility study, in our experience and that of others, our proposed sample size generally provides sufficient data to estimate subject retention, distribution of variables and feasibility as we plan for a larger-multi-site RCT of the proposed study. We expect our intervention to demonstrate feasibility of the intervention in a clinic setting.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Change in knowledge of HPV vaccination and cervical cancer will be measured using a survey, which is under development, that includes questions about HPV and HPV vaccination. It will be administered before and again after the intervention and changes in responses will be compared.</description>

    <description>Based on participants' entries onto the WoW website, a list of their concerns and questions about HPV vaccine and cervical cancer will be created and this list will be brought to a clinical visit with their providers. Following the clinical visit, participants will be asked whether providers addressed their questions and concerns about HPV vaccine and cervical cancer using a short questionnaire with a 5 point likert scale where 1=completely addressed and 5= not at all addressed. Lower scores are favorable.</description>
