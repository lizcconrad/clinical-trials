  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      JJ ureteral stents are often positioned at the end of a ureteroscopy and often cause
      important comorbidities. Indeed, up to 80% of the patients complain a deterioration of the
      quality of life. In order to reducing the symptoms to the minimum, the producing companies
      developed different types of stents, hypothetically thinking that modifications in materials
      and designs might reduce patients' discomfort.

      Classic ureteral stents have a proximal J and a distal J as anchors respectively in the
      kidney and in the bladder. Talking about materials, most ureteral stents are made up of
      polymers, especially polyurethane and its derivatives, and silicon. Next to these ones,
      producing companies have also designed metallic or mixed stents in order to reducing radial
      resistance.

      In literature there are not many studies that adequately make a comparison of the symptoms
      related to the different types of stents. In particular, there are not many comparing
      symptoms caused by traditional hydrophilic Vortek JJ and symptoms caused by silicone JJ.

      From 2008 an Italian version of USSQ is at disposal in order to evaluating with a standard
      method the symptoms reported by patients after ureteral stent positioning.

      Aim of this study study is comparing prospectively in a randomized way symptoms of patients
      with traditional hydrophilic Vortek JJ and symptoms of patients with silicone JJ by
      submitting USSQ to the patients who undergo a URS with laser lithotripsy for ureteral
      lithiasis.
