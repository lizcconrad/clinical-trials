    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-finding
      study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of IMU-838 for induction and maintenance therapy in
      moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis (CALDOSE-1).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigational medicinal product (IMP) IMU-838 (vidofludimus calcium) is a new compound
      that selectively inhibits the human enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH).
      Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase plays a major role in the de-novo pyrimidine synthesis and is
      specifically expressed at high levels in proliferating or activated lymphocytes. Resting
      lymphocytes satisfy their pyrimidine requirements through a DHODH-independent salvage
      pathway. Thus, IMU-838-mediated DHODH inhibition selectively affects activated, rapidly
      proliferating lymphocytes. The metabolic stress secondary to DHODH inhibition leads to a
      reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokine release including interleukin (IL)-17 (IL-17A and
      IL-17F) and interferon gamma (IFNÎ³), and to an increased apoptosis in activated lymphocytes.

      This is a phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled trial in
      patients with moderate-to-severe UC with an option for open-label treatment extension. The
      study comprises a blinded induction phase to establish the optimal dose of IMU-838 to induce
      response and remission, a blinded maintenance phase to evaluate the potential of IMU-838 to
      maintain remission until Week 50, and an open-label treatment extension arm for all patients
      who discontinue the blinded phase as scheduled or prematurely, subject to certain
      restrictions. A subset of patients will undergo a pharmacokinetic (PK) period at the start of
      the open-label period to establish a full single-dose PK profile.
