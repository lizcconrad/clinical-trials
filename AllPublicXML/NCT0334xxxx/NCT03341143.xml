  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this research study is to determine if the fecal microbiota transplant (FMT)
      improves the body's ability to fight your cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II Simon two-stage single-center study of concurrent fecal microbiota
      transplang (FMT) with pembrolizumab in patients with PD-1 resistant/refractory melanoma. The
      study will be conducted over a 12-week period (and up to 24-weeks in responding patients).

      Patient eligibility is based upon prior exposure to PD-1 inhibitor therapy and response at
      restaging scans at any time up to 1 year from time of initiation of PD-1 therapy. Patients
      who have received either nivolumab or pembrolizumab are eligible. Patients who have received
      pembrolizumab/nivolumab in combination with other investigational agent(s) are NOT eligible.
      PD-1 refractory disease is defined as progressive disease (PD) at the first (or subsequent)
      radiographic evaluation while receiving PD-1 inhibitor treatment as assessed by RECIST v1.1
      or immune-related RECIST criteria. Other eligibility criteria include absence of CNS disease,
      presence of disease amenable to biopsy and lack of contra-indications to FMT administration.

      Suitable patients will be identified following restaging study documenting disease
      progression. Patients will undergo a rapid screening evaluation consisting of CNS imaging,
      tumor biopsy, and serological/stool studies to confirm suitability for FMT administration.
      Eligible patients will receive FMT endoscopically (with cycle 1 pembrolizumab +/- 3 days)
      followed by 3 further cycles of pembrolizumab (cycles 2-4) following which restaging will be
      performed. Patients with stable and/or responding disease will continue to receive
      pembrolizumab on study for 4 cycles. Patients with stable and/or responding disease after 8
      cycles of pembrolizumab will continue to receive therapy off study till progression.

    <description>FMT is a procedure in which fecal matter or stool is collected from a tested donor, mixed with a saline or other solution, strained and infused into the colon by doing a colonoscopy. The FMT consists of introducing normal bacterial flora contained in stool collected from a donor into your small intestine. In this case, the donor is patient with advanced melanoma who has been treated with a PD-1 inhibitor (nivolumab or pembrolizumab) and has been rendered disease-free as a result. The FMT will be performed on Cycle 1 Day 1.
Pembrolizumab, 200mg, through an IV over 30 minutes on Cycle 1 Day 1 (same day as the FMT, and then again on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for an additional 3 cycles (Cycles 2 - 4).</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of unresectable stage III
             or IV melanoma. Patient may not have a diagnosis of uveal or mucosal melanoma.

          -  Have received any number of prior systemic therapies for metastatic disease. Prior
             radiation therapy (any number) and interferon use (any formulation and/or duration) in
             the adjuvant or metastatic disease settings is permitted. Vaccine therapy will be
             counted as systemic therapy.

          -  Patient must currently be receiving systemic PD-1 immunotherapy with pembrolizumab or
             nivolumab to be eligible. Patients who are receiving combination Ipilimumab with
             pembrolizumab or nivolumab are not eligible.

          -  Must be pembrolizumab/nivolumab refractory/resistant - defined as having received at
             least 2 doses of pembrolizumab (or 2 doses of nivolumab) with documented systemic
             disease progression on staging imaging. PD will be defined as increase in tumor burden
             &gt; 20% relative to nadir (minimum recorded tumor burden) by RECIST v1.1. Once PD is
             confirmed, initial date of PD documentation will be considered as the date of disease
             progression. Patients can be enrolled at any time following initiation of PD-1 therapy
             up to 1 year.

          -  Patients with CNS progression (parenchymal but not leptomeningeal) are eligible if CNS
             metastases are treated and deemed stable (with a repeat CT/MRI imaging study) prior to
             the enrollment date. If radiation is used to treat CNS parenchymal disease, a 2 week
             washout period will apply.

          -  Consent to receive FMT administered endoscopically (colonoscopically) and undergo
             necessary bowel preparation pre-procedure.

          -  Understand infectious risks associated with FMT administration. Although FMT infusate
             has been screened for bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites there is a risk of
             transmission of known and unknown infectious organisms contained in the donor stool.
             Post-FMT bacteremia (e.g. E. coli), sepsis and fatal events may rarely occur.

          -  Understand non-infectious risks associated with FMT administration. Possible allergy
             and/or anaphylaxis to antigens in donor stool; theoretical risk of developing disease
             possibly related to donor gut microbiota including but not limited to: obesity,
             metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, autoimmune conditions, allergic/atopic
             disorders, neurologic disorders, psychiatric conditions and malignancy.

          -  Understand risks associated with colonoscopy including risk of infection transmission,
             colonic perforation, aspiration pneumonia, and death.

          -  Understand that data regarding the long-term safety risk of FMT are lacking.

          -  Consent to participate in the correlative studies and should have available tumor
             tissue for tumor biopsies. Acceptable biopsies include surgical biopsy, core biopsy or
             punch/surgical tumor biopsies (of accessible lesions).

          -  Have measurable disease as per RECIST version 1.1. At least 1 of the tumor sites must
             be amenable to biopsy and this may not be the site of disease used to measure
             antitumor response.

          -  Be willing and able to provide written informed consent/assent for the trial.

          -  Be 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.

          -  Have a performance status of 0 or 1 on the ECOG Performance Scale.

        International Normalized Ratio (INR) or Prothrombin Time (PT) ≤1.5 X ULN unless patient is
        receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of
        intended use of anticoagulants.

        Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) ≤1.5 X ULN unless patient is receiving
        anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of
        anticoagulants.

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If
