      There will be assessment of patients after acute pulmonary embolism for the development of
      CTEPH.

      There will be analysis of case histories of 40 patients with acute pulmonary embolism. All
      this patients will be clinically assessed by local cardiologist. Also echocardiography, lung
      VQ scans (perfusion and ventilation) will be performed.

      Patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension will be assessed by local team
      experienced in CTEPH treatment.
