      This study aims to evaluate the effect of standard heart failure therapy plus oral solution
      with protein succinylate iron compared to placebo on the primary end point of 6 minute walk
      distance at 24th week in patients with chronic ejection fraction reduction heart failure and
      iron deficiency.

      This clinical trial was designed as a multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind
      controlled study. Patients were randomly divided into one of two treatment groups:

      Control group: standard treatment + placebo（1 bottle orally, twice daily, take orally before
      meals, duration of treatment 16-24 weeks）.

      Test group: standard treatment + Iron protein succinylate oral solution (1 bottle orally,
      twice daily, take orally before meals, duration of treatment 16-24 weeks）.

      Sample size calculation is according to the change of 6 Minute walk distance from the
      baseline at 24 weeks, it is estimated the mean difference between two groups is 20 meter,
      standard deviation 80 meter, statistical power 80%, type I error 0.05, follow up loss
      15%，estimated total sample size 600.
