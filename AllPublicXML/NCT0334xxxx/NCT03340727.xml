  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of continuing treatment with caffeine
      citrate in the hospital and at home in moderately preterm infants with resolved apnea of
      prematurity on days of hospitalization after randomization.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study subjects will be patients in the NICU at one of the participating hospitals at a
      Neonatal Research Network site. Infants who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomized
      to either caffeine citrate at 10 mg/kg/dose or placebo (equal volume of normal saline) to be
      given daily beginning within 72 hours of open label caffeine discontinuation. The infant may
      still require hospitalization for observation after discontinuation of open label caffeine or
      for other discharge issues such as temperature control or feeding tolerance.

      Once deemed ready for discharge, infants will be continued at home on the same dose of
      caffeine citrate or placebo for the first 28 days after hospital discharge. On the day of
      discharge, the parent will be supplied with 28 numbered syringes pre-filled with oral
      caffeine citrate (intervention group) or normal saline at an equivalent volume (placebo
      group).

      The parents will be educated by the research nurse, discharge nurse, physician, or pharmacist
      on storage and administration of study medication. A member of the research team will contact
      the parents to obtain post-discharge information within 72 hours after discharge, once a week
      for the first 4 weeks, and biweekly during the weeks 5 to 8 after discharge.
