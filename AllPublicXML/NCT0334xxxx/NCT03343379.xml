    <textblock>
      Male and female physical education students were subjected to a clinical test battery
      comprised of valid and reliable tests to measure different aspects of core stability at the
      start of the study. After a period of 2 months testing, the injury registration procedure
      started with the use of an online injury registration platform and regular call back moments.
      After 2 years of injury registration, all data was gathered and will be analysed
      statistically to link the measured core stability aspects as risk factors for certain lower
      extremity injuries.

      September 2014 - December 2014: 139 male and female participants 18+ were subjected to
      different test to evaluate corresponding aspects of core stability. The following test were
      performed: Star excursion balance test; Lumbopelvic proprioception test; Lumbopelvic
      neuromuscular control test; Lateral step down test; Hip strength test measured with a
      handheld dynamometer(flexion/extension/abduction/adduction/internal rotation/external
      rotation); Trunk strength tests measured with a handheld dynamometer (trunk flexion and trunk
      extension) and core muscle endurance tests (prone bridging test/Biering-Sorenson test/side
      bridging tests).

      January 2015 - April 2017: Prospective follow up of lower extremity injury contracted during
      sports activity. The injuries were confirmed by a medical examiner and were recorded in an
      online injury registry platform (Survey Monkey).

      Statistical analysis will be performed to evaluate which core stability outcome measure can
      be considered a risk factor for the development of lower extremity injuries.
