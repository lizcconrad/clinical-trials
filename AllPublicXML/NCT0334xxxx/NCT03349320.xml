  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pharmacological treatment of AD is currently based on cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEI) and
      memantine, which have been shown to lead to modest, although effective, clinical benefits.
      Donepezil is a ChEI metabolized through the cytochrome P (CYP) 450, primarily by the 3A4 and
      2D6 isoforms. The CYP2D6 gene presents polymorphisms that can alter its expression. The
      plasma therapeutic level ranges from 30 to 75 ng/mL, and 50% of acetylcholinesterase
      inhibition is achieved when the concentration reaches 15.6 ng/mL. An optimal plasma level is
      greater than 50 ng/mL.

      These polymorphisms may influence the individual's response to treatment with donepezil and
      the concentration of the drug in AD patients, without achieving the desired effect. However,
      most of the individuals are EM, i.e., the metabolism of the drug occurs according to the
      expected kinetics and is associated with the presence of one or two wild-type alleles.

      Objective: investigate the pattern of clinical response to donepezil in a group of patients
      with AD and AD with cerebrovascular disease (CVD) in relation to the plasmatic concentration
      of donepezil and polymorphisms of the CYP2D6 and apolipoprotein E (APOE) genes.

      Patients taking donepezil were seen four times (from June 2009 to March 2013) and were
      submitted to the MMSE test, the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer'sDisease
      battery (CERAD), and the Pfeffer Functional Activities Questionnaire. CERAD memory evaluation
      was further divided into five components: incidental recall (CERAD151 INC), immediate recall
      1 and 2 (CERAD-RM1, CERAD-RM2, respectively) and delayed recall after five minutes (CERAD-R).
      Each aspect was analyzed individually and compared between groups at baseline and after 12
      months of treatment with donepezil. All patients had blood samples (10mL) collected to obtain
      donepezil plasmatic concentration (DPC) measurements and for APOE and CYP2D6 genotyping.

      A blood sample was drawn from the patients on the first consultation for use in DNA
      extraction and Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotyping. For the patients who were taking
      donepezil, after three, six and twelve months of treatment another blood sample were also
      drawn, separated in plasma and kept into the freezer at - 70 Celsius degree for further
      analysis of serum level of donepezil.
