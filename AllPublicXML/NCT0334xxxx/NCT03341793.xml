  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bariatric surgery is recognized as a therapeutic modality of type 2 diabetes. The mechanisms
      of this remission of diabetes remain poorly understood.

      The aim of our research is to characterize the changes in muscle secretome induced by
      bariatric surgery and to determine their role in improving the insulin sensitivity of
      skeletal muscle and insulin secretion by the B cell responsible for the remission of
      diabetes.

      This prospective study will be carried out in insulin-resistant diabetic patients or not in
      whom blood and muscle samples will be carried out before and after bariatric surgery
