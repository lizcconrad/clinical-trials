    <textblock>
      The T.I.N.T.I.N. study investigates the safety and efficacy of the combination therapy with
      the Luminor drug coated balloon (DCB) and the iVolution stent in the treatment of TASC C and
      D femoropopliteal lesions. An expected total of 100 patients will be treated in the scope of
      this study. The lesion is located within the native superficial femoral artery and/or the
      popliteal artery. Prior to dilatation with the Luminor DCB, pre-dilatation with the Oceanus
      balloon is mandatory. After dilatation with the Luminor DCB, stenting with the iVolution
      stent need to be performed. Post-dilatation can be performed according to the physician's
      discretion. Patients will be invited for a follow-up visit at 1, 6 and 12 month
      post-procedure. The primary efficacy endpoint of the study is defined as the freedom from
      clinically-driven target lesion revascularization (TLR) at 12 months. Secondary endpoints
      include primary patency rate at 6 and 12 months, freedom from clinically-driven TLR at 6
      months, clinical success at 1, 6 and 12 months and freedom from serious adverse events at
      pre-discharge, 1, 6 and 12 months follow-up.

      The objective of this clinical investigation is to evaluate, in a controlled setting, the
      long-term safety and efficacy of the combination therapy with the Luminor DCB and the
      iVolution stent post CE-certification and according to the indications of the Instructions
      for use (IFU) with focus on the treatment of TASC C and D femoropopliteal atherosclerotic
      lesions.

      Patients will be selected based on the investigator's assessment, evaluation of the
      underlying disease and the eligibility criteria. The patient's medical condition should be
      stable, with no underlying medical condition which would prevent them from performing the
      required testing or from completing the study. Patients should also be geographically stable,
      willing and able to cooperate in this clinical study and remain available for long-term
      follow-up. A patient is considered enrolled in the study after obtaining the patients
      informed consent, if there is full compliance with the study eligibility criteria and after
      successful guidewire passage through the study target lesion.

      Prior to the index procedure the following tests and clinical data will be collected:
      informed consent for data collection, demographics, medical history, medication record,
      physical examination, clinical category of chronic limb ischemia (Rutherford category) and
      resting ankle-brachial index (ABI).

      During the procedure, the vascular access can be achieved to the investigator's standard
      clinical practice. After successful lesion passage, diagnostic angiography of the lesion area
      and distal run-off is performed and angiographic measurements (vessel diameter, percentage
      stenosis and lesion length) are collected. All inflow-limiting lesion will be treated
      according to the investigators standard clinical practice before treatment of the target
      lesion. Pre-dilatation of the target lesion is mandatory with the Oceanus balloon. After
      pre-dilatation, a least one Luminor DCB will be inflated and at least 1 iVolution stent will
      be deployed at the target lesion. At the physician's discretion, post-dilatation can be
      performed. No other adjunctive therapies (atherectomy, laser) are allowed. The complete
      femoropopliteal vasculature should be treated in one single session, staged interventions are
      not allowed. All outflow-limiting lesions must be treated according to the hospital treatment
      standard.

      The regular follow-ups are necessary to monitor the condition of the patient and the
      procedure. Patients will be invited for a follow-up visit at 1, 6 and 12 months after the
      index procedure. The following data will be collected during these follow-up visit:
      medication record, physical examination, rutherford categorization, ABI and color flow
      doppler ultrasound.
