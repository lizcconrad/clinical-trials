  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe mental illnesses have a significant social cost, as much by their impact on the sick
      as on their entourage. The Deinstitutionalization and care in the community of patients with
      severe mental illness result in increased families and loved ones (also known as &quot;informal
      caregivers&quot; or &quot;informal caregivers&quot;) If psychoeducation programs have been developed to help
      caregivers better manage and cope with the illness of the person being helped (optimize the
      quality of care, manage anxiety and isolation, these initiatives appear minimal in view of
      the magnitude of the burden (notion of burden: &quot;burden&quot;) and the suffering of caregivers.
      Quality of life levels remain extremely low compared to the general population, nearly 4 out
      of 10 caregivers show a sense of inability to cope with the &quot;permanent anxiety&quot; of this load,
      1/3 feels depressed and over 1/10 feels isolated on a personal and professional level

      This project will take place in three stages:

      1- Development and development of the network: the conception of the social network is based
      on the point of view of the caregivers, which is one of the originalities of this project.
      Current social networks are very &quot;medico-centric&quot; And often poorly adapted to the needs of
      caregivers of patients suffering from pathologies mental disorders. This step is based on a
      qualitative approach to these caregivers. Focus groups (5 focus of 5 carers) will be led by a
      psychologist in order to understand their experience and identify the resulting needs in
      order to determine the architecture and services offered on the network social. From emerging
      needs, a study based on Delphi method will be conducted with professionals from different
      disciplines psychiatry, public health, communication and information professionals,
      ethicists, health economists and sociologists) to provide a light on the professional
      responses that can be proposed to the needs of carers. The development of the social network
      will be done in close collaboration with a caregiver who will be in charge of the animation
      and moderation of the network 2. Implementation of the randomized trial comparing two groups
      of caregivers (access to the social network vs. lack of access to the social network) over a
      period of 6 month. The same scales will be filled by both groups at T0 and then at 6 months.

      3. Qualitative approach to network perception: semidirective interviews made by a
      psychologist to a panel of caregivers using the network at course of 6 months
