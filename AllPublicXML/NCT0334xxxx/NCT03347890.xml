  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to investigate the effects of 3.0 mg of liraglutide on reward brain circuits
      in human obesity and to better understand its effects on weight loss (in patients without
      diabetes).

      According to the study protocol, 70 obese patient will be evaluated at baseline and at
      16-week (end of study) after daily subcutaneous injections of Saxenda® (liraglutide 3.0 mg)
      or Placebo by pen injector.

      All participants will first undergo a functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) session
      while being presented with gustatory stimuli. Second, participants will complete behavioural
      tasks (i.e., liking versus wanting, in the scanner) and questionnaires aiming at teasing
      apart reward mechanisms and emotional skills (e.g., emotional regulation ability) associated
      with food intake. Third, metabolic parameters and hormones involved in appetite regulation
      will be assessed and studied in relation to fMRI.

      These measurements will be repeated after 16 weeks in obese individuals. The control group of
      normal body weight individuals will be evaluated once at Baseline.
