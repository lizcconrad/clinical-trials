          7. Treatment with any of the following therapies within 4 weeks prior to randomization:

             a. Any topical/local psoriasis therapies other than those permitted per inclusion #4,

             b. Phototherapy, with or without psoralen. c. Use of an indoor tanning facility, or

             protocol-mandated activities; this includes any clinically significant screening ECG
             abnormalities any may include some clinically significant screening laboratory
             abnormalities.

             abnormalities at screening which are unlikely to interfere with the assessment of

             with the subject's ability to comply with protocol mandated activities are permitted.
