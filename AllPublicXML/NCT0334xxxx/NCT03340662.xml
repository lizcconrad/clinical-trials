    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 open-label 4-part study to evaluate the effect of food, cytochrome P450
      inhibition and induction on the pharmacokinetics of CC 122 in healthy adult subjects.
      Approximately 81 subjects will be enrolled. There will be approximately 24 subjects in Part 1
      and approximately 19 subjects in Parts 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Subjects may participate in
      1 part only.

    <textblock>
      This study will consist of 4 parts. Each part has two periods. The parts may be conducted in
      any order. Subjects may participate in 1 part only.

      Each subject will participate in a screening phase, a baseline phase in each study period, a
      treatment phase in each study period and a follow-up telephone call. Subjects will be
      screened for eligibility. Eligible subjects will return to the study center on Day -1 of
      Period 1 and will remain at the study center until the last day of Period 2.

      Part 1: On Day 1 of Period 1, eligible subjects will be randomized to 1 of 2 sequences. On
      Day 1 of each study period, each subject will receive 1 of 2 treatments according to the
      sequence in which he or she is randomized.

      In Part 2, subjects will receive a single dose of CC-122 in Period 1 and, following an
      appropriate washout, multiple doses of itraconazole plus one dose of itraconazole with CC-122
      in Period 2.

      In Part 3, subjects will receive a single dose of CC-122 in Period 1 and, following an
      appropriate washout, multiple doses of fluvoxamine plus one dose of fluvoxamine with CC-122
      in Period 2.

      In Part 4, subjects will receive a single dose of CC-122 in Period 1 and, following an
      appropriate washout, multiple doses of rifampin plus one dose of rifampin with CC-122 in
      Period 2.
