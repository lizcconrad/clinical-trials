      Ascites is the pathologic accumulation of fluid within the peritoneal cavity. Causes of
      ascites in infants and children :hepatobiliary disorders,serositis, neoplasm, cardiac,
      genitourinary disorder, metabolic disease and others.

      Diagnosis of ascites :history of abdominal distention, increasing weight, respiratory
      embarrassement, symptoms and signs of (hepatic ,cardiac,renal disease, tuberculosis and
      malignancy).

      lnvestigation:complete blood count, complete urine examination, liver function tests, plasma
      proteins, renal function tests, clotting screen, tuberculin test, chest and abdominal plain
      films,abdominal ultrasound, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, abdominal paracentesis for
      ascitic fluid analysis .

      Definition : Ascites is the pathologic fluid accumulation within the peritoneal cavity .

      causes of ascites in infants and children :

        -  Hepatobiliary disorders (cirrhosis, congenital hepatic fibrosis, acute hepatitis B,C
           ,Budd -chiari syndrome, Bile duct perforation)

        -  Serositis (crohn's disease, eosinophilic enteropathy , Henoch- Shonlein purpura )

        -  Neoplasm (lymphoma, wilm's tumor ,Glioma, Germ cell tumor, Ovarian tumor,mesothelioma,
           Neroblastoma )

        -  Cardiac (Heart failure )

        -  Metabolic disease

        -  Gastrointestinal disorder (Nephrotic syndrome, peritoneal dialysis ). Diagnosis of
           ascites :History of abdominal distention, increasing weight, respiratory embarrassement,
           jaundice, bleeding (haematemsis, melena, and epistaxis ),Pruritus ,Growth failure
           ,abdominal pain, fever,Cyanosis, ,dyspnea during suckling, Orthopnea, Buffy eyes, lower
           limb swelling, Haematrruria .

      By examination : Tachycardia ,Tachypnea ,Hypertension ,cyanosis, jaundice, clubbing of
      fingers ,limb edema ,Hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, dilated abdominal wall veins.

      Investigations :

      Laboratory tests :complete blood count , complete urine examination, liver function tests,
      plasma proteins, renal function tests, clotting screen, tuberculin test.

      Imaging studies :chest and abdominal plain films, abdominal ultrasound, upper
      gastrointestinal endoscopy CT, MR I, Abdominal paracentesis for ascitic fluid analysis :cell
      count / cytology ,Gram 'stain and culture, Total proteins (albumin /globulin ratio ),
      Glucose, Amylase, lactase dehydrogenase, Triglycerides,Bilirubin.

      Serum ascites albumin gradient (SAAG )is the best single test for classification of ascites
      into portal hypertensive (SAAG &gt;1.1g/dl) and non-portal hypertensive (SAAG &lt;1.1g/dl) causes.
