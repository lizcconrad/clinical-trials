  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been observed that patients subjected to amputations develop so called receptive
      fields, which time of occurrence and localization over time are yet not examined
      systematically.

      This clinical trial aims to investigate the reliability in detecting these receptive fields
      as well as their incidence and changes over time.

      Further it aims to evaluate the acute effect of a stimulating system (&quot;Phantom Stimulator&quot;
      (Cort X Sensorics, Spaichingen, Germany)) on selected gait parameters measured tough a gait
      analysis system (&quot;OprtoGait&quot; (Microgate, Bolzano, Italy)) as well as on phantom sensations
      measured through a questionnaire.

      It has been observed that patients subjected to amputations develop so called receptive
      fields, which time of occurrence and localization over time are yet not examined
      systematically.

      A receptive field is defined as skin area anywhere on the same side of the body as the
      amputation, which when stimulated by others, causes phantom sensations in the amputated
      extremity.

      This clinical trial aims to investigate the reliability in detecting these receptive fields
      as well as their incidence and changes over time.

      Further it aims to evaluate the acute effect of the stimulating system (&quot;Phantom Stimulator&quot;

    <intervention_model_description>The primary outcomes are the changes in size and position over time and their timed occurrence after the amputation of these receptive fields as well as the inter-/intratester reliability in their detection.
The secondary outcomes are the change in selected gait parameters and phantom sensations through the application of the stimulating system (&quot;Phantom Stimulator&quot; (Cort X Sensorics, Spaichingen, Germany)).
The primary outcome is of mere descriptive nature. Therefore, no control group is created and the participants are not blinded or randomized.
For the secondary outcomes, every tested subject serves as its own control (cross over). The gait analysis as well as the questionnaire are performed three times. The two measurements after the first familiarization measurements are performed in a randomized order.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Single (Participant)</masking>
    <masking_description>As this study is described as single blinded, the only entity of the trial not aware of the group or sequence of the participant is the participant itself.
The other personell involved in the trial needs to be aware of the position of the participant within the study so to apply the right measures.
In this case the participant is unaware of the fact whether his stimulation system is turned on or off.</masking_description>

    <description>The secondary outcomes are the change in selected gait parameters through the application of the stimulating system (&quot;Phantom Stimulator&quot; (Cort X Sensorics, Spaichingen, Germany)).
These parameters are measured with the gait analysis system Optogait. The selected parameters are step length (cm), width (cm), cadence (steps/min) and speed (m/s).</description>

    <description>The secondary outcomes are the change in phantom sensations through the application of the stimulating system (&quot;Phantom Stimulator&quot; (Cort X Sensorics, Spaichingen, Germany)).
These changes are measured through a questionnaire witch uses the Visual Analogue Scale (values from 1 - 10).</description>

  <intervention>

    <intervention_name>Phantom Stimulator, Cort X Sensorics, Spaichingen, Germany</intervention_name>
    <description>This system consists of a pressure sensing insole connected to regular TENS-Electrode patches which are applied to the receptive fields of the patients (evoking the sensation of heel and forefoot). The individually adjusted stimulation intensity on the systems regulatory box through a socked screw is set at the beginning of the testing phase, and not changed anymore.
The current is applied to mimic the roll-off-sensation while walking. This is done by locating two sets of electrodes on the receptive fields representing the heel and the ball of the foot respectively. Now the current is applied in an alternating manner coordinated with the walking of the participant. The coordination is made able through the pressure sensing insole.</description>
