  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of using ice packs on the abdomen
      immediately after laparoscopic hysterectomy surgery on pain control and narcotic pain
      medication use.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hysterectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures performed on women in the United
      States, with approximately 600,000 performed annually. The use of postoperative cooling as an
      adjuvant for post-operative pain control has previously been shown to be effective and safe
      in a variety of procedures, but has yet to be described for laparoscopic surgery. In contrast
      to laparotomy where the wound is a significant pain generator and direct application of ice
      is intuitive, in laparoscopic surgery much of the pain-generating tissue trauma is
      intraperitoneal and pelvic in nature, away from the abdominal wall. Ice pack use on the
      abdominal wall likely inhibits visceral afferent pain fibers via somatic afferent nerve
      cross-talk. Accordingly, applying ice to the abdominal wall and its somatic afferents may
      improve laparoscopic pain control, despite the lack of a significant abdominal wound. Our
      goal is to quantify narcotic use after hospital discharge following hysterectomy, and
      evaluate the effectiveness of abdominal ice packs as low cost adjuncts for pain control.

    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Calculation of average patient MME from the time of hospital discharge to end of narcotic use for post-operative pain control.

    <description>Brief Pain Inventory Short Form scores (Pain diagram to indicate location of pain and 7 Likert-scale questions assessing pain severity and interference with feeling and function, scores ranging from 0 = No pain to 10 = pain as bad as you can imagine) assessed pre-op and again post-operatively, just before hospital discharge (at last 12 but no more than 24 hours after surgery). Mean differences calculated between ice group and usual care group.</description>
