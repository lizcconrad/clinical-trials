  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Changes in the communication of glutamate from one brain structure to another are important
      in the development of therapy for cocaine use disorders. Our preliminary investigations
      suggest that drugs that affect glutamate exchange may be effective at promoting and
      maintaining individuals' abstinence from cocaine. The purpose of this randomized,
      double-blind, controlled trial is to test various glutamate modulators in conjunction with
      motivational enhancement therapy (MET) and mindfulness based relapse prevention (MBRP) for
      cocaine use disorders.

    <textblock>
      Alterations in the transmission between neurons of a neurotransmitter called glutamate are an
      important target of pharmacotherapy for cocaine use disorders (CUDs). Preliminary
      investigations suggest that glutamate modulation may be effective at promoting and
      maintaining abstinence and that it promotes motivation to quit, reduces craving, reduces
      cocaine self-administration and facilitates abstinence in individuals with a CUD in a series
      of trials.

      The study team has recently developed and tested a novel design that integrates a clinical
      trial involving serial infusions and a behavioral treatment platform. The current trial will
      evaluate the effect of two sub-anesthetic infusions on abstinence rates in a relatively large
      sample of treatment-seeking CUD individuals who complete a 12-week double-blind, randomized,
      controlled trial. It will also evaluate the correlation between clinical response and
      brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a peripheral biomarker relevant to glutamate
      modulation antidepressant response. This project aims to expand on several years of promising
      preliminary data to rigorously evaluate the efficacy of this innovative pharmacological
      intervention integrated into a behavioral treatment platform.
