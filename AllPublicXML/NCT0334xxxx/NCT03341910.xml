    <textblock>
      A study for Subjects with mild to moderate facial acne vulgaris. Subjects will be randomized
      to treatment with either DFD-03 (tazarotene) Lotion 0.1%, Tazorac (tazarotene) Cream, 0.1%,
      Vehicle Lotion or Vehicle Cream. During the 12-week treatment period subjects randomized to
      DFD-03 Lotion or Vehicle Lotion will use the study drug twice daily. Subjects randomized to
      Tazorac Cream or Vehicle Cream will use the study drug once daily in the evening. Subjects
      will be instructed to treat the entire face.

      Safety assessments will include the investigator's assessment of local cutaneous
      tolerance/application site reactions on the face, vital signs and adverse events. Urine
      pregnancy tests will be performed for all female subjects. A physical examination will be
      performed.

    <description>Comparison of Change from Baseline to Week 12 in CADI Score between the various treatment arms. The CADI is a short 5 item questionnaire that will be responded by all subjects at Baseline, Week 4, 8, and 12. The questionnaire rapidly assesses the disability caused by the acne. It consists of 5 questions. The scoring for each question is done from 0 to 3 (a=3, b=2, c=1, d=0). The CADI score is calculated by summing the score of each question resulting in a possible maximum of 15 and a minimum of 0. The higher the score, the more the quality of life is impaired.</description>
