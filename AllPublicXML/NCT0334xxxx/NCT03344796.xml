  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal is to prevent ultraviolet light (UV) overexposure by providing consumers with
      relevant, easy-to-access, specifically actionable information. This research proposal will
      develop a UV protection system consisting of an automated real-time counseling framework and
      a personal dosimeter that overcomes barriers to consumer adoption. These new, wearable
      sensors take the form of small (&lt; 1 cm), thin (&lt;0.1 mm), lightweight (&lt;0.1 g), battery-free
      &quot;stickers&quot; that are fundamentally differentiated from other wearable electronics in their
      modes of use, cost structures and accuracy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed work is to refine and validate a UV protection system based on a dosimeter
      &quot;sticker.&quot; The key innovations of the system are automated personalized intervention
      messaging triggered by the exposure levels measured by a novel charge accumulation device
      applied to ultraminiaturized circuit forms. The research will validate the system's accuracy
      and acceptability to users, refine the device, and prove its robustness and efficacy in real
      world use cases. Successful completion of the research will yield a system to prevent
      excessive UV exposure and sunburn, thus reducing the incidence of skin cancer by equipping
      large numbers of general-population consumers and at-risk people to practice
      digitally-informed healthy sun behavior.

    <description>32 subjects
Focus group: It is expected that each participant will provide comments during the 2 hours of the focus group. It will take about one month to enroll the subjects. The audio files should be transcribed and the analysis completed in 60 days.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Usability testing</arm_group_label>
    <description>10 subjects
Usability test with structured interview: Each participant will use the sensor for 14 days and transmit data with the app installed on their mobile phone. It will take about one month to enroll the subjects. The analysis of the structured interview is completed in one week.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Cohort Study</arm_group_label>
    <description>100 subjects
Cohort study: It is expected that each participant will provide wear the sensor and transmit data for 90 days in the warm weather months of June-Aug. It will take about 3 months to enroll the subjects. Data analysis should be completed by February 2019.</description>
