  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers will compare the effects of lidocaine versus air, as a way to fill the breathing
      tube cuff which is gently inflated to hold in place the trachea (airway) during surgery. Air
      is the traditional method used to inflate the breathing tube cuff. Researchers wish to find
      if lidocaine works better than air to facilitate tolerance to the breathing tube (decreased
      coughing, sore throat, hoarseness). They also want to learn more about its effectiveness for
      this particular surgical intervention.

      At the induction of anesthesia, Participants will be breathing 100% oxygen via a face mask
      and then, become anesthetized according to a standard protocol and at the discretion of the
      attending anesthesiologist. Participants will be receive fentanyl, lidocaine and either
      succinylcholine or vecuronium to facilitate tracheal intubation. Laryngoscopy will then be
      performed and the trachea intubated with a standard cuffed ETT. Inflation of the ETT cuff
      will be performed in accordance with the randomization of either air or 1.8% lidocaine/0.76%
      solution until such time as there is no air leak around the tube when administering positive
      pressure to 20 cm H2O. Checking for intermittent leaks will be done by the CRNA every 30 min
      until the end of the surgery. Anesthesia will be maintained with volatile anesthetic with or
      without a Propofol infusion. Vecuronium will be used to maintain the ulnar nerve
      train-of-four at 0-3 of four twitches. Lungs will be mechanically ventilated with tidal
      volumes of 6-8 mL/kg to maintain end-tidalCO2 concentration at 30-35 mm Hg. Anesthesia
      maintenance will occur until the near end of the surgical procedure. The volatile anesthetic
      will be discontinued and Propofol will be initiated via a continuous infusion to facilitate
      transportation to the intensive care unit (ICU). After arrival to the ICU, Neuromuscular
      blockade will then be antagonized with neostigmine and glycopyrrolate, and the pharynx being
      gently suctioned under direct vision. Mechanical ventilation to be maintained until
      swallowing or spontaneous respiration begins, and then, converted to assisted manual
      ventilation. Extubation will be performed when all of the following criteria are met: 1) full
      reversal of neuromuscular block (ulnar nerve T4/T1 ratio 1:1, with sustained tetanus at 50 Hz
      for 5 s and no fade); 2) spontaneous ventilation; and 3) the ability to follow verbal
      commands (eye opening or hand grip) or demonstrate purposeful unilateral movement (attempting
      self-extubation); 4) demonstration of hemodynamic stability; 5) adequate hemostasis with
      combined chest tube output &lt; 100 ml/hour.

      The Participant then will be closely monitored as a 1:1 by the room nurse, and by other staff
      (respiratory therapist, and ICU fellows and consultants) for toleration of the ventilator
      (coughing, double triggering, &quot;bucking,&quot; etc.). on the cardiac surgical intensive care unit.
      Sedation amount will be recorded electronically once the patient lands in the ICU, until the
      time of extubation. The Registered Nurse (RN) will physically record &quot;yes,&quot; or &quot;no,&quot; on the
      form provided regarding the patient coughing, complaining of a sore throat or difficulty
      swallowing, having hoarseness or difficulty speaking.
