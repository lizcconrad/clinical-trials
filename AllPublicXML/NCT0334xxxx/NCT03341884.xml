    <measure>Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve (AUC) from 0 to Infinity (AUC0-inf) of Ipatasertib</measure>
    <time_frame>up to Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>AUC0-inf is defined as AUC extrapolated from Hour 0 to infinity of ipatasertib in the plasma.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of Ipatasertib</measure>

  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events.</description>

    <time_frame>up to Day 15</time_frame>

    <time_frame>up to Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from Hour 0 to the last measurable concentration of ipatasertib.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Half-life (t1/2) of Ipatasertib</measure>
    <time_frame>up to Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>Half-life of ipatasertib is the time elapsed for the drug concentration to decrease by half as determined by measuring drug concentration in blood samples over time.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Apparent Plasma Clearance (CL/F) of Ipatasertib</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>Apparent clearance (CL/F) of ipatasertib, where CL is clearance and F is bioavailability (relative amount of extravascularly-administered drug that reaches systemic circulation unchanged). Determined by measuring drug concentration in blood samples over time.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
