      This trial is a translational proof-of-concept, open-label, prospective cohort study of 60
      patients aiming to identify the clinical markers and/or biomarkers associated with
      therapeutic response to immune checkpoints inhibitors, in patients with advanced melanoma.

      The study will be conducted on a population of patients treated with ICI in the context of
      routine care, separated in two subgroups:

        -  Subgroup 1: patients treated with anti-PD-1 alone (nivolumab or pembrolizumab)

        -  Subgroup 2: patients treated with the combined treatment anti-PD-1+anti-CTLA-4
           (nivolumab + ipilimumab)

      For each included patient, tumor biopsy specimens and blood samples will be collected during
      baseline visit and during treatment period (at Week 6 Day 1 and Week 12 Day 1).

      All included patients will be followed-up for tumor status and/or survival status every 3
      months until a maximum duration of 1 year from the first study dose.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age ≥18 years at the time of study entry.

          2. Patient with histologically-proven metastatic and/or unresectable melanoma (stage
             IIIc-IV, M1a-c as per AJCC 2009), including mucosal melanoma.

          3. Patient for which a treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitor (nivolumab alone,
             pembrolizumab alone or nivolumab + ipilimumab) has been decided.

          4. Patient with at least one metastatic site accessible for biopsy at baseline.

          5. Subjects are included regardless of BRAFV600 mutation status. BRAFV600 mutation status
             must be documented.

          6. Patient must be naïve to immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment for locally advanced
             and/or metastatic disease (i.e., no prior treatment with ICI and current treatment
             with ICI not yet started).

          7. Measurable disease per RECIST 1.1.

          8. ECOG Performance status 0-2.

          9. Life expectancy of at least 3 months.

         10. Patient able to participate and willing to give informed consent prior to performance
             of any study-related procedures and to comply with the study protocol.

         11. Absence of any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition that
             potentially hampers compliance with the study protocol and follow-up after treatment
             discontinuation schedule.

         12. Patient affiliated to a Social Health Insurance in France.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient pregnant, or breast-feeding.

          2. Uveal melanoma.

          3. Any condition contraindicated with tumor sampling procedures required by the protocol.

          4. Any psychological, familial, geographic or social situation, according to the judgment
             of investigator, potentially preventing the provision of informed consent or
             compliance to study procedure.

          5. Any current severe or uncontrolled disease, including, but not limited to ongoing or
             active infection.

          6. Patient who has forfeited his/her freedom by administrative or legal award or who is
             under guardianship.
