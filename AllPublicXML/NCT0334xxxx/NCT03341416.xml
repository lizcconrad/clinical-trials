  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebellar ataxias are a group of disorders caused by cerebellar affections, for which
      currently no specific treatment is available. Some limited studies verified the effects of
      cerebellar transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on ataxic symptoms, with good results. The
      hypothesis is that cerebellar TMS could improve ataxic symptoms in some patients and in these
      patients, chronic cerebellar stimulation through deep brain stimulation could be a
      therapeutic option. The rationale is to stimulate the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum in
      order to balance the functional asymmetry observed between both motor cortices after chronic
      cerebellar lesions.

    <textblock>
      Ten patients with cerebellar ataxia will be included in our protocol. Ataxia might be due to
      several aetiologies, from degenerative to genetic and vascular diseases. The initial focus is
      vascular and spinal cerebellar ataxias. The participants will be submitted to a
      neuronavigation protocol for the precise location of the dentate nucleus contralateral to the
      most symptomatic side. After that, the participants will be randomly assigned to 5 active or
      5 placebo sessions of 1Hz TMS over the located area. After the first 5 sessions and a period
      of at least 4 weeks washout, the participants will cross over and receive other 5 sessions,
      active or sham. Clinical and video evaluations will be conducted before and after active and
      sham cluster of sessions. The good responders, i.e., with over than 30% of improvement after
      the active section will be eligible to bilateral dentate nucleus DBS. After that, again, a
      cross-over double blind on-off stimulation will be performed. Each period (on or
      0ff-stimulation) will last 4 weeks.

    <intervention_model_description>After surgery patients will undergo a first washout period intended to allow their ataxia return to baseline (preoperative levels), thus avoiding post surgery effects bias.
Phase 1: Participants will be randomized to either ON or OFF stimulation. The assigned stimulation will be performed for one week.
Phase 2: Open label phase. All patients are in the ON stimulation condition and will be followed for 6 months.
Duration:
Phase 1 will last from one to 2 months and phase 2 will last six months.</intervention_model_description>
