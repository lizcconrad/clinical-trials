  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of taking multiple doses of BMS-986177
      when aspirin is taken once-daily. Eligible participants will receive twice-daily doses of
      BMS-986177 or placebo, with a once-daily dose of aspirin. The safety, tolerability and
      movement of BMS-986177 into, through and out of the body (pharmacokinetics/PK) will be
      assessed, as will the effect of BMS-986177 on the PK of aspirin.
