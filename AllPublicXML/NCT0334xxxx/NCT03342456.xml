  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection is one of the important causes of gastrointestinal
      diseases, including gastritis, peptic ulcer, and malignancies, nd the eradication of Hp can
      effectively cure or prevent these diseases. Now, owing to the increasingly serious antibiotic
      resistance, Hp eradication rate is, however, becoming decreased. In order to improve the
      eradication rate of Hp, clinicians pay great attention to choose more effective treatment.

      Ilaprazole Enteric-Coated Tablets is a new generation of proton pump inhibitor (PPI).
      Previous research found that Ilaprazole had a more prolonged half-life and higher suppression
      of gastric acid secretion. In addition, its metabolism is not significantly influenced by
      CYP2C19, compared to the available PPIs. Doxycycline is in the tetracycline antibiotic class,
      has a stronger antibacterial force than tetracycline and its antibacterial spectrum is
      basically the same as tetracycline and doxycycline, so far, it is not widely used.
      Preliminary observations showed that Ilaprazole/Doxycycline-based quadruple therapy was
      effective in treating Hp infection, with less adverse reactions and good compliance with
      patients.

      In this study, a multi-center, randomized, parallel controlled trial will be conducted in 10
      hospitals in Hunan Province, China, to observe the clinical efficacy and safety of the
      Bismuth-containing quadruple therapy with Ilaprazole, Doxycycline, Furazolidone and Bismuth
      Potassium Citrate in the treatment of Hp infected duodenal ulcer. It is expected to complete
      240 effective cases, including 120 cases in the experimental group and 120 cases in the
      control group.
