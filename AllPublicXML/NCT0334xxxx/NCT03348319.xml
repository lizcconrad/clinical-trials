  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Limited pancreatic resections are increasingly performed, but the rate of postoperative
      fistula is higher than after classical resections. Pancreatic segmentation, anatomically and
      radiologically identifiable, may theoretically help the surgeon removing selected anatomical
      portions with their own segmental pancreatic duct and thus might decrease the postoperative
      fistula rate. Current pancreatic segmentation theories do not enable defining
      anatomical-surgical pancreatic segments. To our knowledge, no study has tried to describe
      pancreatic segmentation from the divisions of the pancreatic ducts to date. Hence, we
      hypothesize to explore the possibility of pancreatic segmentation following pancreatic ducts,
      using extensive reconstructions of pancreatic duct using micro-scanner on injected human
      pancreas.

      -  In a first step, the injection technique will be developed (dilution, stability,
           hardening of the contrast mixture).

        -  In a second step, we will inject the mixture in human pancreas: into the duct tree, the
           vein and arteries. After hardening, the human pancreas will be removed from cadavers
           following the organ donation technique. The anatomic specimens will be scanned in the
           laboratory UMR CNRS 7369 MEDyC, Reims (Pr X. MAQUART, Dr J. DEVY).

        -  The images obtained (Dicom format) are very big in term of file size. Analysis of the
           images will be performed using a supercomputer of the laboratory CReSTIC - ROMEO EA
           3804, Reims (Dr A. RENARD, Pr M. KRAJEKI). 3D reconstructions will be performed.
