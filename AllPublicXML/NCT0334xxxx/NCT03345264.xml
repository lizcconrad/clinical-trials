  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Concerns with sexual health and fertility are common among cancer patients, survivors and
      their partners. Literature reviews suggest that over 60% of survivors have reproductive
      health problems yet fewer than 20% get professional help. This study will test the uptake,
      use and effectiveness of online, interactive self-help programs for men and women with
      cancer. Participants in the study will receive up to 6 months of access to the self-help
      programs without charge. Navigation through the programs can be personalized by setting goals
      and following links to the most relevant information. The programs cover all cancer sites and
      common treatments, explaining sexual and fertility side effects. Programs also include
      step-by-step cognitive behavioral self-help exercises, guidance on available medical
      treatment options, decision aids, and video stories with actual survivors as well as
      vignettes with actors. Information for same-sex couples is included. Programs include
      suggestions on how partners can work together to cope with sexual or fertility issues.

      The primary hypothesis is that participants will report improvements in sexual function and
      satisfaction from baseline to 3-month follow-up. Secondary hypotheses will investigate
      whether more extensive use of the program is associated with better outcomes (dose-response
      effect) and whether the intervention also improves secondary outcomes such as anxiety,
      depression, relationship satisfaction, and seeking medical help. Analyses from the data will
      investigate how many people who are informed of the study decide to participate (uptake), as
      well as how often participants visit the program and which parts are used most. Both the male
      and female programs have previously been shown to help cancer survivors and partners in
      published clinical trials.

      Participants will be encouraged to invite a sexual partner to join the study, but that will
      be optional. Partners will be able to be linked for statistical analysis through their unique
      study identification numbers. Participants' use of the websites will be electronically
      tracked and compared with questionnaire outcome measures. Outcome measures include online,
      self-report questionnaires completed at baseline and 3-month follow-up. At 6-month follow-up,
      participants will complete 2 online ratings of the helpfulness of the programs. Privacy and
      security are carefully protected. The entire website meets standards for HIPAA (Health
      Insurance Portability and Accountability Act). Questionnaires are identified with study
      numbers rather than names or email addresses. Once the study data are analyzed, the list
      linking participant identifying information (names, email) and study numbers will be
      destroyed. Any publications resulting from the study will discuss group data and will not
      contain any information that could be used to identify an individual participant.
