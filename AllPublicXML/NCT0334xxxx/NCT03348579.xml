  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hospital-acquired pneumonia are a common disease in intensive care unit. The prevention, the
      diagnosis and the treatment of hospital acquired pneumonia are a frequent challenge.
      Nevertheless it seems that there are great differences in standard of care between hospitals.
      The investigators hypothesized that medical education and implementation of evidence-base
      guidelines can reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation in patients presenting of
      hospital acquired pneumonia

      A time series analysis design will be used. The before period (control phase) will consist of
      all consecutive patients admitted to the participating ICUs before the national guidelines
      publication concerning healthcare associated pneumonia.

      The second period will consist of all consecutive patients admitted to the participating ICUs
      after the publication of the national guidelines publication concerning healthcare associated
      pneumonia.

      Afterward, an interphase will occur during which all physicians, residents, physiotherapists
      and nurses will receive a formal training for the processes and procedures related to the new
      guidelines published in september 2017.

      The third and final period will consist of all consecutive patients admitted to the
      participating ICUs after the formal training.
