  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin D deficiency is a modifiable risk factor for poor bone health. Familial correlation
      of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration (25(OH)D) was reported in twin- or family-based
      studies, mostly from Caucasian parent-offspring pairs. However, data on the familial
      association of 25(OH)D in extended family structure and the relative contribution of genetic
      and shared environmental factors on serum 25(OH)D level are limited in Asian populations. In
      this study, the investigators aimed to assess the relative contribution of additive genetic
      and environmental components on serum 25(OH)D level by variance components method in a
      nationwide family-based cohort. Further, the investigators will evaluate the association of
      vitamin D status of index individual with prevalent vitamin D deficiency of each family
      member including spouse, offspring, sibling, and grand-offspring. Additive influences of
      paternal and maternal vitamin D status on offspring will be also investigated.

      From the Korean National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (KNHANES) conducted
      between 2008 and 2012, familial correlations for 25(OH)D will be estimated in different types
      of family relation pairs in 28551 subjects from 10882 families. The relative contribution of
      additive genetic and shared or individual environmental factors for variance of 25(OH)D level
      will be calculated using variance component method. Interactions between paternal and
      maternal vitamin D status for 25(OH)D level of offspring will be evaluated.

        This study was based on data from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination
        Survey (KNHANES) (IV-2, 3 and V), conducted from 2008 to 2012. The KNHANES is a nationwide
        cross-sectional survey performed by the Division of Chronic Disease Surveillance, Korea
        Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which assessed the health, nutritional
        status, and socioeconomic status of the non-institutionalized civilian population of South
        Korea. Subjects were selected using a stratified multistage clustered probability sampling
        design. Families, including at least two family members with serum 25(OH)D measurements and
        whose family relationships could be accurately identified were selected for the study.
        After the selection process, a total of 28,551 subjects from 10,882 families were included
        in our study.
