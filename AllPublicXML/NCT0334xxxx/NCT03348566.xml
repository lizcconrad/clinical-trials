  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      the investigators tested whether genetic variants near FADS cluster, which were recently
      identified to be signatures of adaptation to fish- and n-3 PUFAs-rich diet, interacted with
      these dietary factors on long-term change of body mass index (BMI).

        The Nurses' Health Study began in 1976, when 121,700 female registered nurses aged 30-55 y
        were recruited to complete a baseline questionnaire. the investigators included 11,323
        women of European ancestry. Informed consent was obtained from all participants.

        The Health Professionals Follow-up Study The HPFS was initiated in 1986, and was composed
        of 51,529 male aged 40-75 y at baseline. This study included 6,833 men whose genotype data
        were available. Informed consent was obtained from all participants.

        The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) is a large, multiethnic, 40-center study that focuses
        on strategies for preventing heart disease, breast and colorectal cancer, and osteoporotic
        fractures in postmenopausal women. 6,254 Caucasians women with European ancestry were
        included.

        The design of Singapore Chinese Health Study (SCHS): Between 1993 and 1998, 63,257 Chinese
        between 45 and 74 in Singapore were enrolled. 5,264 subjects with genotyping data were
        included in this analysis.
