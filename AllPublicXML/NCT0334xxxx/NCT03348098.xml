      NACT (Neoadjuvant chemotherapy) Increasingly widespread in clinical practice, there is still
      a substantial proportion of the patients NACT After failing to obtain ORR DCR , NACT Did not
      receive ORR DCR Patient access ORR DCR Patients have a higher risk of recurrence, and
      complete NACT The patient, the current standard therapy in the secondary stage of
      chemotherapy is no longer used, but non-ORR non-DCR After neo-adjuvant chemotherapy in
      patients with postoperative chemotherapy is worth exploring. Targeted drugs refer to
      interfere with tumor specific molecular processes and achieve inhibit or block the
      progression of drugs, its functioning is based on normal cells and tumor cells, differences,
      which makes the target specificity and side effects of the drug. Target drug is a pioneer in
      precision treatment of its interpretation of the individualized treatment based on the
      standard treatment. NCCN guidelines recommend paclitaxel in neoadjuvant chemotherapy is NACT
      first-line choice. At the Apatinib for dasatinib therapy in previous studies of breast cancer
      has a high level of performance, the Apatinib for dasatinib combined with paclitaxel in
      neoadjuvant therapy for breast cancer efficacy and safety is better than traditional
      treatments, is worthy of question.
