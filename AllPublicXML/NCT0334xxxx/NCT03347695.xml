    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation(AF) often occurs in patients with mitral valve disease. Both mitral
      replacement and mitral valve plasty are the effective methods to the mitral valve disease.
      How to cure atrial fibrillation is the key to full recovery. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in
      surgery is an effective treatment for those patients. But there are some recurrence rate of
      AF in RFA. So the investigators design a modified Cox-Maze procedure in surgery and study the
      outcome in order to prevent the recurrence rate.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      From September 2017, 60 consecutive patients with atrial fibrillation and mitral valve
      disease were treated with modified Cox-Maze operation.

      After a median sternotomy, cardiopulmonary bypass was established by standard aorta and
      inferior vena cava cannulation, whereas a bidirectional right-angle venous cannula was placed
      within the innominate vein. Myocardial protection was obtained multiple administration of
      cold blood cardioplegia. The superior vena cava was circumferentially mobilized from the
      pulmonary artery and pericardium and was transected at least 3 cm cephalad to its entry into
      the right atrium. Two circular incisions were performed in the left atrial wall between the
      pulmonary veins and the mitral annulus. The first one was made in the right atrial free wall,
      about 5 mm inside the right pulmonary veins an parallel to the interatrial groove, and
      extended around the pulmonary veins. The second incision was made in the interatrial groove
      and extended around the posterior mitral annulus (leaving about a 2 cm margin from the
      annulus). with those two incisions, a circumferential ban of the left a trial wall with the
      base of the left atrial appendage was excised. All the resected margin of the left atrium was
      thoroughly cauterized to prevent bleeding from the small vessels of the epicardial tissue.
      Finally,the resected margin around the mitral annulus was directly anastomosed to the remnant
      posterior left atrium wall including the pulmonary veins. If there was enlarged in right
      atrium, right atrium Cox-Maze procedure was performed as per usual standard.

      Telephone contact was maintained with the patients after discharge.The use of antiarrhythmic
      medications was allowed during the first 3 months(blanking period). 12-lead
      electrocardiograms, and 24-hour Holter-monitor recordings were obtained at baseline and at 3,
      6, 9,12 and 18 months after the initial operation. Whenever the participants had symptoms
      such as palpitation, dizziness, or shortness of breath, they should telephone the doctors.

      The primary end point is freedom from any documented episode of atrial fibrillation lasting
      longer than 30 seconds and occurring after the operation.The secondary end point are the
      survive rate, complication, reoperation rate, security index perioperatively, life quality
      postoperatively. Statistical analysis were performed with statistic package for social
      science( SPSS) 11.5 software. A value of P &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
