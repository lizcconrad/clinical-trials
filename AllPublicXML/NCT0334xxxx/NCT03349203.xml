    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the pulmonary and metastases lesions objective
      response rate after Icotinib preoperative therapy in EGFR-mutant stage IIIB or
      oligometastasis Non-small Cell Lung Cancer which can be potentially radical treated by
      surgery.

    <textblock>
      Patients with EGFR-mutant stage IIIB or oligometastasis Non-small Cell Lung Cancer which can
      be potentially radical treated by surgery are arranged to receive Icotinib with a dose of 125
      mg three times per day orally for 8 weeks as neoadjuvant therapy; then they receive surgical
      resection of the tumor. If there is curative effect of Icotinib according to the RECIST or
      pathological report, the patients will continue receive Icotinib for two years as adjuvant
      therapy after surgery or till progressive disease or unaccepted toxicity. The primary
      objective of this study is evaluate the pulmonary and metastases lesions objective response
      rate after Icotinib preoperative therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histology or cytology confirmed Non-small Cell Lung Cancer; EGFR mutation (EGFR 19del
             and/or 21L858R) detected by tumor tissue biopsy of primary lesion or metastatic lesion
             or plasma ctDNA

          -  No previous anti-tumor treatment such as surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy or
             biological therapy

          -  Stage IIIB or IV Oligometastasis Non-small Cell Lung Cancer. (a) stage IV
             Oligometastasis: the metastasis organ mainly include: 1. adrenal metastasis which can
             be potentially resected by surgery or radically treated by SRS radiotherapy; 2. brain
             metastasis which can be potentially resected by surgery or radically treated by SRS
             radiotherapy. At the same time, the primary lesion of the lung can be completely

             pneumonia requiring hormone therapy or any active intersexual lung disease with
