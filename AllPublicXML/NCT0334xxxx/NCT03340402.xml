      This research study is studying an intervention as a possible treatment for Triple Negative
      Breast Cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Pilot Study, which means this is the first time investigators are
      examining this study intervention in participants with triple negative breast cancer.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved proton radiation for your
      specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.

      The investigators believe that proton radiation administered in higher doses over a shorter
      time period may help stop cancer from growing while protecting the normal tissue cells.

      In this research study, the investigators are researching how well proton radiation works in
      treating this type of breast cancer. Proton radiation is currently used in other types of
      breast cancer and the investigators believe that the higher doses of proton radiation
      administered over a shorter time period may lead to maximum efficacy in treating this type of
      breast cancer.

    <description>Accelerated partial breast irradiation using proton beam scanning will consist of;
5 daily treatments using custom prone patient immobilization, contrast-enhanced CT planning, and daily image guidance
Radiation therapy may be delivered with photons if proton treatments cannot be delivered
Dose will be prescribed such that the gross tumor (GTV) receives the prescription dose per institutional policy and standard of care
Daily target localization will also be confirmed using AlignRTTM</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age at least 40 years

          -  Core biopsy proven estrogen negative (&lt; 1%), progesterone negative (&lt; 1%), and
             HER2-neu negative (+1 by immunohistochemistry and/or FISH ratio &lt; 2.0) invasive breast
             cancer

          -  Unicentric AJCC 7th edition T1N0M0 tumor measuring no greater than 2.0 cm in longest
             dimension on initial imaging with either breast MRI and/or mammogram

          -  ECOG Performance status &lt; 1

          -  No prior treatment for this diagnosis of cancer

          -  No prior radiation to the ipsilateral breast, a history of contralateral breast

             radiation therapy

          -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

          -  Pregnant females are excluded. Female subjects of childbearing potential must indicate

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Multicentric breast cancer, defined as discontiguous tumors separated by at least 5 cm
             of uninvolved tissue or discontiguous tumors that are located within separate breast
             quadrants either clinical or mammographically.

          -  Multifocal breast cancer, defined as discontiguous discrete foci of invasive
             carcinoma, separated by uninvolved intervening tissue, but within an overall span of 5

          -  Medical condition including but not limited to ongoing or active infection or
