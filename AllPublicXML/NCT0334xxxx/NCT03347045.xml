  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trimodal prehabilitation is a preoperative three-tiered (trimodal) approach to optimizing
      physical and mental health. It has been found to successfully improve functional recovery in
      patients undergoing colorectal surgery following an evidence-based enhanced-recovery pathway
      (ERP). It is unknown whether the same program is effective in patients undergoing a similar
      surgery for bladder cancer (radical cystectomy).

      Objective: To evaluate the appropriateness of a standardized prehabilitation program for
      implementation into an enhanced recovery pathway for cystectomy patients and determine
      whether prehabilitation facilitates earlier recovery of functional capacity.

      Hypothesis: Prehabilitation will ultimately improve recovery of functional capacity, clinical
      and patient-centered outcomes in patients undergoing radical cystectomy for bladder cancer.

      Design: Participants will follow an 8-week trimodal prehabilitation program consisting of
      exercise therapy combined with nutritional counseling, protein supplementation, and
      psychological care; they will be compared to a cohort of participants following ERP care
      alone.

      Conclusion: The proposal will provide insight into the feasibility and effectiveness of
      trimodal prehabilitation for radical cystectomy patients and may ultimately lead to improved
      clinical outcomes and reduced morbidity.
