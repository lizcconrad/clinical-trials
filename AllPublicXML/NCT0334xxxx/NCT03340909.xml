      Objective: The primary objective of this trial is to investigate whether prednisolone
      improves symptom severity as compared to placebo when given in addition to antipsychotic
      medication to patients with early-stage psychotic disorder. Secondary objectives include
      improvement of cognitive functioning and positive, negative and general psychopathological
      symptoms as well as general functioning.

      Study design: Randomized placebo-controlled double-blind trial. Study population: 90 men and
      women, with an age of 18 years and older, diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum disorder. The
      time interval between the onset of psychosis and study entry should not exceed five years and
      CRP level should be at least 3.9 mg/L.

      Intervention: Patients will be randomized 1:1 to either prednisolone or placebo daily for a
      period of 6 weeks. Identical tablets will be administered. Prednisolone will be initiated at
      40 mg for three days, after which it will be phased out within 6 weeks after start, following
      current treatment guidelines.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: Primary outcome is change in symptom severity, expressed as
      a change in total score on the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) from baseline to
      end of the 6-week treatment. Secondary outcomes are a 6-month follow-up assessment of PANSS,
      cognitive functioning (measured through a repeatable neurocognitive battery, change in GAF
      scores and the measurement of various immunological biomarkers. In post-hoc analyses,
      attempts will be made to identify baseline blood markers with predictive properties regarding
      improvement in the anti-inflammatory drug treatment arm.

      Expected benefits for consumers and care givers:

      A decrease in symptom severity is expected, as low grade brain inflammation may be associated
      with psychotic symptoms. The results may give raise to a new line of scientific research as
      well as treatment options for a disabling disorder.
