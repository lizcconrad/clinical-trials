  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe aortic stenosis remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality of the elderly
      affecting approximately 3% of elderly patients with an increasing number of patients
      undergoing transcatheter aortic valve interventions. As part of pre-procedural planning these
      patients undergo CT scans and receive contrast during the procedure. These patients often
      have baseline renal insufficiency and are high risk of contrast induced nephropathy despite
      pre-hydration techniques. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of this
      simple and safe procedure in preventing renal injury in this particular population.

    <description>Assess the effects on post procedure renal injury. Lab work will be obtained in the form of a basic metabolic panel evaluating the creatinine level. A baseline basic metabolic panel will be obtained prior to scheduled procedure to evaluate baseline renal function and then 48-72 hours post procedure, the optimal time to see the effects of contrast induced nephropathy to evaluate the degree of acute kidney injury. The baseline and post procedure measurements of renal function will be compared between both arms of the study.</description>

    <description>The patient's electronic medical record will be reviewed at 6 months post procedure. The investigators will be assessing renal function at 6 months if a creatinine (lab) was ordered by the primary provider for any reason.</description>
