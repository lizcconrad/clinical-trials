    <textblock>
      This study seeks to evaluate the safety, acceptability and feasibility of an outpatient &quot;day
      procedure&quot; for medical abortion at 13-18 weeks gestation. The study regimen will consist of a
      single dose of 200 mg mifepristone to be taken orally either at home or at the hospital,
      followed approximately 24 - 48 hours later with administration of 400 mcg misoprostol. Repeat
      doses of 400 mcg (two tablets) of misoprostol will be administered buccally every three hours
      until the abortion is achieved.
