      The purpose of this observational study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of
      biosimilar Infliximab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis(RA) in Jordan where no visits or
      intervention(s) additional to the daily practice will be performed

    <textblock>
      A multi-center, observational, prospective, cohort study to assess the safety and
      effectiveness of biosimilar Infliximab (Remsima®) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in
      Jordan. Biologic naïve patients will receive Remsima® in accordance with standard medical
      care and the approved label and will be followed over a period of 34 weeks (8.5 months).
      Outcomes including occurrence of adverse events (AEs), mean changes in disease activity and
      health assessment in each cohort will be measured and compared

    <time_frame>8.5 months, changes between baseline and last visit will be compared between visits using repeated measure analyses</time_frame>
    <description>The Disease Activity Score (DAS) measures the disease activity in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). DAS28 is a validated simplified tool in which twenty-eight joints are measured.
Patients will be asked to make a global assessment of disease activity on a 100 mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) measured by units on scale.
Number of swollen and tender joints, Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate and global assessment of disease activity on a 100 mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) are then fed into a complex mathematical formula to produce the overall disease activity score.
The DAS28 provides a number on a scale from 0 to 10 indicating the current activity of the RA of the patient. A DAS28 above 5.1 means high disease activity whereas a DAS28 below 3.2 indicates low disease activity. Remission is achieved by a DAS28 lower than 2.6.</description>

    <measure>Mean changes in Disability Index of the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ-DI)</measure>
    <time_frame>8.5 months, changes between baseline and last visit will be compared between visits using repeated measure analyses</time_frame>
    <description>The Health assessment questionnaire disability index (HAQ-DI) is a questionnaire for the assessment of Rheumatoid Arthritis. The reported data from patients include the amount of difficulty they have in performing some of their activities. Each question asks on a scale ranging from 0 to 3 if the categories can be performed without any difficulty (scale 0) up to cannot be done at all (scale 3).</description>
