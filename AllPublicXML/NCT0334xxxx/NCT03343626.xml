  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of two
      doses of purified inactivated Zika virus vaccine (PIZV) given 28 days apart. Three different
      vaccine doses containing different protein concentrations (2, 5 or 10 microgram [mcg]) each,
      will be given as 2 dose schedule to flavivirus naive and primed healthy adults. Participants
      will be followed for 7 days post each dose for tolerability and up to 6 months post dose 2
      for safety. Immunogenicity assessment will be performed at 28 days post each dose and 6
      months post dose 2. In addition, the selected dose group and control group will be followed
      till 24 months post dose 2 for safety and persistence of immunity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The vaccine being tested in this study is called PIZV or TAK-426 adjuvanted with aluminum
      hydroxide. The Zika virus vaccine is being tested to provide safety and immunogenicity data
      to enable the vaccine to be further developed clinically.

      The study will enroll approximately 240 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned
      (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the four groups-which will remain undisclosed to
      the study observer:

        -  Placebo

        -  PIZV: 2 microgram (mcg) Low Dose

        -  PIZV: 5 mcg Medium Dose

        -  PIZV: 10 mcg High Dose

      All participants will be administered either placebo or PIZV by intramuscular (IM) injection
      into the middle third of the deltoid muscle, preferably in the non-dominant arm on Days 1
      (Visit 1) and 29 (Visit 4).

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States and Puerto Rico. The overall
      time to participate in this study is up to 25 months. Participants will make multiple visits
      to the clinic on Days 1, 8, 29, 36, 57, 211, 393 and will be contacted by telephone on Day
      133 (Visit 7) and Day 575 (Visit 9) and also visit the clinic on Day 757 (Visit 11) depending
      on the study arm, for a final follow-up assessment.
