    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of sleep ergonomics guidance given by
      physiotherapist on pain and disability in patients with low back pain. In this randomized
      controlled trial participants are assigned either into the intervention or the control group.
      The intervention group will receive detailed instruction on sleeping ergonomics whereas the
      control group will only be instructed to avoid painful sleeping posture. The initial
      hypothesis is that in the intervention group pain and disability will decrease more compared
      to the control group.

    <description>Participants receive a detailed instruction in sleep ergonomics. Participants are instructed to maintain either side lying or supine sleeping posture, depending on which is less painful. Neutral position of spine supported by specific placement of body pillow. Changing of posture during sleep is prevented. The participants are recommended to replace their mattress if they feel that it is too hard or too soft. Instruction is given by a physiotherapist during one personal therapy session and the participants also receive a printed instruction.</description>
