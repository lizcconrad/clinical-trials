    <textblock>
      T-1101 is a novel anti-cancer agent being developed by Taivex Therapeutics Corporation, and
      is being studied in a phase I dose escalation trial, protocol TAI-001. That trial's primary
      aim is to study the safety and tolerability of T-1101 (Tosylate) in subjects with advanced
      refractory solid tumors, and provides for a maximum of 2 cycles of treatment. At the end of 2
      cycles of treatment, it is likely that some patients will be continuing to receive clinical
      benefit from T-1101 (Tosylate). The intention of this program is to enable these patients to
      continue to receive T-1101 (Tosylate) at the discretion of the principal investigators and
      Taivex Therapeutics Corporation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with advanced malignancy who are receiving T-1101 (Tosylate) in a previous
             Taivex Therapeutics Corp. sponsored study that has reached its endpoint, and who are,
             in the opinion of the investigator and/or sponsor, expected to continue to have an
             overall positive benefit/risk from continuing treatment.

          2. Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception prior
             to study entry and for the duration of study participation, including the 30 days
             period after last study drug dosing.

          3. Women of childbearing potential who have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days of
             the first dose of T-1101 (Tosylate) in this long term extension trial.

          4. Patients who have completed the End of Study assessments in their originating study.
             Every effort should be made to conduct the End of Study visit such that the patient
             does not have any interruption in T-1101 (Tosylate) dosing.

          5. Signed and dated informed consent document indicating that the patient has been
             informed of all the pertinent aspects of the trial prior to enrollment.

          6. Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans, laboratory
             tests, and other study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator and/or sponsor, could
             jeopardize the safety of the patient.

          2. Hypertension that cannot be controlled by medications (&gt;150/100 mmHg despite optimal
             medical therapy).

          3. Progressive or untreated metastatic brain or meningeal tumors.

          4. Pregnancy or breastfeeding. Male patients must be surgically sterile or must agree to
             use effective contraception during the period of therapy. Female patients must be
             surgically sterile or be postmenopausal, or must agree to the use of highly effective
             contraception during the period of therapy. Highly effective method of birth control
             is defined as one that results in a low failure rate (i.e. less than 1 percent per
             year) when used consistently and correctly, such as implants, injectables, combined
             oral contraceptives, intra-uterine devices (IUDs), sexual abstinence, or a
             vasectomized partner.

          5. Substance abuse, psychological or social conditions that may interfere with the
             patient's participation in the study or evaluation of the study results.
