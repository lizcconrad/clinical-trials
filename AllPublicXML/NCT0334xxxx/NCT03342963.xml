    <textblock>
      To investigate the bioequivalence of aripiprazole between administration of one ASC-01 tablet
      (aripiprazole 3 mg/sertraline 100 mg combination drug) and concomitant administration of one
      aripiprazole 3-mg tablet and two sertraline 50-mg tablets (Cohort 1).

      To investigate food effect on plasma pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and sertraline by
      single oral administration of ASC-01 under a fasting or fed condition (Cohort 2).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male subject at the age between 20 and 40 at the time of informed consent

          -  Subject has a body mass index (BMI = body weight [kg]/height [m]2) of â‰¥18.5 and &lt;25.0
             kg/m2 at screening

          -  Subject is providing consent for participation in this trial in writing prior to the
             start of the procedures related to this trial, and judged by the investigator or
             subinvestigator to be capable of observing procedures in this trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has a clinically significant abnormality in physical findings at screening or
             in medical history that in the investigator's or subinvestigator's opinion may place
             the subject at risk or interfere with outcome variables including drug absorption,
             distribution, metabolism, and excretion.

          -  Subject is judged by the investigator or subinvestigator to be inappropriate for
             participation in this trial.
