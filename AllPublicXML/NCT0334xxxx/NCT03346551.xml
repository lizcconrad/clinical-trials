      The specificity of postnatal depression (PND) was acted as full entity within the
      depressions, by B. Pitt in 1968, through the description of a specific nosography which
      describes &quot;an atypical depression of the post-partum &quot;.

      Actually, the epidemiological studies agree on prevalence from 10 to 15 % of PND. With two
      peaks of frequency, the first one around the 6th and 12th week comment native and the second
      during the second half-year. This rate of PND represents in France 75000 to 100000 women a
      year.

      The professionals of the perinatal period are interested in this disorder because of the
      consequences for the woman herself, and of the impact on the premature interactions
      mother-baby. These interactions and the direct effects of the PND on the mother will have for
      influence an important slowing down on the development of the baby. Moreover, the study of
      Lemaitre and Candilis in 1999, brings the figure of 15 % of the PND which will have an impact
      on the development of the baby.

      The sensation of the depression testifies of a process of change and of psychic conflict
      favored by the psychic transparency of the pregnancy.

      Although the first treaty on this specific nosography dates more than 150 years of numerous
      questions stay suspends it.

      These questions and the reflections which surround them found on their path tools ensuing
      from the theory of the attachment, formalized by John Bowlby. For more than three decades,
      these profiles of attachment, specified by Mary Ainsworth: secure, anxious-ambivalent,
      anxious-avoided and disorganized later, disrupted, is studied, estimated and their evolution
      during a life is observed. Thanks to these models well known for the same person at a time t,
      it is now their effects in the interpersonal relations which are studied. Between the people
      but also on the person himself, its image of her, and its autobiographical memory.

      The autobiographical memory represents a central component of the human memory. At a very
      general level, it's possible to define it as the capacity of a person to remember its past
      experiences. The review of the literature on the functioning of the episodic autobiographical
      memory during the depression highlights three main results: the too bi generalization of the
      memories, the congruence in the humor and the frequency of the intrusive memories
      characterized by an involuntary reminder, fast and effortlessly (Lemogne and al., 2006;
      Lemogne and al., 2012). The authors specify that there are links between strategies of
      avoidance of the intrusive memories and the phenomenon of generalization. These links ask to
      be explored within a model integrating, self and episodic autobiographical memory in the
      field of the depression. The use of the memories defining the one could allow to study more
      specifically this kind of memories. The memories defining the one were introduced to Ape and
      Moffitt (1991) to characterize a specific category of autobiographical memories. The memories
      defining the one are important personal memories which help a person to understand whom this
      person is as individual. In a way, they build the life story and support the personal
      identity. Connected to other similar memories, the self-defining memories contain numerous
      sensory details and are often associated to a strong emotional charge. They are also
      connected to long-term purposes, to concerns or to unsolved conflicts.

      Recent studies used the self-defining memories (French version adapted by Mr van der Linden's
      team, Switzerland) as tool to understand better the psychological disorders from which
      certain people suffer. The studies show that the self-defining memories undergo modifications
      the characteristics of which are in connection with every pathology (works of the team of
      J.M. Danion).

      In 1994, Moffit and al. studied a group of students with evaluation of the depressive
      symptomatology. They established that the presenting subjects of high scores of depression
      develop more generalized memories than the other participants when is asked to them a
      self-defining memorie positive. For the memories with negative valence, no difference is
      found among the tested students. There are no data in the literature on the self-defining
      memories and the postnatal depression. Besides, there is only a single search, not published
      which explores the links between the attachment and the memories defining the one (Tagini,
      Conway and Meins, looks for not published, quoted by Conway, to Ape and Tagini, on 2004). The
      authors present the results according to the styles of attachment. So, autobiographical
      memories would vary according to the cognitive and emotional dimensions, in connection with
      differences in the style of attachment. In every style of attachment would correspond certain
      specificities in the contents and in the form of the self-defining memories.

      In this context, it seems important to look for if there are specificities concerning the
      profiles of attachment and the self-defining memories at the patients suffering from
      postnatal depression. Especially as the current literature approaches only little this
      subject of public health.

      To analyze these specificities, two groups (group postnatal depression versus group control)
      will compare by estimating the type of maternal attachment and theirs self-definig memories,
      without omitting to look for a possible psychiatric pathology, and a personality problem at
      the mother.

      The main objective of this study will be to highlight specificities of the style of
      attachment and the personal identity in the postnatal depression.

      The secondary objectives of this study will on one hand be to look for the existence of links
      between the various clinical variables in the postnatal depression.

      And on the other hand to look for psychological and clinical factors which can be markers of
      vulnerability and\or factors of protection of the depression comment native (comparison
      between both groups of subjects).

      The participation to this study will be proposed to all the women of both centers, throughout
      the inclusion. Those who will have accepted will fill a scale Edinburgh Post-natal Depression
      Scale (EPDS). The score which will decide in which group women will be assigned :

        -  &lt; 11 group control

        -  &gt; 11 group PND The specific visit in the study will take place in a identical way for
           the cases and the witnesses.

      The patients will be seen at first by a doctor a child psychiatrist who will make a data
      collection sociodemographic and clinical and the signing of various questionnaires : Mini
      International Neurospychiatric Interview (MINI), Adult Attachment Narratives (AAN), Camir
      scale and Perceived Social Support Questionnaire (QSSP).

      Secondly, the patients will be seen by a psychologist to pursue the clinical evaluation
      (Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Beck Depression Inventory and self-esteem scale (EES), Scale
      of vocabulary (MILL-HILL) and to realize the signing of the questionnaire of the
      self-defining memories.
