      Target population:

      Patients with (1) newly diagnosed or (2) past history of pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas
      (PPGL) or (3) carrier of genetic mutations in known PPGL susceptibility genes.

      International multicenter prospective cohort study with randomized intervention (special care
      follow-up vs. standard care follow-up).

      All patients will receive instructions about follow-up at the time point of study inclusion.
      Patients randomized to the standard care follow-up group will be advised to return annually
      for follow-up according to current routine practice (without active re-scheduling). In
      contrast, patients randomized to the special care follow-up group will also be advised to
      return annually for follow-up but these patients will be actively invited, re-scheduled and
      reminded by the centers to meet scheduled follow-up appointments.

      The long-term goal of the research planned under this protocol is to reduce morbidity and
      mortality of patients with PPGLs by improving approaches for management, follow-up and
      therapy of affected patients. As a first step towards attaining this goal, the primary
      objective of this protocol is to investigate whether standardized follow-up results in
      improved long-term outcome in terms of less morbidity and mortality as compared. The central
      hypothesis is that pro-active, structured and periodic disease screening and management of
      patients at risk for developing PPGLs and other neoplasms can lead to earlier detection of
      tumors and reduce adverse outcomes associated with cardiovascular, metabolic and oncologic
      complications of the tumors than standard care follow-up. The underlying rationale is that
      establishing improved outcomes for patients at risk for PPGLs will enable evidence-based
      recommendations for disease follow-up and management, thereby establishing wider acceptance
      and use of outlined practices with ensuing improvements in the health and quality of life of
      affected patients and their families.

      In addition to the primary objective directed at establishing whether standardized and
      structured follow-up of patients with an increased risk for new events of PPGL (recurrent
      tumor, new tumor, or metastases) will result in improved longterm outcome, this protocol will
      enable several secondary objectives to be addressed using clinical (e.g. age, mode of
      presentation), biochemical, metabolic and genetic characteristics. These include:

        1. to identify prognostic markers of disease progression

        2. to assess whether clinical presentation, cardiovascular, metabolic and biochemical
           phenotype, genetic background and tumor characteristics (location, size, recurrence,
           pathology) are useful for development of personalized follow-up strategies.

        3. to investigate whether standardized follow-up affects quality of life

    <intervention_model_description>To provide evidence whether strict follow-up will result in improvement in clinical outcome parameters as compared to standard care follow-up, patients upon inclusion into the study protocol will be randomized into two groups:
Standard care follow-up group: Patients will receive an information leaflet (see appendix), which advises on recommended routine follow-up according to international guidelines.
Special care follow-up group: In addition to the information leaflet patients will be actively contacted by the clinical center to increase the likelihood that patients meet recommended follow-up schedules.
Stratification will be done for inclusion criteria (newly diagnosed PPGL, previous history of PPGL, gene carrier, presence of malignant PPGL and center).</intervention_model_description>
