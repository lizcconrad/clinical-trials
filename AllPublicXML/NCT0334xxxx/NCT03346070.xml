  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Sugammadex when
      administered according to actual body weight (ABW) as compared to ideal body weight (IBW) for
      the reversal of both moderate and deep neuromuscular blockade (NMB) induced by either
      Rocuronium or Vecuronium in morbidly obese participants. The primary hypothesis of this
      investigation is that, compared to obese participants dosed based on IBW, obese participants
      receiving Sugammadex according to ABW will demonstrate a faster time to recovery to a Train
      Of Four (TOF) ratio of ≥0.9 (i.e. faster NMB reversal), pooled across NMB depth and type of
      neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA; Rocuronium or Vecuronium) administered.

    <time_frame>Up to 30 minutes post-administration of study intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Following administration of study intervention, the time to recovery of participant TOF ratio to ≥0.9 will be assessed through the repeated application (every 15 seconds) of the TOF electrical stimulation protocol. Specifically, 4 electrical stimulations will be applied to the ulnar nerve and the magnitude of the twitch response of the adductor pollicis muscle (i.e. thumb twitch response) will be assessed. With T4 and T1 referring to the respective magnitude of the fourth and first thumb twitch during nerve stimulation, the T4/T1 ratio (i.e. TOF ratio) indicates the current degree of NMB present in the participant as a decimal from 0 (loss of T4 twitch) to 1 (no NMB).</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 30 minutes post-administration of study intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants experiencing treatment-emergent bradycardia will be identified with continuous ECG monitoring. Treatment-emergent sinus bradycardia is defined as a heart rate &lt;60 bpm that has also decreased more than 20% compared to participant baseline heart rate value, sustained for at least 1 minute after administration of study intervention.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Other Treatment-Emergent Cardiac Arrhythmia</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 minutes post-administration of study intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants experiencing other treatment-emergent cardiac arrhythmias will be identified with continuous ECG monitoring. Other treatment-emergent cardiac arrhythmias are defined as new or worsening arrhythmias (e.g., atrial fibrillation, atrial tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or ventricular tachycardia), sustained for at least 1 minute after administration of study intervention.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Experiencing an Adverse Event (AE) after Administration of Study Intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 7 days</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants experiencing an AE following administration of study intervention will be monitored. An AE is any unfavorable and unintended medical occurrence, symptom, or disease witnessed in a participant, regardless of whether or not a causal relationship with the study treatment can be demonstrated. Further, any worsening of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the study treatment is also considered an AE.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 7 days</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants experiencing an SAE following administration of study intervention will be monitored. An SAE is an adverse event that: results in death; is life threatening; results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity; results in or prolongs a hospitalization; is a congenital anomaly or birth defect; is a cancer; or may jeopardize the participant, potentially require medical or surgical intervention.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 7 days</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants experiencing an ECI following administration of study intervention will be monitored. ECIs are a discrete set of both AEs and SAEs, specifically designated as such for the trial. For the purposes of this investigation, ECIs include the following: 1) drug-induced liver injury; 2) clinically-relevant arrhythmias, inclusive of bradycardia and tachycardia; and 3) instances of hypersensitivity and/or anaphylaxis.</description>

    <description>Following administration of study intervention, the percentage of participants experiencing prolonged (&gt;10 minutes) recovery to a TOF ratio ≥0.9 will be calculated. Recovery of the TOF ratio to ≥0.9 will be assessed through the repeated application (every 15 seconds) of the TOF electrical stimulation protocol. Specifically, 4 electrical stimulations will be applied to the ulnar nerve and the magnitude of the twitch response of the adductor pollicis muscle (i.e. thumb twitch response) will be assessed.

             relaxants or their excipients, or other medication(s) used during general anesthesia.

          -  Have received or are planning to receive toremifene within 24 hours before or within

             participation in the trial.

          -  Are currently participating in or has participated in an interventional clinical trial
             with an investigational compound (including any other current or ongoing trial with a
