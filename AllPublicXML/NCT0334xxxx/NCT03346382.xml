  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retrospective data analysis, all emergency medical services of the city of Zurich
      interventions due to epileptic convulsions during June 2013 and December 2014 have been
      analyzed regarding the type of drug used, its application mode and the application mode based
      success. Furthermore, children versus adults were compared. Continuous variables were
      summarized as mean ± standard deviation (SD) and also presented as median [minimum; maximum].
      Groups were compared using the independent samples t-test. P-values &lt; 0.05 are considered
      significant.

    <measure>Which drug (Midazolam versus Diazepam) better stops epileptic seizures in the pre-clinical setting</measure>
    <time_frame>follow up up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>In this retrospective trial, all Emergency Medical Services of the city of Zurich interventions due to epileptic seizures during June 2013 and December 2014 are analyzed regarding the two drugs (Midazolam or Diazepam) used, its application mode (intravenous, nasal, intramuscular, rectal) and the application mode based success. Data will be collected regarding these aspects in order to determine if one drug is better than the other one, and which application mode is the most efficient.
Furthermore, children versus adults are compared. Continuous variables are summarized as mean ± standard deviation (SD) and also presented as median [minimum; maximum]. Groups are compared using the independent samples t-test. P-values &lt; 0.05 are considered significant.</description>
