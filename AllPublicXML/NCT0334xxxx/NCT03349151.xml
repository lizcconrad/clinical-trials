      gastrointestinal complaints and patient's satisfaction.

      Two hundred uncomplicated singleton term pregnancies who had caesarean section under regional
      anaesthesia will be included in our trial. Patients will be randomized to a soft food diet
      (honey, skimmed cheese, soup, mashed potatoe, pudding, grissini) served on postoperative 2nd
      hour or whenever they wanted to eat on return to the ward. Thirty minutes after they eat
      their meal, nausea, vomiting, ileus and distention will be questioned. Participants will be
      provided with the visual analogue scale (VAS), which will be presented with a statement
      explaining what was intended to measure. Patient satisfaction before discharge from hospital
      will be recorded by the patient by using a 100-mm VAS (0= minimum satisfaction, 100= maximum
      satisfaction). Time to first flatus passage and defecation will be recorded after the
      caesarean section.

    <description>The primary outcome is patient satisfaction before discharge from hospital, measured using a scale called visual analogue scale (VAS). It is a 100-mm long scale with adjectival descriptions at both end positions. There will be a statement explaining what was intended to measure. Participants will be asked to mark the VAS on the second they of the surgery before they are discharged from the hospital. On this scale 0= lack of satisfaction from the timing of having their meal after the surgery 100= full satisfaction from the timing of their meal after the surgery.</description>
