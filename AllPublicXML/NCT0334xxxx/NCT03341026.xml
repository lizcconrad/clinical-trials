  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to investigate the clinical performance of the Metronom CGM
      system in patients with type 1 diabetes over a period of 14 days. In this study, the CGM
      sensor will be tested in an inpatient setting (meal/insulin test with frequent plasma glucose
      monitoring) at different days of wear-time. Sensor data will be compared to gold standard
      reference (Super GL2 analyser or YSI) and stability of sensor performance will be assessed
      over time. Additionally, safety and tolerability of the sensor will be investigated by
      regular assessment of the insertion site.
