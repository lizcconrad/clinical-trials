      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center, Phase II study of s.c.
      secukinumab 300 mg in approximately 100 randomized patients with overuse rotator-cuff
      tendinopathy without systemic inflammatory disease.

      The study consists of a 4-week screening period, a 2-week run-in period, a 12-week treatment
      period and a 12-week follow-up period after last treatment The population will consist of
      patients with unilateral overuse (non-systemic inflammatory) shoulder tendinopathy, 18 - 65
      years of age.

      Safety assessments will include physical examinations, ECGs, vital signs, standard clinical
      laboratory evaluations (hematology, blood chemistry, and urinalysis), adverse event and
      serious adverse event monitoring.
