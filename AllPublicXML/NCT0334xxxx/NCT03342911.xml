    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well nivolumab, carboplatin, and paclitaxel work in treating
      patients with stage III-IV head and neck squamous cell carcinoma that can be removed by
      surgery. Monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor
      cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin and paclitaxel,
      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by
      stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving nivolumab,
      carboplatin, and paclitaxel may work better in treating patients with head and neck squamous
      cell carcinoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate pathologic complete response (pCR) at the primary site in patients with newly
      diagnosed and untreated stage III-IVA squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) of
      the oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx, and hypopharynx with nivolumab, paclitaxel and
      carboplatin in addition to standard chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Safety. II. Complete pathologic response at all sites of disease. III. Major pathologic
      response rate at primary site. IV. Overall clinical response rate. V. Clinical complete
      response rate. VI. 1 year progression-free survival (PFS). VII. Overall survival.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore whether PDL1 expression is associated with treatment response. II. To explore
      whether there is a net change in the Th1/Th2 ratio (IFN-gamma, IL-4, IL10, etc.) or cell
      subset frequencies (M2 monocytes, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, etc.) within a patient's
      peripheral blood either at baseline or in response to treatment is associated with treatment
      response.

      III. To explore whether exosomes or other immune related serum biomarkers change after
      combination therapy.

      IV. To explore the predictive value of serial cell free deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) levels
      and response.
