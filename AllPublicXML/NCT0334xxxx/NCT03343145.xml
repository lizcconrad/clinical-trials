      A study to compare the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of Leucostim® to those of
      Neupogen® in patients with breast cancer intended to be treated with TAC regimen as a
      myelosuppressive chemotherapy.

    <textblock>
      TAC regimen (docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide) is recommended for the adjuvant
      treatment of breast cancer patients. The TAC regimen is known to lead to significant
      hematological toxicity and induces febrile neutropenia with a rate &gt; 20%. The use of primary
      G-CSF prophylaxis with the TAC regimen is recommended by guidelines. e.g., by the European
      Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer as well as by the guideline on myeloid
      growth factors of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network.6,7 This study is to compare the
      efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of Leucostim® to those of Neupogen® in patients with
      breast cancer intended to be treated with TAC regimen as a myelosuppressive chemotherapy.
