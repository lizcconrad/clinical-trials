  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aging population is at an exceptionally high risk of debilitating falls, contributing
      significantly to reduced independence and quality of life. It remains extremely challenging
      to screen for falls risk, and programs designed to mitigate falls risk have only modestly
      influenced the sizeable portion of the aging population experiencing one or more falls
      annually. Balance control in standing and walking depends on integrating reliable sensory
      feedback and on planning and executing appropriate motor responses. Walking balance control
      is especially dynamic, requiring active and coordinated adjustments in posture (i.e., trunk
      stabilization) and foot placement from step to step. Accordingly, using a custom, immersive
      virtual environment, the investigators have shown that sensory (i.e., optical flow)
      perturbations, especially when applied during walking, elicit strong and persistent motor
      responses to preserve balance. Exciting pilot data suggest that these motor responses are
      remarkably more prevalent in old age, presumably governed by an increased reliance on vision
      for balance control. Additional pilot data suggest that prolonged exposure to these
      perturbations may effectively condition successful balance control strategies. Founded on
      these recent discoveries, and leveraging the increase reliance on vision for balance control
      in old age, the investigators stand at the forefront of a potentially transformative new
      approach for more effectively identifying and mitigating age-related falls risk. The
      investigator's overarching hypothesis is that optical flow perturbations, particularly when
      applied during walking, can effectively identify balance deficits due to aging and falls
      history and can subsequently condition the neuromechanics of successful balance control via
      training.

      Specific Aim 1. Investigate sensory, motor, and cognitive-motor mechanisms governing
      susceptibility to optical flow perturbations. Aging increases the reliance on vision for
      balance control. However, central and peripheral mechanisms underlying aging and falls
      history effects on the susceptibility to optical flow perturbations are unclear. Hypothesis
      1: Entrainment to optical flow perturbations will correlate most strongly with visual
      dependence and decreased somatosensory function, alluding to an age-associated process of
      multi-sensory reweighting. Methods: Multivariate models will quantify the extent to which
      strategically-selected sensory (i.e., visual dependence via rod/frame test, somatosensory
      function), motor (i.e., rate of torque development, timed sit-to-stand) and cognitive-motor
      (i.e., interference) mechanisms underlie inter-individual differences in susceptibility to
      perturbations.

      Specific Aim 2. Estimate the efficacy of prolonged optical flow perturbations to condition
      the neuromechanics of walking balance control in older adult fallers. Pilot data from young
      adults suggests that prolonged exposure to optical flow perturbations may condition reactive
      strategies used to successfully control walking balance. The investigator's premise is that
      dynamic perturbation training can improve resilience to unexpected balance disturbances.
      Here, the investigators conduct a preliminary test of the effects of training with optical
      flow perturbations on walking balance in older adult fallers. Hypothesis 2: (a) Older adults
      with a history of falls will adapt to prolonged exposure to perturbations, conditioning their
      step to step adjustments in walking balance control, and (b) improving their response to
      unexpected balance challenges following training. Methods: In two 20 min sessions, on
      different days in a randomized cross-over design, older adults with a history of falls will
      walk with (&quot;treatment&quot; session) and without (&quot;control&quot; session) prolonged exposure to optical
      flow perturbations. The investigators will assess time-dependent changes in the
      neuromechanics of walking balance during training and after-effects via gait variability,
      dynamic stability, and performance on a series of real-world like targeting and obstacle
      avoidance tasks.
