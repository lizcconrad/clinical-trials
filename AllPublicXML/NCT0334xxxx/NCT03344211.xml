  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well enzalutamide with or without radium Ra 223
      dichloride in treating patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer that has spread to
      other places in the body. Enzalutamide is an androgen receptor inhibitor that may slow down
      the growth of prostate cancer by blocking the action of the male hormone testosterone and
      other male hormones called androgens. Radiation therapy uses high energy alpha particles to
      kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Enzalutamide with or without radium Ra 223 dichloride may
      work better in treating patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate changes in prostate cancer bone involvement induced by enzalutamide alone or
      in combination with radium Ra 223 dichloride (radium 223), specifically extent of prostate
      cancer infiltration, androgen receptor (AR) signaling and hormone levels, hematopoietic
      composition, apoptosis and proliferation.

      II. To evaluate the immune activation of enzalutamide alone, or with radium 223.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the adverse event profile for the combination in this patient population.

      II. Rate of undetectable prostate specific antigen (PSA) nadir, PSA and alkaline phosphatase
      changes, rate of symptomatic skeletal events at 12 months, and rate of PSA and radiographic
      progression at 12 months.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive enzalutamide orally (PO) daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive
      radium Ra 223 dichloride intravenously (IV) on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up
      to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive enzalutamide as in Arm I. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1.5 years.

             symptomatic or asymptomatic

          -  Castration resistance will be defined as the development of disease progression,
             defined as one of the following:

               -  Rising PSA x 2 values &gt;= 2 weeks apart; minimum absolute PSA value 2 ng/mL

                  level &lt; 50

          -  Men must have osseous metastases, but the presence of visceral metastases will not
             exclude patients from participation

               -  Prior external beam radiation therapy (&gt; 4 weeks prior to enrollment) for
                  palliation of osseous metastatic disease is allowed, provided there is at least

          -  No prior docetaxel or cabazitaxel chemotherapy for metastatic castration-resistant
             prostate cancer (mCRPC) (men treated with prior docetaxel administered as up-front
             therapy with androgen deprivation therapy [ADT] &gt; 6 months ago will be eligible);
             prior abiraterone is allowed

             elevated alkaline phosphatase, low hemoglobin, or elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior treatment with docetaxel or cabazitaxel for mCRPC

          -  Prior treatment with ARN-509 or enzalutamide (there is a grace period for men who wish
             to enroll and who have recently started enzalutamide for the first time but have taken
             less than 15 days of therapy)

               -  Concurrent use of androgen deprivation therapy aside from LHRH agonist or
                  antagonist (i.e. bicalutamide, flutamide, nilutamide, abiraterone, ketoconazole,
                  estrogen); there will be a 2 week wash-out period from the last dose of any of
                  these agents until the first dose of enzalutamide on study; patients who have
                  just started enzalutamide for fewer than 5 doses prior to enrollment in the trial
                  are still considered eligible and not subject to wash-out

          -  Concurrent oral corticosteroid use aside from adrenal replacement, or use of other
             immunosuppressive agents (ex: infliximab); topical or inhaled steroids will be allowed

          -  Received systemic therapy with radionuclides (e.g., strontium-89, samarium- 153,
             rhenium-186, or rhenium-188, or radium Ra 223 dichloride) for the treatment of bony
             metastases

          -  History of seizures except for remote with specific etiology which has resolved (ex:
             alcohol induced seizure); transient ischemic attack (TIA) or cerebrovascular accident
             (CVA) within last 6 months

          -  Known untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastases; leptomeningeal disease will
             be an absolute exclusion criterion due to limited life expectancy
