    <measure>Efficacy of Wilate in achieving complete or partial immune tolerance induction (ITI) success in moderate and severe haemophilia A patients with inhibitors</measure>
    <time_frame>A maximum period of 5 years from ITI start</time_frame>
    <description>ITI success will be determined using predefined success criteria based on the following variables: 1) Inhibitor titre assessed using the modified Bethesda assay; 2) Incremental in vivo recovery (IVR) of FVIII; 3) FVIII half-life up to 72 h following Wilate infusion.</description>

    <measure>Bleeding frequency while on Wilate ITI treatment</measure>

    <measure>Association of inhibitor titres with the probability of ITI success</measure>
    <time_frame>A maximum period of 5 years from ITI start</time_frame>
    <description>Inhibitor titre will be assessed at the start of and throughout ITI treatment using the modified Bethesda assay.
ITI success will be determined using predefined success criteria based on the following variables: 1) Inhibitor titre assessed using the modified Bethesda assay; 2) Incremental IVR of FVIII; 3) FVIII half-life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Use of bypassing agents before and during treatment with Wilate</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months before the start of ITI with Wilate to a maximum of 5 years from starting ITI with Wilate</time_frame>
    <description>Use of bypassing agents is at the discretion of the Investigator, either to treat bleeding or to provide prophylactic therapy. As long as the patient's inhibitor level is ≥0.6 Bethesda units (BU), treatment of BEs may, in addition to FVIII treatment, require the administration of activated prothrombin complex concentrates (aPCC) or recombinant FVIIa.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Relapse rate following complete or partial successful ITI using Wilate</measure>
    <time_frame>A maximum period of 5 years from ITI start</time_frame>
    <description>Reoccurrence of &gt;0.6 BU in at least 2 consecutive blood samples after having reached the prophylactic treatment phase; a further ITI initiation (re-start) with Wilate is at the discretion of the Investigator.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to relapse following complete or partial successful ITI using Wilate</measure>
    <time_frame>A maximum period of 5 years from ITI start</time_frame>
    <description>Time to reoccurrence of &gt;0.6 BU in at least 2 consecutive blood samples after having reached the prophylactic treatment phase; a further ITI initiation (re-start) with Wilate is at the discretion of the Investigator.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence with the ITI regimen</measure>
    <time_frame>A maximum period of 5 years from ITI start</time_frame>
    <description>During ITI, any injections of Wilate will be recorded in the patient study diary. The treating physician will review and verify the information provided by the patient.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety: adverse drug reactions (ADRs)</measure>
    <time_frame>A maximum period of 5 years from ITI start</time_frame>
    <description>ADRs will be documented.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety: infection-related adverse events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>A maximum period of 5 years from ITI start</time_frame>
