  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some of the liver transplantation recipients experience postoperative acute kidney injury due
      to various causes including genetic factors. Prevention of postoperative acute kidney injury
      is essential for postoperative care in liver transplantation recipients. The aim of this
      study is to investigate the relationship between gene polymorphisms and the occurrence of
      acute kidney injury after liver transplantation by performing genome-wide association study
      (GWAS).

    <measure>Acute kidney injury after liver transplantation</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed up during the first 72 hours post-liver transplantation in order to confirm the development of acute kidney injury.</time_frame>
    <description>The development of acute kidney injury is defined by the following definition: 50% increase in SCr from the baseline (preoperative value) or a 0.3 mg/dl increase from baseline within 48 h without urine output. The development of acute kidney injury after liver transplantation could correlate with gene polymorphisms, which have been known to be associated with postoperative acute kidney injury.</description>

    <description>Adult patients undergoing liver transplantation will be included and followed up during the first 72 hours post-liver transplantation in order to confirm the development of acute kidney injury. The patients will be divided into two groups (AKI group vs. non-AKI group) according to the development of acute kidney injury. The GWAS will be performed with the blood obtained from enrolled patients.</description>

    <description>In previous study performed in adult patients undergoing liver transplantation (NCT02489474, 4-2015-0411), we enrolled patients and collected data regarding the development of acute kidney injury during the first 72 hours post-liver transplantation. Among these patients enrolled in this previous study, only patients who agreed to additional use of the blood sample for research purposes will be included in the present study. The GWAS will be performed with the blood obtained from enrolled patients.</description>
