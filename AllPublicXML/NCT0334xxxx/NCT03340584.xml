    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a single-blind, randomized controlled trial of 100 patients
      with total knee replacement. Patients will be randomly assigned into a control group and an
      intervention group.Both groups received same rehabilitation procedures after surgery,except
      intervention group also received taping applications throughout all rehabilitation
      period.Then, the patients will be reevaluated to determine changes in lower extremity
      function, edema, pain,knee range of motion, and muscle strength of quadriceps femoris and
      hamstring.
