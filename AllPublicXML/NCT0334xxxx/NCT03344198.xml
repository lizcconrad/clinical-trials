  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will explore the capacity for a lifestyle modification in volunteer firefighters to
      improve blood pressure, blood vessel stiffness, inflammation, and reduce oxidative stress.
      The study will be a randomized controlled trial with three groups. The interventions will be
      a weekly circuit workout program including yoga practice, a Mediterranean diet, or a
      combination.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent statistics from the American Heart Association (AHA) have reported that &gt;92% of adults
      in the U.S. meet at least 1 metric for cardiovascular disease risk factors. In firefighters,
      this increased risk is especially concerning. The National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA)
      estimates there are around 1.3 million firefighters in the United States, 70% of which are
      volunteer. Every year, almost half of line-of-duty deaths (LODD) are cardiac-related, and the
      prevalence of impaired cardiovascular health is higher in firefighters than in the general
      population. It is known that exercise and diet mitigate cardiovascular disease risk. Meeting
      the physical activity guidelines remains a target of ideal cardiovascular health and a major
      public health concern. However, the NFPA does not require volunteer fire companies to have a
      fitness program for their crew, and sadly less than a third of the stations actually do. And
      importantly, cardiovascular-related LODD remains a major issue in the firefighter population.
      The results could guide clinical treatment for firefighters and may therefore reduce
      cardiac-related LODD.
