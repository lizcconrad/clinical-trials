  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Therapeutic compliance is defined as the degree of coincidence between a person's behavior
      and prescribing advice given by his or her physician. According to the World Health
      Organization (WHO), &quot;insufficient adherence is the main reason why patients do not get all
      the benefits they could expect from their medicines. It causes medical and psychosocial
      complications, diminishes the quality of life of patients, increases the likelihood of drug
      resistance, and waste of resources. &quot; In the case of certain conditions such as high blood
      pressure (hypertension), poor adherence increases the risk of stroke, acute coronary
      syndrome, and heart failure.

      In patients with uncontrolled hypertension under treatment, the issue of therapeutic
      non-compliance should always be considered before considering the dose (supplemental drug) of
      antihypertensive therapy.

      For each patient participating in the study, medication adherence (for one of the
      antihypertensive treatments) will be assessed for 2 months using an electronic pill. The
      antihypertensive treatments considered for the study belong to the following classes:
      diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium-blockers, ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors,
      sartans.

      Main objective: care objective: to provide physicians and patients with assistance in case of
      ineffectiveness or therapeutic escape in a chronic disease such as hypertension, by assessing
      the compliance profile of each patient.

      Secondary objectives: to carry out a quantitative typology of drug adherence in patients with
      unbalanced HTA under treatment.

    <description>This measure, though often close to the previous one, focuses on the dose actually received and is defined according to the reference: Vrijens B, Goetghebeur E. Comparing compliance patterns between randomized treatments. Control Clin Trials. 1997 Jun;18(3):187-203.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Drug Holidays</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months of follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>We define a &quot;drug holiday&quot; as a period of one or more days without drug intake (that is, without MEMS (Medication Event Monitoring System) opening). The statistic counts the number of gaps among the prescribed days, ignoring the length of each individual gap, according to the reference: Vrijens B, Goetghebeur E. Comparing compliance patterns between randomized treatments. Control Clin Trials. 1997 Jun;18(3):187-203.</description>
