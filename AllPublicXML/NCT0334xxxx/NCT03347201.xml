  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators will be comparing anticoagulation for Cardiopulmonary Bypass
      (CPB) guided by the Hemostasis Management System (HMS Plus) with the current dosing based on
      weight and ACT measurements.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether relative to patients with
      conventional management, those managed with the HMS Plus have improved thrombin generation
      after CPB.

      The secondary objective is to determine if patients in the HMS Plus group have reduced blood
      loss in the first 24 hours following surgery compared with patients in the conventional
      group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) allows cardiac surgery to be performed on a motionless,
      bloodless heart while maintaining circulation to the rest of the body. Anticoagulation with
      heparin prevents the body's clotting system from being activated when blood comes into
      contact with the walls of the bypass circuit. The amount of heparin given to achieve this
      effect is determined on a weight-based dosing and monitored with a point-of-care monitor
      called ACT (activated clotting time). However, there remains a high level of variability in
      the concentration of heparin in the blood and the ACT is affected by hypothermia and dilution
      of the blood, both of which commonly occur during CPB for cardiac surgery.

      The Hemostasis Management System (HMS Plus) offers an alternative way of dosing and
      monitoring heparin by aiming to achieve a pre-determined heparin concentration throughout
      CPB, rather than being determined by the ACT. It also aims to determine the dose of
      protamine, the drug used to reverse heparin at the end CPB, required based on residual
      heparin concentration rather than on a 1:1 ratio of the total dose of heparin given which is
      the common current practice. The benefits of using this system are proposed to be more
      effective anticoagulation during CPB meaning less of the body's reserves of clotting factors
      are consumed. This could mean potentially less bleeding and decrease requirement of blood
      products following surgery.

    <description>Initial heparin bolus before CPB to be calculated using HMS Plus.
Following commencement of CPB further heparin requirements will be determined using the HMS Plus. ACT's will also be checked whilst on CPB and if falls below 480 seconds, additional heparin will also be given.
Following cessation of CPB the dose of protamine required to reverse residual heparin will be calculated using the HMS Plus.</description>

    <description>Patients in the control arm will undergo routine heparin anticoagulation using a weight based initial dose of 400 units/kg, aiming for an ACT of &gt;480 seconds. Further heparin doses (5000 to 10000 units) will be given if the ACT falls below 480 seconds whilst on bypass. At the end of CPB heparin will be reversed with protamine using 1:1 ratio based on the initial dose of heparin given pre-bypass. HMS Plus measures will also be conducted in this group for study purposes, but the results will not be made available to the clinicians.</description>
