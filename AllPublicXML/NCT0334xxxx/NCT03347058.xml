  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As usage and indications for immunotherapy (IO) increase, there presents a critical need to
      identify patient-centered and practice solutions across the continuum of care. Immunotherapy
      &amp; Me is an innovative program of customizable resources that seeks to improve the patient
      experience by supporting the unique needs of both IO patients and the clinical staff who care
      for them. Cancer Support Community (CSC) will implement this operational framework of patient
      and provider tools at nine geographically and demographically diverse oncology practices. At
      the end of year one, CSC will evaluate program impact, retool interventions as necessary, and
      pursue additional funding with the goal extending services at existing practice sites - and
      scaling this turnkey model of IO treatment support.

      Through this program, participants will have access to:

      Digital Tools -

        -  My Tracker: An online service to help patients and/or caregivers manage their
           immunotherapy treatment. This online platform provides patients and/or loved ones with
           information about cancer immunotherapy and links to community-based resources and online
           and in-person support. My Tracker will also help patients record and monitor
           immunotherapy-related side effects so that the healthcare team can better support and
           manage care between medical appointments.

        -  CancerSupportSource® (CSS): A scientifically-validated, multi-question screener that
           provides direct links to CSC's Affiliate network and national Helpline for personalized
           referrals and psychosocial support services. CSS meets the distress and depression
           screening requirement for Oncology Care Model participants and the distress screening
           standard for the Commission on Cancer.

        -  E-Learning: Online learning courses designed to help patients and family caregivers be
           more informed and involved in immunotherapy treatment.

      Educational Resources -

      • Frankly Speaking About Cancer: Frankly Speaking About Cancer (FSAC) is an award-winning
      educational series that covers a comprehensive list of cancer topics from tumor-specific
      information and treatment to financial issues and information about participating in clinical
      trials. As part of Immunotherapy &amp; Me, patients and families will have free access to print
      and online resources to provide them with general cancer information, tumor-site specific
      (e.g., breast, prostate, lung) resources, and help them better understand their immunotherapy
      treatment and how to be active partners in their care.

      Person-to-Person Support -

        -  Cancer Support &amp; IO Helpline: This dedicated cancer-support Helpline is designed to
           assist patients with navigating their care. Patients and caregivers can call the
           Helpline to reach a mental health professional or registered nurse who can help answer
           questions about cancer treatment, symptoms and side effects, and financial questions, as
           well as provide emotional and decision-making support.

        -  CSC Affiliates: Pilot sites within CSC Affiliate service areas will have access to
           patient and caregiver support services and programs offered through their local CSC
           chapter.

        -  Cancer Experience Registry: An online community for people affected by cancer to share
           their cancer-related experiences with healthcare providers and healthcare policymakers.
