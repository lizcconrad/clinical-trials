    <textblock>
      Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI), including concussion, is a real public health problem.
      Indeed mTBI might induce long-term brain disorders with increased risk of neurodegenerative
      diseases and the healthcare costs can be significant for both the individual and the society.
      However mTBI is called the &quot;silent epidemic&quot;, because of the lack of research in this field
      in France as well as in the rest of the world. Most of the time, mTBI is associated with
      sports injuries, road traffic accidents and falls. The risk of neurodegenerative diseases is
      significantly increased with the repetition of mTBI, which may have a cumulative effect. In
      this context, playing football (or 'soccer') is associated with a high risk of concussion and
      with frequent head-ball contacts which are repeated during the training and matches.
      Moreover, football is the most popular team sport in the world, with more than 265 million
      players. The long-term impact of &quot;heading&quot; in football is still debated in the literature.
      Nevertheless, several studies suggest the possible emergence of early neurocognitive
      disorders. Otherwise, while mTBI is usually characterized by normal brain images using
      traditional neuroimaging techniques, microscopic anatomical changes might be detectable by
      new neuroimaging techniques. According to recent studies, cognitive dysfunctions could be
      based on these microstructural changes in the gray matter and white matter, secondary to the
      primary mechanical injury. Studies that have examined the structural changes in the brain
      white matter in football players are rare and lack of evidence regarding the consequences of
      accumulated brain impacts explains the lack of preventive measures in this sport. In
      addition, post-traumatic secondary lesions cause functional alterations of the neurovascular
      unit and its effect on cerebral perfusion may play a crucial role, which has never been yet
      explored in humans over the long term.

      In this research, the investigators will develop a unique multi-modal neuroimaging protocols
      to assess brain changes after minor head trauma and over the time. Investigators want to
      perform magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess cerebral blood flow using Arteria Spin
      Labelling (ASL), structural changes using Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), susceptibility
      weighted imaging (SWI), and functional changes using BOLD resting-functional MRI.
