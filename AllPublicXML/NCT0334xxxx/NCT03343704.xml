  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to demonstrate reversal of the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran in
      patients treated with dabigatran etexilate who have uncontrolled or life-threatening bleeding
      requiring urgent intervention, and in patients treated with dabigatran etexilate who require
      emergency surgery or other invasive procedure.

      The secondary objectives are to assess the reduction or cessation of bleeding, evaluate the
      clinical outcomes, safety and the pharmacokinetics of dabigatran in the presence of
      idarucizumab.

               -  Group A: Overt bleeding judged by the physician to require a reversal agent. OR

               -  Group B: A condition requiring emergency surgery or invasive procedure where
                  adequate hemostasis is required. Emergency is defined as within the following 8

        Exclusion criteria:

        Group A:

        Group B:

          -  A surgery or procedure which is elective or where the risk of uncontrolled or
             unmanageable bleeding is low.

          -  Contraindications to study medication including known hypersensitivity to the drug or
             its excipients (subjects with hereditary fructose intolerance may react to sorbitol).
