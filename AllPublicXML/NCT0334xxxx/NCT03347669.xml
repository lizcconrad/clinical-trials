  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia (FM) is characterized by chronic diffuse pain and affects 0.5 to 5% of the
      population, with a higher prevalence in women1. This condition is characterized by joint and
      muscle pain, also associated with fatigue, migraine, sleeps disorders, depression and
      irritable bowel syndrome2. The presentation of these various symptoms varies greatly from one
      patient to another, with great heterogeneity in clinical, physical, social, psychological and
      therapeutic responses. . A recent parliamentary inquiry report called for recognition of the
      disease and recommended to build a unified care path for patients; a collective expertise is
      led by INSERM to help in patient care. Faced with the heterogeneity of FM, several
      international studies have attempted to identify subgroups of patients based essentially on
      clinical symptoms of the disease3-8, including a recent Korean study of 313 patients9, which
      suggested four groups, but with methodological limitations, not taking into account the new
      criteria10 for evaluating FM.

      Recent studies have also shown that there is a peripheral neuropathic component in the
      mechanisms of this pathology, demonstrated by a decrease in the density of the epidermal
      nerve fibers11-12, called small fiber neuropathy (SFN) neuropathy. It is an attack of small
      sensory and sympathetic nerve fibers, causing pain, paresthesia as well as disturbances of
      the autonomous system. Other studies also suggested that a significant proportion of patients
      diagnosed with fibromyalgia had SFN, demonstrated by cutaneous biopsy13-14 or confocal
      microscopy of the cornea15. A new device, the Sudoscan®, makes it possible to detect a SFN
      much simpler, faster and less invasive than the technique of ophthalmology or biopsy.
      Although this Sudoscan® test has been used extensively in conditions such as diabetes16-19,
      no study has been used to assess the presence of SFN in FM.

      The aim of this pilot study is to identify the prevalence of SFN in FM patients, using this
      new non-invasive device, in order to have a better defined representation of the prevalence
      of small-fiber neuropathy in an FM population compared to a group of healthy volunteer
      matched in age, sex, BMI and by menopausal status for women.

    <description>Sudoscan® is a new device that provides rapid, non-invasive and reproducible quantitative assessment of sweat function. It makes it possible to measure the ability of the sweat glands to release chloride ions in response to electrochemical activation and thus to detect the presence of a neuropathy with small fibers. This new device therefore makes it possible to detect an SFN in a much simpler and faster way than the technique of ophthalmology, or biopsy. Sudoscan® has been tested to assess the neuropathies of small nerve fibers in several diseases, in particular diabetes, chemotherapy-induced polyneuropathy, familial amyloid polyneuropathy or Fabry disease. The interest of Sudoscan® lies in the fact that this device is non-invasive and rapid. Its diagnostic value has been compared with other neurophysiological tests.</description>
