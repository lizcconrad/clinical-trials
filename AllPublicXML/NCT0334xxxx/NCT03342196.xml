  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the United States, thiotepa has been utilized in reduced intensity conditioning regimens
      for alternative donor courses (double umbilical cord blood transplant (dUCBT) and
      haplo-identical transplants).

      The hypothesis is that thiotepa at a dose of 10mg/kg, in combination with melphalan
      (100mg/m2) and fludarabine (160mg/m2) as a reduced intensity conditioning regimen for
      alternative donor transplant is safe and effective in patients with hematologic malignancies.

      Given that this regimen has been investigated extensively, and the current study proposes to
      confirm those previous observations with a small modification (melphalan dose reduction due
      to previous mucositis rates with higher doses), this will be a phase II study designed to
      measure disease-free-survival.

      Primary Objective:

      To assess the effectiveness of Thiotepa, Fludarabine, and Melphalan in alternative donor
      transplants as measured by leukemia free survival.

      Secondary Objective:

      To assess the 1- year OS, Relapse, TRM, aGVHD and cGVHD rates and the rates of neutrophil and
      platelet engraftment.

      Study Design This is a Phase II study of Thiotepa, Fludarabine, and Melphalan in alternative
      donor transplants.

      Subjects will be assessed for safety and tolerability (including adverse events, serious
      adverse events, and clinical/laboratory assessments) using a continuous monitoring approach.
      Subjects will be followed for up to 1 year or until progression of disease, relapse, or
      death.
