  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The XEN1101 Phase 1 clinical trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study
      that will evaluate the safety, tolerability and PK of both single ascending doses (SAD) and
      multiple ascending doses (MAD) of XEN1101 in healthy subjects. In addition to safety and PK
      data, the clinical trial has been designed to include a pharmacodynamic read-out by
      incorporating a pilot transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) sub-study. The TMS model
      sub-study is designed to demonstrate delivery of XEN1101 into the central nervous system and
      to observe a change in cortical excitability as measured by EEG and/or EMG activity. It is
      estimated there will be approximately 64 subjects in the planned SAD and MAD cohorts.
