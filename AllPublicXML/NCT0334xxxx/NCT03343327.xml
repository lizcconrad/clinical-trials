      This is a single centre, open label, randomised, two period, crossover study to evaluate the

      dexamethasone-suppressed healthy adult male subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, randomised, single dose, two-period, crossover study in 24
      healthy male subjects.

      The study will comprise of a pre-study screen, followed by 2 treatment periods (1 and 2) and
      a post-study followup.

      Screening (Day -28 to Day -1): Screening assessments will be carried out within 28 days
      before first administration of IMP. Eligible subjects will be asked to return for the
      treatment periods. Continued eligibility will be confirmed pre-dose during each treatment
      period.

      Treatment Periods (Day -1 to Day 1): Eligible subjects will receive a single-dose of each IMP
      over 2 treatment periods (1/period as determined by the randomisation schedule), each
      separated by at least 7 days washout. Each study period will be approximately 2 days in
      duration, from the afternoon of Day -1 to the morning of Day 1 at 24 hours (h) post-dose.
      During each treatment period, Subjects will arrive at the Clinical Unit on Day -1, IMP will
      be administered on the morning of Day 0 fasted (following an overnight fast of at least 10 h)
      and subjects will be discharged following the 24 h post-dose blood samples and completion of
      the scheduled measurements.

      Pharmacokinetic (PK) samples will be collected pre-dose at ~ -2min and up to 23 h post-dose
      (Day 1) (24 samples) for the measurement of cortisol. A further 3 baseline samples will be
      taken for the measurement of cortisol. Safety will also be evaluated throughout the study.

      Post Study: After completion of both study periods, the subjects will return 7 ± 2 days later
      for the final followup visit.
