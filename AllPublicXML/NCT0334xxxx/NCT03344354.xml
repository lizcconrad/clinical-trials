  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective open-label study design was chosen because it will provide the most accurate
      data on the efficacy of four commercially available similar brands of NRL (natural rubber
      latex) and synthetic latex surgical gloves when they are used for surgeries in a clinical
      setting. The primary endpoint will be the overall failure rate of the Biogel® sterile
      surgical undergloves (device) compared to undergloves from Ansell, Medline, and Cardinal
      brands of surgical gloves. The secondary endpoints are perforation rates of the underglove,
      the failure rate of the overglove, the frequency of overglove perforation detection by the
      glove wearer when double-gloving, the ratio of perforations detected of overglove compared to
      underglove and to determine the frequency of overglove perforation detection by the glove
      wearer.

      The clinical investigation will be statistically powered to test the hypothesis that the
      failure rate of the Biogel® Sterile Surgical undergloves is different from that of the three
      comparators.

      This is a non-significant risk, cross-over, comparative, prospective, five-armed, open-label
      clinical investigation in which the perforation rate of surgical gloves from four different
      manufacturers will be evaluated in double-gloving fashion. Study clinicians who will directly
      in the sterile field, with a similar surgical procedural work scope will be asked to use
      gloves from the four manufacturers of surgical gloves: Molnlycke Health Care, Ansell,
      Medline, and Cardinal - while performing those surgical procedures. The types of procedures
      under which the study gloves will be put in use are prosthetic joints arthroplasty and
      implantation (i.e. orthopedic), trauma surgery, neurosurgery, colorectal and cardiothoracic
      surgery.

      All gloves under evaluation in each phase will be assessed for perforation rate and overall
      failure on the basis of binomial responses (Y/N) looking at five time points:

        -  glove failure pre-donning (after removal from pack, prior to donning)

        -  glove failure during donning (putting the gloves on)

        -  observed intraoperative glove failure

        -  glove failure during doffing (glove removal)

        -  post-procedure: glove perforation and failure determined using a standardized water leak
           test

      No patient data will be assessed.
