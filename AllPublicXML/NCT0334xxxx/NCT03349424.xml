    <textblock>
      This study is designed to assess the preventive effects of somatostatin on post-operation
      pancreatic fistula in intermediate risk patients after pancreaticoduodenectomy. Patients
      assigned into the treatment group will be continuous intravenous infusion with the
      somatostatin (Stilamin®) in addition to conventional treatments (including infection
      prevention, nutrition support and acid suppression therapy, etc.).The pancreatic fistula
      incidence will be monitored within 30 days after operation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center randomized, controlled clinical trial. A total of 200 patients are
      expected to be recruited. Each trial center recruits subjects based on the sequential
      principle and inspect the inclusion and exclusion criteria after PD and subjects meeting the
      standard are assigned randomly to the treatment group or control group. Apart from
      conventional treatments (including infection prevention, nutrition support and acid
      suppression therapy, etc.), the treatment group will be continuous intravenous infusion with
      the somatostatin (Stilamin®) of 250μg/h for 120h (total dose of 6mg/day x 5 days=30mg),
      beginning within 3 hours after the operation; the control group will accept conventional
      treatments other than the Stilamin.

      The pancreatic fistula incidence, biochemical leak incidence, morbidity and number of other
      complications related to the pancreatectomy, length of stay in hospital, hospitalization
      cost, re-admission rate and re-operation rate will be monitored within 30 days after
      operation. Subjects will be visited for 5 times from the start to the end of the study.

      Statistical Methods:Number of patients who had pancreatic fistula after surgery will be
      analyzed using Chi-square test.Secondary endpoints: Continuous variates will be described as
      mean± SD; attempted to be analyzed using analysis of variance. Categorical variates will be
      described as rate; attempted to be analyzed using Chi-square test.
