  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Music has been used in the treatment of patient since the time Plato, Hippocrates and
      Alpharabius were alive. It is used by music therapists to help patients' social, physical,
      emotional, psychological and spiritual needs. In a study conducted, it was seen that music
      has a positive effect on pain, anxiety, depression, shortness of breath, mood, face
      expression and speech. Our aim is to evaluate the analgesic consumption of music therapy
      during egg collection applications and to compare the parameters of oxidative stress in blood
      and follicular fluid.

      Patients were randomly allocated into 3 groups. Group 1 is control group. Group 2 is
      Classical Turkish Music group. Group 3 will be organized as a group listening continuously
      (Preoperative and peroperative) Classical Turkish Music (Acemaşiran Makam). Voluntary
      patients, patients without hearing problems, patients between the ages of 18 and 40, and
      patients without music phobia will be included in the study. Patients who do not want to
      participate in the study, patients with hearing problems, and patients outside the 18-40 age
      range will not be included in the study. Once the Control group has been taken to the
      patient's room, the vessel way will be prepared for operation and will be kept waiting for
      one hour. Then blood will be taken to evaluate the oxidative stress parameters (Superoxide
      Dysmotase, Catalase, Glutathione Peroxidase, Myeloperoxidase, Malondialdehyde, Nitric Oxide,
      Thiol Disulfide levels) and taken to the operation room. Group 2 patients will be taken to
      the patient's rest room and will listen to music with an MP3 headset for 1 hour. Patient's
      blood will be taken to assess the oxidative stress parameters and taken to the operation
      room. Group 3 will listen Turkish Classical Music for 1 hour in patient room, vein path will
      be opened, Patient's blood will be taken with the aim of evaluating oxidative stress
      parameters and taken to the operation room. The patients will listen to music throughout the
      operation. All patients included in the study (Gr.1, Gr.2, Gr.3 patients) will use
      remifentanil 0.5 mcg / kg, propofol 1 mg / kg on induction after taken to the operating
      table. Blood and follicle fluid will be taken with the aim of comparing the values of
      Oxidative Stress Parameters in blood and follicular fluid at the end of the operation of all
      the patients in the three groups included in the study. Hemodynamics follow-up and pain
      follow-ups will be recorded at 1,5,15,30, and 60 minutes in the postoperative resting rooms
      of the patients after the operation. VAS will be used for pain recording. The analgesic needs
      of the patients will be met. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs will be administered to
      patients for postoperative analgesia. The pre-and post-operative oxidative stress parameters
      in patients blood will be compared and the oxidative stress parameter values of the
      follicular fluid of the patients after the operation will be compared in the three groups.
