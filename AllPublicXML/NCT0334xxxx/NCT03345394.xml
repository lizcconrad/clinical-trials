  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Crack addiction has become a severe public health problem in Brazil. Crack users present
      elevated prevalence rates of psychiatric comorbidities, sexual transmitted infections and
      unemployment with high probability of living or have lived in the streets, history of
      incarceration and engagement in illegal activities. For the last 20 years a treatment called
      Contingency Management (CM) have achieved the best results regarding reduction of substance
      use, promotion of abstinence, treatment attendance and retention in treatment. The first CM
      study conducted in Brazil advocates for the efficacy of CM on all of these outcomes,
      suggesting that CM can be effective in a Brazilian population of crack users.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Contingency Management (CM)
      for crack users living in the &quot;Crackland&quot; region. To achieve this goal, regular treatment
      staff from Unidade Helvétia and CRATOD treatment services will be capacitated in CM to
      latter-on apply the CM intervention in their respective services. The design will be a
      crossover randomized clinical trial composed of a sample of 200 subjects with current
      diagnose for crack/cocaine dependence. Participants allocated to the control condition will
      receive 12 weeks of the usual care treatment provided by these two treatment facilities.
      Participants allocated to the experimental condition will receive the exact same treatment as
      control participants associated with CM. CM procedure will occur 2 timer per week (every
      Monday and Thursday or Tuesday and Friday). After 12 weeks of intervention, participants in
      the control condition (standard treatment alone) will receive 12 weeks of the experimental
      treatment (standard treatment plus CM) and participants in the experimental condition will
      receive 12 weeks of the control procedure. Primary outcomes are: (1)retention in treatment;
      (2) reduction of crack use; (3) promotion of continuous crack cocaine abstinence. Secondary
      findings are reduction on psychiatric symptomatology. The investigator hypothesis is that
      participants will have a better response in all studied outcomes when receiving treatment in
      the CM condition.
