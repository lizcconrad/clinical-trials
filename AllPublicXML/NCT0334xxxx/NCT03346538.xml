          -  Patients for whom study treatment can be initiated within 24 hours after onset

          -  Patients with confirmed new ischemic area only in the supratentorial region on MRI

          -  Patients with neurological signs equivalent to between 4 and 22, inclusive, on the
             NIHSS

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with disability equivalent to an mRS score of 2 or more from before onset

             prohibited concomitant therapy (e.g., intravascular therapy)

          -  Patients for whom the (sub)investigator judges the efficacy endpoints (e.g., NIHSS,
             mRS, BI) that have been selected for this study can not be measured appropriately,
             such as patients who are not expected to achieve improvement of 4 or more on the NIHSS
             because of nerve symptoms that have been present since before the onset of cerebral
             infarction, Alzheimer's dementia patients, or Parkinson's disease patients

          -  Patients with severe consciousness disturbances (Japan coma scale ≥ 100)

          -  Patients with clear concurrent peripheral vascular disease or peripheral neuropathy

          -  Patients diagnosed by MRI on admission with a disease other than stroke (e.g.,
             intracranial bleeding, subarachnoid bleeding, arteriovenous malformations, Moyamoya
             disease, brain tumor) or with cerebral aneurysm with a maximum diameter &gt; 7 mm

          -  Patients with prior or current drug abuse or alcohol dependence

          -  Patients with prior (or current) malignant tumor within 5 years before stroke onset

          -  Patients with a past history of hypersensitivity to edaravone drug products

          -  Patients with concurrent heart disease severe enough to warrant admission and
             treatment (e.g., acute myocardial infarction, cardiac failure) and with problems with
             their overall condition judged by the (sub)investigator to be unsuitable for study
             participation

          -  Patients for whom MRI tests cannot be performed

          -  Male or female patients who do not consent to practice contraception from the date of
