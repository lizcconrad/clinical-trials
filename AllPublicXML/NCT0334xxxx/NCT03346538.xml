          -  Patients for whom the (sub)investigator judges the efficacy endpoints (e.g., NIHSS,

             such as patients who are not expected to achieve improvement of 4 or more on the NIHSS
             because of nerve symptoms that have been present since before the onset of cerebral
             infarction, Alzheimer's dementia patients, or Parkinson's disease patients

          -  Patients with severe consciousness disturbances (Japan coma scale â‰¥ 100)

          -  Patients with clear concurrent peripheral vascular disease or peripheral neuropathy

             disease, brain tumor) or with cerebral aneurysm with a maximum diameter &gt; 7 mm

          -  Patients with prior or current drug abuse or alcohol dependence

          -  Patients with prior (or current) malignant tumor within 5 years before stroke onset

          -  Patients with a past history of hypersensitivity to edaravone drug products

          -  Patients with concurrent heart disease severe enough to warrant admission and
             treatment (e.g., acute myocardial infarction, cardiac failure) and with problems with
             their overall condition judged by the (sub)investigator to be unsuitable for study
             participation

          -  Patients for whom MRI tests cannot be performed

          -  Male or female patients who do not consent to practice contraception from the date of
