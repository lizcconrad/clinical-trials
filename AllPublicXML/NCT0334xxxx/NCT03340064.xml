    <measure>Percent change in average daily frequency (ADF) of partial seizure frequency monitored by the 48h video-EEG at Week 6</measure>
    <time_frame>From Selection Period to Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>This Variable will be tested in the First Period for subjects on adjunctive therapy.
Partial seizure count will be based on electrographic seizures with or without clinical correlate depending upon age as specified below. Partial seizure frequency for subjects aged &gt;=1 month to &lt;=6 months will be based on electrographic seizures. Partial seizure frequency for subjects aged &gt;6 months to &lt;4 years will be based on electrographic seizures with an accompanying clinical correlate. Electrographic seizures are defined as recognizable ictal patterns on an electroencephalogram (EEG) involving &gt;=2 contiguous electrodes. The seizures are initiated as a unilateral or strongly asymmetric abnormal epileptiform discharge lasting a total of &gt;10 seconds.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject must have a diagnosis of epilepsy with partial onset seizures whether or not
             secondarily generalized.

          -  Male or female from 1 month to &lt;4 years of age. Pre-term infants aged &lt;1 year are to
             be stratified into an appropriate age category using the best estimate of their
             corrected gestational age.

          -  For subjects on adjunctive therapy, subject must be on a stablea ntiepileptic drug
             (AED) regimen for the Selection and Evaluation Periods of the study. Minor adjustments
             to the dose of current AEDs are allowed only prior to Visit 1. Monotherapy subjects
             must not receive AED treatment, receive temporary AED treatment, or switch an AED
             prior to Visit 1.

          -  Subject weighs &gt;=3.0kg.

          -  Subject may have Vagal Nerve Stimulation (VNS) which has been implanted for at least 6
             months prior to Visit 1; the settings must be stable for at least 2 months prior to
             Visit 1. Activated VNS must be counted as 1 of the 2 AEDs.

          -  Subject must have experienced at least 2 partial seizures, with or without secondary
             generalization during each 7-day period during the 2 weeks prior to Visit 1. This time
             period (the 2 weeks prior to Visit 1) will be referred to as the Retrospective
             Baseline Period. This seizure information (including type, frequency, and date) must
             have been recorded on a daily record card (DRC) in order to be acceptable.

          -  Subjects 1 month to &lt;6 months of age must experience at least 2 partial seizures,
             during the 48h video-EEG performed prior to Visit 3 (Week 0). These seizures do not
             need to be accompanied by a corresponding clinical event.

          -  Subjects 6 months to &lt;4 years of age must experience at least 2 partial seizures,
             whether or not secondarily generalized, during the 48h video-EEG performed prior to
             Visit 3 (Week 0). These seizures must be accompanied by a corresponding clinical event
             as noted on either video or as reported by investigator/subinvestigator.

          -  If epilepsy surgery has been performed prior to study entry, subjects must have a
             documented failed epilepsy surgery outcome at least 4 weeks prior to Visit 1.

          -  The use of intermittent benzodiazepines, phenobarbitals, and phenytoins is allowed as
             long as the frequency is not greater than 1 single administration per week for at
             least 2 weeks prior to Visit 1 and throughout study participation. If benzodiazepines
             are used more than once a week, they must be considered as 1 of the AEDs.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has been taking any medication (other than their concomitant AEDs) that
             influences the central nervous system (CNS) for which they had not been on a stable
             regimen for at least

             1 month prior to Visit 1.

          -  Subject is taking any medication that may interfere with the absorption, distribution,
             metabolism, or excretion of the concomitant AEDs or LEV during the course of the
             study.

          -  Subject has received any investigational medication or device within 30 days prior to
             Visit 1.

          -  Subject has taken LEV prior to the study.

          -  Subjects using felbamate who have presented with clinically significant abnormalities
             and/or hepatic function during felbamate treatment, and subjects who are taking
             felbamate &lt;1year from the date of Visit 1.

          -  History of status epilepticus requiring hospitalization during the 30 days prior to
             Visit 1, except for status epilepticus occurring during the first 10 days of life.

          -  Subject has a treatable seizure etiology.

          -  Subject is on a ketogenic diet (concomitantly or within 30 days prior to Visit 1).

          -  Subject has epilepsy secondary to progressing cerebral diseases.

          -  Subject has a current diagnosis of Rasmussen's syndrome, Landau-Kleffner disease or
             Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.

          -  Clinically significant deviations from reference range values for renal function or
             any of the other laboratory parameters required for this study, as determined by the
             Investigator.

          -  Clinically significant acute or chronic illness (as determined during the physical
             examination or from other information available to the Investigator).

          -  Allergy to pyrrolidine derivatives or a history of multiple drug allergies.

          -  Subject is known to have a terminal illness.

          -  Subject has a disorder or condition that may interfere with the absorption,
             distribution, metabolism, or excretion of medications.

          -  Subject has a history of or presence of pseudoseizures.

          -  Subject has any medical condition that might interfere with the subject's study
             participation

          -  Subject has ≥3x upper limit of normal (ULN) of any of the following: alanine
             aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP),
             or &gt;ULN total bilirubin (≥1.5xULN total bilirubin if known Gilbert's syndrome). If
             subject has elevations only in total bilirubin that are &gt;ULN and &lt;1.5xULN, fractionate
             bilirubin to identify possible undiagnosed Gilbert's syndrome (ie, direct bilirubin
             &lt;35%).
