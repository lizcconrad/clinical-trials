    <textblock>
      The main objective of this trial is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BI
      836826 in combination with venetoclax on the basis of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs
      incidence rate during the MTD evaluation period of the combination treatment and to determine
      the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of the combination.

      Other objectives are to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of BI 836826 in combination with
      venetoclax and to further determine the safety, as well as to evaluate the efficacy of the
      combination by means of the Complete Response (CR) rate and Minimal Residual Disease (MRD)
      negativity rate.
