  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is involved in the development of esophageal motility
      disorders like Jackhammer esophagus (JE), a novel hypercontractile condition that was
      associated with progression to achalasia and limited outcomes following surgical anti-reflux
      therapy.

      This trial was designed to assess the prevalence and characteristics of JE in patients with
      typical symptoms of GERD and responsiveness to PPI therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Jackhammer esophagus is a novel hypercontractile esophageal disorder. The investigators
      assess the prevalence and clinical characteristics of patients diagnosed with this disorder
      out of a collective of patients that are referred with symptoms of gastroesphageal reflux
      disease and respond to PPI. This is an observational trial.

        All patients that are referred to our center undergo esophageal high-resolution manometry
        and ambulatory pH monitoring for screening of gastroesophageal reflux disease and motility
        disorders. We assess the data that are prospectively obtained. Patients do not have to
        undergo any interventions.
