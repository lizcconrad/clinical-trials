  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unwell patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) often need supplementary fluids to be given
      into the bloodstream through a drip in a vein (venous cannula), however too much fluid can be
      harmful. It can sometimes be difficult to tell whether or not a patient will benefit from
      extra fluids so they are given a &quot;fluid challenge&quot;, whereby a small volume of fluid is given
      quickly into the cannula and the change in their status is noted. If the patient's condition
      improves, this suggests that the patient is &quot;fluid responsive&quot; and needs more fluid.

      A LiDCOplus haemodynamic monitor is a device used in the ICU to estimate the amount of blood
      ejected from the heart on each heartbeat using pressure readings obtained from a tube placed
      in one of the patient's arteries (arterial line).

      The investigators aim to determine whether or not the use of this device called makes a
      difference to the judgement of &quot;fluid responsiveness&quot; when the patient is given a fluid
      challenge when compared to simply using measurements of pulse and blood pressure and
      assessing the circulation in the patient's limbs. This will allow the investigators to
      determine whether or not the LiDCOplus alters the decisions made by doctors and nurses about
      how much fluid to give their patients and hence if it is of any benefit.

    <description>Patients in study group receive intravenous fluid bolus as part of standard fluid resuscitation. Fluid responsiveness (i.e. improvement in cardiac output) is estimated using both standard clinical parameters and by LiDCOplus haemodynamic monitor (with the clinician initially blinded to the latter) before a final decision about fluid responsiveness is made.</description>
