    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effect of dietary intervention on metabolic risk profile, and on potential
      simultaneous changes in physiological and cognitive functions and to collect a unique
      database using state-of-the-art technologies on variables related to the above mentioned
      areas.

      The study is compiled from 4 phases: 1) a pilot study to evaluate performance and feasibility
      of the measurements and logistics for the BRAVE intervention study (N=10), 2) a pre-screening
      phase to select volunteers for the intervention study based on metabolite analyses (N=600),
      3) the BRAVE intervention study as a controlled non-randomized open-label fixed sequence diet
      switch trial (N=88)and 4) a non-interventional reference group to estimate the learning
      effect due to repeated cognitive testing (N=30).

      The Brainfood dietary regime is planned optimal for metabolism and cognitive function; having
      focus on regular meal frequency (breakfast, lunch and afternoon snack) and well-balanced
      light lunch at work -according to the so-called plate model and optimized recipes- will be
      provided.

          1. Signed written informed consent

          2. Age 18â€”65 years

             ischemic attack within the previous 6 months

          6. Diagnosed type 1 or type 2 diabetes requiring treatment

          7. Inflammatory bowel disease or other intestinal or oesophageal disease requiring
             medical treatment or likely to have a nutritional affect

          8. History of malignant diseases like cancer within five years prior to recruitment

          9. Lipid lowering medication (statin, cholestyramine) or medication for obesity
             (orlistat, or liraglutide) or depression

         10. Alcohol abuse (&gt; 4 portion/per day) or recreational drug abuse
