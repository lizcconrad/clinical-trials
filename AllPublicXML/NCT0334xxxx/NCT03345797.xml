  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ARM 1 - 10 subjects at Tanner Stage 0 boys with bone age &gt;/= 10.5 will receive single dose of
      5.5mg on day one and single dose of 11mg on day 2 with repeat blood draws to assess serum
      levels of testosterone and metabolites.

      ARM 2 - 10 subjects with Tanner Stage 3 or above with bone age &gt;/= 13 will receive single
      dose of 11mg on day one, and single dose of 11mg in the morning and a second 11mg dose in the
      afternoon on day 2 with repeat blood draws to assess serum levels of testosterone and
      metabolites.
