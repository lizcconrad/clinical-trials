  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a large and growing body of animal evidence demonstrating neuroapoptosis and
      neurodevelopmental abnormalities after exposure to anesthetic agents. This has prompted an
      FDA warning concerning use of anesthetics and sedatives in children under 3 years of age.
      There has been very little investigation of the neurodevelopment effects of prolonged
      sedation in previously healthy infants in Paediatric Intensive Care. This feasibility study
      will recruit previously healthy infants who required respiratory support with or without
      sedation at up to 6 months and assess neurodevelopmental outcomes at 6 years of age.

    <measure>Wechsler Pre-school and Primary Scale of Intelligence -IV</measure>
    <time_frame>6 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence consist of 14 subtests. They are designated as one of three types: core, supplemental, or optional. The core subtests are required for the computation of the Verbal, Performance, and Full Scale IQ. Quotient and Composite scores have a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. Subtest scaled scores have a mean of 10 and a standard deviation of 3. A score of 90-109 is Average</description>

    <measure>NEuroPSYchological Assessment (NEPSY)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 years</time_frame>
    <description>The six functional domains below are made up of 32 subtests and four delayed tasks. These domains are theoretically, not statistically, derived. The subtests were designed to assess cognitive abilities related to disorders that are typically diagnosed in childhood and that are required for success in an academic environment.</description>
