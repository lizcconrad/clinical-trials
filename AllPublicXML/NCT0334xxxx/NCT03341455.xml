  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We aim to implement a community-based support program delivered by preschool teachers and
      volunteer parents that will increase awareness, knowledge and uptake of available services
      for IPV and substance misuse, and of the link between these issues and poorer education
      outcomes in children. Through this, we aim to decrease the prevalence of IPV and substance
      misuse.

      The proposed method of implementation is to deliver targeted training to preschool teachers,
      mothers with children at the preschools, fathers with children at the preschools, and
      community development officers managing preschools. This project will target the most
      vulnerable sections of the community and will provide a sustainable and feasible strategy for
      scale up of the intervention.

      By intervening through these preschools the investigators aim to identify and support
      high-risk families early enough to arrest the cycle of violence that results in children
      themselves becoming victims and perpetrators of such violence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project will be implemented as a cluster-randomised controlled trial (RCT) in preschools
      in 2 urban study areas. The unit of randomisation will be the preschool.

      The intervention is a preschool-based capacity-building and support intervention addressing
      family violence and alcohol and drug misuse.

      The study intervention will be delivered to preschool teachers, local government Community
      Development Department staff, other key government service providers, and selected mothers
      and fathers of children attending each preschool. Participants in data collection will be all
      teachers and parents of children in participating preschools.

      Half the preschools in the study areas, selected at random, will receive the intervention
      initially. Those that do not will act as time-concurrent controls. If the intervention is
      demonstrated as being effective at the end of the study, these control preschools will
      subsequently receive the intervention.

      This research will address important gaps in literature documented by other researchers by
      using multiple sources of data to assess the effectiveness of the intervention. Preschool
      communities have not previously been target populations when addressing domestic violence in
      Sri Lanka. Results will add to the evidence base for future interventions in Sri Lanka and
      have potential to contribute to national policy.

      Study activities are listed in brief below, and will be subsequently expounded upon in the
      following sections.

        1. A baseline survey at project outset will include mothers and fathers of children
           utilising these preschools, and will be conducted at the beginning of semester 1 of the
           project. This survey will include a series of self-report questionnaires, measuring:
           prevalence of family violence, prevalence of alcohol and drug misuse, depression, child
           psychological wellbeing, and gender attitudes to establish any baseline differences in
           prevalence of these factors between intervention and control groups.

        2. Selected mothers and fathers from half of the preschools (the intervention group), along
           with preschool teachers, community development officers, and other government service
           providers, will receive training associated with the intervention before the end of
           semester 1.

        3. Post intervention surveys with parents will be conducted near the end of the school year
           (at least 6 months post intervention) in all preschools in both study areas (both
           intervention and non-intervention groups).

        4. Qualitative interviews will also be carried out with key informants associated with the
           project who received the intervention including teachers, community members, community
           development staff and other government sector service providers to determine their
           satisfaction with the intervention, and any challenges or barriers to its
           implementation.

        5. If the intervention is deemed to have been effective, the non-intervention preschools
           will then receive the training intervention in 2019.

    <intervention_model_description>The study will be implemented using a randomised controlled trial design. Parents with children attending government-managed preschools in two study areas will be recruited to participate. Preschools will be randomly assigned to an intervention or control group. Preschool teachers in the intervention group will also be recruited to participate.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Allocation of interventions cannot be concealed from either training staff or study participants once implementation occurs.
All data collectors will be blinded to the intervention status of preschools.
The study will be presented as a project related to family health and wellbeing, no specific study hypotheses will be presented to participants, and data collectors will not be involved in delivering the intervention. However, parents at preschools receiving the intervention will be aware of the training activities, and may still link the intervention to survey activities.</masking_description>

    <measure>Difference in prevalence between the intervention and control groups of family violence experienced by preschool mothers.</measure>
    <time_frame>At least six months post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Mothers from all participating preschools ( both intervention and control groups) will be surveyed to measure prevalence of family violence at 6 months after implementation of the intervention. The survey for mothers will include questions adapted from the World Health Organization Multi Country Survey of Violence against Women that will indicate prevalence of violence against them by their husband (or intimate partner). The survey will also include the Sri Lankan specific Peradeniya Depression Scale to measure mental health and depression in adults.</description>

    <measure>Difference in prevalence between the intervention and control groups of alcohol and drug misuse experienced by preschool fathers.</measure>
    <time_frame>At least six months post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Volunteer fathers from the preschool will be surveyed to measure the impact of the intervention on prevalence of alcohol and drug misuse. This survey will include locally validated versions of the Alcohol Used Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), the Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST) and the Sri Lankan specific Peradeniya Depression Scale to measure mental health and depression in adults.</description>
