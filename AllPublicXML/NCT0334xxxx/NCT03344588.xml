  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A male factor is responsible for almost half the cases of subfertility. Varicocele is a major
      cause of impaired spermatogenesis and potentially a correctable cause. It affects up to 40%
      of men with primary subfertility and 80% of men with secondary subfertility. Varicocelectomy
      is now accepted as a cost effective treatment in subfertile men with clinically palpable
      varicocele and impaired semen parameters. Recently, Varicocelectomy is reported to improve
      fertility potential in patients with severe oligozoospermia. In one such study,
      Varicocelectomy was associated with a statistically significant increase in sperm density and
      motility. Spontaneous pregnancy was achieved in16.7% of cases. In a recent meta-analysis,
      Varicocelectomy in men with severe oligozoospermia showed a strong trend toward improvement
      in pregnancy rate (PR) [OR= 1.69, 95% CI (0.951, 3.020), p= 0.073] and statistically
      significant increase in live birth rate (LBR)[OR=1.699, 95%CI (1.020, 2.831), p= 0.04].

      The impact of ligation of internal spermatic artery (ISA) during Varicocelectomy is a matter
      of debate. Conventional view is arterial ligation can negatively affect testicular function
      and decrease the likelihood of post-operative paternity. Other investigators reported that
      ligation of ISA was not associated with significant changes in postoperative semen
      parameters, testicular size or PR in comparison to artery preservation. Moreover,
      laparoscopic artery-ligating Varicocelectomy was proved to be superior in the form of shorter
      operative time and lower recurrence rates with no difference in semen parameters or PR in
      comparison to laparoscopic artery-preservation varicocelectomy.

      Also, isolation of ISA is not an easy task during subinguinal Varicocelectomy due to
      compression by external oblique aponeurosis and its inherent anatomical variation. In 29 %
      and 57% of the cases, the ISA is surrounded by the varicose vessels and adherent to the veins
      respectively. Thus, the ISA is liable to a substantial risk of accidental ligation during
      subinguinal Varicocelectomy.

      Whether or not ligation of the ISA has a deleterious effect on the fertility outcomes in
      patients with severe oligozoospermia; this is not clear in the literature. This prospective
      randomized study was conducted to assess the impact of ISA ligation during subinguinal
      Varicocelectomy on fertility outcome in patients with severe oligozoospermia.

    <description>In all patients, sub-inguinal varicocelectomy will be carried out under spinal anesthesia, by a single surgeon (KS), using surgical microscope. A 2-3 cm pre-pubic incision will be performed. The cord will be grasped with a Babcock clamp and isolated over a vessel tape. Any external cremastric veins will be identified and ligated using vicryl 3/0. After opening the spermatic fascia, the vassal compartment including the vasal, cremasteric arteries and lymphatics will be separated from the pampiniform plexus compartment and preserved. In group A (APV), testicular arteries will be spared with aid of by intraoperative Doppler US (VTI intraoperative Doppler system 20 MHz). The arteries will be carefully dissected by a micro-dissector, separated over a vessel loupe, and then the remaining veins will be ligated using vicryl 3/0.</description>
