  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of food additives on children with ADHD.
      This study could potentially answer an important question which still remains unanswered as
      to whether certain food additives may be able to cause behavioral changes in children with
      ADHD. In this context, food additives will be artificial food coloring.

      Consent and assent will be obtained at the first visit. Baseline data will be collected on
      the children, including height, weight, hemoglobin levels, computerized cognitive
      functioning, and an EEG recording. The parent(s) and the child's teacher will be asked to
      complete a behavioral assessment over the next two days. The parent(s) will also be taught
      how to keep a detailed food and symptom diary over the following week. One week later, the
      parent(s) and child will return to the lab and turn in the food/symptom diary. Parent(s) will
      be trained on how to follow the dietary intervention. Detailed information on the diet will
      be given, including food additives to avoid, healthy foods which should be eaten, shopping
      tips and recipes. For the next two weeks, the family will follow the dietary intervention at
      home with access to Dr. Holton to answer any questions. The parents and child will return to
      the lab after following the diet for two weeks and assessments (hemoglobin, cognitive
      testing, and EEG) will be completed again. The parent(s) and teacher will also fill out a
      post-diet behavioral assessment and information on dietary compliance will be collected. The
      third meeting will also mark the beginning of the first challenge period. For the challenges,
      the child will consume chocolate cookies every Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday for two weeks.
      The cookies may or may not contain artificial food coloring depending on the week. Every
      Wednesday repeat testing will be completed after the cookies are consumed. The parents and
      the child's teacher will fill out a behavioral assessment on Thursday of each week. Children
      will be asked not to take ADHD medication on testing days. After two weeks of challenges the
      study will be completed. Parents will receive information on their child's performance and on
      the study results overall.

    <description>The Conners Assessment quantifies behavioral symptoms. It yields T-scores of 0-100 for the sub-scales of inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, learning problems, executive function, aggression, and peer relations. A score of &gt;63 is indicative of ADHD.</description>
