  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is at onset an immune-mediated demyelinating disease. In most cases,
      it starts as a relapsing-remitting disease with distinct attacks and no symptoms between
      flares. Over years or decades, virtually all cases transition into a progressive disease in
      which insidious and slow neurologic deterioration occurs with or without acute flares.
      Relapsing-remitting disease is often responsive to immune suppressive or modulating
      therapies, while immune based therapies are generally ineffective in patients with a
      progressive clinical course. This clinical course and response to immune suppression, as well
      as neuropathology and neuroimaging studies, suggest that disease progression is associated
      with axonal atrophy. Disability correlates better with measures of axonal atrophy than immune
      mediated demyelination. Therefore, immune based therapies, in order to be effective, need to
      be started early in the disease course while MS is predominantly an immune-mediated and
      inflammatory disease. While current immune based therapies delay disability, no intervention
      has been proven to prevent progressive disability.The investigators propose a randomized
      study of autologous unmanipulated peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT)
      comparing two different conditioning regimens: (1) cyclophosphamide and rabbit
      anti-thymoglobulin (rATG) versus (2) cyclophosphamide, rATG, and Intravenous Immunoglobulin
      (IVIg).

             enhancing lesions on MRI within the last three months

          5. Inflammatory disease despite treatment with standard disease modifying therapy (DMT)
             including at least 6 months of interferon or Copaxone. Inflammatory disease is defined

               1. Failed a first line DMT (Copaxone or Interferon), defined as two or more *steroid
                  treated clinical relapses within the last 12 months. A clinical relapse may also
                  be evidence of active inflammation on MRI (gadolinium enhancing lesion or new T2
                  lesion) in the last 12 months on two MRIs at least three months apart

               2. Failed a second or third line MS Drug: Zinbryta (daclizumab), Aubagio
                  (teriflunomide), Gilenya (fingolimod), Tecifidera (dimethyl fumarate), Lemtrada
                  (alemtuzumab), Ocrevus (ocrelizumab), Tysabri (natalizumab), Rituxan (rituximab)
                  or IVIg, defined as one *steroid treated clinical relapse within the last 12
                  months or evidence of active inflammation on MRI (gadolinium enhancing lesion or
                  new T2 lesion) in the last 12 months.

               3. Cognitive dysfunction that prevents gainful employment, but competent to comply
                  with treatment and informed consent

                    -  A steroid-treated relapse will include a relapse that was severe enough to
                       justify treatment but due to patient intolerance of steroids, they were
                       offered but not used.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any adult who is unable to consent (for adults who are cognitively impaired due to MS,
             consent may be obtained from the closest living relative or person who has power of
             attorney)

          2. Individuals under the age of 18 or over the age of 58

             the patient to tolerate aggressive chemotherapy

          8. Prior history of malignancy except localized basal cell, squamous skin cancer or
             carcinoma in situ of the cervix

             MS disease)

         10. History of sickle cell disease (SS), SC disease, coagulopathy, or if actively
             receiving anticoagulation therapy

         11. History of insulin-dependent diabetes

         12. Inability or unwillingness to pursue effective means of birth control from the time of
