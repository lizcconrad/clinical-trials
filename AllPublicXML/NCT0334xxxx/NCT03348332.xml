  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Assessing the role of moderate exercise in newborn intrapartum variables have showed to be
      crucial not only on prescribing exercise safely, but also on understanding its impact on the
      prevention of some cardio-metabolic diseases after labor. Clarify this concept will be
      essential on reducing human risk for some chronic diseases through implementing supervised
      exercise programs during such a critical period.

      The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the effect of combined exercise
      (aerobic and strength exercise) on maternal and newborn intrapartum variables.

    <description>A supervised physical conditioning program of three 55—60 minute sessions per week during whole pregnancy (from week 10 to 39) was conducted. Each session consisted of 25-30 minutes of cardiovascular exercise,10 minutes of specific exercises (strength and balance exercises), and 10 minutes of pelvic floor muscles training. Aerobic activity was prescribed at light to moderate intensity, aiming for 55-60 of maximal heart rate. All subjects wore a heart rate (HR) monitor during the training sessions to control the intensity.</description>
