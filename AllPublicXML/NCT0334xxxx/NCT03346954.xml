  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cushing's disease is characterized by the existence of a benign pituitary tumor developed
      from corticotropic cells responsible for excessive ACTH secretion. This results in
      hypercorticism causing high morbidity and mortality and severely impairing quality of life.
      The etiological diagnosis is based on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). However, pituitary
      MRI revealed a pituitary tumor in only 60% of patients. The diagnostic procedure is
      complicated by the existence of extra pituitary tumors responsible for ACTH ectopic
      secretion. This rare etiology imposes, in the absence of typical pituitary image, the
      realization of catheterization of the lower petrosal sinuses. Treatment of Cushing's disease
      is based on transsphenoidal surgical management, even in the absence of a formal MRI image,
      if pituitary origin is confirmed by the catheterization. Although pituitary surgery without
      identified target is part of French recommendations, this surgery is associated with a high
      risk of failure and morbidity. Optimization of the management of patients' with Cushing's
      disease thus requires the improvement of the diagnostic methods.

      Hypothesis of our study is that [11C] MET MRI-PET may be performed as a first-line MRI for
      suspected Cushing's disease and may limit indications for catheterization of lower petrosal
      sinuses. Its localizing value should also make it possible to improve the surgical results
      with a better identification of the adenoma
