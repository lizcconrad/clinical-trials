    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test resting state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
      (rsfMRI) scans to see if rsfMRI scans are better than the standard task based fMRI scans at
      diagnosing or monitoring central nervous system lymphoma.

    <description>Trail Making Test (Parts A &amp; B): Part A is a timed test of visual scanning and graphomotor speed; AT: 3 minutes. Part B is a timed measure of set-shifting; Administration Time (AT): 5 minutes. Test-retest reliabilities=0.64-0.94.
Brief Test of Attention-BTA assesses auditory working memory; AT: 10 minutes. Test-re-test reliability=0.70.
Controlled Oral Word Association Test-COWAT is a timed measure of phonemic verbal fluency. It requires the subject to generate as many words as possible, beginning with a given letter of the alphabet (i.e., F, A, and S). The subject is allowed 60 seconds per letter, and the resultant score is the total number of words produced. Test-retest reliability=0.88. AT: 5 minutes.</description>
