  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The many negative outcomes associated with loneliness in older people have rendered
      loneliness itself a new public health target. Older adults who feel lonely carry increased
      risk for reduced quality of life, morbidity, and mortality. The risk of premature mortality
      related to loneliness is at least as large as the risks arising from such factors as obesity,
      physical inactivity, alcohol misuse, and smoking. Volunteering is a promising intervention
      for reducing loneliness in later life. The primary objective of this proposal is to test the
      hypothesis that a social volunteering program for lonely older adults will lead to reduced
      loneliness and improved quality of life. National infrastructure for volunteering (The Senior
      Corps) ensures that volunteering is a highly scalable intervention.

      The investigators propose to compare the effect of a Senior Corps volunteering intervention
      versus a self-guided life review active control condition on feelings of loneliness in older
      adults. The investigators' preliminary data, as well as published studies of volunteering in
      later life, strongly suggest that volunteering should reduce loneliness. Rigorous
      experimental study is needed, however, to examine volunteering in both men and women who are
      lonely, to determine conditions that maximize benefit, and to understand mechanisms. The
      investigators hypothesize, per tenets of Self-Determination Theory, that increased social
      engagement and feelings of both usefulness and social support function as psychological
      mechanisms whereby volunteering reduces loneliness. Understanding these mechanisms will
      promote effective implementation, allowing communities to adapt volunteering programs while
      retaining the active ingredients.

      The study involves randomly assigning older adults (150 women, 150 men) who report loneliness
      to 12 months of either: 1) a structured social volunteering program providing peer
      companionship to frail, homebound older adults for at least 4 hours per week, or 2) an active
      control intervention with self-guided life review.

      Specific aims are as follows: 1) To examine the effect of volunteering on loneliness and
      quality of life; 2) To examine social engagement, perceived usefulness, and social support as
      mechanisms for reducing loneliness; 3) To examine conditions under which volunteering is most
      effective at reducing loneliness.

      The volunteering intervention is already implemented nation-wide, indicating high feasibility
      of going to scale (http://www.nationalservice.gov/programs/senior-corps). If effective,
      volunteering should be &quot;prescribed&quot; by physicians and promoted by policy. Dissemination and
      scaling up efforts will involve connecting primary care patients and aging services clients
      who are lonely with The Senior Corps, shown to be feasible in the investigators' companion
      study, The Senior Connection. Existing infrastructure will make it possible to reach a large
      proportion of lonely older adults. Reducing loneliness has the potential to improve
      well-being and save lives.

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>UCLA Loneliness Scale Version 3, which assesses self-reported loneliness. 20 items, rated as to how often the participant has felt a certain way in the prior month (e.g., &quot;How often do you feel alone?&quot;) -- &quot;never&quot; (1), &quot;rarely&quot; (2), &quot;sometimes&quot; (3), or &quot;often&quot; (4). Higher scores indicate greater loneliness. However, some individual items must be reverse-coded so that higher total scores reflect greater loneliness (i.e., 1=4, 2=3, 3=2, 4=1). These items (e.g., &quot;How often do you feel there are people you can turn to?&quot;) are items 1,5,6,9,10,15,16,19,20. Total scores range from 20 to 80, with higher scores representing a worse outcome (i.e., greater loneliness).</description>

    <measure>Health-related Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>World Health Organization Quality of Life--Bref instrument (WHOQOL-Bref). This self-report instrument comprises 26 items. The WHOQOL-Bref produces scores for four domains (i.e., physical health, psychological functioning, social relationships, and environmental opportunities) and a total score reflecting overall health-related quality of life. Our primary outcome is the total score assessing overall quality of life. All items are rated on a 5-pt scale, with scores of 5 representing the best outcome. Some items are reversed scored (per the WHOQOL manual). Scores are transformed (per the WHOQOL manual) such that the range for the total score is 0-100, with 100 representing the highest quality of life.</description>

    <description>Perceptions of belonging will be measured with the 9 items in the &quot;belonging&quot; subscale of the Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire. Each item is rated on a 3-pt scale: 'not at all true for me' (0), 'somewhat true for me' (1), or 'very true for me' (2). Some items are reverse scored so that higher scores represent better outcomes (i.e., greater belonging). Scores represent a sum of all items and can range from 0 - 18.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Meaning and Purpose</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS Meaning and Purpose short form has 4 items, rated from 1 ('not at all'), 2 ('a little bit'), 3 ('somewhat'), 4 ('quite a bit'), and 5 ('very much'). Total scores are transformed using a T-score metric in which 50 is the mean of the reference population and 10 is the standard deviation (SD) of that population. For the Meaning and Purpose form, the reference group was a general (not clinical) population. Greater scores indicate a better outcome (i.e., greater meaning and purpose).</description>

    <ipd_description>The final dataset will include self-reported demographic and behavioral data from interviews with the subjects. The final dataset will be stripped of identifiers prior to release for sharing; however, we will make the data and associated documentation available to users only under a data-sharing agreement as suggested by the NIH that provides for: (1) a commitment to using the data only for research purposes and not to identify any individual participant; (2) a commitment to securing the data using appropriate computer technology; and (3) a commitment to destroying or returning the data after analyses are completed. Data from this research will be made available to the public in the University of Rochester's institutional repository, UR Research, at https://urresearch.rochester.edu. UR Research is fully searchable in its own right, and is also regularly indexed by Google, so that its contents are accessible from the results of Google searches.</ipd_description>
