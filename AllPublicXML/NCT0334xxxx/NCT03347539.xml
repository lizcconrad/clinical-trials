    <textblock>
      This study explores reasons why adolescents choose to receive a nexplanon implant and remove
      a Nexplanon implant. Nexplanon is provided as part of the standard of care on the University
      of Chicago mobile health unit. This study explores reasons for implantation and removal of
      Nexplanon on this mobile health unit.

    <description>This group is participants who choose to remove the nexplanon implant. This group will only have one study interaction in the form of filling out a survey, at the time of removal. Anyone with a Nexplanon implant can have the implant removed on the mobile health unit and become part of this group - removal participants do not need to be in the Nexplanon group.</description>
