    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 non-randomized, open label, uncontrolled, efficacy and safety study. Study
      participants will receive two priming doses of 0.5mL of DPX-Survivac 21 days apart and up to
      six 0.1ml booster vaccinations every two months with low dose metronomic oral
      cyclophosphamide (50 mg BID) for one year or until disease progression, whichever occurs
      first.

      Pembrolizumab 200 mg will be administered every 3 weeks for up to one year or until disease
      progression, whichever occurs first.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, non-randomized, open-label, uncontrolled, efficacy and safety trial.

      Participants will receive 2 priming injections (0.5ml) of the DPX-Survivac vaccine 3 weeks
      apart on Study Days 7 and 28. In addition, up to 6 booster vaccinations (0.1ml) over the
      course of the study occurring on Study Days 84, 140, 196, 252, 308, and 364. All injections
      will be given under the skin of the upper thigh.

      Participants will receive metronomic oral cyclophosphamide (50mg BID; 7 days on / 7 days off)
      for study period.

      Pembrolizumab 200mg will be administered intravenously every 3 weeks, commencing on study day
      7, to a total of 18 infusions.

      If a subject is removed from the trial prior to the completion of at least 4 doses of
      Pembrolizumab and 3 vaccinations of DPX-Survivac, that subject may be replaced to determine
      the efficacy of treatment in a minimum of 16 subjects.

      DPX-Survivac injection sites will be evaluated throughout the study and if evidence of
      significant reaction, an Injection site reaction biopsy will be sought.

      During the course of the study, blood will be drawn to evaluate immune cells and the effect
      that the vaccinations have on the participants immune system. During all treatment cycles a
      physical exam and questions about the participants general health will be performed.

      Participant will undergo &quot;re-staging&quot; to assess the status of their disease at approximately
      study day 70 (if there is evidence of Grade 2 or greater injection site reaction or
      ulceration evident on study day 49) or routinely at approximately study day 91 and repeated
      at end of study or study withdrawal for all participants.

      A follow-up tumour biopsy will be requested between study day 77-83 for subjects with any
      grade 2 or greater Injection site reaction or ulceration on SD49 or between SD98 and SD104 if
      no evidence of injection site reaction or ulceration.

      Upon completion of study, participants will be monitored every 2 months for 1 year.
