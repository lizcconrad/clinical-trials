    <textblock>
      Background:

      Researchers do not know much about the causes of congenital heart disease (CHD). They do know
      that many factors play a role. Some factors are environmental. Some are genetic. But few
      specific factors have been identified. And researchers do not know how many involve genes.
      They want to study data that has already been collected from people with CHD and their
      families.

      Objectives:

      To identify genetic variations related to CHD. To study molecules related to vascular disease
      in order to learn new ways to treat it.

      Eligibility:

      People who already participated in the Pediatric Cardiac Genomics Consortium (PCGC) study

      Design:

      Researchers will study data that was already collected in the PCGC. There will be no active
      participants.

      Researchers will get access to the data through the coordinating center. They will not
      download data to local storage devices.

      The data will have no personally identifying information....

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current understanding of the causes of congenital heart disease (CHD) is limited, but CHD is
      known to be multifactorial and affected by a combination of environmental, teratogenic, and
      genetic causes. Furthermore, both genetic and environmental factors have been proposed to act
      as disease modifiers, accounting for a wide variation in phenotypic expression and clinical
      outcomes of these disorders. To date however, few specific genetic or environmental causative
      factors have been identified, nor is it even known what proportion of cases involve genetic
      factors.
