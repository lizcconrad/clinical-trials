  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rod-cone dystrophies (often referred to as retinitis pigmentosa (RP)) are a clinically
      and genetically heterogeneous group of disorders in which there is progressive loss of rod
      and later cone photoreceptor function leading to severe visual impairment. RP usually occurs
      as an isolated retinal disorder, but it may also be seen in association with systemic
      abnormalities.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      X-linked Retinitis Pigmentosa (XLRP) is a severe form of RP with early onset of nyctalopia
      and progression to legal blindness by the 3rd to 4th decade. Most affected males show
      symptomatic night blindness before the age of 10 years, are often myopic and show fundus
      abnormalities and ERG changes in early childhood. Examination of close female relatives is
      helpful in the absence of a family history, as the recognition of the XL carrier state will
      confirm the diagnosis.
