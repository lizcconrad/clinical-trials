  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endometriosis is a chronic gynecological disease characterized by sustained painful symptoms
      that are responsible for a decline in the quality of life of sufferers. Endometriosis is
      fairly common, affecting an estimated 10%-15% of women and girls, usually during their
      reproductive years. Based on these rough estimates, the latest epidemiological studies
      suggest that over 200 million women are might be affected who may commonly have infertility
      problems. V-Endo is a tableted preparation derived from hydrolyzed, heat-inactivated, pooled
      blood of women with endometriosis. When taken orally it is postulated to cause the immune
      tolerance and anti-inflammatory effect as a result.

      Anatomically endometriosis is characterized by the presence of endometrial-type mucosa
      outside the uterine cavity. This tissue proliferates and causes chronic inflammation
      resulting in pain and excessive menstrual bleeding. Conventional treatment includes surgical
      and pharmacological therapy aiming at reducing painful symptoms. However, there is an unmet
      need in finding optimally safe and effective treatment. This study aimed to evaluate the
      effect of V-Endo on pain levels in women with endometriosis, focusing on reducing
      inflammation by immunotherapeutic intervention.

For pain intensity, the scale is most commonly anchored by &quot;no pain&quot; (score of 0) and &quot;pain as bad as it could be&quot; or &quot;worst imaginable pain&quot; (score of 10).</description>
