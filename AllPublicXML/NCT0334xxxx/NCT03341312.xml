    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a new formulation of insulin lispro, LY900014, which
      is a drug that lowers blood sugar. The study will look at how the body processes LY900014,
      and the effect of LY900014 on blood sugar levels following a standard meal. For each
      participant, the study will consist of 4 periods and will last approximately 12 weeks from
      screening to final study follow up.
