    <textblock>
      Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is a condition in which the vessels carrying blood to the lungs
      become suddenly blocked, usually by a blood clot. There are a number of adverse consequences
      that result, with one of the most significant being strain on the right side of the heart
      (which must push blood through the blocked arteries to the lungs). Although this strain on
      the right heart is very important, current methods for measuring it are flawed. The standard
      practice is to obtain an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart), from which indirect
      measurements of the size of the heart are used to make inferences about right heart strain.
      This method can help guide management in some patients, but it in not a sensitive test and
      does not provide detailed information.

      Patients with PE are treated with blood thinning medications. Some patients may be referred
      to the Interventional Radiology (IR) team for endovascular intervention, in which catheters
      are placed into the patient's vessels under radiologic guidance and advanced to the lungs to
      remove the clot entirely.

      Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a well-established imaging technique that
      produces highly detailed images of the heart's structure and function, with no risks to
      patients of ionizing radiation or intravenous contrast. Cardiac MRI is far superior to
      echocardiogram in evaluation of the right side of the heart, however it has not been widely
      used in the evaluation of patients with PE. We propose that by using a fast MRI protocol, we
      will be able to detect right heart strain with more accuracy than echocardiogram.
      Furthermore, we hypothesize that MRI images obtained before and after IR catheter-directed
      therapy will demonstrate the degree to which strain is relieved with this treatment. Finally,
      we believe that using MRI may help to guide management of patients with PE by detecting early
      or mild heart strain before it progresses.

      In order to test these hypotheses, we plan to image PE patients who have been referred to the
      IR team with MRI. Patients recruited for this study will undergo two short MRI scans - one
      immediately before treatment, and one after completion of IR treatment (which lasts
      approximately 12-24 hours).

    <textblock>
      Pulmonary embolism occurs when embolic material (usually clot in the venous system) travels
      to the heart and lodges in the pulmonary vasculature. This obstruction, if significant, can
      lead to pulmonary arterial hypertension, which places increased demand on the right ventricle
      (RV), which must pump against the blockage. This can manifest as right ventricular
      dysfunction (RVD), which is characterized by dilatation of the RV, wall motion abnormalities
      and other structural and functional changes. There is a significant body of data
      demonstrating that function of the RV is an important prognostic indicator in patients with
      acute PE. In these studies, RVD allowed identification of patients who, although clinically
      stable on presentation, were at risk for hemodynamic instability and high
      morbidity/mortality. As a result, many authors have suggested that RVD represents an
      important indication for more aggressive therapy in patients with submassive PE.

      Currently, echocardiography is the most commonly used method for evaluating the RV in acute
      PE. However, obtaining quality imaging of the RV using echocardiography is technically
      difficult, and determining a reliable indicator of RV function has proved challenging. A
      number of markers of right ventricular function have been described, including size criteria,
      ejection fraction, wall motion, tricuspid regurgitation, paradoxical septal motion, and
      others. However, there is no general consensus on which methodology or measurements produce
      the most clinically meaningful data. The American Heart Association guidelines for submassive
      pulmonary embolism use the ratio of the right ventricle to left ventricle at end diastole
      (RV:LV ratio), which is defined as greater than 0.9 in patients with RVD. However, there is a
      large degree of heterogeneity in echocardiographic criteria for RVD used in the literature.

      Additionally, the quantitative data provided by echocardiography is suspect, as they show
      only modest correlation with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) or computed tomography
      (CT) in evaluation of the RV. Even when specifically utilizing the American Society of
      Echocardiography guidelines, echocardiography proves to be significantly less accurate than
      cMRI for evaluation of the RV, especially in patients with a dilated ventricle.

      Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is considered the reference standard for accurate
      evaluation of ventricular structure and function. It has proven its accuracy, reliability,
      and prognostic value in the setting of other pathologies that result in RV dysfunction, such
      as pulmonary hypertension. However, to date, this modality has not been used to provide
      detailed information about the structure and function of the RV in patients with acute PE.

      Recently, new therapies for acute PE have come into use that allow more precise treatment of
      the embolus itself through the use of endovascular catheters. These catheter-directed
      therapies (CDTs) deliver thrombolytic medication or other treatment strategies directly to
      the pulmonary circulation. There is a strong body of evidence supporting the use of these
      therapies, and some devices have been FDA-approved for this indication. Despite this, there
      is a lack of definitive markers for the patients who would benefit most from this therapy.
      Additionally, techniques currently used to attempt to quantify response to therapy (such as
      RV:LV ratio) are not ideal. There remains a need for a quantitative method for evaluating the
      structure and function of the RV in patients with acute PE in order to determine their risk
      for hemodynamic compromise, the need for CDT, and response after therapy is completed.
