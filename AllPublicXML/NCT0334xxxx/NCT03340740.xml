  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of cetirizine, an oral antihistamine, on
      wheezing in patients with allergic rhinitis. Patients presenting to the pediatric emergency
      department who have a history of allergic rhinitis and who are wheezing will be asked to
      participate. Half of patients will receive a dose of cetirizine and the other half will
      receive placebo and their response will be monitored over the course of their emergency
      department visit with vital signs, physical examinations, and measurement of
      bronchoconstriction with spirometry.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized, placebo-controlled trial to look at the effect of
      cetirizine on bronchoconstriction in patients with allergic rhinitis who present to the
      Pediatric Emergency Department with wheezing. Oral second generation antihistamines such as
      cetirizine are already the standard of care for allergic rhinitis. Wheezing pediatric
      patients with allergic rhinitis who are not already on this therapy will be randomized to
      receive either age-appropriate-dosed cetirizine or placebo in addition to standard asthma
      therapy at the discretion of the treating clinician, and will be monitored every 30 minutes
      with asthma scores and FEV1 measurements. At the conclusion of 3 hours, each patient who
      received placebo will receive a dose of cetirizine, and each patient who received cetirizine
      will receive a placebo medication dose, such that initiating therapy for allergic rhinitis is
      delayed by no more than 3 hours.
