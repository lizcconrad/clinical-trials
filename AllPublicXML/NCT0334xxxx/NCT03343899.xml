  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of our study will be to analyze the interplay between particular VDR variants
      and its ligand in cells obtained from intervertebral disc and cartilage endplate and their
      action on cell proliferation and phenotype maintenance. The identification of novel molecular
      targets in the vitamin D pathway, potentially promoting pathological alterations of the
      tissues involved in spinal disc diseases, will allow to develop innovative and more
      personalized preventive and pharmacological/nutritional therapies.
