  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to learn about 2 types of FDA-approved catheters used
      in angiographic (X-ray of blood vessels, with radiopaque substance) procedures like DEB-TACE
      treatment. The Principal Investigator will check the beads given during the DEB-TACE. They
      will compare the way in which they are spread out in the tumor and density (how condensed
      something is).
