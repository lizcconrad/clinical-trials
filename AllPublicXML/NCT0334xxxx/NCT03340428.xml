  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV remains the leading cause of death in South Africa as a result of a failure of people
      living with HIV to seek HIV treatment and be retained in care. After initiating
      antiretroviral therapy while incarcerated, most ex-inmates fail to remain engaged in care.
      The goal of this research is to reduce mortality, morbidity, and HIV transmission by
      developing an actionable approach to retaining these individuals in HIV care.

  <detailed_description>

      To pilot a randomized clinical trial of a transition adherence club (TCAC) versus traditional
      care, among ex-inmates receiving antiretroviral therapy in South Africa, to study
      feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness using mixed methods.

      Investigators will pilot an RCT of the TCAC compared to traditional care among
      inmates/ex-inmates measuring transition in care, six-month viral load suppression, and
      follow-up of participants. Feasibility will be assessed by process measures. Acceptability
      will be assessed using in-depth interviews among 36 participants and 10 staff. Effectiveness
      will be assessed by a difference in proportions in-care with an undetectable viral load at 6
      months and difference in bonding social capital and care satisfaction between arms.
