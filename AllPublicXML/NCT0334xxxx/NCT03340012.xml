  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of intrabony defects in patients with aggressive periodontitis remains a
      challenging procedure and novel therapeutic strategies are sought. The purpose of this study
      is to compare the clinical and radiographic outcomes of using guided tissue regeneration
      (GTR) with radiation-sterilized allogenic bone grafts (material prepared in the Central
      Tissue Bank in Warsaw, Poland) versus guided tissue regeneration with xenogenic grafts
      (Bio-Oss®, Geistlich Biomaterials, Princeton, New Jersey, United States) in the treatment of
      localized intrabony defects in patients with aggressive periodontitis.

    <description>CAL will be measured in millimeters on the study teeth at 6 locations as a distance from the cementoenamel junction to the bottom of the gingival sulcus. The average differences between 12 months and baseline measurements at the sites with the most advanced attachment loss at baseline will be compared.</description>

    <description>The surgical procedure will be performed in line with minimally invasive surgical technique by Cortellini and Tonetti (2007). The intrabony defects will be debrided and the roots will be planned. The required quantity of radiation-sterilized allogenic bone graft will be delivered into intrabony defects. Subsequently, a trimmed collagen membrane will be placed over graft. The flaps will be sutured with non-absorbable modified internal mattress sutures.</description>
