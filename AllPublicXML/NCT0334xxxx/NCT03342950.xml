  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Microvascular dysfunction underlies pain in different animal models of neuropathic pain.
      Pentoxifylline is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that reduces cyclic adenosine monophosphate
      (cAMP) hydrolysis, enhances blood flow and reduces platelet aggregation, decreases blood
      viscosity, and increases the flexibility of red blood cells, all of which relieve
      microvascular dysfunction. Clonidine is an α2-adrenergic receptor agonist that decreases
      sympathetic outflow from the brainstem, vascular reactivity and has direct peripheral
      vasodilatory action. Topical combination of pentoxifylline and clonidine produced significant
      antiallodynic effects in rat models of neuropathic pain with sciatic nerve injury, painful
      diabetic neuropathy, and chemotherapy-induced painful neuropathy. In healthy volunteers with
      an experimentally-induced surrogate for neuropathic pain: post-capsaicin tourniquet exposure,
      the topical combination reduced areas of dynamic allodynia and mechanical hyperalgesia, in
      addition to reducing post-capsaicin ischemic pain.

      This study will investigate if the same topical combination of clonidine + pentoxifylline
      will relieve pain in patients with neuropathic pain following traumatic injuries of
      peripheral nerves.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in visual analogue scale (VAS) score of spontaneous pain intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>Scores recorded on pain diary on trial day 1, day 14 , day 21 and day 35 will be used</time_frame>
    <description>This will be an evaluation of patients' daily spontaneous pain recorded on a pain diary. The visual analogue scale is a 100 millimetre line with the words &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;worst pain possible&quot; on the left and right of it respectively. The patients will indicate their level of pain by marking on the line. The position of the mark on the line from the left end to the right will be measured in millimetres to obtain level of pain severity (The higher the VAS score the more severe the pain) . Change in VAS score will be obtained by comparing the difference between scores recorded on trial day 1 versus trial day 14 and trial day 21 versus trial day 35.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in visual analogue scale (VAS) score of dynamic mechanical allodynia (DMA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Scores obtained from tests performed on trial day 1, day 14, day 21 and day 35 will be used.</time_frame>
    <description>The degree of dynamic mechanical allodynia will be determined by stroking the most painfully sensitive area of the skin three times over 5 seconds at a rate of 1-2 cm/s with a Somedic brush. The patient will indicate the amount of pain evoked on a 100-millimeter visual analogue scale (VAS) by marking on a 100 mm line with the words &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;worst pain possible&quot; on the left and right of it respectively. The position of the mark on the line from the left end to the right will be measured in millimetres to obtain level of dynamic mechanical allodynia (The higher the VAS score the more severe the dynamic mechanical allodynia). The change in dynamic mechanical allodynia will be assessed by comparing the scores obtained on trial day 1 versus day 14 and scores obtained on day 21 versus day 35.</description>

    <measure>Analysis of pain relief</measure>
    <time_frame>Scores will be obtained on trial day 14 and day 35.</time_frame>
    <description>Pain relief measured on a 6-point categorical pain relief scale (0-worse pain to 5-complete pain relief). The higher the score the greater the pain relief.</description>

    <measure>Change in area of Punctate Hyperalgesia</measure>
    <time_frame>Measurements will be performed on trial day 1, day 14 , day 21 and day 35.</time_frame>
    <description>Area of punctate hyperalgesia will be obtained by marking and calculating the area of sensitivity to punctate stimulation of the skin with a Neuropen. Change in area of punctate hyperalgesia will be obtained by comparing the areas measured on trial day 1 versus trial day 14 and trial day 21 versus trial day 35.</description>
