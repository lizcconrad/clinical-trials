  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objectives of modern antenatal care programs are to identify high risk pregnancies
      then to predict any possibility of adverse pregnancy outcome as early as possible.

      The earliest attempts to achieve this goal were possible with the introduction of ultrasound
      in obstetrical practice in the 1950s. A breakthrough that enabled obstetricians to directly
      visualize the fetus, placenta and amniotic fluid. At first 2-dimensional (2D) imaging was
      employed whereby fetal biometry and placental location were detected. Later on, Doppler
      measurements &amp; 3-dimensional (3D) representation became feasible further revolutionizing this
      area

    <description>A 3D volume of the uterus will be acquired by transabdominal sonography. The sweep angle was set at 85º and the probe will be kept perpendicular to the placental plate. The placenta will be examined and the size of the volume box will be adapted in such a way that the placenta fitted into it completely. The volume will then stored for later offline analysis.</description>
