  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Assisted Autogenic Drainage (AAD) or
      bouncing combined with Assisted Autogenic Drainage (BAAD), induces or aggravates acid and
      non-acid gastro-oesophageal reflux in infants under the age of one year. Infants, referred to
      the hospital for impedance-pH monitoring are included in this study.

    <description>AAD is an airway clearance technique for infants based upon the principles of autogenic drainage. By modulating manually the functional breathing level within the vital capacity, optimal airflow will be obtained at the targeted airway generations, where secretions have been identified. A gentle increase of manual pressure on the chest during each inspiration is performed to guide the breathing of the patient towards the desired lung volume level. During expiration the breathing movement of the patient is followed gently.</description>

    <description>AAD is an airway clearance technique for infants based upon the principles of autogenic drainage .AAD sometimes leads to crying or resistance against therapy.Bouncing (at low amplitude:6-8 cm) in a stable upright position is a gentle up-and-down movement on a physio ball. It is not an ACT, but used to maximize the relaxation of the infant, avoiding resistance against or crying during treatment. Due to the relaxing effect of bouncing, infants appear to tolerate better AAD, increasing the effectiveness of the treatment.</description>

    <description>In this controlled trial with intra-subject design infants will be studied using multichannel intraluminal impedance pH (pH-MII) monitoring , during which they receive one 20 min session of AAD . The number of reflux episodes (RE) is the outcome measure. The results obtained during and 20 min after the intervention will be compared to a period of 20 min before treatment ( control ).</description>
