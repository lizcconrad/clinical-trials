      This will be a 1:1 randomized open label trial. European and outside Europe centres will be
      involved. Aim of the project is to conduct a head-to-head comparison of effectiveness of two
      approved disease modifying treatments (DMTs) in patients with relapsing remitting multiple
      sclerosis (RRMS). The term effectiveness refers to efficacy in a real life setting: this is
      intended to be in fact the first pragmatic multi-centre randomised controlled trial to
      directly assess the effectiveness of the new oral agents approved for MS (fingolimod/FTY
      versus dimethyl-fumarate/DMF) on disease activity, disability progression, quality of life,
      functioning and symptoms. It will be a randomized trial taking place in clinical care setting
      and comparing existing therapies, any of which may constitute standard care for naive
      patients or sub optimal responders to first-line drugs. Post hoc analysis will also identify
      the better treatment strategy on the different patient subgroups. Patient overall disease
      experience will be considered for the first time as the most important outcome. In fact, in
      addition to classical &quot;no evidence of disease activity&quot; (NEDA), a new composite NEDA taking
      account also of patient point of view and quality of life, will be proposed. Finally,the
      specific effectiveness profile of the two DMTs will be addressed, by exploring comparative
      benefits on different outcomes (disease activity, disability progression, brain atrophy,
      quality of life, fatigue, psychiatric and cognitive symptoms, medication satisfaction).

      Background and significance

        1. The expansion of the treatment landscape in MS has increased the complexity of treatment
           decisions. Recommendations and algorithms can help to maximize the benefit of each
           available therapy; however, there is currently no consensus algorithm available, with
           most of the recently published recommendations being regional and most guidelines
           currently used in clinical practice, being driven by the labels of the therapies. The
           lack of head-to-head clinical trials for approved drugs is crucial since head-to-head
           trials constitute the gold standard for efficacy comparisons. This kind of information
           is mandatory for informed and objective health decisions. The present proposal aims at
           filling this critical gap in evidence. Randomized head-to-head trials are the best
           method for evaluating the efficacy of different treatments and to help the clinicians
           and the patients in health decision making. Randomized controlled trials, designed as
           experiments with high internal validity, have the ability to determine cause effect
           relationships. These experiments employ comprehensive designs to control for most, if
           not all, sources of bias by means of randomization, blinding, allocation concealment,
           etc. Usually, extended inclusion and exclusion criteria are used to identify a clearly
           defined population group of participants who would benefit from the intervention under
           investigation. Although the above experimental design, if correctly applied, leads to
           well-controlled trials with statistically credible results, the applicability of these
           results to real life practice may be questionable.

        2. Here we aim at conducting a comparative open label trial preserving the internal
           validity due to randomization and generalizability due to a pragmatic design. The term
           pragmatic is used for trials designed to test the effectiveness of the intervention in a
           broad routine clinical practice. The explanatory trial is designed in order to control
           for all known biases and confounders, so that the intervention's effect is maximized.
           The pragmatic trial, on the other hand, is designed to test interventions in the full
           spectrum of everyday clinical settings in order to maximize applicability and
           generalizability.1 This is intended to be the first pragmatic multi-centre randomised
           controlled trial to directly assess the effectiveness of the new oral agents approved
           for MS (FTY/gilenya versus DMF/tecfidera). FTY (0.5 mg/day) and DMF (240 mg twice daily)
           are both efficacious in the treatment of MS and both offer the convenience of an oral
           administration. As such they are similarly valuable alternative treatments for MS
           patients, and are indeed frequently proposed as possible alternative treatment options
           to MS patients. Indication for FTY is restricted in Europe to second line in first-line
           therapy non responders or in active naïve patients. DMF is highly prescribed also in
           active naive patients and as switching strategy in patients who do not adequately
           respond to self-injectable DMTs, such as FTY.

      The need for randomized trials with approved drugs exists when treatment decision in clinical
      practice is challenged by the lack of evidence of superiority of one drug for a specific
      group of patients.

      The efficacy profile of the two oral drug have been characterized in large clinical
      development programs. Oral therapies have been shown to offer benefits with regard to these
      clinical and MRI outcomes when compared with placebo in phase 3 trials.2-5 The clinical
      efficacy of these therapies over traditional injectable DMTs has been demonstrated for FTY in
      the trial assessing injectable interferon versus FTY720 oral in RRMS (TRANSFORMS).6 Findings
      of these phase 3 trials indicate that oral therapies may represent an advance in the
      treatment of MS because they offer effective treatment options that are often better
      tolerated and more convenient than the traditional injectable DMTs. there are no head-to-head
      controlled trials comparing the efficacy of the different oral DMTs. This is an area of much
      interest to neurologists and healthcare decision makers; therefore, indirect treatment
      comparisons have recently been performed. Of these, a recent study has compared FTY with DMF
      using a network meta-analysis approach and found no significant differences in relapse rate
      or in the proportion of patients with disability progression.7 Standard network meta-analysis
      methods may be susceptible to bias because of differences in trial populations and
      methodologies. Subgroup and post hoc analyses of the phase 3 trials of DMTs have demonstrated
      that differences in patient baseline characteristics influence the observed effect of DMTs on
      relapse rate and disability progression,,6,8 and that the application of different
      definitions of disability progression has a large impact on disability outcomes.9 Therefore,
      it is important to adjust for these potentially confounding factors when assessing the
      comparative efficacy of these oral DMTs. It has been reported that FTY therapy results in a
      higher probability of no evidence of disease activity (NEDA) than DMF therapy when phase 3
      trial data are indirectly compared and differences between trials are adjusted for.10 These
      findings must, however, be interpreted with caution, owing to the assumptions inherent in any
      modeling approach.

      The need for high-quality, widely applicable evidence is gaining momentum, especially amidst
      health care policy makers. The increased costs of interventions and health care in a
      resource-limited environment have fueled the demand for clinically effective and applicable
      evidence. Here we aim at conducting a comparative open label trial preserving the internal
      validity due to randomization and generalizability due to a pragmatic design. It will be the
      first randomized pragmatic trials in MS. Policy makers have an active interest in pragmatic
      trials, since these are designed to answer the question most relevant to a decision maker's
      agenda: comparative effectiveness of interventions in the routine practice. The availability
      of comparative data from routine practice will help policy makers to efficiently allocate
      resources and manpower and will drive patients and clinicians in shared and informed health
      decisions. The evolving MS landscape, in which a number of new treatments are appearing—each
      with their own benefits and risks—will require a change in the nature of interactions between
      patients and their physicians, with a shared approach to clinical decision making that
      emphasizes patient-related goals. Together, these innovations in MS management offer exciting
      new opportunities to optimize treatment outcomes. This will necessitate attention both to
      traditional clinical endpoints such as relapses and disability, to objective radiological
      surrogates of disease activity, and to newer outcome measures such as brain atrophy ,
      cognition and patient-reported outcomes. In line with this, the present proposal aims at
      comparing the effectiveness of two oral MS agents on patient overall disease experience. If,
      traditionally, both clinical trials and routine medical care have relied on outcomes assessed
      by healthcare professionals, here we want to focus also on the importance of self-evaluation
      of health, thus growing participation of individuals in their own care. We can foresee a
      continuum where patient empowerment contributes to improve his/her healthcare and, at the
      same time, makes valuable medical data accessible to the medical community for future
      therapeutic developments.

      The whole idea of applicable and generalizable research is very appealing and of benefit to
      the health sciences community.
