  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adaptive gait assessements will be evaluated as a potential new marker for tracking locomotor
      recovery throughout rehabilitation of spinal cord injury subjects. To this end, controls,
      subacute and chronic patients will be assessed at two timepoints with 3 month standard
      rehabilitation inbetween. The specific assessments will require the participant to acitvely
      modulate their gait pattern to fullfill specific task constraints. Their performance will be
      assessed via 3D kinematics, kinetics and EMG and these measures will be used to describe the
      adaptive capacity that the patient retains. Sensitivity and specificity of these markers will
      be determined. With more sensitive descriptors of gait function and quality, locomotor
      rehabilitation for SCI can be better designed and smaller effects can be accurately measured.
