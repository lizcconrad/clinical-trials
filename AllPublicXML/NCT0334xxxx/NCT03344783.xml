      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether early life natural exposure to fatty acid
      affects the AD risk.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of Allergic Diseases (AD) is rising dramatically worldwide especially in more
      industrialized countries during the past two decades, representing a substantial disease
      burden of individuals and health service cost. Early life nutritional exposures could modify
      the gene expression and susceptibility of allergic diseases (AD), yet the effects of early
      life polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and ruminant trans fatty acids (R-TFA) on AD remain
      unclear.Therefore,the investigators performed the meta-analysis and systematic review to
      evaluate whether early life natural exposure to PUFA and R-TFA affects the AD risk.

    <description>PUFA and R-TFA exposure were assessed mainly from maternal dietary, blood sample or breast milk. Exposure period was restricted to early life. Dietary PUFA and R-TFA were measured by food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ) or diet history questionnaire (DHQ). The profile of PUFA and R-TFA in the blood sample and breast milk were examined by using gas chromatography</description>

        Among these studies, most of them were performed in Europe. The sample size ranged from 65
        to 4,976, with a median sample size of 708. One study included only boys, while the others
        included both sexes. Mother's mean age ranged from 27.5 to 38.7 years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Studies needed to provide endpoints of AD, and risk estimates [odds risk (OR),
             relative risk (RR) or hazard ratio (HR)] for PUFA or R-TFA as the exposure. We
             included English language articles only, while scanned titles /abstracts of
             non-English language articles to evaluate agreement with the results published in
             English.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Studies were excluded if they didn't report the profile of PUFA or R-TFA, or if they
             targeted participants with medical condition.
