      The main objective of the trial is to demonstrate the efficacy of dupilumab administered
      concomitantly with topical corticosteroids (TCS) in participants ≥6 years to &lt;12 years of age
      with severe atopic dermatitis (AD).

      The secondary objective is to assess the safety of dupilumab administered concomitantly with
      TCS in patients ≥6 years to &lt;12 years of age with severe AD.
