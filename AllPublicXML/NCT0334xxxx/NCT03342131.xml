  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to find the change of serum wnt effectory moleculars and the association with
      Hs-CRP，cTnI and Prognosis in Patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been reported that wnt effecory moleculars (wnt2, wnt4, wnt11,wnt10b, DKK1, DKK2)
      increased in myocardium at acute phase after myocardium infarction in animal experiment.
      These moleculars can be detected in serum or plasma from human subjects. However, there is
      few relevant studies about wnt2 and wnt4 concentration in patients with acute coronary
      syndrome. This study valuates the serum wnt2 and wnt4 concentration in patients with acute
      coronary syndrome. It will possibly enable to find the relationship between serum wnt2 or
      wnt4 concentration and Hs-CRP, cTnI and prognosis in patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome.

    <description>The study population consists of 150 patients with ST-elevated acute myocardial infarction (STEMI) who are admitted within 24 hours after chest pain attack. They will all undergo coronary angiography. The diagnosis is made according to American Heart Association (AHA, 2014 and 2015) guidelines. Patients who had autoimmune diseases, malignancies, chronic or acute infections, asthma, severe heart failure (NYHA class 3 and 4) and advanced liver or renal diseases are excluded. Blood (150 each group) is obtained into ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid（EDTA） tubes from all subjects via antecubital venepuncture to explore circulating wnt 2 and wnt 4 concentration by ELISA at 0 , 7days and 12 months after admission.</description>

    <description>Blood (150 each group) is obtained into ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid（EDTA） tubes from all subjects via antecubital venepuncture to explore circulating wnt 2 and wnt 4 concentration by ELISA. Continuous wnt2 and wnt4 concentration are measured in all patients with STEMI at 0 , 7days and 12 months after admission. Other patients with acute syndrome system are measured Wnt 2 and wnt4 only once within 24h after admission.
