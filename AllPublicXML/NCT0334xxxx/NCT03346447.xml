        The study population consists of 24 Caucasian females, age 18-40, in good general health
        and free from dermatological conditions in the testing area.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Fluent in English, willing and able to read, understand, and sign the informed

             instructions; 3. Females aged 18 to 40 years, in good general health as deemed by the
             investigator (no physical required).

             4. Caucasian individuals with Fitzpatrick skin type I, II, or III (See Appendix I).

             5. Individuals free of any systemic or dermatological disorder including a known
             history of allergies or other medical conditions which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, could interfere with the conduct of the study, interpretation of
             results, or increase the risk of adverse reactions.

             6. Anticipated ability to complete the course of the study and to comply with
             instructions.

             7. Females practicing an acceptable method of birth control (abstinence is
             acceptable). Females of child-bearing potential must have practiced an acceptable
             method of birth control for the past 3 months and be willing to continue using the
             same method throughout the duration of the study. Acceptable methods of birth control,
             include: 1) Systemic birth control (Subjects must have been taking the same type of
             birth control for at least 3 months prior to entering the study and must not change
             the type of birth control during the study); 2) Condom with spermicide; 3) IUD; 4)
             Vasectomized partner; and 5) Abstinence. Females who are post-menopausal (for at least
             1 year) or have had a permanent sterilization procedure (i.e. hysterectomy, tubal
             ligation, bilateral oophorectomy) do not need to have additional birth control
             methods.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Individuals with any visible skin disease, skin condition (e.g., back acne)
             including baseline erythema assessment &gt; 0.5, or tattoos in the test area (mid to
             upper back).

             2. Individuals with abnormal skin pigmentation at the test sites, which might
             interfere with subsequent evaluations of dermal responsiveness.

             3. Individuals with recent prolonged sun or tanning bed exposure in the test area 4.
             Individuals with excessive dryness or redness at the sites of application. 5.
             Individuals with a known hypersensitivity to any of the components of the insult,
             controls, or adhesive tapes.

             6. Subjects must not have applied any lotions, creams, powders, or oils to their backs
             the morning of the study. Additionally, two hours must have passed since bathing or
             showering.

             7. Women who are pregnant or nursing. 8. Individuals who have participated on a study
             involving the test sites (back) in the previous 30 days.

             9. Individuals participating in another clinical study 10. Individuals with open or
             healing cuts/incisions, abrasions, lesions, pustules, fissures, or broken mucosa/skin
             in the test area
