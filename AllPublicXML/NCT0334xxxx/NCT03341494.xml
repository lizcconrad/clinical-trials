  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      EGFR-TKIs are the standard first-line treatment option for EGFR-mutant NSCLC. After a
      randomized phase II trial, JO25567 was presented at 2014 ASCO, the synergistic effect of
      progression-free survival(PFS) could be expected when EGFR TKI, Gefitinib is combined with
      Antiangiogenesis agent thalidomide, Therefore Chinese data of treating EGFR mutation positive
      NSCLC patients with Gefitinib and thalidomide is significantly necessary for developing new
      standard treatment in first-line therapy in Chinese EGFR mutant NSCLC patients.

      In this study, The investigators will investigate the efficacy and safety of Gefitinib and
      thalidomide combination compare to Gefitinib alone in Chinese EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients.

      EGFR-TKIs are the standard first-line treatment option for EGFR-mutant NSCLC. After a
      randomized phase II trial, JO25567 was presented at 2014 ASCO, the synergistic effect of
      progression-free survival(PFS) could be expected when EGFR TKI, Gefitinib is combined with
      Antiangiogenesis agent thalidomide, . Even Chinese and Japanese are classified as Asian based
      on location, the figure of Chinese is more tended to Western people due to the dietary life
      in recent years. However the incidence rate of EGFR mutation positive patients in Chinese is
      much higher than Western countries.

      Therefore Chinese data of treating EGFR mutation positive NSCLC patients with Gefitinib and
      thalidomide is significantly necessary for developing new standard treatment in first-line
      therapy in Chinese EGFR mutant NSCLC patients.

      In this study, The investigators will investigate the efficacy and safety of Gefitinib and
      thalidomide combination compare to Gefitinib alone in Chinese EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients.
