  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe the neutralizing antibody response against each
      dengue serotype at 1 month post second dose of TDV or placebo in dengue-naive adolescent
      participants.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The vaccine tested in this study is tetravalent dengue vaccine (TDV). TDV will be tested to
      assess the safety and immunogenicity in healthy adolescents in non-endemic area(s) for
      dengue.

      The study will enroll 400 healthy participants. Participants will be randomized in 3:1 ratio
      to receive:

        -  TDV 0.5 mL subcutaneous injection OR

        -  Placebo normal saline solution (0.9% NaCl) for injection. In each trial group, all
           participants will receive 2-dose schedule of TDV or placebo by subcutaneous injection on
           Days 1 (Month 0) and 90 (Month 3).

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Mexico. The overall time to participate in this
      study is 270 days. Participants will have multiple visits to the clinic including a final
      visit at Day 270.
