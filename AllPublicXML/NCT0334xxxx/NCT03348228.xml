  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hydroxycitrate (HCA) is a compound extracted from the fruit, Garcinia Cambogia.
      Hydroxycitrate supplements are available over the counter and are primarily promoted as a
      weight loss supplement. There has been recent evidence that hydroxycitrate is a potent
      inhibitor of calcium oxalate crystal growth and can lead to the dissolution of the crystals.
      The purpose of this research study is to study the effect of Hydroxycitrate (HCA) supplements
      on HCA urinary excretion and on urine chemistries in kidney stone formers and normal
      subjects.
