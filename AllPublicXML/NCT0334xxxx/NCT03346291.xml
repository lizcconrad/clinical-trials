      All participants will receive free weekly counseling (8- weeks) and free nicotine patches
      (10-weeks). They will complete assessment measures commonly used in smoking cessation
      studies. We hope to show that this treatment is feasible in this small pilot study before
      comparing it to a more established treatment in a future randomized clinical trial.

    <textblock>
      This study is a non-randomized trial of a new psychosocial treatment for smoking cessation
      (for smokers with schizophrenia) that is based on cognitive behavioral therapy for smoking
      cessation - a commonly used approach. Participants will receive free weekly counseling (8-
      weeks) and free nicotine patches (10-weeks). They will complete assessment measures commonly
      used in smoking cessation studies. We hope to show that this treatment is feasible in this
      small pilot study before comparing it to a more established treatment in a future randomized
      clinical trial.
