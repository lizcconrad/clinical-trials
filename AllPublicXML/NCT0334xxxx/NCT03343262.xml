  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT) is an abnormal metabolic state following glucose metabolic
      steady state but prior to diabetes. IGT is an important stage during the progression of
      diabetes, with an underlying mechanism of insulin resistance and pancreatic β cell
      dysfunction. IGT is one of the diseases that shows significant beneficial response to
      acupuncture treatment. Original findings from the investigators'laboratory show that
      transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) which is innervated by vagus nerve,
      would enhance the activity of pancreatic β cells, promote the secretion of insulin,
      upregulate the expression of insulin receptors in central as well as peripheral tissues, thus
      to improve glycometabolism. In this study, the investigators would further illuminate the
      mechanism of taVNS at &quot;yidan-pi&quot; auricular acupoints on the regulation of glucose metabolism,
      its improvement of the IGT state in rat model, as well as its regulation effect on insulin
      receptor expression and insulin resistance, and systematically illustrate the clinical
      effective of this treatment on IGT, with emphasize on its influence on the concentrations of
      glucose and HbA1c, and thus provide an effective proposal for clinical acupuncture.
