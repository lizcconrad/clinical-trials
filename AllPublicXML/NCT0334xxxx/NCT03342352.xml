  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination of
      nivolumab plus epacadostat in combination with chemotherapy in first-line recurrent or
      metastatic patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) when compared
      to the standard of care (EXTREME regimen).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Recurrent or metastatic carcinoma of the nasopharynx and paranasal sinuses, squamous
             cell carcinoma that originated from the skin and salivary gland or non-squamous
             histologies (e.g., mucosal melanoma) and SCCHN of unknown primary origin.

          -  Untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastases.

          -  Carcinomatous meningitis.

          -  Active, known or suspected autoimmune disease.
