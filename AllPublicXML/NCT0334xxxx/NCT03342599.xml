  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eight weeks supplementation of alpha lipoic acid (known superantioxidant already produced by
      the body) will significantly improve metabolic syndrome markers (e.g., excess body weight,
      blood pressure, glucose, insulin, blood lipids, and self-report measures) in young (18-25
      years) overweight or obese males compared to placebo (cellulose starch). If the hypothesis is
      supported, alpha lipoic acid ingestion could be beneficial in reducing disease risk and
      enhancing metabolic dysfunction in ethnic individuals. Therefore, the purpose is to establish
      the impact alpha lipoic acid has on the modifiable markers associated with metabolic
      perturbations consistent with metabolic syndrome in males.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Young adults exhibit an increasing prevalence of obesity, pre-diabetes, and metabolic
      syndrome that contribute to increased risk of type II diabetes and cardiovascular heart
      disease later in life. Twenty five percent of American adults have been diagnosed with
      metabolic syndrome, whereas the prevalence increases to 30 % in Mexican American adults
      between 30-70 years old. The risk in this population may be higher based on ethnicity and the
      rising obesity rates in young adults and children, although the definition of metabolic
      syndrome in younger age has yet to be established. Factors causing metabolic syndrome are
      complex but include a physically inactive lifestyle, an unhealthy diet made up of saturated
      fat and processed foods, and inherited influences. Therefore identifying the need to
      intervene early with a dietary intervention in order to combat the risk for future disease is
      vital. It is hypothesized that 8 weeks supplementation of alpha lipoic acid (known
      superantioxidant already produced by the body) will significantly improve metabolic syndrome
      markers (e.g., excess body weight, blood pressure, glucose, insulin, blood lipids, and
      self-report measures) in young (18-25 years) overweight or obese males compared to placebo
      (cellulose starch). If the hypothesis is supported, alpha lipoic acid ingestion could be
      beneficial in reducing disease risk and enhancing metabolic dysfunction in young individuals.
      Therefore, the purpose is to establish the impact alpha lipoic acid has on the modifiable
      markers associated with metabolic perturbations consistent with metabolic syndrome in males.
