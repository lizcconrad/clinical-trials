      This is a phase 4 prospective, nonrandomized, open label, interventional clinical trial.
      Study eyes will receive 5 required initial monthly IAI doses of 2 mg followed by 2q8 IAI for
      a total of 52 weeks; only one study eye from each patient will be enrolled.

      This is a phase 4 prospective, nonrandomized, open label, interventional clinical trial.
      Study eyes will receive 5 required initial monthly IAI doses of 2 mg followed by 2q8 IAI for
      a total of 52 weeks; only one study eye from each patient will be enrolled.

      Starting at week 24, patients may be eligible to receive additional 2mg IAI (2q4) treatment
      if both of the following criteria is met and the investigator feels additional treatment
      would be beneficial:

        -  Loss of &gt;5 letters from baseline or best previously recorded BCVA

        -  Presence of new or recurrent intraretinal fluid or subretinal fluid as assessed by SD
           OCT

      Starting at week 24, rescue therapy with macular laser photocoagulation may be administered
      if any the following criteria are met

        -  Loss of &gt; 15 letters from baseline or best previously recorded BCVA and loss of acuity
           felt to be secondary to DME and not from other cause (i.e., cataract, epiretinal
           membrane, vitreous hemorrhage, etc) and investigator feels patient would benefit from
           rescue therapy

        -  Increase in SD OCT CSF &gt; 100 um from baseline or best previously recorded SD OCT CSF and
           investigator feels patient would benefit from rescue therapy.

      Every 4 week visit will include ETDRS BCVA, IOP measurement, Slit lamp biomicroscopy,
      Indirect ophthalmoscopy, Heidelberg Spectralis SD-OCT and evaluation for systemic and ocular
      adverse events. Fundus Photography and Wide field Optos fluorescein angiography will be
      performed at baseline and at week 20and week 52.

      STUDY DURATION: Approximately 52 weeks to the end of the study. Primary endpoint will be
      evaluated at week 52.

        A patient must meet the following criteria to be eligible for inclusion in the study:

        1. Adults with Diabetes Mellitus 2. Documented history of ROTATE study completion (within 3
        months +/- 1 week of exit visit) 3. BCVA ETDRS visual acuity letter score 20/25-20/400 4.
        Thickening due to DME involving the center of the macula evident on clinical exam 5. DME on
        OCT at baseline (&gt;305 microns if male or &gt;290 microns if female) as assessed on Heidelberg
        Spectralis SD OCT 6. At least 30 days but less than 45 days since prior 0.3 mg ranibizumab
        injection 7. Willing and able to comply with clinic visits and study-related procedures 8.
        Provide signed HIPAA statement and informed consent prior to any study procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

        A patient who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from the study:

          1. Macular edema considered to be due to a cause other than DME (ERM, Vein Occlusion,
             Postop CME, uveitis)

          2. History of PRP within 3 months prior to enrollment or anticipated need for PRP

          3. History of idiopathic or autoimmune uveitis in the study eye
