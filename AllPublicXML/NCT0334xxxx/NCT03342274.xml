  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether an adapted version of ]he Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP)
      can be effective when delivered by community health workers (CHWs) in a poor urban community
      in South Africa. We will randomize existing groups that are part of an non-governmental
      organization's (NGO) chronic disease management program (anticipated cluster N = 54;
      anticipated individual N=540), to receive either the program or usual care (wait-list). The
      primary outcome analysis will compare percentage of baseline weight loss at Y1 between the
      program and usual care; however, after Y1 usual care participants will also receive the
      program and both groups will be followed for another year.
