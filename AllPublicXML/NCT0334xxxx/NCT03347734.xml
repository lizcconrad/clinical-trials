  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypermetropia in school-aged children is a pathology which is very common and responds to
      treatments early. No studies have been found in the literature on the efficancy of the
      hypermetropia treatments with physiotherapy methods. In our study, it was aimed to
      investigate the effects of different eye exercises on hypermetropia defects in school age
      children aged 7-17 years and to determine whether exercise protocols have superiority against
      each other.

      60 volunteer school-aged children (30 girls, 30 boys, between 7-17 years of age) were
      included in our study. 60 participants were randomly divided into three groups: eye
      exercises, convergence exercises and oculomotor exercise groups. Home exercise protocols were
      given to all groups for 2 sessions per day for 6 weeks, and regular phone calls were made
      once a week. Participants were assessed for their hypermetropic grades by autorefractometry,
      visual acuity by snellen chart, near and sharp visual acuity by activities of daily vision
      scale, and the health-related quality of life by pediatric quality of life inventory 4.0
      version (PEDSQI 4.0) children report.

    <measure>Visual acuity</measure>
    <time_frame>6 week</time_frame>
    <description>Snellen chart was used for visual acuity measurement. Snellen &quot;E&quot; was asked to be registered or registered to the device. In visual acuity measurement, individuals were evaluated with their own glasses.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hypermetropic grade</measure>
    <time_frame>6 week</time_frame>
    <description>The refraction defects were measured by autorefractometry, which is frequently used because it provides fast and reliable results in clinic. In the autorefractometry method, the infrared rays sent to the patient's eye are reflected from the retina back to the device and evaluate the refraction defect of the patient</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Near and sharp visual acuity</measure>
    <time_frame>6 week</time_frame>
    <description>Subscales of activities of daily vision scale, individuals questioning the near vision and sharp vision scores were used. Individuals question the extent to which they can not perform activities because of the difficulty of seeing them, and the degree of difficulty they experience while doing the activity. Points in different categories are summed and converted to a value between 0-100 by the formula. High score gives good visual acuity.</description>

    <measure>Health-related quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>6 week</time_frame>
    <description>Participants' health-related quality of life was assessed using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Version 4.0 (PedSQI 4.0) Children Report. Score is calculated in 3 areas as total score of scale (SST), total physical health score (FSTP) and total score of psychosocial health (PSTP) which is calculated by calculating emotional, social and school functioning.</description>
