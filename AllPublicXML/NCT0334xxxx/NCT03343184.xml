      Treatment clinical trial, randomized, controled, parallel, double-blinded, with four groups,
      that aims to evaluate the best application strategy when using a Universal Adhesive system,
      Single Bond Universal (3M ESPE, USA), in self-etch application mode, with or without enamel
      etching, associated wity a Bulk Fill Composite (Filtek Bulk Fill, 3M ESPE, USA), or with a
      conventional nanofilled composite (Filtek Z350 XT, 3M ESPE). Volunteers will be selected and
      recruited,following inclusion criteria and pre-established exclusion. All volunteers will be
      informed and sign a term of clarification and consent. 50 enrolled patients will receive 200
      Class I or Class II dental restorations, made in four different ways, one from each
      experimental group, using the same universal self-etching adhesive system, with two
      application strategies, under the restorations that will use two different composites, a bulk
      fill composite, used in the bulk strategie, or a nanofiiled composite, used in the
      traditional incremental strategie. Occlusal or Proximo-occlusal lesions will receive the
      selected adhesive system in 2 different protocols separated by groups. Group Self Etching and
      Bulk Fill (SETB), Group Selective enamel etching and Bulk Fill (SEEB), Group Self Etching and
      Filtek Z350XT (SETI), and Group Selective enamel etching and Filtek Z350XT (SEEI).Total time
      used in the restorations will be evaluated during the restorations. Immediate post-operative
      tooth sensitivity will be evaluated after one week. Restorations will be evaluated every 6
      months for pain assessment, shape, fractures, staining or recurrent caries, using scores. To
      determine in which group each tooth will be enrolled, the authors will randomize the teeth.

      This is a Treatment clinical trial, randomized, controlled, parallel, double-blinded, with
      four groups, that aims to evaluate the best application strategy when using a Universal
      Adhesive system, Single Bond Universal (3M ESPE, USA), in self-etch application mode, with or
      without enamel etching, associated wity a Bulk Fill Composite (Filtek Bulk Fill, 3M ESPE,
      USA), or with a conventional nanofilled composite (Filtek Z350 XT, 3M ESPE). Volunteers will
      be selected and recruited, following inclusion criteria and pre-established exclusion. All
      volunteers will be informed and sign a term of clarification and consent. All 50 enrolled
      patients will receive 200 Class I or Class II dental restorations, made in four different
      ways, one from each experimental group, using the same universal self-etching adhesive
      system, with two application strategies, under the restorations that will use two different
      composites, a bulk fill composite, used in the bulk strategie, or a nanofiiled composite,
      used in the traditional incremental strategie. All patients must have at only 20 teeth in
      function, must have at only 4 carious lesion in occlusal or proximo-occlusal face in
      posterior teeth or old restorations in the same faces, with problems, that need to be
      changed. Those lesions must be more than 2 mm deep, should have exposed dentin, and must have
      at only 50% of margins in enamel. Teeth should not present periodontal mobility. Firstly, the
      patient will be anesthetized locally with 3% Mepivacaine solution, followed by prophylaxis
      with pumice powder and water. All cavities will be washed and dried after these procedures
      for optimal selection of color, using a color scale. Then, the rubber dam isolation of the
      teeth to be restored will be held. Occlusal or Proximo-occlusal lesions will receive the
      selected adhesive system in 2 different protocols separated by groups. Group Self Etching and
      Bulk Fill (SETB): no conditioning, the adhesive system will be used in 50 teeth, according to
      the manufacturer's instructions, in the self-etching mode. The adhesive system will be
      brushed during 20 seconds in the cavity, will be air-dried during 5 seconds, and
      phtoactivated during 10 seconds with Light Emission Diode (LED) light. Then, the Filtek Bulk
      Fill composite will be used in increments of 4 mm, using the bulk restoration technique, and
      photoactivated for 40 seconds; Group Selective enamel etching and Bulk Fill (SEEB): 37%
      phosphoric acid will be applied during 30 seconds, only in enamel in 50 teeth. This acid will
      be removed using water, the cavity will be air-dried, and then, the adhesive will be applied
      according to the manufacturer's instructions, as described in group SETB. Restorations will
      also be made as described in group SETB; Group Self Etching and Filtek Z350XT (SETI): no
      conditioning, the adhesive system will be used in 50 teeth, according to the manufacturer's
      instructions, in the self-etching mode. The adhesive system will be brushed during 20 seconds
      in the cavity, will be air-dried during 5 seconds, and phtoactivated during 10 seconds with
      Light Emission Diode (LED) light. Then, the Filtek Z350XT composite will be used in
      increments of no more than 2 mm, using the incremental restoration technique, and each
      increment will be photoactivated for 40 seconds.; Group Selective enamel etching and Filtek
      Z350XT (SEEI): 37% phosphoric acid will be applied during 30 seconds, only in enamel in 50
      teeth. This acid will be removed using water, the cavity will be air-dried, and then, the
      adhesive will be applied according to the manufacturer's instructions, as described in group
      SETI. Restorations will also be made as described in group SETI. Total time used in the
      restorations will be evaluated during the restorations. Immediate post-operative tooth
      sensitivity will be evaluated after one week. Restorations will be evaluated every 6 months
      for pain assessment, shape, fractures, staining or recurrent caries, using scores. To
      determine in which group each tooth will be enrolled, the authors will randomize the teeth.
