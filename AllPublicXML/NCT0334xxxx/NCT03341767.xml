  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of treating
      Cryptosporidiosis in HIV positive patients with Clofazimine. Half of the HIV positive
      patients with Cryptosporidiosis enrolled will be treated with Clofazimine while the other
      half will be given placebo. An additional group of HIV positive patients without
      Cryptosporidium infection or diarrhea will be given Clofazimine to assess the differences in
      pharmacokinetics between HIV positive patients with and without Cryptosporidiosis and
      diarrhea.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cryptosporidiosium infection and diarrhea is a life-threatening infection in children 6-18
      months and in immunocompromised patients. However, Nitazoxanide, the only drug approved for
      treatment of Cryptosporidiosis, showed little-to-no efficacy in HIV positive patients and low
      efficacy in malnourished children.

      Recently, Love MS et al reported that Clofazimine inhibited proliferation of both
      Cryptosporidium parvum and C. hominis in vitro and reduced shedding in a mouse model of acute
      C. parvum infection. Clofazimine has been approved for treatment of leprosy for decades and
      more recently for the treatment of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Safety and
      pharmacokinetics of Clofazimine are well documented for a variety of patient populations, but
      not for HIV positive patients or patients with diarrhea. Thus, this clinical trial seeks to
      determine the efficacy of 50 or 100 mg of Clofazimine administered 3 times daily for 5 days
      on fecal shedding of Cryptosporidium oocysts in HIV positive patients, as well as safety,
      tolerability, and pharmacokinetics in this patient population.
