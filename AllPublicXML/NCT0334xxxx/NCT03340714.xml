      This pilot early phase I trial studies the Automated Device for Asthma Monitoring and
      Management in monitoring adult patients with lung cancer who are undergoing radiation
      therapy. The Automated Device for Asthma Monitoring and Management may provide useful
      information to doctors to help monitor adult patients with lung cancer and diagnose certain
      conditions earlier than traditional means.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine compliance with the Automated Device for Asthma Monitoring and Management
      (ADAMM) device in patients receiving radiation therapy (RT) for lung cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate feasibility of recruitment, acceptability of the ADAMM device, and compliance
      with electronic patient-reported outcomes (ePROs) in this patient population
