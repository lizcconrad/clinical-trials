  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neurological deficits and motor disorders are extremely common after stroke. Physical
      therapies can improve the autonomy of these patients, but despite an intensive stationary
      neurorehabilitation, severe deficits often persist. Complementary therapies that could
      improve recovery would therefore be very welcome.

      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) induces, in a non-invasive way, a transient
      inhibitory or excitatory neuromodulation of certain cerebral regions. An increasing number of
      studies show that this modulation of brain activity can improve motor functions in patients
      with brain lesions and increase the effect of physical therapies. However, the &quot;optimum&quot;
      configuration of tDCS and the induced effects remain to be characterized and investigated.

      The investigators therefore propose to carry out a study including a pilot phase in order to
      determine the most efficient tDCS setup. The optimum setup of of the pilot phase will be
      compared to a placebo condition in a multicentric main study.
