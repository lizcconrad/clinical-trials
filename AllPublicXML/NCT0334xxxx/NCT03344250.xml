  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I trial using EGFR Bi-armed Activated T-cells (BATs) in combination with
      standard of care temozolomide (TMZ) and radiation (RT) in patients with glioblastoma (GBM).
      The purpose of the study is to determine a safe dose of EGFR BATs when given with standard of
      care therapy and will require a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 18 patients to identify this
      dose.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In addition to finding the safe dose of EGFR BATs, immune evaluations will be performed as
      delineated in the schedule of events to measure immune responses during all stages of
      treatment for GBM.

             There is a current or prior history of angina/coronary symptoms requiring medications
             and/or evidence of depressed left ventricular function (LVEF &lt; 45% by MUGA or ECHO).

             There is clinical evidence of congestive heart failure requiring medical management
             (irrespective of MUGA or ECHO results).

             B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA [qualitative] is detected).

          9. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy.

         10. Has received any treatment for GBM besides surgery.

         12. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

         13. A patient may be excluded if, in the opinion of the treating clinician, the patient is
