  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is usually observed among patients with HIV
      infection. No study to date has investigated the impact of CMV infection on HIV viral load
      decay during antiretroviral therapy.

      Methods: 345 consecutive HIV patients coinfected (N=300) or not (N=45) with CMV were
      enrolled. Clinical, biological and virological data were collected from HIV antiretroviral
      therapy initiation to the day of HIV viral load undetectability if any.
