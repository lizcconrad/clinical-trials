  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The exponential growth of physiological, behavioral and environmental data generated through
      consumer mobile health (mHealth) devices and Internet of Things (IoT) technology provide
      unprecedented sources of personalized and contextual health information. If linked to
      clinical health data from the Electronic Health Record (EHR), these data can provide dynamic
      and individualized views of patient health states and trajectories that can greatly inform
      clinical care and health-related research. The investigators propose to advance precision
      health through the development and evaluation of a mobile application and data platform that
      collects, harmonizes and integrates mHealth and environmental data from patients' daily lives
      with their clinical histories and electronic health record data.

      The investigators propose a participatory design approach to implement and evaluate a
      precision health platform through the study and modeling of hypertension (HTN) and depression
      in patient communities of UC Davis (UCD) and UC San Francisco (UCSF). These chronic diseases
      have high prevalence across geography, socioeconomic status, and race/ethnicity, and have
      significant economic, societal and personal costs. They are considerably challenging to
      manage due to difficulties in acquiring high-quality and consistent data from patients
      outside of their clinical care appointments that is so needed for a full view of the
      patient's disease state. Despite a broad array of self-monitoring devices and consumer
      applications, mHealth data are not getting into the clinical care process, and patients do
      not regularly monitor their own health states, particularly during periods of medication
      change, when frequent assessments are especially important.

      The investigators propose to conduct a 6-month single arm feasibility study of 200 ambulatory
      men and women (100 each at UCSF and UCD) with either hypertension or depression to implement
      an open, web-accessible, standards driven and patient-centric data platform for the
      integration of patient-reported and clinical data.

    <description>Participants will monitor their blood pressure using a wireless-enabled blood pressure cuff or mood using a mobile health application once per week at baseline. The investigators will monitor their medical records to determine if a medication change has occurred. After this, the investigators will increase the frequency of notifications to monitor the participant's specific health condition to once daily for 1 month. This monitoring will continue for a study duration of 6 months.</description>
