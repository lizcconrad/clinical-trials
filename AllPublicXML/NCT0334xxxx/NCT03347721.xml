  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to determine if there is a clinically meaningful difference in pain perception
      for women during in-office diagnostic flexible cystoscopy when using lidocaine gel vs plain
      lubricant. This will be a double blinded randomized control trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of anesthetic lubricant during in-office flexible cystoscopy has been well studied
      men. Pain during cystoscopy can lead to poor compliance and follow-up. Very few studies
      challenging the use of anesthetic lubricant during cystoscopy have included women. Those that
      have, only recruited a small number with insignificant findings. A meta-analysis reviewed
      four studies looking at the efficacy of lidocaine gel on pain relief during flexible
      cystoscopy in men. Four hundred and eleven men underwent flexible cystoscopy with and without
      the use of lidocaine gel and those who received anesthetic gel were 1.7 times more likely not
      to experience moderate to severe pain than those who received placebo. The anatomy of the
      female and male urogenital tract differ. The female urethra is approximately 3cm in length
      while the male urethra averages 7 cm with an external and prostatic sphincter which is the
      location where the most discomfort is thought to occur. A randomized control trial of 144
      women undergoing rigid cystoscopy and found that pain was decreased with lidocaine vs
      placebo, however other studies such found no difference in pain perception. The efficacy of
      lidocaine gel in women during flexible cystoscopy has not been studied. The use of lidocaine
      gel during diagnostic flexible cystoscopy in women is based on surgeon preference and
      experience, and use of either plain or anesthetic gel, is currently acceptable clinical
      practice. The morbidity and cost of local anesthesia associated with cystoscopy in women is
      unknown due to the lack of studies. The objective of this study is to determine if there is a
      clinically meaningful difference in pain perception in women during in-office diagnostic
      flexible cystoscopy when using lidocaine gel vs plain lubricant.
