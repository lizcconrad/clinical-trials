  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study is designed to explore whether the introduction of Thiotepa, to the pre autologous
      stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) conditioning will reduce toxicity and thus improve outcome
      following transplantation in up to 24 patients with malignant lymphoma including both
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and Hodgkin's lymphoma ( HL) improving toxicity profile ,
      reducing side effects while potentially improving the antitumor response. Specifically,we
      speculate that using the novel Thiotepa based TEAM consisted of THIOTEPA 5mg/kg on days -7-6,
      etoposide 200 mg/m2 , Cytosar (ARA-C) 200 mg/m2 on days -5,-4, -3, -2 and melphalan 140 mg/m2
      on day -1, pre transplantation conditioning regimen may allow transplantation with lower
      transplant related toxicity and thus improve outcome in this setting. Toward this aim the
      impact on toxicity profile ,engraftment and disease control will be assessed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with non-Hodgkin's and Hodgkin's lymphoma as confirmed by a pathological
             biopsy report.

          2. Patients who are candidates for Autologous stem-cell transplantation due to refractory
             or relapsing disease by standard institutional indications and comply with standard
             transplant eligibility criteria.

          3. Age less than physiologic 70 years.
