  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research will follow healthy weight children who vary by family risk for obesity
      to identify the neurobiological and appetitive traits that are implicated in overeating and
      weight gain during the critical pre-adolescent period. The investigator's central hypothesis
      is that increased intake from large portions of energy dense foods is due in part to reduced
      activity in brain regions implicated in inhibitory control and decision making, combined with
      increased activity in reward processing pathways. To test this hypothesis, the investigators
      will recruit 120 healthy weight children, aged 7-8 years, at two levels of obesity risk
      (i.e., 60 high-risk and 60 low-risk) based on parent weight status.

      In aim one, the investigators will use functional magnetic resonance imaging to characterize
      the brain regions which are activated in response to food portion size and compare these
      regions between high- and low-risk children.

      Second, the investigators will determine the relationship between brain response to visual
      portion size cues and measured food intake when portions are increased in the laboratory.

      Third, the investigators will determine the relationship between brain response to large
      portions and other validated measures of overeating, including satiety responsiveness and the
      amount of calories children consumed from high calorie snacks when they are not hungry (i.e.,
      eating in the absence of hunger).

      Fourth, the investigators will conduct follow-up visits one year after baseline to determine
      the extent to which baseline brain and behavioral responses to portion size predict gains in
      adiposity assessed by anthropometrics (body weight, height, and dual-energy x-ray
      absorptiometry).

      Secondary study endpoints include the relationship between child behavioral and brain
      response to food portion size and physical activity assessed by accelerometry and
      questionnaires, inhibitory control assessed by a go/no go test, loss of control eating, child
      sleep, parent rated eating behaviors, and parental feeding practices.
