      The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics
      (PK) and preliminary efficacy of idelalisib; and to establish recommended phase 2 doses
      (RP2D) of idelalisib in combination with rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide (RICE)
      in children and adolescents with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)
      or mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (MBCL)

    <description>Participants will receive idelalisib monotherapy (from day 1 to day 21), followed by combination therapy with RICE. Upon enrollment, participants will be assigned to one of the 3 dose levels during idelalisib monotherapy (Dose level 1 = 55 mg/m^2 twice daily (BID), Dose level 2 = 85 mg/m^2 BID, Dose level 3 = 125 mg/m^2 BID) administered as 50 mg, 100 mg or 150 mg tablets as appropriate, or as 10 mg dispersible tablets for oral suspension for participants who cannot swallow tablets.
Day 1: single dose of idelalisib
Day 2 up to Day 21: initiate and continue idelalisib BID dosing
Day 22 for up to 12 months: idelalisib twice per day in combination with RICE. Cycles of RICE will be administered over 5 days every 3 weeks (Day 1: rituximab; Day 3: rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide; Days 4 and 5: ifosfamide, etoposide) starting day 22 (or earlier if there is evidence of clinical progression while on idelalisib monotherapy) for up to 12 months.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive one of the 3 doses of idelalisib monotherapy (from day 1 to day 21) followed by combination therapy with RICE. Idelalisib will be administered as as 50 mg, 100 mg or 150 mg tablets as appropriate, or as 10 mg dispersible tablets for oral suspension for participants who cannot swallow tablets. Participants will will be enrolled at dose level 1 once tolerability is demonstrated in the older cohort (Cohort 1). Thereafter, both age cohorts will be dose escalated independently.
Day 1: single dose of idelalisib
Day 2 up to Day 21: initiate and continue idelalisib BID
Day 22 for up to 12 months: idelalisib twice per day in combination with RICE.
