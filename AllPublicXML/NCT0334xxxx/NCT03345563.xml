  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Project HERO is a 12-week study of the efficacy of Body Mind Training (BMT) for reducing
      fatigue in prostate cancer survivors. This 3-arm randomized clinical trial will examine
      inflammatory biology and selected gene-expression pathways that are hypothesized to
      contribute to the intervention's effect.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will establish the efficacy of a 12-week Body Mind Training (BMT) for reductions
      in fatigue (the study's primary outcome). Secondary patient-reported outcomes include quality
      of life changes (e.g. changes in sleep and perceived psychological distress), changes in the
      biomarkers of inflammation; including genome wide transcriptional factors, and expression of
      fatigue-related genes.

      There are over 9 million cancer survivors that are 55 years of age or older. Cancer survivors
      in this age group have unique challenges coping with late and long-term effects of having had
      a cancer diagnosis and treatment, coupled with age-related declines and comorbidities. This
      may influence their ability to engage in lifestyle interventions because of slower
      post-treatment recovery, increased functional limitations, and other quality of life (QOL)
      impairments. Fatigue is common, under-recognized, undertreated and correlated with
      impairments in psychological distress, social and functional well-being and health-related
      QOL in cancer survivors, including men with prostate cancer. For prostate cancer survivors
      suffering from fatigue, body-mind training (BMT) may be more appealing because it is not
      overly physically exertive and is safe for people 55 years of age or older.

    <intervention_model_description>After obtaining informed consent and baseline assessments, 210 fatigued prostate cancer survivors age 55 years and older will be randomized to the BMT arm or intensity-matched Body Training (BT), or Usual Care (UC) arms. Patient-reported assessments (surveys) will occur at baseline (within 2-weeks pre- intervention), mid-intervention (6 weeks), 1-week post-intervention (13 weeks), and at 3 months and 12 months post-intervention. Phlebotomy is done at baseline, 1 week post intervention (13 weeks), and 3 months and 12 months post intervention. Dietary assessments are done at baseline, and week 13 (1 week post intervention), 3 months and 1 year post-intervention. Physical activity is assessed weekly throughout the intervention. Sleep diaries are collected at all time points.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Participants will be instructed not to discuss their arm assignment with study personnel during their assessments; questionnaires will be self-administered, administered in person or by telephone based on participant need and preference. Some investigators, the data manager, biostatisticians, biometric testing and lab technicians will be blinded to intervention allocation. The technicians who analyze biospecimens will be blinded to all other data.</masking_description>

    <description>Change in fatigue levels over time: measured with 13-item scale assessing the level of fatigue during usual activities over the 7 days prior to the measurement timepoint, with higher scores indicating less fatigue.

    <description>Questionnaire: consists of 3 categories related to the risk of having sleep apnea. Patients can be classified into High Risk or Low Risk based on their responses to the individual items and their overall scores in the symptom categories.</description>

    <measure>Inflammation Biology Measures: Changes in circulating levels pro- and anti-inflammatory biomarkers will be assessed by measuring NF-κB and AP-1.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (2 weeks pre-intervention), and post-intervention at week 13, 3 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples will be collected at using standardized procedures. The dynamics of inflammation will be measured by using a vertically integrated mechanistic approach and examining upstream signaling pathways and circulating levels. Circulating levels will be assessed by assay of plasma pro- and anti-inflammatory biomarkers; Inflammatory signaling as indexed by activation of key inflammatory transcription factors (e.g., NF-κB) will be measured using intranuclear staining and flow cytometric analyses. Genome-wide transcriptional analyses (all baseline and 13-week biospecimens) will be used to identify the differential regulation of gene expression and the molecular inflammation-related signaling pathways that are plausible candidates driving these changes (e.g., NF-κB).</description>

    <description>Questionnaire: Psychological distress (depression and anxiety) is measured using the using the Brief Symptom Inventory-18 instrument. Items are summed to calculate the raw score, range 0-72. Raw scores can be converted to T-scores, based on US population norms. Participants with T-scores that are ≥ 63 are considered a &quot;case,&quot; and may need professional help. Somatization Scale: Raw score range 0-24, with 24 indicating high somatization. Depression Scale: Raw score range 0-24, with 24 indicating high depression. Anxiety Scale: Raw score range 0-24, with 24 indicating high anxiety.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (2 weeks pre-intervention) and week 6, and post-intervention at week 13, 3 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire: Provides scores for each of the eight health domains and psychometrically-based physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) scores. The raw score of each of the eight SF-36 dimensions was derived by summing the item scores. Subtract the lowest possible raw score from the actual raw score, divide by the possibly raw score range, and multiply by 100 to get the transformed scale. Higher scores indicate better health-related quality of life.</description>
