    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, non-inferiority multicenter
      clinical trial of azithromycin vs. placebo in adults presenting as outpatients with suspect
      LRTI and a PCT level of &lt; /=0.25 ng/mL, as a strategy for reducing antibiotic prescriptions.
      The study is designed to compare the efficacy of azithromycin versus placebo on Day 5 (i.e.,
      after 4 days of treatment) in subjects with suspect LRTI and PCT levels of &lt; /=0.25 ng/mL at
      enrollment using a non-inferiority approach. The study will recruit potential subjects 18
      years of age or older who are suspected to have LRTI and 420 subjects will be randomized 1:1
      to receive oral azithromycin or placebo for five days. Randomized subjects will have efficacy
      measured from the time of the first dose of study drug (Day 1) through approximately Day 28.
      The Primary Objective is to compare the efficacy of azithromycin versus placebo on Day 5
      (i.e., after 4 days of treatment) in subjects with suspect LRTI and PCT levels of &lt; /=0.25
      ng/mL at enrollment using a non-inferiority approach.

      Days 11 and 28; groups receiving azithromycin versus placebo with regard to return visits to
      a physician's office or urgent care by Days 11 and 28; groups receiving azithromycin versus

      azithromycin versus placebo with regard to hospitalization by Days 11 and 28 if not
      hospitalized at the enrollment and randomization visit; groups receiving azithromycin versus
      placebo with regard to improvement in presenting symptoms by Days 11 and 28; the efficacy of
      azithromycin versus placebo in subjects with suspected LRTI and PCT levels of &lt; /=0.25 ng/mL
      at Day 5 using a superiority approach, employing the &quot;Response Adjusted for Days of
      Antibiotic Risk (RADAR)&quot; methodology; groups receiving azithromycin versus placebo in regard
      to solicited events by Day 5; groups receiving azithromycin versus placebo in regard to
      hospitalization or visits to an ED, outpatient clinic, or urgent care center for worsening or
      persistent LRTI after randomization by Day 5; groups receiving azithromycin versus placebo in
      regard to improvement in vital sign abnormalities or symptoms present at enrollment, on Day
      5; groups receiving azithromycin versus placebo in regard to new vital sign abnormalities or
      symptoms on Day 5, or deterioration in symptoms relative to the enrollment visit on Day 5.
