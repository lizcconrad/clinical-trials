    <textblock>
      PEARL is a phase III multicentre 2:1 randomised controlled trial, with an incorporated phase
      II (pilot) component. All patients consented/registered onto the trial will have an
      autofluorescence bronchoscopy (AFB) to check for the presence of high grade lesions (HGLs) in
      the lung, as verified by tissue biopsy. Only patients with one or more histologically
      confirmed lung HGL will be randomised to receive either photodynamic therapy (PDT) treatment
      with surveillance (=intervention), or surveillance alone (=control).

      The overall aim of the phase II pilot is to demonstrate a &gt;20% response in the PDT group (at
      least 3 out of 21 PDT patients), compared to a minimum response of 5%. This will be used as
      an efficacy signal to determine whether the trial will continue into phase III. Response will
      be measured by regression of high grade lesions (HGLs) to either low grade lesions (LGLs), or
      to normal epithelium at 6 months post treatment (blind assessment). The overall aim of the
      phase III is to show that the time period over which HGLs progress to invasive lung cancer is
      significantly longer when treated with PDT compared to surveillance alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Squamous cell carcinoma of the lung develops through a transition of progressive
      cytological aberration, from normal to metaplasia, mild, moderate, and severe dysplasia and
      then carcinoma in situ (CIS) before becoming an invasive cancer. Progression rates to
      invasive carcinoma can vary depending on the initial grade of lesion and it is generally
      accepted that high-grade lesions are more likely to progress to invasive cancer than
      low-grade lesions. Early detection and treatment of these lesions is critical to improving
      survival. There is no evidence base examining how, or whether these high-grade lesions (HGLs)
      should be treated, resulting in diverse treatment practices both nationally and
      internationally. This is the first randomised clinical trial of a bronchoscopic intervention
      in treating HGLs using PDT.

      Treatment: Treatment-arm patients will receive two courses of PDT treatment using the
      photosensitiser drug Fotolon®. Fotolon®, which preferentially accumulates in HGLs, is first
      administered via IV infusion. Patients then undergo bronchoscopy during which their HGLs are
      irradiated with red light (via non-heat emitting laser). Red-light activation of the
      photosensitiser causes chemical transformation of the cells and cell death.

      Follow Up: Follow up in both arms consists of AFB surveillance at 6 and 12 months, then every
      6-12 months (depending on the appearance of lesions), with annual CT scanning of the thorax,
      and annual spirometry. Biological samples for translational analysis will be taken at
      baseline and each subsequent trial visit.

      Duration of recruitment: Anticipated recruitment for phase II is 1 year (12 months), and an
      additional 2 years (24 months) for the phase III.
