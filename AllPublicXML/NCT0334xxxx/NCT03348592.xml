  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase 1, 3-period crossover with repeated measures feasibility study is
      to characterize the gut microbiome of individuals with chronic kidney disease, and to explore
      effects of p-inulin on the gut microbiome. The nature of the study will provide information
      about the feasibility of stool sample collection for future multicenter studies of the gut
      microbiome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overarching hypothesis motivating this exploratory study of variability is that treatment
      with oligofructose-enriched inulin (p-inulin) will alter the composition and/or function of
      the gut microbiome, and thereby reduce the generation of gut-derived uremic toxins, improve
      gut barrier function and attenuate systemic inflammation in CKD patients. In order to design
      a future clinical trial the following parameters from CKD subjects are needed:

        1. Intra-patient variability in the composition and function of the gut microbiome

        2. Inter-patient variability in the composition and function of the gut microbiome

        3. Impact of p-inulin on the composition and function of the gut microbiome

        4. Tolerability of p-inulin administration

        5. Feasibility of collecting stool samples in this patient population
