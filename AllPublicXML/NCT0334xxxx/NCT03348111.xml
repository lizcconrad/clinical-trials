  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Considering the frequent occurence of peri-implantitis and mucositis, a multiple of treatment
      alternatives have been proposed including non-surgical and surgical procedures. However, it
      seems that the most effective treatment remains prevention of these diseases.

      The aim of this study is to emphasize on mucositis and peri-implantitis prevention using an
      air abrasion device the Air-Flow Master Piezon® with erythritol and chlorhexidine powder in
      order to eliminate and / or disorganize the biofilm responsible for peri-implant mucosa
      inflammation.

    <textblock>
      Peri-implant infections (mucositis and peri-implantitis) depict an increasing focus in dental
      practice and implantology. mean prevalence of mucositis is of 43% and periimplantitis of 22%.
      Consequences for the implant without successful treatment range from local reversible
      inflammation (mucositis) to implant loss (periimplantitis). These lead to functional, social
      and esthetic prejudices for patients. The main factor for establishment of peri-implant
      infections is the formation and maturation of the bacterial biofilm. Peri-implantitis and
      mucositis treatment require the removal of the bacterial biofilm and the disinfection of the
      implant surface. Because of special surface conditions and structures, it is more difficult
      to remove bacterial biofilms from implant surfaces than teeth. the key to controlling the
      inflammation due to the bacterial biofilm is to prevent its installation and progression. The
      procedure tested in this study is an air abrasion device, the Air-Flow Master Piezon® with
      erythritol and chlorhexidine powders on implants presenting clinical and radiographic signs
      of mucositis and peri-implantitis along with renewal of local oral hygiene instructions in
      order to reduce the inflammation locally by disorganizing and eliminating the biofilm.
      Follow-up of the patients will be held every 2 months for 6 months by scoring the bleeding on
      probing, the plaque index and measuring clinical attachment level in order to compare it with
      the initial measure. At 6 month an X-ray will also enable to compare bone level and
      mineralization. This initial study will help establish a standardized protocol for
      peri-implant infection management.
