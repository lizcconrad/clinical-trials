  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to investigate the safety and tolerability of BI
      1265162 in healthy male subjects following inhalative administration of single rising doses.

      Secondary objective is the exploration of the pharmacokinetics (PK) of BI 1265162 after
      single dosing.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male subjects according to the assessment of the investigator, based on a
             complete medical history including a physical examination, vital signs (Blood pressure
             (BP), Pulse rate (PR)), 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory tests

          -  Age of 18 to 50 years (incl.)

          -  Body mass index (BMI) of 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 (incl.)

          -  Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1) and Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) of equal
             or greater than 80% of predicted normal, at screening and prior to randomisation

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study in
             accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and local legislation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any finding in the medical examination (including BP, Pulse rate (PR) or
             Electrocardiogram (ECG)) is deviating from normal and judged as clinically relevant by
             the investigator

          -  Repeated measurement of systolic blood pressure outside the range of 90 to 140 mmHg,
             diastolic blood pressure outside the range of 50 to 90 mmHg, or pulse rate outside the
             range of 50 to 90 beats per minute (bpm)

          -  Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to be
             of clinical relevance

             investigator

             within 60 days prior to planned administration of trial medication, or current
             participation in another trial involving administration of investigational

          -  Drug abuse or positive drug screening

          -  Blood donation of more than 100 mL within 30 days prior to administration of trial
             medication or intended donation during the trial

          -  Intention to perform excessive physical activities within one week prior to
             administration of trial medication or during the trial

          -  Inability to comply with dietary regimen of trial site

          -  A marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (such as QTc intervals that are
             repeatedly greater than 450 ms in males) or any other relevant ECG finding at
             screening

          -  A history of additional risk factors for Torsades de Pointes (such as heart failure,
             hypokalemia, or family history of Long QT Syndrome)

          -  A history of chronic kidney disease (EGFR &lt;59 mls/min including corrections as per
             ethnicity)

          -  Subject is assessed as unsuitable for inclusion by the investigator, for instance,
             because considered not able to understand and comply with study requirements, or has a
             condition that would not allow safe participation in the study

          -  The subject has a diagnosis history of pulmonary hyperreactivity

          -  Male subjects with woman of child bearing potential (WOCBP) partner who are unwilling
