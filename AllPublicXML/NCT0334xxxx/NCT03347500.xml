  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is the fastest growing cause of disability worldwide due to population
      ageing and increasing obesity incidence. Obese individuals have a higher risk of OA
      insurgence and severe progression due to several risk factors, including their systemic
      inflammation state and superior migratory ability of monocytes. In the present project we aim
      at the development of a novel 3D microfluidic organotypic model resembling the joint to
      investigate the migration ability of monocytes from obese and non-obese OA patients.

      We hypothesize that monocytes from obese OA patients display superior migration ability and a
      specific pattern of chemokine surface receptors compared to monocytes from non-obese OA
      patients. We also hypothesize that these features lead to a superior infiltration of
      monocytes/macrophages to the synovial membrane in obese OA patients. Based on this, our main
      aim will be to highlight differences between Mo from obese and non-obese OA patients in terms
      of surface receptors and migration ability in a microfluidic organotypic model.
