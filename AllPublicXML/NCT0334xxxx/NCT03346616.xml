  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, third year medical students on the pediatric clerkship will be randomized to
      receive either only written educational material (review journal articles) or written
      educational material plus daily text messages consisting of board style questions with online
      answers. The students' performance on the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME)
      Pediatric Subject Evaluation will be compared between the two groups.

    <textblock>
      In the last decade, the use of smartphone and text messaging (SMS) has increased
      significantly; during this time, text messaging has become the primary means of communication
      in some instances. Despite the popularity, text messaging and smartphones have been rarely
      utilized in the context of medical education. Few studies have been performed examining the
      effect of text messaging as an adjunct to traditional medical education. A previous study
      with the Saint Louis University (SLU) Pediatric Residency program, showed the feasibility of
      using text messaging to deliver medical information to pediatric residents through the
      Text4Peds program.

      This study aims to expand Text4Peds to third NBME Pediatric Subject Evaluation performance.
      The NBME Pediatric Subject Evaluation is a national, standardized pediatric knowledge based
      exam from the NBME taken by all medical students at the end of their pediatric clerkship.

    <intervention_model_description>Participants were randomly assigned to a Texting Group or a Non-Texting Group using a random number generator. The texting group received a daily text message containing a board style multiple choice question. If the participant wanted immediate feedback, the message contained a link to a website containing the answer to the question along with an explanation, the source material, and a more complete clinical vignette. One hour after the initial text message was sent, a follow up &quot;answer&quot; text message was delivered. Text messages were sent 6 days per week (Monday through Saturday) at 2pm and 3pm. To minimize perceived impropriety, the non-texting group received access to the journal articles from which the content was derived, but did not receive any text messages or any of the synthesized material. The primary outcome was performance on the NBME Pediatric Subject Examination.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The NBME pediatrics subject examination is used to assess medical student knowledge and is a common component of the pediatric clerkship grade. It is also used to compare medical student performance to a national benchmark. NBME scores are on a scale of 0-100 (% correct); mean score for this exam during year of evaluation was 75.7 (SD 8.7).</description>
