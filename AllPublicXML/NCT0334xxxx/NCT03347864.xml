    <textblock>
      This is an open-label positron emission tomography/computed tomography(PET/CT) study to
      investigate the diagnostic performance and evaluation efficacy of 68Ga-NOTA-RM26 in breast
      tumor patients. 1.85 MBq per kilogram body weight of 68Ga-NOTA-RM26A will be injected
      intravenously. Visual and semiquantitative method will be used to assess the PET/CT images.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR), also known as bombesin receptor subtype II
      (BB2), is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor family of bombesin receptors. GRPR is
      over-expressed in various types of human tumors including breast cancer. RM26, a GRPR
      antagonist with high affinity, was discovered by peptide backbone modification of bombesin
      analogues.To target gastrin-releasing peptide receptor in neoplastic cells of human breast
      cancer, peptide NOTA-RM26 was synthesized with a PEG3 linker between NOTA and RM26, and then
      labeled with 68Ga. An open-label whole-body PET/ CT study was designed to assess its clinical
      diagnostic value in patients with breast tumor.
