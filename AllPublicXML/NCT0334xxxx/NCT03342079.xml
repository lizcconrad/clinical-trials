  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Venipuncture (puncturing of a vein) through the skin in order to insert a vein catheter (also
      know as cannula) is one of the most common needle-related medical procedures performed in
      children. Venipuncture is necessary for administration of sedation to facilitate motionless
      patient state for radiological imaging studies such as diagnostic nuclear medicine imaging or
      CT scan studies.

      The current practice for management of needle-related pain is to use needle-less topical
      local anesthetic delivery systems. These delivery systems are increasingly used in children
      to anesthetize the skin prior to venipuncture and venous cannulae insertion. This can reduce
      the pain and distress associated with the needle sticks, however, many children express
      considerable fear, anxiety and distress during medical procedures that involve needles.
      Anticipatory pain and phobia associated with needle stick may render the patient
      uncooperative and anxious even when effective analgesia is produced by a topical local
      anesthetic.

      Both the discomfort and associated anxiety during such an intervention can be considerably
      improved when inhaled nitrous oxide is used alone or in combination with local anesthetics.
      The administration of nitrous oxide (50% to 70%) for painful procedures is an effective and
      safe method of suppressing procedural pain and distress in children over the age of one year
      (level 3 evidence). When compared to other intravenous sedation agents, nitrous oxide 50%
      used for uncomplicated painful procedures is associated with markedly shorter recovery time
      and less respiratory side effects (level 3 evidence). When combined with local anesthetics
      for procedural pain and stress management, nitrous oxide 50% is more effective and has higher
      success rate compared to orally administered anxiolytics or local anesthetic alone (level 2
      evidence). Combining nitrous oxide (50-70%) and local anesthetics is shown to be a more
      effective procedural sedation than local anesthetics alone (level 1 evidence).

      The efficacy and safety of inhaled 50-70% nitrous oxide for relief of mild-to-moderate
      anxiety and pain of venipuncture in children just prior to induction of anesthesia have been
      investigated in randomized controlled trials by anesthesiologists; physician who are skilled
      and competent in providing optimal sedation in the operating room setting. The major benefit
      of administration of a fixed low concentration of 50% nitrous oxide for procedural sedation
      is that it achieves pain relief while retaining verbal contact with the patient. The
      efficacy, safety and tolerability of administration of low fixed concentration 50% nitrous
      oxide using a nitrous oxide mask delivery system for control of mild-to-moderate procedural
      sedation during performance of needle-related pain (i.e., venipuncture) in children has not
      been investigated in a blinded randomized controlled trials outside the operating room
      setting when provided by skilled and competent non-anesthesia trained personnel.

      In view of safety of low concentration (50%) of nitrous oxide due to preservation of the
      patent airway, lack of respiratory depression and rapid recovery, investigators propose this
      preliminary study to validate the hypothesis that nurse-administered premixed inhaled nitrous
      oxide and oxygen at a fixed 50:50% concentration with or without a topical anesthetic can
      provide safe and effective pain relief and reduce behavioral distress in preschool children
      during routine placement of intravenous cannulation prior to administration of intravenous
      sedation for nuclear medicine studies and CT imaging studies.

      To test this hypothesis, investigators propose performing a prospective, double blind control
      trial in 105 children undergoing nuclear medicine studies or CT imaging, randomized into
      three groups;

        1. the treatment groups will receive either nitrous oxide and a placebo topical anesthetic
           patch or

        2. nitrous oxide and a topical anesthetic patch (Synera) and

        3. the placebo group will receive oxygen mask and a topical anesthetic patch (Synera).

      The topical anesthetic patch or placebo patch will be applied for 20 minutes prior to the
      scheduled insertion of intravenous cannula. The use of a topical local anesthetic such as the
      Synera patch is a standard of care for placement of intravenous cannula at Children's
      Hospital Boston.

      Assessments to estimate the effectiveness of nitrous oxide with and without the use of
      topical anesthesia Synera patch will include;

        1. Assessment of child's pain and observer report of pain control.

        2. Child's anxiety before and during the procedure.

        3. Tolerability of the mask delivery system of a fixed concentration of 50% nitrous oxide
           outside the operating room.

        4. Accuracy of nitrous oxide delivery dose by measuring the end-tidal concentration of
           nitrous oxide.

        5. Adverse events related to use of nitrous oxide alone or in combination with a topical
           analgesic.
