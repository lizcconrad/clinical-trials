  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, participants with relapsed or refractory primary mediastinal large B-cell
      lymphoma (rrPMBCL) will receive GVD (Gemcitabine, Vinorelbine and Doxorubicine) chemotherapy
      and PD-1 antibody（SHR-1210） with or without low-dose Decitabine priming. The safety and
      feasibility of combined regimens will be evaluated in phase I study. The subsequent phase II
      study will access the efficacy of the combined regimens.

    <description>The antitumor efficacy of the combination treatments as measured by ORR was determined using the International Working Group 2007 criteria for malignant lymphoma (J Clin Oncol. 2007 Feb 10;25(5):579-586). Clinical response of progressive disease (PD), stable disease (SD), partial remission (PR), or complete remission (CR) will be determined at each assessment. ORR is defined as the sum of CR and PR.</description>
