      Monocentric prospective study evaluating the efficacy of High intensity focused ultrasound
      (HIFU) in breast tumors.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Incidence of breast cancer increases with the lifetime of the population, and represents an
      important socio-economic issue. Diagnosis and treatment are major public health issues. High
      Instensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) is a minimally invasive technique which decreases the
      risk of post-treatment complications and allows shorter hospitalization times. This
      technology is also remarkable for the absence of limitation related to the dose delivered,
      which makes it possible to repeat if necessary and the absence of ionizing radiation both for
      the treatment itself and for its guidance (MRI).

      The main objective is to evaluate the efficacy of HIFU for the treatment of breast tumors,
      based on histological criteria.

      Indication :

      Histologically invasive ductal carcinoma, T0, with unifocal or plurifocal lesion, with or
      without associated microcalcifications, measuring 15 mm maximum on ultrasound and clinical
      N0.

      Course of the study :

        -  Signature of consent,

        -  Clinical and radiological assessment at Baseline,

        -  Realization of the HIFU procedure under local anesthesia and sedation (J0),

        -  Total or partial mastectomy depending on the lesion (between D2 and D8),

        -  Consultation with surgeon (J30),

      Number of patients :

      15 patients will be included in this pilot study. If no success is observed, the study will
      be stopped and the technique considered inefficient. If there are one or more successes, an
      Independant Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will meet to propose an additional trial if
      necessary with the data from this trial.

Incomplete success: Partial tumor destruction of the invasive contingent, unhealthy margins due to underestimation of tumor volume before treatment or imperfect targeting of focused ultrasound. Incomplete successes will be considered as failures. The persistence of an in situ quota alone will be considered as success.
Failure: presence of viable invasive tumor cells in the treated area.</description>
