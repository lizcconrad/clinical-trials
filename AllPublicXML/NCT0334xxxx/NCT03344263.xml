  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is a monocentric prospective pilot study in Poitiers University Hospital, specifically
      analyzing the vigilance disorders in the Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea Syndrome (OSAHS)
      and their reversibility after 6 months of Continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP).

      All subjects were administered a test of vigilance (Test of Attentional Performance) both
      before and after the 6 months of CPAP.

      The main objective is the study of the reversibility of alertness disorders on the number of
      omissions in the subtest visual vigilance of the TAP ( (Test of Attentional Performance) at 6
      months of CPAP in the OSAHS in patients with a memory complaint.
