      Investigators adopt cross-sectional study design to carry out the exemplary research in the
      aspects of disease diagnosis.This study is designed to confirm the hypothesis &quot;acupoint
      sensitization is associated with a severity of angina pectoris, which may contribute to the
      diagnosis of stable angina pectoris&quot;. After the eligible participants recruited in group, the
      coronary artery lesions will be evaluated through coronary angiography and the Canadian
      Cardiovascular Society(CCS) angina pectoris classification will also be evaluated at the same
      time. The degree of acupoint sensitization will be tested by the electronic Von Frey
      instrument by one professional acupuncturist with total 12 acupoints, including
      Shenmen,Yinxi, Shaohao,Jiquan,Neiguan, Ximen, Quze, Shanzhong, Juque, Jueyinyu, Xinyu, Duyu.
      Analysis were conducted to explore relationships between the degree of acupoint
      sensitization, the degree of coronary artery stenosis and CCS angina pectoris classification.
      Diagnostic value will be further analyzed in the final step.
