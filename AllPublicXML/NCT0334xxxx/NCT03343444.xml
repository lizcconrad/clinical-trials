        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Willing and able to provide written informed consent.

          2. 12-18 years

          3. HCV RNA ≥ 104 IU/mL at screening.

          4. Confirmed chronic HCV infection as documented by either:

             a. a positive anti-HCV antibody test or positive HCV RNA or positive HCV genotyping
             test at least 6 months prior to the Baseline/Day 1 visit, or

          5. Screening ECG without clinically significant abnormalities.

          6. Patients must have the following laboratory parameters at screening:

               -  ALT (Alanine transaminase) ≤ 10 x the upper limit of normal (ULN)

               -  AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase) ≤ 10 x ULN

               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 12 g/dL for male, ≥ 11 g/dL for female patients

               -  Platelets &gt; 50,000 cells/mm3

               -  INR (international normalized ratio) ≤ 1.5 x ULN unless subject has known
                  hemophilia or is stable on an anticoagulant regimen affecting INR

               -  Albumin ≥ 3 g/dL

          7. Patient has not been treated with any investigational drug or device within 30 days of
             the screening visit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Chronic liver disease of a non-HCV etiology (eg, hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, α1
             antitrypsin deficiency, cholangitis).

          2. Infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

             syndrome).

          5. History of clinically-significant illness or any other major medical disorder that may
             interfere with subject treatment, assessment or compliance with the protocol.

          6. History of a gastrointestinal disorder (or post-operative condition) that could
             interfere with the absorption of the study drug.

          7. History of significant pulmonary disease, significant cardiac disease or porphyria.

          8. History of difficulty with blood collection and/or poor venous access for the purposes
             of phlebotomy.

          9. Donation or loss of more than 400 mL blood within 2 months prior to Baseline/Day 1.

         10. Known hypersensitivity to the study investigational medicinal product, the
             metabolites, or formulation excipients.
