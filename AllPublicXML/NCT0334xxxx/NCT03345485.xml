  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tinostamustine (EDO-S101) is a new chemical entity, an AK-DAC (a first-in-class alkylating
      deacetylase inhibiting molecule) that, in preclinical studies, has been shown to
      simultaneously improve access to the DNA strands within cancer cells, break them and block
      damage repair. This Phase 1/2 study will enroll patients with various advanced solid tumors.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of 2 phases:

        -  Phase 1: Dose Escalation until MAD

        -  Phase 2: Evaluation of Toxicity and Response Rate in Selected Solid Tumor Cohorts

      The study is designed as an open label, Phase 1/2 trial of single agent EDOS101. The Phase 1
      portion of the study is designed to define the MTD for two (2) administration schedules by
      evaluating toxicities during dose escalation until MAD. The Phase 2 portion of the study is
      designed to evaluate ORR and CBR at four (4) or six (6) months depending on the type of solid
      tumor.
