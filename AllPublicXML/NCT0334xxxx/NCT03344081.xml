  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Meditation skills, or paying attention to internal mental states, are thought to improve
      people's health. This study is developing a new brain measure of meditation skills, called
      the EMBODY Task, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The investigators are
      testing whether pattern recognition methods can be applied to fMRI data to identify mental
      states during meditation, including attention to the body and to thoughts. This task is being
      developed in meditation practitioners and non-meditators. The goal is to understand what
      people are paying attention to during meditation using brain data. The investigators
      hypothesize that pattern recognition technology will be able to identify different mental
      states that occur during meditation.

    <textblock>
      The investigators are developing a new functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) task (the
      EMBODY Task) to measure mental states during meditation using pattern recognition or machine
      learning technology. This task is being piloted and validated in 20 meditators and 20 control
      participants, in two waves of pilot testing. Meditators will have practiced meditation for at
      least the 5 years, at least 90 minutes weekly. Control participants will have little to no
      meditation experience and will be age- and gender-matched to each meditator. All participants
      will be MRI-compatible, healthy with no health conditions that affect breathing, have no
      current psychiatric disorder, and not be taking psychotropic medications.

      In the EMBODY Task, participants will be instructed to pay attention to areas of the body,
      their thoughts, sounds in the scanner, and to stop paying attention, in short intervals
      (16-45s). They will also meditate on their breath for 10 minutes. The investigators will
      determine whether pattern recognition technology can distinguish 5 mental states, and whether
      these brain patterns can be used to identify mental states during meditation. The
      investigators hypothesize that all 5 mental states will be distinguished by pattern
      recognition in the meditators, and potentially in the controls. Investigators also
      hypothesize that meditators should pay attention to their breath longer during meditation
      compared to controls.

    <description>The EMBODY Task is a new brain-based measure using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure meditation skills. The primary outcome measure of the EMBODY Task is whether brain patterns are recognized by pattern classification algorithms for the 5 conditions in the study (attention to breath, body, mind wandering, thoughts, and sounds) above chance levels (20% for 5 conditions, using a one-sample t-test for each condition in the entire sample). Classification accuracy is a standard outcome measure in studies that use brain pattern classification. This will demonstrate that brain patterns associated with internal attention are indeed differentiable by pattern classification methods. These brain patterns will then be used to identify the focus of attention during breath meditation.</description>

        This study is designed for healthy adults, some of whom have extended meditation practice
        (at least 5 years), and some who have little or no meditation experience.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy adults, 25-65 years of age.

          -  Meditators will be affiliated with meditation centers that are based in the Vipassana
             tradition or Zen traditions. In the past 5 years, meditators will have a consistent
             practice in mindfulness of body practices, where consistent practice is defined as
             practicing for at least 90 minutes in a typical week. They will also have had at least
             14 days of total silent retreat practice in the past 5 years. At least half of total
             practice time as reported by the participants will be engaged in mindfulness of body
             practices (e.g., breath meditation, body scan, mindfulness of emotions, mindful yoga,
             walking meditation).

          -  Non-meditator control group. Within the past 3 years, participants will not have
             engaged in regular meditation (including from courses such as Mindfulness-Based Stress
             Reduction, Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy, and Dialectical Behavioral Therapy),
             yoga, or other mind-body practice (such as Tai Chi, Feldenkrais, sensory awareness, or
             related practices), defined as more than 20 minutes of practice at least two times per
             week. If there is experience with mind-body practices prior to the past 3 years, it
             should not include an extended period of consistent practice (such as 20 min daily
             practice for a year or more) or a period of intensive practice longer than 7 days
             (e.g., 10-day silent retreat).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Participants who endorse:

          1. being smokers;

          2. chronic or recurrent bronchial or pulmonary disease requiring medical attention;

          3. having been diagnosed with sleep apnea;

          4. a history of an upper or lower respiratory tract infection in the 6 weeks preceding
             the study;

          5. pregnancy;

          6. diseases that restrain chest or abdominal breathing, such as ankylosing spondylitis,
             systemic lupus, chronic abdominal pain, chronic liver or kidney diseases,

          7. can not fit comfortably in the MRI scanner.

          8. potentially confounding medical conditions that impact breathing (e.g.,asthma,
             congestive heart failure, and emphysema that are not well-controlled), could impact
             attention to the breath (e.g., chronic pain conditions that are not well-managed), or
             impact neural functioning (e.g., multiple sclerosis, neurological diseases, brain
             injury);

          9. currently experiencing a mental health condition (e.g., anxiety, depression, panic
             disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, attention deficit and hyperactivity
             disorder) or past severe mental illness such as bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or
             severe substance abuse disorder.

         10. use of psychotropic medications in the past year

         11. current use of medications that potentially can affect the respiratory system or the
             interoceptive focus in the past week (including narcotics, benzodiazepines); if the
             research assistant is unclear about a specific medication, the physician on the study
             (Dr. Rick Hecht) will be asked and will decide;

         12. health behaviors that could affect respiration (e.g., DSM-IV diagnosis of substance
             use disorder, use of major recreational drugs in the past year—heroin, cocaine, etc.);

         13. any high-level training in a field that could impact body awareness and is not
             associated with mind-body practices (e.g., professional athletes or dancers, marathon
             runners);

         14. lack of ability to speak and read English fluently (instructions and questionnaires
             will be in English only and foreign language translations will have to await future
             studies);

         15. For participants who consent to the fMRI study, exclusion criteria include
             contra-indications for safety and data quality in the MRI scanner (see MRI screening
             form): presence of ferromagnetic metal on or in the body, pregnancy, movement disorder
             which prevents lying still in the scanner, claustrophobia, braces, and corrected
             vision that is not within +/- 8.
