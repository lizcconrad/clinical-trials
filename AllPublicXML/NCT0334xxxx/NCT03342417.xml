  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Safety and tolerability of combination of Nivolumab and Ipilimumab will be studied in
      patients with 3 different types of cancers in 3 parts of the study, as shown below:

      Part 1 - Neoadjuvant Therapy of Breast Cancer;

      Part 2 - Therapy of Ovarian Cancer; and

      Part 3 - Therapy of Gastric Cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Open-Label, Non-Randomization and Safety Run-In: Part 1 of the study is a Phase 2 clinical
      trial in 20 newly diagnosed patients who have Stage II-III breast cancer, with the primary
      cancer in place. Parts 2 and 3 of the Study are Phase 2 clinical trials in 20 platinum
      resistant refractory ovarian cancer (PRROC) and gastric cancer patients, respectively.

      Also in all Parts 1, 2 and 3 of the study, there will be a safety run-in involving 3-6
      patients. Specifically, the enrollment of patients in each of the 3 parts of the study will
      begin with 3 patients. If no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs, defined as toxicity ≥Grade 3)
      are observed in the first 3 patients during the first cycle, enrollment can continue for the
      remaining 17 patients. If 1 of the first 3 patients experiences a DLT, the enrollment will be
      expanded to a total of 6 subjects. If no more than 1 of 6 subjects experiences a DLT,
      enrollment can continue for the remaining 14 patients. If 2 or more of the first 2-6 subjects
      experience a DLT, enrollment may be paused. The study data will be reviewed to determine
      whether alternate dose levels or treatment schedules should be evaluated.

        core needle biopsy (CNB) or incisional biopsy (excisional biopsy is not allowed):

          -  fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) negative. (Note: Patients who are HER2Neu+3
             or HER2Neu+ by FISH are excluded, as there is FDA approved therapy with known clinical
             benefit in the neoadjuvant setting.)

             mastectomy or lumpectomy) after completion of neoadjuvant therapy

          -  the disease must be radiographically measurable in the breast. (radiographically
             measurable disease is defined as longest diameter ≥1.0 cm)

             pills cannot be used) during the study and for at least 3 months following completion
             of the study, and must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 2 weeks

        R. Any live virus vaccine within 30 days prior to the start of therapy (Note: Seasonal flu
        vaccine is acceptable.)

        S. Known hypersensitivity to OPDIVO or YERVOY, or to their excipients.
