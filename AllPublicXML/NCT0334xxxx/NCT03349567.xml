  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antimicrobial resistance is one of today's most urgent public health problems. One of the
      most important strategies to slow the spread of antimicrobial resistance is the promotion of
      judicious antimicrobial use. There are tremendous opportunities to reduce unnecessary
      antimicrobial-prescribing, particularly in Emergency Departments (EDs). In this study, the
      investigators will work collaboratively with ED providers in the Veterans Health
      Administration (VHA) to reduce unnecessary antimicrobial use. Academic-detailing and an
      audit-and-feedback intervention will be implemented, and the study will assess how overall
      antimicrobial-prescribing changes once these interventions are performed. ED providers will
      be shown how their antimicrobial-prescribing compares to their peers, thereby encouraging
      them to consider their professional reputation when making prescribing decisions. To assess
      the impact of this intervention, the study will monitor providers' antimicrobial-prescribing
      behavior through an automated metric, i.e. number of antimicrobial prescriptions per number
      of patient-visits. To assess changes in the appropriateness of antimicrobial-prescribing, the
      study team will also perform manual chart reviews and compare prescribing decisions to
      published guidelines.

      Using a quasi-experimental design, the study team will work collaboratively with ED providers
      in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) to improve antimicrobial-prescribing.
      Academic-detailing and an audit-and-feedback intervention will be implemented. Through
      audit-and-feedback, providers will be shown how their antimicrobial-prescribing compares to
      their peers, thereby encouraging them to consider their professional reputation when making
      prescribing decisions.

      The study will use a pretest-posttest design (quasi-experimental design with a non-equivalent
      control group) to assess the effect of our pilot intervention at 2 participating EDs and 2
      control EDs. For each ED, the pretest period will be the 12 months prior to the intervention.
      The intervention itself will last 12 months.

      There will be an estimated 30 ED providers at the 2 study sites and 30 ED providers at the 2
      control sites. Only antimicrobial prescriptions to patients discharged from the ED will be
      evaluated.

      The primary outcome will be antimicrobial-prescribing volume adjusted for the total number of
      patient-visits. Secondary outcomes include the frequency of guideline-discordant
      antimicrobial-prescribing and adverse events.

      At the conclusion of the pilot trial, a quasi-experimental interrupted time-series (ITS)
      analysis will be performed to assess the change in monthly antimicrobial usage for the 2
      intervention sites combined and the 2 control sites combined. The time frame for this ITS
      analysis will be the one-year prior to the pilot trial's initiation through the trial's
      1-year intervention period for a total of 24 months. In addition, a multivariable analysis
      will be performed to identify predictors of guideline-discordant therapy.

    <measure>Change in antimicrobial-prescribing volume</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in antimicrobial-prescribing volume will be calculated across the 12-months of the intervention period in comparison to the 12-months of the pre-intervention period. An interrupted time-series analysis will be performed.</time_frame>
    <description>Antimicrobial-prescribing volume reflects the volume of antimicrobials prescribed per patient-visits. It is defined as the total number of antimicrobial prescriptions divided by the total number of patient-visits. This metric will be calculated on the provider level. It will also be calculated as an aggregate across all intervention sites and separately across all control sites.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Guideline-discordant antimicrobial use</measure>
    <time_frame>It will be calculated for the entire 12-months of both the pre-intervention period and the intervention period.</time_frame>
    <description>Guideline-discordant antimicrobial use is defined as the frequency of guideline-discordant antimicrobial-prescribing. To calculate this outcome, a trained chart abstractor will first manually review the medical records from a random sample of 25 visits for each provider. Visits that are audited will be associated with an ICD-10 code for an ARTI or cystitis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Late antimicrobial prescription</measure>
    <time_frame>It will be calculated for the entire 12-months of both the pre-intervention period and the intervention period.</time_frame>
    <description>Late antimicrobial prescription is defined as the prescription of an (additional) antimicrobial by any provider within 30 days of the patient's index visit with the ED provider.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospitalization</measure>
    <time_frame>It will be calculated for the entire 12-months of both the pre-intervention period and the intervention period.</time_frame>
    <description>Hospitalization is defined as the need for hospitalization for any indication at a VA-facility within 30 days of the patient's index visit with the ED provider.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mortality</measure>
    <time_frame>It will be calculated for the entire 12-months of both the pre-intervention period and the intervention period.</time_frame>
    <description>Mortality is defined as all-cause death within 30-days of the patient's index visit with the ED provider.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clostridium difficile</measure>
    <time_frame>It will be calculated for the entire 12-months of both the pre-intervention period and the intervention period.</time_frame>
    <description>Clostridium difficile testing is defined as a laboratory test for Clostridium difficile ordered within 30-days of the patient's index visit with the ED provider. Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is defined as a positive laboratory test for Clostridium difficile within 30-days of the patient's index visit with the ED provider.</description>
