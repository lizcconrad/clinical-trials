  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Within the present study 4 different band-aid/adhesive combinations will be tested in
      patients with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes with regard to adherence to the body and
      allergic potential. The study period is set to 21 days following adhesive material placement
      to cover the maximum expected wear-time of the novel CGM system (14 days) plus an additional
      seven days to ensure that adhesive material is tested for a sufficient time-period and
      differences in adhesion can clearly be observed. A sub-study will be conducted with patients
      only enrolled at Medical University Graz. The sub-study is conducted to analyse the
      individual pain perception during the insertion process and to asess the easiness of sensor
      insertion by three different insertion methods.
