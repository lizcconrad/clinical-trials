  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A double-blind sham surgery-controlled trial was developed to determine the effectiveness of
      implantation of human embryonic dopamine neurons into the putamen of patients with advanced
      Parkinson's disease (PD), with half the patients receiving the implant (n = 20) and half
      receiving sham surgery (n = 20). The blind was maintained for 12 months before participants
      were told which surgery they received, at which time those receiving sham surgery could
      request the implant surgery.

      A double-blind sham surgery-controlled trial was conducted to determine the effectiveness of
      implantation of human embryonic dopamine neurons into the putamen of patients with advanced
      Parkinson's disease (PD), with half the patients receiving the implant (n = 20) and half
      receiving sham surgery (n = 20). The goals were to determine whether the cells survived and
      led to improvement of symptoms, and to examine the effect of age on results of the
      implantation. Quality of life of participants and care partners was also examined at each of
      the assessment periods (baseline, 4, 8 and 12 months). The blind was maintained for 12
      months.
