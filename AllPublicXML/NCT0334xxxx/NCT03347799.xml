  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When a child was born too early, it is more likely to develop an alteration of its visual
      function than in the case of term birth. Significant visual disturbances are found in 3% of
      children born prematurely, but visual impairment can be very severe, up to the loss of vision
      in case of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in the most immature infants. The introduction of
      screening surveillance systems, such as WINROP software, might reduce the need for stressful
      eye examination in low risk neonates. This retrospective study aimed at validating the WINROP
      algorithm in a cohort of premature infants, born below 32 weeks of gestation, who had
      systematic eye examination for ROP screening over 4 year period.
