    <textblock>
      Heart failure is a clinical syndrome marked by breathlessness, even at low levels of
      exertion, general fatigue, and fluid retention and is estimated to affect 5.1 million people
      in the United States. Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) means that the
      heart pumps enough blood to the body, but patients still have terrible symptoms. It is
      estimated to account for about 50% of all heart failure cases. Experts agree that impaired
      filling of the heart, perhaps due to &quot;stiffness&quot; of the heart muscle itself, critically
      underlies HFpEF. There is currently no clinical technique for measuring heart muscle
      (myocardial) stiffness; the very definition of &quot;myocardial stiffness&quot; remains poorly
      established. Consequently, the ability to study the mechanisms that underlie HFpEF is
      virtually non-existent, and limited treatment options will persist without significant
      advances. The objective of this project is to use an Equilibrium-Material-Stability (EMS)
      framework that couples patient-specific clinical MRI and heart pressure data in a
      computational model of the heart to diagnose changes in myocardial stiffness. The central
      hypothesis is that the new EMS framework for understanding the mechanisms of diastolic
      dysfunction in HFpEF will be more sensitive and outperform currently available approaches.

      The study has three aims. The first aim of the project is to refine MRI techniques using
      &quot;free-breathing&quot; versus &quot;breath-holding&quot; measurements. Twenty-five normal volunteers will
      undergo MRI to refine &quot;free-breathing&quot; cardiac imaging and enable construction of
      patient-specific computer models of the heart. The second aim of the project is to validate
      and test the myocardial stiffness evaluation framework derived through the first objective in
      human subjects. Twenty-five normal volunteers will undergo MRI and the data from these images
      will be compared to specially constructed 3D printed models of the heart, enabling refinement
      of the EMS framework to separate structural stiffness from material stiffness. The third aim
      of the project is to measure changes in myocardial stiffness in patients with HFpEF.
      Thirty-three subjects with current diagnostic criteria for HFpEF will be evaluated at
      baseline and at six months to evaluate myocardial stiffness and cardiac MRI biomarkers.
      Specifically, this aim will establish the diagnostic sensitivity of the EMS framework with
      comparison to cardiac MRI biomarkers of increased stiffness, thereby providing mechanistic
      insight to one critical underlying cause of HFpEF.
