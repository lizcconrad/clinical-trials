    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of adavosertib when given together
      with external beam radiation therapy and cisplatin in treating patients with cervical,
      vaginal, or uterine cancer. Adavosertib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some
      of the enzymes needed for cell growth. External beam radiation therapy uses high energy
      x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin,
      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by
      stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving adavosertib, external
      beam radiation therapy, and cisplatin may work better in treating patients with cervical,
      vaginal, or uterine cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) and safety profile of adavosertib
      (AZD1775) in combination with radiotherapy and concurrent cisplatin in patients with
      gynecological cancers.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the acute and late toxicity of AZD1775 when administered to patients with
      gynecological cancer in combination with standard radiotherapy and concurrent cisplatin.

      II. To evaluate the pharmacodynamic effects of AZD1775 when administered in combination with
      radiotherapy and concurrent cisplatin (in particular, for the 15 patients treated in an
      expansion cohort at the RP2D).

      III. To obtain preliminary information about the progression-free survival, as defined by
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 or clinical progression, of AZD1775
      in combination with standard radiotherapy and concurrent cisplatin in women with
      gynecological cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of adavosertib.

      Patients undergo external beam radiation therapy on days 1-5 and receive adavosertib orally
      (PO) on days 1, 3, and 5 or once daily (QD) on days 1-5 and cisplatin intravenously (IV) over
      1 hour on day 1 or 3. Courses repeat each week for up to 5 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression of unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 28 days and then every 4
      months for 2 years.
