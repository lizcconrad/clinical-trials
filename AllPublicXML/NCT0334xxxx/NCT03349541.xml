  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medical and technological advances have resulted in a growing cohort of children with medical
      complexity (CMC), many of whom would not have survived previously and are living and thriving
      within the community. These families have unique needs that have previously not been taught
      in the typical training programs for paediatricians. The goal of this project is to develop
      an evaluation of a national complex care curriculum and to identify whether dedicated
      educational modules have an impact on improving clinical performance and resident
      self-efficacy.

  <detailed_description>

      Rationale:

      A structured program evaluation considering a hierarchy of outcomes is essential to determine
      whether improved training in complex care is associated with increased skills in this area,
      and whether these skills transfer to a clinical setting where they will influence quality of
      care for CMC.

      A paediatric resident's sense of self-efficacy, or perceived capability, in caring for CMC is
      therefore important to foster for the graduating paediatrician to assume a leadership role in
      coordinating care, co-developing goals of care with families, advocating in the face of
      health challenges, and ultimately striving for high-quality clinical care for CMC.

      We anticipate that participation in a complex care curriculum will result in sustained high
      performance on simulated clinical scenarios in complex care and increased resident
      self-efficacy in caring for CMC, compared to paediatric residents that have not participated
      in the curriculum. This study will examine if a standardized complex care curriculum for
      paediatric residents has a positive effect on the acquisition of key competencies in the care
      of CMC using a rigorous experimental research design. To our knowledge, this is the first
      national, standardized, population-specific curriculum for Canadian paediatric residents to
      be developed and evaluated with this systematic approach.

      Study Objectives:

      The overarching aim of this project is to develop a robust evaluation of the national complex
      care curriculum, and identify whether dedicated educational modules have an impact on
      improving clinical performance and resident self-efficacy.

      Primary Research Question:

      What is the comparative effectiveness of participation in a standardized curriculum on
      acquisition of clinical skills in complex care for paediatric residents, relative to
      paediatric residents receiving a standard educational session not related to complex care,
      evaluated by OSCE scores in a complex care scenario?

      Secondary Objectives:

      To explore changes in paediatric residents' sense of self-efficacy and comfort in caring for
      CMC following participation in the curriculum using semi-structured interviews.

    <description>This outcome will be measured by the score obtained on a standardized checklist for a complex care scenario in the Spring 2017 national paediatric in-training objective structured clinical examination (OSCE). The OSCE global score is out of 50, with a higher score representing a better performance. OSCE sub-scores related to specific components of the curriculum (tracheostomy care, common issues in complex medical care, and diagnosis and management) will be compared between groups.</description>
