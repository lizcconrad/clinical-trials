      The &quot;Make It Fresh, For Less&quot; Supermarket Pilot Study is a supermarket-based intervention
      developed by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in collaboration with the
      nonprofit organization ChopChop Magazine (chopchopmagazine.org) and a large Northeastern
      supermarket chain. A promotional campaign advertising low-cost, kid-friendly meals was
      piloted in one store selected by the supermarket partner, with promotions rotating every 4
      weeks during a 16-week intervention period. Parent shoppers were recruited (n=401) at the
      store and given a study loyalty card to track their transactions. At the start of the
      intervention, half of the participants were additionally randomized to receive weekly
      behavioral messages via text message or email. Supermarket purchases were assessed at
      baseline, during the 16-week intervention, and up to 6-weeks post-intervention.

      Primary Aim 1: to examine the impact of a choice architecture intervention in combination
      with a promotional campaign on food purchases of parents shopping in a large supermarket. It
      is hypothesized that there will be an increase in selection of foods targeted by the
      promotional campaign when physical modifications are made.

      Primary Aim 2: to examine the impact of weekly behavioral messages in combination with an
      environmental change intervention on food purchases of parents shopping in a large
      supermarket. It is hypothesized that there will be a greater increase in selection of foods
      targeted by the promotional campaign among participants receiving the messages compared to
      participants exposed to the environmental change intervention alone.

    <description>Shopper responses to survey questions asking participants to rate the acceptability of each recipe (taste, cost, difficulty, perceptions of children's preferences) on a Likert scale from 1-5.</description>

    <measure>Recall of intervention (self-reported survey measures)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Shopper responses to survey questions regarding aided and unaided recall. Unaided recall asks shoppers to choose the best description of what they saw in the store and aided recall asks shoppers whether they remember seeing various elements of the display in the store (yes, no, not sure). These measures will be combined to report the proportion of shoppers who recalled each component of the intervention either through aided or unaided means.</description>
