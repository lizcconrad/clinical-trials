  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Modern way of life characterized by decreased physical activity and poor dietary habits seems
      to be an important trigger for the onset of metabolic disorders. Accumulating evidence
      indicates that the gut microbiota is involved in host metabolism by increasing energy
      extraction, immune system modulation, and altering lipid metabolism, which play an intricate
      role in metabolic disorders, such as obesity and diabetes. Diet has a major role in shaping
      the composition and activity of gut microbiota. Consumptions of whole-grain and
      polyunsaturated fatty acids are known to exert certain extent of impacts on gut microbial
      communities in terms of participants' richness and diversity. In this study, the
      investigators aim to evaluate the impact of dietary intervention on gut microbiome in Hong
      Kong obese population

      1. Purpose of the Study Modern way of life characterized by decreased physical activity and
           poor dietary habits seems to be an important trigger for the onset of metabolic
           disorders. Accumulating evidence indicates that the gut microbiota is involved in host
           metabolism by increasing energy extraction, immune system modulation, and altering lipid
           metabolism, which play an intricate role in metabolic disorders, such as obesity and
           diabetes. Diet has a major role in shaping the composition and activity of gut
           microbiota. Consumptions of whole-grain and polyunsaturated fatty acids are known to
           exert certain extent of impacts on gut microbial communities in terms of the
           participants' richness and diversity. In this study, the investigators aim to evaluate
           the impact of dietary intervention on gut microbiome in Hong Kong obese population.

        2. Method of investigation

           The study will last for 9 weeks. 48 eligible subjects aged 30-60 years old will be
           randomly allocated into 4 groups, to 3 of which nutrition advice on healthy diets and
           preferred food choices will be given while the remaining one will keep the participants'
           usual diets. Dietary surveys will be conducted to reveal the participants' dietary
           habits. Meanwhile, blood, stool and buccal swab will be collected to examine the effect
           of dietary intervention for example, changes of composition of gut microbiota, fasting
           blood glucose levels and lipid profiles as well as other metabolic indicators.

        3. Approach

      Subjects will be recruited via convenience sampling through internet and poster promotion.
      Screening for eligible subjects will be conducted by Research staff in PolyU on phone. If the
      participants are interested to join the study, the staff will explain study details and
      appointments will thus be made on a first come first serve basis. The study starts upon
      obtained consensus from subjects. Blood collection and testing will be outsourced to health
      check centre to further confirm the eligibility of subjects.

      Eligible subjects will be randomly allocated into either control or intervention groups, in
      which subjects will receive dietitian consultations provided by registered dietitians. Also,
      stool, blood and buccal swab samples of subjects will be collected at various time points to
      examine changes of the investigators' desired parameters within the study.

    <masking_description>As soon as the samples are obtained from the subjects, subjects will be coded straight-away. No samples will be stored with the subjects' name on, only codes will be used. Only the investigating team will be able to break the codes and trace the results back to the subjects. All the questionnaires will be only shown the subjects' code without subjects' name on them. No data file in hard or soft copy format will contain all the information on the subject's name, project code and experiment result.</masking_description>
