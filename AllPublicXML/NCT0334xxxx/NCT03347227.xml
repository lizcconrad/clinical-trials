  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multicentre, parallel group, two arm, single-blinded randomized clinical trial, assessing
      the efficacy of a patient-tailored catheter ablation (CA) strategy guided by atrial scar
      mapping in addition to pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) when compared to PVI alone in patients
      with persistent atrial fibrillation (AF).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The optimal CA strategy for persistent AF remains unknown. Current data highlight the need
      for a better understanding of the substrate and mechanisms of arrhythmia maintenance in this
      population. Atrial scar-based catheter ablation has recently emerged as a promising strategy
      for ablation of AF. However, the available data has limitations that preclude definitive
      conclusions regarding the utility of this strategy (no data from multicenter, randomized
      studies available). Further research is needed to assess the role of scar-based ablation for
      persistent AF.

      The Investigators hypothesize that catheter ablation of persistent AF (PeAF) tailored to
      abolish abnormal atrial substrate identified by intracardiac atrial scar mapping in addition
      to pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) will result in higher procedural success rates when
      compared to PVI alone.

      The study will recruit 360 patients with PeAF (180 per study arm) who are candidates for CA
      ablation of AF according to the treating physician (and in agreement with current practice
      guidelines). Subjects will be recruited over a 24 month period. The total duration of the
      study is 48 months.

      Prior to undergoing catheter ablation subjects will be seen by the investigator/ research
      assistant and the following data will be collected:

      i. Age and sex ii. Structural heart disease if present iii. CHADS2VASc score iv. NYHA class
      v. Current medications vi. Duration of uninterrupted AF vii. Height and weight, blood
      pressure, pulse rate viii. Echocardiogram and other cardiac imaging results (within previous
      12 months, including assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction, left atrial volume and
      valve function).

      ix. ECG, Holter or loop monitor recording (within past 36 months) documenting AF

      Subjects will undergo cardiac MRI scan of the heart or cardiac CT scan to delineate left
      atrial (LA) and pulmonary vein (PV) anatomy. This will be used for image integration with the
      electroanatomical mapping system during ablation.

      Subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to undergo wide area circumferential
      ablation for pulmonary vein isolation (PVI- control arm) or wide area circumferential
      ablation PVI and scar ablation (experimental arm). Subjects will be randomized prior to
      procedure start (central venous access).

      Enrolled subjects will have a clinical follow up visit at 3, 6,12 and 18 months after the
      ablation procedure. A 14-day continuous ambulatory ECG monitor will be completed at each
      visit. The results of monitoring will be interpreted at a centralized core lab, and the
      results will be adjudicated by an arrhythmia specialist blinded to treatment group. A total
      of three questionnaires will be administered throughout the study, each at a specific time
      point. The Quality of Life (EQ-5D) and CCS-Severity of AF scale will be completed at
      baseline, 12-month and 18-month visit. The patient satisfaction score will be completed at
      the 18-month visit.

      Concomitant medical therapy will be selected according to the treating physician. All
      subjects will be maintained on systemic oral anticoagulation for at least 2 months following
      catheter ablation. Subjects with CHADS2 score ≥ 1 will be maintained on systemic oral
      anticoagulation indefinitely.
