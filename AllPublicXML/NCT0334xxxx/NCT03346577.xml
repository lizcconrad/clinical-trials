  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational study is to evaluate the performance and safety of
      endovascular treatment with stenting (Optimed Sinus Superflex 635) or balloon angioplasty
      (Cardionovum Legflow or Optimed Nylotrack .035 + .018) according to current practice. The
      goal of the study will be achieved by assessing binary restenosis with duplex ultrasound,
      peri- and postoperative complications, technical success, target lesion revascularization,
      amputation and clinical outcome.
