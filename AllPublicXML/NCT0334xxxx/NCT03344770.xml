  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind placebo controlled trial whose objective is to understand how much the
      radial extracorporeal shockwave therapy can improve function of patients with knee
      osteoarthritis.

      For this trial, patients with knee osteoarthritis, after signing the informed consent form
      and having their demographic and baseline information collected, will be randomly allocated
      into one of both treatment arms: radial extracorporeal shockwave therapy (rESWT) or sham
      radial extracorporeal shockwave therapy. Then, they will undertake three sessions of rESWT,
      for three weeks, i.e. one session per week.

      Patients will be assessed prior to the therapy, one week after the end of the therapy and
      three months after the end of the therapy, and the primary outcome of this study is the
      functional change measured by the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)
      validated in Portuguese, three months after the end of the therapy.

      Secondary outcomes, will be the change of pain, the change of pressure pain tolerance
      threshold, change in diffuse noxious inhibitory control (DNIC), and thermographic changes.
