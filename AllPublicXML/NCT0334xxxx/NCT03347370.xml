  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety of subcutaneous (SC) interferon beta
      therapies with regard to frequency of injection site reactions (ISR) and flu-like symptoms
      (FLS) as reported by the relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) participants.
