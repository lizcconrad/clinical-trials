  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of a phase Ib study is to find out the best or maximum tolerated dose of a
      medication or combination of medications. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to decide
      the best dose of the study drug, Debio 1347, that can be given in combination with the
      standard hormonal drug, fulvestrant. Debio 1347 and fulvestrant could shrink the cancer but
      it could also cause side effects. This study tells us about the side effects of these drugs
      when given in this new combination, and how often they occur.

             medications that affect FGFR signaling as a secondary target (e.g., multi-tyrosine
