    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well tazemetostat works in treating patients with ovarian,
      primary peritoneal, or endometrial cancer that has come back. Drugs used in chemotherapy,
      such as tazemetostat, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by
      killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the clinical activity (overall response rate) of tazemetostat in patients with
      recurrent or persistent endometrioid or clear cell ovarian or primary peritoneal cancer, and
      low grade endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine the nature and degree of toxicity in this patient population treated with this
      regimen.

      II. To examine the progression free survival and overall survival for this patient population
      receiving tazemetostat.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate BAF250a expression in patient samples as an indicator of ARID1A mutation
      status and correlation with clinical response to study drug.

      II. To examine the correlation between ARID1A mutation and BAF250a expression and to identify
      potential mutations predictive of response in patients with preserved BAF250a expression.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive tazemetostat orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Courses repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
