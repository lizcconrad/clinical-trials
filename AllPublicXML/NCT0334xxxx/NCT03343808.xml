      Analyze the results of cooled radiofrequency in patients with chronic knee pain after one
      year of follow- up.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators performed a retrospective case-series reviewed of 40 patients who underwent
      cooled RF of genicular nerves. The investigators evaluated results of the survey of quality
      of life (SF36), knee society score (KSS) and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment success was defined as the number of subjects whose knee pain is reduced by ± 50% based on the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).</measure>
    <time_frame>one year after the procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS is a 11- point scale (0 points to 10 points), where 0 points equals &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 points equals the &quot;worst pain&quot;.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Short Form (36) Health Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>one year after the procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The SF36 values eight parameters: physical function, social function, physical role, emotional role, mental health, vitality, pain and general health. Zero is the worst conceivable health and 100 the best.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Knee Society Score (KSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>one year after the procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The KSS consists of two parts. KS measures pain, range of motion, stability and alignment. FS measures the distance able to walk, the difficulty in going up or down stairs and the need for walking aids. The result is rated as excellent (80-100), good (70-79), regular (60-69) and bad (&lt;60).</description>

    <intervention_type>Procedure</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>cooled radiofrequency ablation of genicular nerves</intervention_name>
    <description>Cooled RF consists of creating an injury in the nerve trough a high frequency flow. Unlike conventional RF, in cooled RF through a closed circuit where intravenous flows, we can create an injury for a longer period of time, at a lower temperature (standard RFA 90º C, cooled RFA 60º C) and within an area 8 times larger. As the lesion is spherical, and larger (about 10-12 mm in diameter), the chances of neurolysis of the nerve increase.</description>

        The procedure was performed to 33 patients with OA (two of them with inflammatory causes)
        and in 7 patients with TKA (four with revised TKA).
