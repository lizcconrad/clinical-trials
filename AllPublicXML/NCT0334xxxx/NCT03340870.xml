      The primary purpose of this study is to determine the Pharmacokinetics (PK) data of
      perfluorobutane (PFB) in blood and exhaled air following intravenous (I.V.) bolus injection
      of Sonazoid™ in healthy volunteers.

             results of a serum or urine human chorionic gonadotropin pregnancy test, performed on
             the day of Sonazoid™ administration (with the result known before IMP administration),
             were negative

          -  Participant is able and willing to comply with study procedures and provide signed and
             dated informed consent

             the investigator to be of no clinical importance are permitted

          -  Normal blood and urine clinical chemistry variables at screening. Isolated or
             minimally out-of-range values considered by the investigator to be of no clinical
             importance are permitted

          -  No regular use of concomitant medication, except for routine use of supplemental
             oestrogen

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant was previously included in this study

          -  Participation in another clinical trial with an unregistered medicinal product, or
             less than 30 days have passed since completing participation in such a trial

          -  Participant has a history of allergies to eggs or egg products (i.e., manifested by
             full body rash, respiratory difficulty, oral and laryngeal swelling, hypotension or
             shock)

          -  Donation of &gt;500 milliliter (mL) blood in the 12 weeks before Sonazoid™ administration

          -  Participant with congenital heart defects, including right-to-left, bi-directional, or
             transient right-to-left cardiac shunts

          -  Participant has positive test results for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or human
             immunodeficiency virus
