    <textblock>
      The trial evaluates the clinical efficacy and safety of autologous osteo-periosteal cylinder
      graft transplantation for Hepple V osteochondral lesions of the talus. Half of participants
      will receive autologous osteo-periosteal cylinder graft transplantation, while the other will
      receive osteochondral graft transplantation as a control group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autologous osteo-periosteal cylinder graft surface is a periosteal structure, with the
      ability of repairment to cartilage, periosteum is closely connected to the cortical bone,
      then the deep loose cancellous bone.The objective of the study is to evaluate the clinical
      efficacy of autologous osteo-periosteal cylinder graft transplantation for Hepple V
      osteochondral lesions of the talus by randomized controlled trial. 70 patients with
      clinically diagnosed Hepple V talus osteochondral lesions according to 1: 1 were divided into
      experimental group and control group. The experimental group will be treated with autologous
      osteo-periosteal cylinder graft transplantation under arthroscopy. The control group will be
      treated with autologous osteochondral graft under arthroscopy. The patients will be treated
      by the same surgeon in this study group. Postoperative MRI MOCART evaluation, clinical AOFAS
      score, VAS score, Tegner score, and the secondary arthroscopy ICRS score will be selected as
      the measures of outcome. The incidence of adverse events will be recorded.

    <description>The visual analogue scale or visual analog scale (VAS) is a psychometric response scale which can be used in questionnaires. It is a measurement instrument for subjective characteristics or attitudes that cannot be directly measured. When responding to a VAS item, respondents specify their level of agreement to a statement by indicating a position along a continuous line between two end-points. From 0 to 10, no pain 0, worst pain imaginable 10. The higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>
