      In this study, CE (European Conformity) marked, domestic manufactured standard orthopedic
      implants will be used after silver HA coating with electrospray method in 30 patients
      requiring hip joint prostheses, intramedullary nails or external fixator in 30 patients to
      antimicrobial effectiveness. These patients will be tasted for liver and kidney functions and
      blood and urine silver levels in addition to routine tests such as full blood, complete
      biochemistry, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate required in the normal
      diagnosis and treatment processes,

      In this study, considering the differences in bone contact surface area and interactions; hip
      joint prostheses, intramedullary nails and external fixator implants to be used in 30
      patients . CE (European Conformity) marked, domestic manufactured standard orthopedic
      implants will be used in patients after silver HA coating with electrospray method. These
      patients will be tasted for the evaluation of liver and kidney functions and blood and urine
      silver levels in addition to routine tests such as full blood, complete biochemistry,
      C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate required in the normal diagnosis and
      treatment processes, and will be monitored for at least 12 months. The performance of coating
      to be applied and any unwanted side effects in normal conditions of use will be evaluated..
