    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare the effects of spinal and general anesthesia on
      transcranial regional cerebral oxygen saturation in geriatric patients undergoing total hip
      arthroplasty.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Geriatric patients who received anesthesia undergoing total hip arthroplasty were randomized
      by means of a computer-generated randomization order into two groups; general anesthesia
      group (Group 1) and spinal anesthesia group (Group 2). Before and after induction of the
      general or spinal anesthesia, patients were monitorized with near infrared spectroscopy for
      regional cerebral oxygen saturation. Findings were compared statistically.
