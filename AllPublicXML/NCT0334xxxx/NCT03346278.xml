  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is strongly recommended for patients with coronary heart disease.
      However, patient enrollment and completion of cardiac rehabilitation is low. This study will
      examine if a mobile phone intervention that uses a text messaging program can successfully
      promote participation in cardiac rehabilitation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mobile phone interventions, such as text messaging programs, have been shown to promote
      healthy behaviors in patients with coronary heart disease, but it is unknown whether text
      messaging can successfully promote participation in cardiac rehabilitation.

      This study will have the following aims:

      Aim 1: Adapt a theory- and evidence-based text messaging intervention to promote
      participation in cardiac rehabilitation.

      Aim 2: Determine whether text messaging improves participation in cardiac rehabilitation
      among eligible patients.

      This study will have two parts. In part 1, the investigators will enroll patients with heart
      disease to rate the acceptability of text messages. In part 2, the investigators will enroll
      patients to participate in a randomized controlled trial. Participants will be randomized to
      receive text messages or no text messages for 6 months. Those who have been assigned to
      receive the text messaging intervention will be sent several text messages per week
      throughout the study period. The content of these text messages is designed promote healthy
      behaviors and participation in cardiac rehabilitation. Those who have not been assigned to
      receive the text messaging intervention will receive usual care. Outcome measures will be
      assessed at a baseline visit and at a 6-month follow-up visit at the end of the intervention.
      Additionally, some participants in the text messaging intervention group will be interviewed
      about their overall satisfaction and engagement with the text messages upon completion of the
      study.
