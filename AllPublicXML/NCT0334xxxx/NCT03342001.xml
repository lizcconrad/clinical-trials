  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some people with hypothyroidism have persistent symptoms despite adequate treatment with
      thyroid hormones. We are testing whether giving calcitonin to such people will improve their
      quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is known that a proportion of patients with hypothyroidism despite serum TSH levels being
      within the normal reference range, may continue to express symptoms of hypothyroidism. Common
      symptoms include fatigue, muscle pain, weight gain, and mood changes. Saravanan et al.
      reported in a large community-based survey that patients on levothyroxine even with a normal
      TSH showed significant impairment in psychological well-being compared with age- and
      sex-matched controls. These patients are challenging to manage and are often unhappy with
      they care.

      Established treatment of hypothyroidism is levothyroxine. Thyroid follicular cells synthesize
      and secrete thyroxine and triiodothyronine. However, even when people are receiving adequate
      levothyroxine replacement therapy, their quality of life may not improve. Calcitonin (CT) is
      also produced by the thyroid gland, parafollicular cells. Their levels are not tested in
      hypothyroidism because the exact role of calcitonin in human health and disease is not fully
      known. CT has long been thought to play an important role in bone and mineral homeostasis,
      particularly with respect to its ability to regulate calcium metabolism. CT has been found in
      fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Salmon-derived CT is 50-100 times more potent than human
      CT. Hence, salmon CT (sCT) has been used for medicinal purposes.

      There is a need for further research in order to understand the nature of persisting symptoms
      in patients on T4 monotherapy despite a serum TSH within the reference range. Calcitonin has
      been shown to alleviate pain in patients with bone or mineral disorders. To date, the use of
      calcitonin for relief of hypothyroid symptoms has not been studied.
