  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2 study designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BION-1301 in
      adults with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma whose disease has progressed after 3 or
      more prior systemic therapies.

      An open-label, multi-center, dose-selection Phase 1/2 study (also referred to as ADU-CL-16)
      evaluating BION-1301, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against APRIL for the
      treatment of relapsed or refractory MM. This first-in-human study is designed to evaluate the
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and initial clinical activity of
      BION-1301 administered as a single agent.

      The study will be conducted in 2 parts. Phase 1 is dose escalation and seeks to determine the
      recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Once an RP2D is identified, Phase 2 of the study will open
      and continue to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of BION-1301 administered at
      selected dose level(s).

      The population for this study will consist of adults with relapsed or refractory MM whose
      disease has progressed after at least 3 prior systemic therapies. BION-1301 will be
      administered in 28-day cycles; the dosing interval will be once every two weeks (Q2W).
