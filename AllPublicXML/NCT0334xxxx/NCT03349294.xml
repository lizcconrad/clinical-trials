  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thyroid cancer patients who have undergone total thyroidectomy, postoperative iodine 131
      treatment to ablation residual thyroid tissue, is the current clinical practice. The
      effective half-life of the iodine 131 in the human body and in vivo exposure dose can be
      assessed by the in vivo kinetic model published by ICRP, but this model is based on standard
      healthy people and can not be corrected for patients undergoing total thyroidectomy.

      In this study, the investigators will use the actual clinical data to revise the biokinetic
      model of iodine-131 in patients with total thyroidectomy.

      Methods Patients:All patients undergoing thyroidectomy and are about to be treated with
      iodine 131 30mCi will be invited to join the study. Exclusion with gastrointestinal surgery.

      Preparation:The patient of this study, their medication and diet and other matters needing
      attention, are in accordance with the original to accept iodine -131 30mCi treatment of the
      standard treatment.

      Imaging Protocol:After oral administration of iodine 131, patients must undergo whole body
      scan, for 1 hour, 4 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 168 hours, respectively. Image
      collection will use GE Infinia Hawkeye 4 SPECT / CT with high energy general purpose
      collimator. The imaging parameters use the original I-131 whole body scan protocol.

      Expected results:Image data is further analyzed by MATLAB software to obtain iodine 131 in
      the body of individual organs of the biological half-life and path strength percentage. This
      analysis can revise the iodine -131 biokinetic model of patients with total thyroidectomy,
      providing more accurate calculations and subsequent studies.
