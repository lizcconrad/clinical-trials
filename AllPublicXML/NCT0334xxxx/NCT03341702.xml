  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prison concentrates people with violent behavior and patients suffering from psychiatric
      disorders. Aggression are daily, the suicide rate is 5 to 10 times higher than the ordinary
      environment and current prevention devices have shown their limits.

      That's why, in order to improve the violence's prevention in prison, the investigator propose
      to identify the predictive factors of violence by studying retrospectively the link between
      the psychiatric profile and commission of violence after being jailed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      From the 1st January to the 31 December 2012, every man incarcerated was screened thanks to
      the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) to establish the presence of a
      current and/or past psychiatric diagnoses. In addition, collection of violent incidents based
      on penitentiary's reports (aggression, suicide, self-mutilation, intoxication, murder…) was
      conducted .

      Then statistic analysis compared psychiatric characteristics of prisoners according to
      whether they commit violence or not within 12 months after being jailed, distinguish the
      authors of self and hetero aggressive violence. Those tests are completed with a cluster
      analysis to precise psychiatric from criminological profiles of dangerousness.
