      The purpose of this study is verify the efficacy and safety of Cettum (Electrical
      moxibustion) for patients with perennial allergic rhinitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators target the patients with perennial allergic rhinitis. After treatment in 2
      groups (Cettum treatment and acupuncture treatment) the investigators will compare the
      effects of relieving symptoms and improving quality of life. So the investigators will
      confirm the efficacy of Cettum, and further the best treatment method. In addition, the
      investigators are going to evaluate the safety of abnormal reaction during the treatment.

    <measure>Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>TNSS evaluates symptoms of rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, nasal itching and sneezing on a 4-point scale. The total score range is from 0 to 12, where 0 = no symptoms, 1 = mild symptom(s), 2 = moderate symptom (s), and 3 = severe symptom(s). TNSS baseline value will be measured prior to the start of the experiment and then again during every visit.</description>

    <measure>Rhinoconjunctivits Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>RQLQ is self-report questionnaire used to assess the quality of life in patients with allergic rhinitis. The questionnaire has 7 domains; activity limitations, sleep disturbances, non-hay fever symptoms, practical problems, nasal symptoms, ocular symptoms and emotional problems. Patients will be asked to recall their experiences during the previous week and to rate each question on a ranging from 0 (no impairment) to 6 (severe impairment). RQLQ will be measured during visits 2, 6, 9, and 10.</description>

    <description>The investigator, traditional Korean medicine doctor, will evaluate the nasal endoscopy index during visits 2 and 9. The investigator will check the score following observation of the nasal membrane color, rhinorrhea, and inferior turbinate swelling of the patient via nasal endoscopy.</description>
