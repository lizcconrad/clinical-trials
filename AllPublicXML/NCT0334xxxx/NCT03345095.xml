  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The standard of care for newly diagnosed glioblastoma includes surgery, involved-field
      radiotherapy, and concomitant and six cycles of maintenance temozolomide chemotherapy,
      however the prognosis remains dismal. Marizomib has been tested in patients with newly
      diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma in phase I and phase II studies. In patients with
      recurrent glioblastoma, marizomib was administered as a single agent or in combination with
      bevacizumab (NCT02330562). Based on encouraging observations, a phase I/II trial of marizomib
      in combination with TMZ/RT --&gt;TMZ in newly diagnosed glioblastoma has been launched
      (NCT02903069) which explores safety and tolerability of this triple combination and which
      shall help to determine the dose for further clinical trials in glioblastoma. In this
      context, given that marizomib has been established as a safe addition to the standard TMZ/RT
      --&gt;TMZ, a phase III study is considered essential to establishing its impact on overall
      survival.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed newly diagnosed glioblastoma (WHO grade IV)

          -  Tumor resection (gross total or partial), or biopsy only

          -  Availability of FFPE tumor block or 24 unstained slides for MGMT analysis

          -  Patient must be eligible for standard TMZ/RT + TMZ

             surgery (if any)

          -  The patient is at least 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent
