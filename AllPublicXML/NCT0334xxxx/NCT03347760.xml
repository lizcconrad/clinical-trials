    <textblock>
      Infectious myocardities are frequent, most of the time viral and can evolve to cardiac
      insufficiency. The diagnostic is difficult because they can mime an acute coronary syndrome.
      Approximately 10 % of patients with acute infarction suspected, have a normal angiography,
      and half of them has in fact a myocarditis, as showed studies of cardiac MRI among which some
      realized in our department . However, anomalies observed in MRI are not specific and it is
      necessary to use multiples criterias. A new radiopharmaceutical, the 68Ga-DOTATOC, specific
      of somatostatine's receptors which are over expressed by the inflammatory cells, has recently
      showed the capacity to identify myocardities, but only in a small group of 6 patients.

      The investigators make assumptions:

        1. this radiopharmaceutical is enough sensitive to detect most of the acute inflammatory
           myocardities which are identified by the MRI and

        2. it could maybe allow to identify myocardities with a persistent subacute or chronic
           inflammation, which are difficult to identify with cardiac MRI, and it would be a new
           information able to guide the medical decision.

      Primary objectif: to determine if PET with 68Ga-DOTATOC is enough sensitive to identify
      myocardities in acute inflammatory phase by hospitalized patients with suspected acute
      infaction and with normal angiography and who have a high probability of myocarditis
      identified by MRI. Disease prevalence will be close to 100 % at baseline Secondary
      objectives: 1. Estimate the frequency of inflammatory forms (subacute or chronicle), with a
      68Ga-DOTATOC PET at 3 to 5 months from baseline, when classic signs of acute inflammatory
      generally disappeared (CRP, Troponine-I, myocardial oedema in MRI).

      2. Analyze the concordance of the results of 68Ga-DOTATOC TEP by two readers
