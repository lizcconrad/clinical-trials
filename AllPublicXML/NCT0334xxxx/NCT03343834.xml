      Scientific context

      Epstein-Barr virus has a causal role in the pathogenesis of multiple distinct lymphomas.
      Post-transplant lymphoproliferative diseases (PTLD) are the most frequent EBV-induced
      proliferations. PTLD after allogeneic stem cell transplantation has an incidence lower than
      5% but may increase up to 10-20% in patients with established risk factors. EBV-DNAemia is
      predictive of EBV-PTLD and is routinely performed using qPCR on whole blood. Preemptive
      therapeutic strategies with anti-CD20 antibody are used when patients are above a defined
      EBV-DNAemia threshold. This approach remains limited since it does not discriminate between
      an EBV-induced lymphoproliferation (latent cycle) and/or a replicating virus (replicative
      cycle).

      DNA methylation plays a central role in regulating the switch from latent to lytic gene
      expression. Specific DNA modifications - such as CpG methylation in specific regions of the
      viral genome - can be regarded as molecular signatures for EBV genomes associated with the
      status of the viral infection (latent vs lytic). Accordingly, these signatures may be
      envisioned as a potent tool to characterize the state of the viral infection in vivo.

      Description of the project Our primary objective is to estimate the respective percentages of
      EBV-lytic and EBV-latent genomes (proliferating cells) in patients presenting with a high
      EBV-DNAemia after allogeneic stem cell transplantation HSCT by analysing the methylation
      level of EBV genome on specific sites. Our secondary objectives are i) to determine risk
      factors associated with each &quot;latent versus lytic EBV&quot; profiles and ii) to correlate the
      &quot;latent versus lytic EBV&quot; profiles with response to rituximab infusion and patient outcomes.

      For this purpose, a retrospective study (n=80) and a prospective study (estimation n=58) will
      be established. The different steps of this project are:

        1. To study DNA methylation levels by meth-qPCR The laboratory is currently developing a
           rapid and convenient PCR-based assay to quantify hypo/hyper-methylated genome to
           distinguish between latent and lytic genomes. This approach relies on the existence of
           restriction enzymes that are blocked (or not) depending on the methylation of their
           recognition site on specific positions. This study intends to identify several regions
           whose methylation level would characterize the status of the virus ( latent / lytic
           phase).

        2. To realize quantitative analysis by RT-PCR of different EBV transcripts specific of the
           latent or of the lytic phase of the virus This method will be applied on RNA extracted
           from patient blood samples with elevated EBV viral load, under condition preserving RNA
           integrity (trizol frozen blood). The results will be validated on a prospective cohort
           of HSCT patients (n=58) (Saint-Antoine Hospital and La Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital).

        3. To perform quantitative analysis of EBV genomes in plasma, saliva and total blood
           samples by current routine procedures In addition to total blood samples, plasma and
           saliva will be collected since free viral particles are known to accumulate in these
           biological fluids upon EBV reactivation. These samples will be treated by normalized
           procedures that are routinely used in the medical virology laboratory to quantify EBV in
           human samples.

      Expected results By establishing a simple method for studying the methylation of EBV genomes,
      we expect to understand the significance of high EBV viral load and the pathophysiology of
      post-HSCT PTLD. We aim to distinguish between the latent / lytic profiles of HSCT patients
      and to correlate their respective risks for developing PTLD. Establishing the methylation EBV
      profile in the post-HSCT setting when facing increase viral load and PTLD will improve our
      understanding of the biological mechanisms determining EBV-status in post-HSCT. This should
      improve major medical and economical issues. These results could have a major therapeutic

      Study duration :

      Total study duration: 37 months Duration of recruitment: 24 months Duration of participation
      for each patient: 13 months

      Inclusion criteria:

      Retrospective study: Patient who underwent HSCT, in Saint-Antoine hospital, between
      2010-2015, treated by rituximab for high level EBV-DNAemia (above 3.3 log copies/mL).

      Prospective study: Patients who underwent HSCT, in Saint-Antoine hospital and la
      Pitié-Salpêtrière, in 2016-2017, treated by rituximab for high level EBV-DNAemia (above 10
      000c/mL), And/or having post-transplant lymphoproliferative diseases(PTLD) Concerned
      population Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) patients with a
      high Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) viral load

      Study endpoints:

      Primary endpoint (linked to the primary objective) Respective percentages of latent versus
      replicative EBV profiles, defined by the methylation level of specific sites of EBV genome,
      in a cohort of HSCT patients with a high EBV viral load (above 3.3 log copies/ml) before the
      initiation of treatment per rituximab. A methylation index will be calculated from the
      respective differences of the &quot;Cycle thresholds&quot; of the methyl-qPCR performed on patients
      blood samples Secondary endpoints (linked to the secondary objectives)

        1. Characteristics of the patients according to the EBV q-PCR results

        2. Patients' outcome according to the EBV profile defined by the methyl-qPCR :

             -  Response to Rituximab infusion (EBV DNA-emia &lt; 3.3 log copies/mL) after a maximum
                of 4 infusions)

             -  Disease-free survival (DFS) at 12 months defined as survival without relapse

             -  Overall survival (OS) at 12 months

             -  Relapse incidence (RI) at 12 months

             -  Non-relapse mortality (NRM) at 12 months

             -  Number of post-HSCT infections within 12 months

      Statistical Analysis :

        1. Comparison between characteristics of latent and lytic genomes will be performed using
           parametric (Student t-test) or non-parametric (Mann Whitney test) when appropriate for
           continuous variables, Chi-Square test for qualitative variables.

           Multivariate analysis for determination of risk factors associated with &quot;lytic EBV&quot;
           profiles will be performed using logistic regression.

        2. Correlation between &quot;latent versus lytic EBV&quot; profiles&quot; and response to rituximab
           infusion will be performed using logistic regression including in the model all other
           factors potentially associated to the response to rituximab. OS and DFS will be
           estimated by using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cumulative incidences of RI and NRM will be
           calculated from the date of inclusion to the date of relapse or death in remission,
           respectively, with the other event being the competing risk. Death or progression will
           be considered as a competing events for estimating the incidence of acute GVHD.
           Multivariate analyses for survival endpoints will be performed using the Cox
           proportional hazards model. The type I error rate is fixed at 0.05 for determination of
           factors associated with time to event outcomes. All statistical analyses will be
           performed with R software packages (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna,
           Austria)
