  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with recurrent calcium oxalate stones undergoing endourological procedures for renal
      stones at our institution from June 2013 to June 2014 were considered eligible for enrolment.
      Enrolled patients underwent a baseline unenhanced CT scan before the urological procedure;
      after endoscopic removal of their stones, the patients were instructed to drink at least 2
      L/day of a hypotonic, oligomineral water low in sodium and minerals (fixed residue at 180°C
      &lt;200 mg/L) for at least 12 months. Finally, the patients underwent a follow-up unenhanced CT
      scan during hydration regimen.
