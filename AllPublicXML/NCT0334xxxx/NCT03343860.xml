  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the treatment of symptomatic drug resistant persistent atrial fibrillation (Ps AF),
      catheter ablation has a class IIA indication. During the follow-up, a significant amount of
      patients (~50%) will experience atrial tachycardias (AT) recurrence. The endpoint of AT
      ablation during the second procedure has not been validated. At present, several strategies
      are considered as good clinical practice.

      Main objective: To evaluate if ablation of all inducible AT post AF ablation (ATPAFA) offers
      as substantial benefit in comparison with ablation of the clinical ATPAF only during a redo
      procedure post initial persistent AF ablation.

      Secondary objectives:

      To evaluate the prognosis of non-inducibility during a redo procedure for ATPAFA
