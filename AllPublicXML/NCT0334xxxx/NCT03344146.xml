  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary objective of the MAAESTRO trial is to evaluate the impact of an educational and
      reminder-based intervention on the adherence of stroke patients to DOACs. Secondary
      objectives are to evaluate the association between non-adherence and clinical events, to
      identify predictors of non-adherence and to compare objective measures of adherence with
      self-reporting.

      Key methodological instrument for this study will be the &quot;Time4Med&quot; pillbox with Smart/
      Reminder Card. The study includes 3 visits (baseline visit 0, follow-up visit 1 and
      end-of-study visit 2) with a total follow-up of 12 months.

      After an initial 6-month observational phase with electronic monitoring of adherence using
      the &quot;Smart Card&quot;, all patients will receive counselling based on their electronically
      recorded drug intake data, as well as a multicompartment pillbox. Patients will be then
      randomised to one of two groups in a crossover design, so that in the subsequent 6-month
      interventional phase one group will use a (reminder-delivering) &quot;Reminder Card&quot; for the first
      3 months and the &quot;Smart Card&quot; for the last 3 months, while the second group will use the
      cards in reverse order.
