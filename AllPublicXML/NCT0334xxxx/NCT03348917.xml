  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study determines the effects of a single application of different antiseptic skin
      cleansers on the composition of the skin surface microbiome using next-generation sequencing
      (NGS) techniques. Twelve healthy volunteers will receive all three test products in a
      randomized order to compare the effects of each skin cleanser.

    <textblock>
      Disinfectants and oral antiseptics including PVP-I are known to kill microorganisms to a
      variable extent, at a variable range of time points. Microorganisms may be protected from
      disinfectants by production of thick masses of cells and extracellular materials, or
      biofilms. Moreover, antiseptics should not lead to dysbiosis after use. Dysbiosis is a
      negative change in the microbiome of a particular skin or mucosal region. The Human
      Microbiome project showed, that every area has a specific microbiota in which the human host
      lives with an abundance of commensal, synergistic, and potentially pathogenic microorganisms.
      Antiseptics with efficacy gaps and resistance may induce such dysbiosis, especially after
      prolonged use. It is envisaged that twelve healthy volunteers will complete the study. Each
      healthy volunteer will apply the test product according to a developed protocol, between
      established wash out periods.

      The ability of the test product (Commercially available - Betadine® 7.5% skin cleanser (PVP-I
      7.5%)) compared to the reference products (commercially available 4% chlorhexidine skin
      cleanser - Unity antiseptic hand wash (no alcohol) and Plain non antibacterial soap -
      Guardian gel hand wash (not medicated)) to reduce resident and transient microflora will be
      assessed. The hand wash products will also be assessed for their ability to maintain and/or
      restore balanced microflora.
