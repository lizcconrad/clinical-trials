  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage of granulosa cells obtained during oocyte retrieval will
      be evaluated by comet assay in unexplained infertile patients undergoing in vitro
      fertilization (IVF) treatment. The oocytes will be graded by particular criteria.
      Fertilization, embryo quality, transfer rate, implantation, clinical pregnancy, pregnancy
      outcomes (gestational age at delivery, route of delivery, and birthweight etc.) will be
      recorded as well as demographic data. DNA damage of granulosa cells will be compared between
      unexplained infertile and control groups. The effect of DNA damage of granulosa cells on
      fertilization, quality of oocyte and embryo, implantation, and clinical pregnancy will be
      also evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Granulosa cells surrounding the oocytes will be mechanically obtained during the oocyte
      pick-up procedure in women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment due to
      unexplained infertility. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage in these cells will be evaluated
      by comet assay. The quality of oocytes retrieved during the oocyte pick-up procedure will be
      graded by particular criteria (zona pellucida thickness, granulation, vacuolization, etc).
      Fertilization rates, embryo quality by grading, and transfer rates will also be assessed.
      Implantation and clinical pregnancy rates, and pregnancy outcomes including gestational age
      at delivery, route of delivery, and birthweight will be recorded as well as demographic data
      such as age, body-mass index, smoking, alcohol use, employment, coexisting chronic disease,
      infertility duration, etiology of infertility, treatment protocol, and hormone levels on day
      3. Implantation will be evaluated by determination of serum human chorionic gonadotropin
      (hCG) at day 12 following an embryo transfer. Clinical pregnancy will be diagnosed upon
      presence of gestational sac on ultrasound examination. DNA damage of granulosa cells will be
      compared between unexplained infertile group and control group. The effect of DNA damage of
      granulosa cells on fertilization, quality of oocyte and embryo, implantation, and clinical
      pregnancy will be also evaluated.

    <description>Patients diagnosed as unexplained infertility (UI) were recruited to the study. UI was diagnosed after normal standard infertility evaluation according to the guideline of The Practice Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine which consist of the assesment of spermiogram, ovulation, hysterosalpingogram and if indicated ovarian reserve tests and laparoscopy. If the results of all this tests were normal, patients were accepted as UI.</description>

    <description>The control group received in vitro fertilization (IVF) for tubal factor and included only those women who had salpingectomy for ectopic pregnancy or proximal tubal obstruction because of low-grade infection or fimbrial occlusion with or without mild peritubal adhesions. Tubal infertility associated with hydrosalpinx, severe pelvic adhesions, endometriosis or pelvic inflammatory disease were excluded. Patients with male factor except oligoasthenospermia were also recruited for the study.</description>
