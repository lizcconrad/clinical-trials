  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of
      nivolumab plus epacadostat in combination with platinum chemotherapy compared with platinum
      chemotherapy alone, in participants with treatment-naïve Stage 4 or recurrent non-small cell
      lung cancer (NSCLC).
