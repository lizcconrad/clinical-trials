      DESIGN: Non-inferiority Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT). Patients undergoing free flap
      reconstructive surgery at UCDMC will be assigned randomly into no intervention group
      (immediate post operative care in an Intensive Care Unit) or intervention group (immediate
      post operative care in a non-ICU specialty ward).

      HYPOTHESIS: There is no significant difference in the length of stay (LOS) or complication
      rate between head and neck free flaps patients managed immediately post-operatively in an
      Intensive Care Unit (ICU) versus a non-ICU specialty ward.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary Objective: To compare the postoperative LOS between head and neck free-flap patients
      managed initially in an ICU versus a non-ICU specialty ward.

      Secondary Objective: To compare differences in the rate of complications between head and
      neck free flap patients managed initially in an ICU versus a non-ICU specialty ward.

      Tertiary Objective: To compare differences in resource utilization between head and neck
      free-flap patients managed initially in an ICU versus a non-ICU specialty ward.

      Free flaps are an instrumental component of head and neck reconstructive surgery. There is no
      current consensus on the postoperative management of these patients despite the increasing
      frequency with which free flaps are used. Although patients often do not have a specific
      medical indication for postoperative ICU management, they frequently are sent to the ICU for
      postoperative care based on the need for close nurse monitoring of the flap [Bhama, 2013
      #1325;Giannini, 2006 #1330]. In a US based survey in 2007, 88.9% of head and neck surgeons
      were sending postoperative flap patients to the ICU[Spiegel, 2007 #1333]. Typical ICU length
      of stay for these patients varies from 2-11 days [Arshad, 2014 #1324]. There are numerous
      theoretic disadvantages to ICU care in these patients. ICU care has been associated with
      increased use of sedation leading to decreased flap perfusion, prolonged use of ventilation,
      less self care, less ambulation, increased delirium and increased cost [Arshad, 2014 #1324].

      Due to these concerns, several institutions have developed protocols that allow for the
      monitoring of head and neck free-flap patients outside of the ICU. Two recent retrospective
      studies assessed outcomes using these protocols. Arshad et al included 257 patients (119 ICU,
      138 ward) and showed no significant difference in morbidity and mortality, or flap failure
      between the groups. There was a significant increase LOS from 8 to 9 days and transfusion
      rate, in the ICU group[Arshad, 2014 #1324]. Panwar et al looked at 247 patients (175 ICU, 72
      ward) and found no difference between flap failure, reoperation, hematoma, wound
      complications between the groups. They also found an increased LOS from 7 to 8 days in the
      ICU group. They calculated cost difference and found a decrease in average patient cost from
      $101,199 to $86,195 in the ward group[Panwar, 2015 #1323]. These studies support the use of
      non-ICU care for head and neck free-flap patients, however given their retrospective nature
      significant biases may exist, tempering the strength of their conclusions. To date, there has
      never been a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) that addresses this question.

      This is a non-inferiority RCT at UC Davis Medical Center (UCDMC) to assess differences in
      LOS, complication rate and resource utilization between patients randomized to the ICU and a
      head and neck specialty ward. Since ICU/Ward bed availability has to be determined before
      surgery, a subject will be randomized before surgery when the subject meets all inclusion and
      none of the exclusion criteria. Currently, postoperative flap patients who are not enrolled
      in the study at UCDMC are monitored in the ICU for a minimum of 24 hours following their
      surgery.
