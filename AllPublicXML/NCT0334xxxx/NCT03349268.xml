      The objective is to conduct a prospective, sham controlled, double-blinded, interventional
      crossover trial to compare standard terminal cleaning plus PX-UV (intervention) with standard
      terminal cleaning plus sham PX-UV (control) with crossover at 12 months, following a 6-month
      washout period. Outcome measures include the rates of HAIs, as well as the recurrence of
      genetically identical clinical strains of HAIs among patients on study units. The study will
      be conducted in 2 hospitals covering 16 total hospital units at Detroit Medical Center. Our
      central hypothesis is that the addition of PX-UV to standard terminal cleaning will be
      associated with a significant reduction in the rate of HAIs, as well as a reduction in the
      recovery of genetically identical strains of MDROs. The impact of PX-UV disinfection on rates
      of HAIs on study units will be determined by comparing rates of HAIs on a) study units where
      PX-UV is added to standard terminal cleaning practices to b) units where a sham UV
      disinfection system is added to standard terminal cleaning; and by comparing rates of HAIs on
      the same medical ward during each of two 12-month phases of a crossover study (one phase when
      a PX-UV device is added and one when a sham device is added to standard terminal cleaning).

      The long-term goal of this project is to establish the efficacy of terminal cleaning plus
      PX-UV in reducing rates of HAIs due to the following multi-drug resistant organisms (MDROs):
      C. difficile, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia
      coli producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), methicillin-resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Acinetobacter baumannii.

      At the conclusion of the proposed project, novel data will be generated from this rigorously
      controlled study regarding the effectiveness of PX-UV in reducing HAIs in a representative,
      real-world healthcare setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2011, 721,800 healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) were reported in the United States.
      The hospital environment has been increasingly recognized as an important determinant of HAI
      acquisition and prevention of HAIs has become a top priority for the U.S. Department of
      Health and Human Services (HHS). Terminal cleaning of a patient room is recognized as a
      critically important process to help prevent HAIs and involves extensive cleaning and
      disinfection of the room after a patient has been discharged from the room and before the
      subsequent patient has been admitted to the room. Pulsed xenon ultraviolet light (PX-UV) has
      been shown to be effective in killing a variety of pathogens including endospores of
      Clostridium difficile. PX-UV works quickly - the entire cycle time for use in a hospital room
      is 15 minutes. To date, the clinical impact of adding PX-UV to terminal cleaning has not been
      demonstrated in clinical trials with sham controls or in a crossover design. The long-term
      goal of this project is to establish the efficacy of terminal cleaning plus PX-UV in reducing
      rates of HAIs due to the following multi-drug resistant organisms (MDROs): C. difficile,
      vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli producing
      extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)
      and Acinetobacter baumannii. The objective of this application is to conduct a prospective,
      sham controlled, double-blinded, interventional crossover trial to compare standard terminal
      cleaning plus PX-UV (intervention) with standard terminal cleaning plus sham PX-UV (control)
      with crossover at 12 months, following a 6-month washout period. Outcome measures include the
      rates of HAIs, as well as the recurrence of genetically identical clinical strains of HAIs
      among patients on study units. The study will be conducted in 2 hospitals covering 16 total
      hospital units at Detroit Medical Center. Our central hypothesis is that the addition of
      PX-UV to standard terminal cleaning will be associated with a significant reduction in the
      rate of HAIs, as well as a reduction in the recovery of genetically identical strains of
      MDROs. The impact of PX-UV disinfection on rates of HAIs on study units will be determined by
      comparing rates of HAIs on a) study units where PX-UV is added to standard terminal cleaning
      practices to b) units where a sham UV disinfection system is added to standard terminal
      cleaning; and by comparing rates of HAIs on the same medical ward during each of two 12-month
      phases of a crossover study (one phase when a PX-UV device is added and one when a sham
      device is added to standard terminal cleaning). At the conclusion of the proposed project,
      novel data will be generated from this rigorously controlled study regarding the
      effectiveness of PX-UV in reducing HAIs in a representative, real-world healthcare setting.

    <description>Two Detroit Medical Center (DMC) acute-care hospitals are being proposed for this project, Sinai-Grace Hospital (SGH) and Detroit Receiving Hospital (DRH). SGH is a 383-bed hospital, and DRH is a 248-bed hospital. The study will be conducted in eight hospital units in SGH and eight hospital units in DRH, including two medical intensive care units (ICUs), two surgical ICUs and 12 non-ICU medical-surgical wards. The 16 study units include a total of 379 beds.
Devices will be deployed on these study units with the sham and intervention devices split evenly between SGH and DRH. Within each study site, the types of devices (PX-UV vs sham) will be assigned randomly to the units in Phase 1 and then switched in Phase 2.</description>
