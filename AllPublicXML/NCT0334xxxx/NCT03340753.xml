  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, partial crossover, single-dose study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics
      (PK), dose proportionality, and safety/tolerability of tablet versus capsule formulations of
      KBP-5074 in healthy subjects. The study is designed to evaluate the PK of a new tablet
      formulation versus that of the current capsule formulation. Data derived from this study, in
      addition to preclinical data and chemistry, manufacturing, and controls, will provide a basis
      for dose selection in future studies.

    <textblock>
      Twenty healthy subjects will be allocated 4:1 to either the crossover study groups (16
      subjects) or to the 0.25 mg tablet single dose treatment (4 subjects). Subjects allocated to
      the crossover study groups will be randomized 1:1 to 0.5 mg tablet/capsule (8 subjects) or
      1.0 mg tablet/capsule (8 subjects).

      Within the crossover study groups, subjects will be further randomized to receive a single
      dose of KBP-5074 (0.5 mg or 1.0 mg) in either capsule or tablet formulation in a 2-period
      crossover design with a 2-week washout period. The study duration for subjects in the
      crossover study groups will be approximately 7 weeks, which includes a 3-week screening
      period, and the 2 crossover single dose periods, which will be followed by a 2-week
      washout/follow-up period, respectively.

      Subjects allocated to the 0.25 mg dose cohort (n=4) will receive a single dose of 0.25 mg in
      tablet formulation only. The 0.25 mg tablet cohort will provide additional data for the
      evaluation of dose exposure for the tablet formulation. The study duration for the single
      dose arm will be 5 weeks, which includes a 3-week screening period, and the single dose which
      will be followed by a 2 week washout period.

             Adequate methods of contraception are defined as those that result in a low failure
             rate (&lt;1% per year) when used consistently and correctly. Such methods include the use
             of oral contraceptives, other hormonal contraceptives (vaginal products, skin patches,
             or implanted or injectable products), or mechanical products (such as an intrauterine
             diaphragm, condoms, or spermicides);

          -  Women of childbearing potential are defined as women who are not surgically or

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of any illness, that, in the opinion of the Investigator, could confound the
             results of the study or pose an additional risk to the subject by their participation
             in the study ;

          -  History or presence of significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, renal,
