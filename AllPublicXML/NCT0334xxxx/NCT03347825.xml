  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to compare perioperative outcomes for robotic-assisted
      lobectomy with those associated with VATS and open lobectomy for lung cancer
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, retrospective chart review study of all consecutive lobectomies
      performed for clinical stage IA, IB, IIA, IIB and IIIA lung cancer, performed by
      participating surgeons at their respective institutions that meet all inclusion and exclusion
      criteria. All cases of lobectomy performed for clinical stages, IA, IB, IIA, IIB and IIIA
      lung cancer via robotic-assisted, VATS (video assisted thoracic surgery) and open approach
      that meet the study inclusion and exclusion criteria will be considered for inclusion in the
      study. The chart review and data collection will be performed in a reverse chronological
      order starting at 30 days prior to IRB approval of the study at the institution and going
      back to 2013 (i.e most current data in 2017 and chronologically going back through 2013). The
      retrospective chart review and data collection is anticipated to occur in two phases:

      Phase-I: Phase I will include chart review and data collection of clinical stage IB, IIA,
      IIB, IIIA cases from approximately 30-days prior to IRB approval of the study in 2017 or
      early 2018 and will continue retrospectively thru January 1, 2013 at each institution.

      Phase-II: This phase will be initiated after completion of phase-I at each institution and
      will include chart review and data collection of clinical stage IA cases from approximately
      30-days prior to IRB approval of the study in 2017 or early 2018 and will continue
      retrospectively thru January 1, 2013 at each institution.

      Depending on availability of research coordinator resource (s) at each institution, the
      institution can choose to complete the data collection of both the phases either
      simultaneously or sequentially.

      Baseline patient characteristics, perioperative and post-operative short term clinical and
      pathological outcomes data will be obtained from hospital records. Each participating
      institution will contribute approximately 100-800 cases from one or more surgeons. Since the
      data will have been de-identified, and is archival in nature, there will be no active subject
      recruitment and no patient consenting is required
