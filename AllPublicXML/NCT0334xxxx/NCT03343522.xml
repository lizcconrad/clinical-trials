  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: It is well known that the infection caused by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus
      (HIV) is associated to a higher cardiovascular event risk. On the other hand, it is clear
      that the aerobic exercise training induces improvements in autonomic control and vascular
      function, through increases in vasodilator agents and blood vessels number. However, the
      investigators could not find previous works that studied the microvascular function in
      response to exercise training in HIV patients.

      Objectives: To study the impact of aerobic exercise training in endothelial function of HIV
      patients. In addition, the investigators will verify the association of the physical fitness
      to the nitric oxide bioavailability, angiogenesis and lipid profile in HIV patients.

      Methods: The study subjects will be composed by HIV patients, that will be randomly divided
      in two different groups: exercised and sedentary. The subjects will be tested before and
      after training in regards to endothelial function, nitric oxide bioavailability, physical
      fitness and lipid profile, through flowmetry, colorimetric essays, maximal cardiopulmonary
      exercise test, and biochemical tests; respectively. The exercise training will be performed
      in a treadmill for 12 weeks, 3 times a week, 40 minutes each section.

      Expected Results: The investigators expect to achieve markers that will help in understanding
      the interaction of HIV with several factors that contribute to an increased endothelial
      function after exercise training.

    <textblock>
      HIV-infection triggers a massive oxygen reactive species production, increasing oxidative
      stress and vascular complications. Despite the importance of therapeutic strategies in
      reducing the cardiovascular risk among HIV-infected patients (HIVP), exercise-related effects
      upon macro-and-microvascular endothelial function and oxidative stress in HIVP have not been
      previously reported.
