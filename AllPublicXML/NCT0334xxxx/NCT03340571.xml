  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, no cures or disease modifying therapies exist for Alzheimer's disease (AD). This
      is partially due to the inability to detect the disease before it has progressed to a stage
      where there are clinical manifestations. The identification and validation of high throughput
      biomarkers to measure disease progression (as well as identify pre-clinical disease onset) is
      critical to the development of disease-modifying or even preventative therapies. In this
      study, we are testing a blood biomarker for stratification of Alzheimer's disease patients
      and healthy volunteers. This study may lead to future blood tests that may help earlier
      diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and detect the disease progression.

        The research coordinator(s) will review the clinic schedule in the Memory Disorders clinic
        at Duke University for potential patients who meet the basic inclusion/exclusion criteria
        who have appointments that day.

        While consenting AD potential subjects, the study team may also ask their caregivers who
        accompany the AD patient to the clinic if they would also like to be part of the study and
        possibly enroll as a Healthy Control subject.
