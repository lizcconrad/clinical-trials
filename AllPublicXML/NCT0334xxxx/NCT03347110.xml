    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of Serious Adverse Event (SAE) during the study</measure>
    <time_frame>From Entry Visit (Visit 1) until Safety Follow-Up Visit (up to Week 120)</time_frame>
    <description>Once it is determined that a subject experienced an Adverse Event (AE), the seriousness of the AE must be determined. An SAE must meet 1 or more of the following criteria: death, life-threatening, significant or persistent disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect, important medical event, initial inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization.) product.</description>

             systemic antibiotics within 2 weeks of study entry

          -  Subjects who meet any withdrawal criteria in PA0008. For any subject with an ongoing
             Serious Adverse Event, or a history of serious infections (including hospitalizations)
             in the lead-in study, the Medical Monitor must be consulted prior to the subject's
             entry into PA0009
