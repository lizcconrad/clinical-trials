  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to evaluate if addition of the steroid to the spacer / stent will
      improve healing after endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) compared to spacer without drug.

  <detailed_description>

      The study is designed to evaluate basic device usability and confirm safety and effectiveness
      of the Restora Steroid Eluting spacer compared to a Silastic spacer.

      At the completion of their procedure, patients undergoing ESS will receive one steroid
      eluting spacer placed into the surgical site on one side, and one spacer without drug placed
      on the other side. Patients will return for standard post-op visits. Between post-op day 6
      and 8, both spacers will be removed. Patients will again be seen on post-op day 35 and 90 to
      evaluate the surgical sites with respect to healing, scarring, infection, degree of
      inflammation, polyp formation, and the need for secondary intervention. Data from the two
      sides will be compared to determine if there is a benefit derived from the spacer with
      steroid vs the one without.

    <masking_description>At the end of surgery, the Surgery Fellow will insert either the Drug Eluting Spacer or the Silastic spacer into each side of the subject's nose. The subject will receive one of each spacer. The fellow will record which spacer was placed on which side using a special coding system to keep this information private. This maintains the blinding for the primary surgeon/outcome assessor and subject.</masking_description>
