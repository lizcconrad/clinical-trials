  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      If the investigators are to adequately address the health needs of African American and
      Latino men, both culture and gender must be considered when developing and implementing
      strategies to increase their healthy eating and physical activity and decrease tobacco
      use.The aim of this project is to develop and test gendered, culturally and contextually
      relevant messages that will be used in a future, web- based tailored intervention to
      encourage tobacco cessation and increase healthy eating and physical activity in African
      American men. This study is part of a larger research agenda that for a decade has focused on
      understanding and reducing chronic disease risk among African American and Latino men.
      Because men are more likely than women to engage in over 30 behaviors known to increase their
      risk of injury, morbidity, and mortality, improving men's health requires understanding the
      social and cultural factors that help explain sex differences in health. Operationalizing
      gender in individually-tailored health communications has great potential to unlock the
      potential of health communications and interventions to engage and improve the health of men
      and particularly African American and Latino men. To date, no community-based intervention
      has produced clinically significant improvements in weight loss, healthy eating or physical
      activity in Latino and African American men. It also is unclear how technology can be used to
      promote these behaviors in this population. Thus, there is a need to develop healthy eating,
      physical activity and weight loss interventions specifically targeted and tailored to African
      American and Latino men that explores the utility of technology. This intervention content
      and focus represents a novel strategy to promote health equity by using technology-based
      health care innovations to improve healthy eating and active living by addressing a root
      cause of unhealthy behavior in men: notions of manhood. The investigators focus on gender and
      manhood because they are under-explored factors that shape men's health behaviors.

      The overall aim of this study is to develop and pilot an individualized weight-loss
      intervention for obese middle-aged African American and Latino men and to explore how the
      genetically predicted BMI relates to outcomes. Using strategies previously employed by the PI
      to develop individually-tailored materials for African American men, the proposed study is
      designed to develop person-specific materials for Latino men (Specific Aim 1). Investigators
      also will pilot a behavioral weight loss intervention for 40-59 year old African American men
      in Nashville and Latino men in Miami (Specific Aims 2-3), and explore how the phenotypic
      expression of obesity shapes and is affected by behavioral and physiological changes
      (Specific Aim 4). The proposed intervention includes (a) person-specific goals/ messages (via
      web and text), (b) self-monitoring (via wearable device and text), (c) small group training
      and education (including social support) and (d) educational and community-based information
      and resources (via web and text).

    <description>Intervention Arm: In the pilot intervention, participants will receive: tailored goals/ messages, self-monitoring, small groups (led by a personal trainer) and educational and community-based information and resources. These intervention components were selected based on investigator's formative research and experience using them in prior studies. These components will be implemented simultaneously as they complement one another. While all of these components have not been tested together in an intervention for this population, they are variations and enhancements of previous interventions by the investigators.</description>

    <description>Control Condition: Participants in the attention control group will receive self-help materials on how to improve healthy eating, physical activity and weight loss from the NIDDK Weight-control Information Network and the three assessments with blood work and anthropometric measures. Participants in this condition will receive a copy of their assessment data and the nurses will provide this personalized information as well as answer any questions participants may have about their assessment results. At baseline, participants will receive the &quot;Better Health and You Tips for Adults&quot; brochure and at the 3-month assessment attention control group participants will receive the &quot;Active at Any Size&quot; and the &quot;Tips to Help You Get Active&quot; brochures.</description>
