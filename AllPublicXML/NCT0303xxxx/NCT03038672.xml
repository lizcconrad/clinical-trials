  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well nivolumab with or without varlilumab works in
      treating patients with aggressive B-cell lymphomas that have come back or do not respond to
      treatment. Monoclonal antibodies, such as varlilumab and nivolumab, may work by stimulating
      the immune system to attack cancer tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the anti-tumor activity of combination therapy with CDX-1127 (varlilumab) and
      nivolumab as compared to nivolumab alone in patients with advanced aggressive B-cell
      non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) based on the lymphoma response to immunomodulatory therapy
      criteria or LYRIC.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety and tolerability profile of treatment with a combination of CDX-1127
      (varlilumab) and nivolumab in patients with advanced aggressive B-cell NHL.

      II. To evaluate the duration of response, progression-free survival and overall survival.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effect of combination therapy with CDX-1127 (varlilumab) and nivolumab on
      the immune system as assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC), mass cytometry (CyTOF), changes
      in serum cytokine profile and immunogenicity assays.

      II. To describe the pharmacokinetic profile of CDX-1127 (varlilumab) and nivolumab when used
      in combination.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes every 2 weeks for 4
      months and every 4 weeks for a total of up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may cross over to Group II at the time of disease
      progression.

      GROUP II: Patients receive varlilumab IV over 90 minutes every 4 weeks for up to 2 years in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive nivolumab
      IV over 60 minutes every 2 weeks for 4 months and every 4 weeks for a total of up to 2 years
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 100 days.

    <measure>Overall response rate assessed by computed tomography (CT)-based criteria or positron emission tomography (PET)-CT based criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>A response will be defined as an objective status of partial remission (PR) or complete remission (CR) for patients evaluated by CT-based criteria and complete metabolic response (CMR) or partial metabolic response (PMR) for patients evaluated by PET-CT based criteria. Exact binomial ninety-five percent confidence intervals for the true success proportion will be calculated in each arm. Comparison of overall response rates between the two treatment groups will be performed using a one-sided Fisher's exact test at significance level 0.15.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of response</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as the date at which the patient's objective status is first noted to be a PR or CR for patients evaluated by CT-based criteria or CMR or PMR for patients evaluated by PET-CT based criteria to the earliest date progression (documentation of disease progression [PMD] or progressive disease [PD]) is documented. The distribution of duration of response will be estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier. The comparison of duration of response between two treatment arms will be based on the log-rank test.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression free survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization to the earliest date of documentation of disease progression (PMD or PD) or death due to any cause, assessed for up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The distribution of PFS will be estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier. The comparison of progression-free survival between two treatment arms will be based on the log-rank test.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 100 days after last dose of study drug</time_frame>
    <description>The overall adverse event rates for grade 3 or higher hematologic and non-hematologic adverse events at least possibly related to treatment will be compared between the two treatment groups using the Chi-square test (or Fisher's exact test if the data in the contingency table is sparse).</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in CD27 expression in tissue assessed by immunohistochemistry</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 100 days after last dose of study drug</time_frame>
    <description>Will be both graphically and quantitatively summarized and explored. Standard paired comparisons methodologies (Wilcoxon signed rank and McNemar's tests) will be used to assess changes in these variables before and after therapy. In addition, baseline values and changes over time in each measure will be explored in relation to clinical outcome. Differences between responders and non-responders will be assessed using Wilcoxon's rank sum (continuous data) or Fisher's exact (categorical data) test. The relationship between each measure and time to event measures (PFS, overall survival [OS]) will be evaluated using Cox's proportional hazards models and log-rank tests. Logistic regression will be used to model the response rate as a function of treatment and CD27 (as a continuous variable). The distribution of CD27 will be estimated empirically in the entire trial population and used to calculate CD27 values corresponding to each fixed percentile.</description>

                       have minimal hepatic injury are eligible

          -  Patients with active autoimmune disease or history of autoimmune disease that might
             recur, which may affect vital organ function or require immune suppressive treatment
             including systemic corticosteroids, should be excluded; these include but are not
             limited to patients with a history of immune related neurologic disease, multiple
             sclerosis, autoimmune (demyelinating) neuropathy, Guillain-Barre syndrome, myasthenia

             topical medication and patients with positive serology, such as antinuclear antibodies
             (ANA), anti-thyroid antibodies should be evaluated for the presence of target organ
             involvement and potential need for systemic treatment but should otherwise be eligible

          -  Patients are permitted to enroll if they have vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus,
             residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone

          -  Patients should be excluded if they have a condition requiring systemic treatment with
             either corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other
             immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug administration; inhaled or
             topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses =&lt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents
             are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease; patients are permitted to
             use topical, ocular, intra-articular, intranasal, and inhalational corticosteroids
             (with minimal systemic absorption); physiologic replacement doses of systemic
             corticosteroids are permitted, even if =&lt; 10 mg/day prednisone equivalents; a brief
             course of corticosteroids for prophylaxis (e.g., contrast dye allergy) or for
             treatment of non-autoimmune conditions (e.g., delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction
             caused by contact allergen) is permitted

          -  Patients who have had evidence of active or acute diverticulitis, intra-abdominal
             abscess, gastrointestinal (GI) obstruction and abdominal carcinomatosis which are
             known risk factors for bowel perforation should be evaluated for the potential need
             for additional treatment before coming on study

          -  Patients with other active malignancy =&lt; 3 years prior to registration for which
             active treatment is required must be excluded; patients with composite lymphomas that
