  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dyspnea is a common complaint in obese patients. The mechanisms behind this dyspnea and the
      effects of weight loss on dyspnea are not completely understood. The objectives of this study
      were to examine the relationships between exercise parameters and dyspnea in obesity and
      assess the effects of weight loss.

      The investigators compared pulmonary function, exercise performance and dyspnea in 34
      patients with abdominal obesity and metabolic syndrome (MS) against 34 age and sex-matched
      controls. The study also assessed within-group changes in physiology and symptoms in a subset
      of patients following participation in a weight management program.

      Because obesity is a heterogeneous condition, with variable genetic associations,
      co-morbidities and distributions of adipose tissue, the study focused on patients with
      abdominal obesity who met diagnostic criteria for metabolic syndrome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study has two parts: first, the investigators compared dyspnea, pulmonary function and
      exercise measurements between obese patients and control subjects with normal weight; then,
      the investigators assessed the effects of medical weight loss in the obese group on these
      parameters. Baseline dyspnea was assessed using the baseline dyspnea index.The effect of
      weight loss on dyspnea was assessed using the transitional dyspnea index. The main
      physiologic measurement of interest was the inspiratory capacity (L, measured at rest and
      during exercise).

    <intervention_name>Weight Management Program</intervention_name>
    <description>Obese subjects partake in a medically supervised weight management program. This lifestyle modification program involves weekly three hour sessions for six months and monthly sessions for six months. The first twelve weeks comprise an initial weight loss phase when patients are placed on a 900 Kcal/day meal replacement. This is followed by a four week transition to a 1200-1800 Kcal diet followed by a ten week maintenance phase of 10 weekly sessions.The majority of weight loss occurs during the first 26 weeks followed by a 26 week period of stabilization of weight loss. Hence subjects are evaluated after the first 26 weeks.</description>
