      The aim of this study is to compare pain during maxillary infiltration local anesthesia
      injection with the aid of DentalVibe comfort system in comparison to maxillary infiltration
      injection alone.

      Intervention:

      History taking from the child and the parent including personal, medical and dental history
      as in the examination sheet (Appendix A) to assess inclusion criteria.

      Clinical procedure:

      Intervention group:

      Clinical examination using mirror and probe to assess inclusion criteria. Before initiating
      the treatment, the site of the injection will be dried then prepped with antiseptic solution
      swab, then a topical anaesthetic agent (topical anesthetics 20% benzocaine) will be applied
      with a cotton tip applicator for 60 sec.

      Demonstration will be performed by putting the device into direct contact with the children's
      nails before applying the device intraorally.

      The cheek will be retracted and the device will be turned on.

      1mL of local anesthetic solution (articaine hypochloride 4% with 1:100.000 epinephrine,
      Septodont) will be injected using a 27 gauge needle which will be delivered over 1 min.

      Control group:

      AS that of the intervention group except, the device will be used only as a cheek retractor
      during the injection, but will be turned off.

      Assessment:

      Objective assessment will be performed by observing the patients behavior using the FLAAC
      scale during the anesthetic injection and needle insertion.

      Subjective evaluation will be obtained using the Wong-Baker FACES pain rating scale.
