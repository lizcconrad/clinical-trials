    <textblock>
      Eligible patients will be randomized into 2 separate arms:

        -  Arm number one will receive Bevacizumab every 2 weeks in combination with TVB-2640 from
           day 1 until day 28 of the first cycle.

        -  Arm number two will receive Bevacizumab alone every 2 weeks, from on days 1 and 15 of
           the first until day 28 of the first cycle.

        -  MR-Spectroscopy will be obtained on all patients (both arms) at day 28 of first cycle.

        -  Starting on cycle 2 day 1, all patients will converge to a single arm and will continue
           to receive bevacizumab every 2 weeks in combination with TVB-2640. Every cycle will last
           28 days.
