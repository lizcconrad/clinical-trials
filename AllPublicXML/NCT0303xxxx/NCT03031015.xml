  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To introduce a novel external-fixation technique using the combination of K-wires and cement.
      For comparison, we also included another group of patients who were treated using a mini
      plate and screw system. Bone healing, range of motion of the fingers, costs of treatments,
      and patient satisfaction were assessed.

      Shaft fractures of the proximal phalanx are common injuries that may significantly affect
      hand function. Good fracture stability to allow early mobilization of joints and thus early
      return of function. The objective of this report is to introduce a novel external-fixation
      technique using the combination of K-wires and cement. For comparison, we also included
      another group of patients who were treated using a mini plate and screw system. A total of
      104 patients (131 fingers) were randomly allocated into group A (56 patients) and B (51
      patients). Patients in group A were treated with cemented K-wire fixation; and patients in
      group B were treated with conventional mini-plate. Bone healing, range of motion of the
      fingers, costs of treatments, and patient satisfaction were assessed.

    <description>The mean age of group A was 41 years (range, 18-63 years). There were 56 male and 11 female patients. The mean time from injury to operation was 5±4.53 days. Injured digits included index (n=24), long (n=19), ring (n=9), and little (n=15) fingers. Types of fractures were transversal (n=31), oblique or spiral (n=14), and comminuted (n=22) fractures. The patients were treated with Cemented K-wire Fixation.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  patient aged between 18 and 65 years;

          -  acute fractures within 15 days;

          -  closed fracture or open injury with small wound less than 1.5 cm;

          -  involvement of proximal phalanges of index to little fingers; shaft fractures;

          -  at least 5 mm in length of the most distal and proximal fragments so that the K-wires
             or screws can be engaged;

          -  oblique, spiral, and comminuted fractures;

          -  normal opposite hand for comparison.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patients younger than 18 years are excluded because of skeletal immaturity;

          -  patients older than 65 years are excluded because of possible osteoporosis;

          -  severe open injury or crush injuries; tendon or neurovascular injuries; - involvement
             of articular surface;

          -  old fractures exceeding 15 days because close reduction was most likely difficult;

          -  a combined tendon, nerve, or artery injuries or diseases; diabetes, gout, ganglion;

          -  osseous tumors, and other disease affecting bony structures and joint motion;

          -  patients who declined to participate.
