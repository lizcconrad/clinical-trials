  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The combination of the diuretics amiloride hydrochloride (HCl) and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ)
      (GSK3542503) is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, congestive heart failure and
      hepatic cirrhosis with ascites and edema. This first time in human (FTIH) study is aimed to
      determine whether the test product GSK3542503 is bioequivalent to the reference (ref)
      hydrochlorothiazide 50 milligram (mg)/amiloride hydrochlorothiazide 5 mg in healthy adult
      participants under fasting conditions based on pharmacokinetic (PK) endpoints. This is a
      phase I, open label, balanced, randomized, single dose, two-way crossover study, enroling
      approximately 42 healthy participants at a single center. Study participants will be
      randomized to one of two treatment sequences (A-B or B-A) in accordance with the
      randomization schedule. A single dose of one of the two treatments A (Test: GSK3542503, a
      hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg and amiloride hydrochloride 5 mg fixed dose combination) or B
      (Reference: Moduretic, a hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg and amiloride hydrochloride 5 mg fixed
      dose combination), will be administered on Day 1, in each treatment period. Each participant
      will participate in both treatment periods and receive a single dose of each treatment. The
      treatment periods will be separated by a washout period of at least 7 days and no more than
      14 days. The total duration in the study for each participant is expected to be 5 to 7 weeks,
      from screening to his or her last visit. A maximum of 42 participants will be randomized such
      that at least 32 evaluable participants complete the study.
