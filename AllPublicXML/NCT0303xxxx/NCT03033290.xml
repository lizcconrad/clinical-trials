  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allergic rhinitis is an importance disease in Taiwan with its high incidence about 20-30% and
      gradually increased annually. However, symptom relapse still bothered the majority of
      patients though there were certain advances in western medicine. In addition, side effects of
      western medicine, such as lethargy, mouth dryness were noted. Traditional Chinese medicine,
      especially qi-tonifying regimen has been used and proved benefit to the allergic diseases by
      many researchers.This study will provide the evidences of gut microbiota changes and
      immune-modulatory effects of BZYQT for the treatment of allergic rhinitis.

      Recently studies reported that gut microbiota is related to the human immunity modulation of
      allergic diseases. Investigators are interested to know weather qi-tonifying herbal medicine
      is through the changes of gut microbiota to modulate human immunity. In this study, a
      double-blinded, randomized, placebo control design is applied and total 60 perennial allergic
      rhinitis patients will be enrolled in our study. All subjects will be divided into
      Bu-Zhong-Yi-Qi-Tang (BZYQT) and placebo control groups, 40 and 20 subjects each. Subjects of
      BZYQT group will receive capsule of BZYQT, 4gm tid, 12gm a day, while control group will
      receive similar placebo capsule with same scheme. Total 2 months treatment course will be
      done. Gut microbiota will be assayed before and after 2 months treatment. Additionally,
      various parameters for immunologic response will be checked before and after the treatment,
      including the total IgE amount, the ratio of CD4/CD8 of T lymphocytes, the profile of
      cytokine such as IL-10 and IL-12 as well as functional change of dendritic cells and T cells.
      Results will be analyzed statistically including gender analysis. This study will provide the
      evidences of gut microbiota changes and immune-modulatory effects of BZYQT for the treatment
      of allergic rhinitis.
