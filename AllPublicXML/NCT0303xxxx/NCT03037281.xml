  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nociceptin is a protein found in the body, with a number of functions in the central nervous
      system, blood vessels and the gut. There is evidence that it may have a role in controlling
      the immune response to infection, and may act as a link between the brain and immune system.

      In infection, or after surgery, there is an increase in nociceptin, and subjects greater
      elevations of nociceptin have a poorer outcome. There is evidence that cells of the immune
      system may produce nociceptin, although it is not yet known which cells are capable of
      producing it, and what &quot;switches on&quot; production.

      This study aims to determine

        1. Which cells of the immune system can produce nociceptin

        2. If there is a difference in the ability to produce nociceptin between healthy volunteers
           and patients with severe infections
