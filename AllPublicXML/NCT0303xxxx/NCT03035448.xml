  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to learn about advanced cancer patients' preferences about
      how psychology services are introduced.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 110 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      If you agree to take part in this study, during an already-scheduled office visit, you will
      complete 3 questionnaires about your symptoms, your emotional health, and if you have ever
      participated in psychiatric or psychology services. These questionnaires should take about 9
      minutes to complete.

      All participants will watch 2 short videos. The videos show actors playing a doctor,
      counselor, and patient, discussing psychology service options. Each video is about 1 minute
      and 30 seconds long and will discuss the same material, but the content of each video will be
      different. The order in which they are presented will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of
      a coin). You will have an equal chance of seeing either video first.

      After you watch the second video, you will complete 3 questionnaires about whether you think
      1 of the videos was better than the other, and about your attitude toward psychology
      services. These questionnaires should take about 4 minutes to complete.

      Length of Study:

      It should take about 16 minutes to watch both videos and to complete all questionnaires. Your
      participation on this study will be over after you have completed the last questionnaire.

      Other Information:

      We will ask your caregiver(s) to leave the room while the videos are played. In case they
      decide to stay, we will ask them to keep silent.

    <description>Participants asked the preference to the introduction of counselor. The possible answers are The First Video, The Second Video, Neither, or No Difference. The actual content of the answers will be decoded by the study team at the end of the study to &quot;Counselor Alone&quot; or &quot;MD + Counselor&quot; depending on each patient's assigned arm.</description>
