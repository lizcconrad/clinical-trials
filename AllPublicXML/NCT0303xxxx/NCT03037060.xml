  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a need to better understand the mechanisms underlying alcohol use and dependence in
      order to advance the clinical treatment of alcohol dependence. Here, the investigators will
      use Positron Emission Tomography to determine if there is an up-regulation of D3 receptors in
      the brains of subjects with alcohol use disorders. The investigators will also investigate
      the relationship between D3 binding and major phenotypes associated with alcohol use
      disorders, namely: alcohol cue induced craving and motivation to self-administer alcohol in
      the laboratory.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol dependence is a devastating illness with social and medical costs estimated to be 180
      billion dollars annually in the US. In the clinical treatment of alcoholism, reducing alcohol
      consumption in heavy drinkers is a major clinical challenge. As such, there has been much
      emphasis in both clinical and preclinical research to identify the substrates that mediate
      craving, excessive drinking and addiction. Identifying the neurobiological mechanisms of
      alcohol dependence may lead to the development of new and better treatment strategies.
      Preclinical studies indicate that the D3 receptor is involved in alcohol-cue response and in
      the motivation to drink alcohol. However, there is currently no data available in human
      subjects exploring the relationship between D3 and those behavioral responses in subjects
      with alcohol use disorders.

      Aim #1: To measure the [11C]-(+)-PHNO PET binding levels in the brains of subjects with
      alcohol use disorders.

      Aim #2: To determine the relationship between D3 receptor binding and alcohol cue induced
      craving and motivation to self-administer alcohol in the laboratory.

      To achieve designated goals, the investigators will recruit 25 male and female subjects who
      are non-treatment seekers. After a period of abstinence from alcohol, participants will come
      to the Centre for Addiction of Mental Health for a [11C]-(+)-PHNO PET scan. Participants will
      also have additional sessions during which other alcohol-related measures will be assessed
      (i.e. alcohol cue induced craving and motivation to self-administer alcohol in the
      laboratory).

    <time_frame>One PET scan after 2-7 days of abstinence from alcohol; ~2 hours in duration.</time_frame>
    <description>Dopamine D2/D3 receptor occupancy in the brains of individuals with Alcohol Use Disorders will be quantified using [11C]-(+)-PHNO Positron Emission Tomography (PET). [11C]-(+)-PHNO binding levels will be used to infer receptor occupancy.</description>

    <measure>Alcohol craving ratings</measure>
    <time_frame>Cue paradigm session is expected to take ~1 hour and will occur on the PET day.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants' ratings for alcohol craving acquired during the validated Cue-Induced Craving Paradigm (using the Alcohol Urge Questionnaire: 8 items on a 11-point Likert scale) will be correlated to dopamine receptor occupancy (outcome 1).</description>

    <measure>Effort to obtain alcohol</measure>
    <time_frame>Single self-administration session will occur on its own day with a time commitment of ~6 hours.</time_frame>
    <description>Laboratory alcohol self-administration paradigm in which participants press a button to intravenously self-administer small doses of alcohol will be used to assess amount of effort expended to obtain alcohol (&quot;break point&quot;). The # of button presses required to obtain the alcohol will increase as per the Progressive Ratio schedule. Regression analysis between effort and [11C]-(+)-PHNO binding (outcome 1) will be applied.</description>
