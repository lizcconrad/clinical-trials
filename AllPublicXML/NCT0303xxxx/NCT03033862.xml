      Platelet activation and aggregation, intrinsic thrombogenicity, and biomarkers (fibrinogen,
      C-reactive protein, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule, von Willebrand factor,
      p-selectin) will be measured and compared following the implantation of Bioreabsorbable
      Vascular Scaffolds and Drug Eluting Stents.

             above), or is anticipating one during the course of their study participation, or is
             planning to have one within 1 month post dosing with the study drug.

          -  History within 30 days before enrollment of TIA and ischemic (presumed thrombotic)
             stroke/CVA.

          -  Known platelet count &lt;100,000/mm3 within 30 days before enrollment.
