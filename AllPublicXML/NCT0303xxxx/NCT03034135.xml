      This study of DSF-Cu in combination with TMZ for recurrent GBM will evaluate the antitumor
      effect in patients who have recurrent GBM. Patients will take DSF-Cu daily during their
      routine standard of care with TMZ therapy for approximately 6 months. Patients will be
      evaluated for response every 8 weeks. Patients will be followed up 2 years after the last
      dose of DSF-Cu.
