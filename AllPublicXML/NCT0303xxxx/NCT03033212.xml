  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This investigation will assess how the timing and type of rehabilitation after a
      transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion will affect the efficacy of the surgical procedure.
      The efficacy of the procedure will be evaluated through patients' quality of life, measured
      by health-related quality of life questionnaires up to 24 months following the procedure.
      These measures will be compared to the patients' baseline value.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will undergo transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion for degenerative pathology at
      the L4-5 vertebral level. They will be randomized to one of three postoperative
      rehabilitation groups. Group 1 will receive &quot;structured early rehabilitation&quot; beginning at 7
      weeks. Group 2 will receive &quot;Delayed rehabilitation&quot; beginning at 13 weeks postoperatively.
      Group 3 will undergo &quot;Self Rehabilitation&quot; beginning at 7 weeks postoperatively. Groups 1 and
      2 will undergo rehabilitation under the supervision of a certified physical therapist for 10
      total weeks. Group 3 will undergo non-supervised rehabilitation for 10 total weeks, and will
      be given educational materials regarding which exercises to perform and at which intervals.
