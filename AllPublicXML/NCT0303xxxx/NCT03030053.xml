  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A double-blind, randomised, controlled, parallel arm chronic intervention trial with healthy
      older adults will be conducted to determine the effect of a flavonoid-rich supplement on
      cognitive function, peripheral arterial health and brain mechanisms. It is predicted that
      chronic flavonoid supplementation will result in cognitive benefits and that these may be due
      to beneficial effects of flavonoids on vascular and brain function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There has recently been an increasing interest in the potential of flavonoids, plant derived
      compounds found in foods such as fruit and vegetables, to improve cognitive function.
      Research suggests that flavonoids improve memory and learning, possibly as a result of their
      anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects, for example by increasing cerebral blood flow
      (CBF), protecting vulnerable neurons, or by stimulating neuronal function and growth. The
      proposed research will involve a parallel design chronic dietary supplementation trial using
      a flavonoid-supplement and a matched control containing no flavonoids, to investigate
      long-term changes in cognitive performance. To understand the neural mechanisms behind
      potential changes in cognitive performance, resting cerebral blood flow (CBF), blood-oxygen
      level dependent (BOLD) response during two sensitive tests of cognitive performance, and
      structural brain changes will be measured in a group of healthy elderly adults (N=70, age
      range 60-75 years) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Additionally, peripheral vascular
      health will be measured using flow mediated dilatation (FMD), and bioavailability of
      flavonoid monomers and metabolites will be determined through analysis of plasma and urine
      samples. Biomarkers in the blood associated with vascular health and neural functioning as
      well as markers of interest in relation to the possible mechanisms of action of flavonoids
      will also be measured. All endpoints will be acquired before and after a 24-week chronic
      supplementation of either a high flavonoid supplementation or a control product, consumed in
      addition to participants' normal diet. Measures will also be taken following a 12-week
      post-intervention washout period in order to investigate whether any beneficial effects are
      sustained following cessation of supplementation.

If not possible, due to the need to reach the widest possible audience, pre-publication manuscripts arising from the project will be deposited in the free and publicly searchable University of Reading research database (CentAUR: http://centaur.reading.ac.uk). All data will be made available in an anonymised format upon request following publication of main findings. It is envisaged that the entire datasets will be available 6 months following the end of the project and maintained for a period of at least 10 years.</ipd_description>
