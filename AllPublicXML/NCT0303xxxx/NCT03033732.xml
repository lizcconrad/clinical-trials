  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial evaluates two standard of care treatments for opioid addiction: methadone and
      buprenorphine/naloxone. In order to improve patient care, the study will address real-world
      treatment conditions, including strict regulations for methadone dosing (i.e. initially
      dispensed daily at the pharmacy until stabilisation) vs. flexible take-home dosing for
      buprenorphine/naloxone. The OPTIMA study is designed with the intention to support
      patient-provider decision-making and evaluate health related outcomes with the overall aim of
      improving treatment outcomes through enhancing patient-centered approaches in clinical care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, 2-arm, randomized trial with a pragmatic design involving
      276 individuals with prescription opioid use disorder. Participants will be randomized to
      receive either:

        1. Methadone provided via initial daily witnessed ingestion as per local guidelines.

        2. Buprenorphine/naloxone maintenance therapy provided via flexible take-home dose regimens
           dispensed as per the physician's discretion, once clinical stability is achieved.

      Once randomized to a study medication and treatment initiation and induction has begun, study
      physicians and participants will discuss the treatment plans and procedures going forward.
      Once treatment initiation has taken place, the participant will attend study visits every 2
      weeks (including collection of urine samples) for the 24-week intervention period. For all
      study sites, standardized guidelines exist and will be adhered to for the safe induction of
      both medications. Frequency of illicit opioid use, intensity of craving and other secondary
      endpoints will also be assessed via standardized questionnaires.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Opioid Use</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Opioid use will be measured by the overall proportion of opioid-free urine drug screens (UDS) during the 24 weeks of the trial (excluding the assigned metabolites of opioid agonist treatments, as appropriate), with missing values defined as positive UDS (binary, laboratory assay).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Retention in treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Retention in treatment is defined as the proportion of participants on assigned opioid agonist treatment (OAT) at the end of the study, as defined by having both a) an active prescription for the assigned OAT at week 24, and b) a positive UDS result for the assigned OAT at week 24.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Opioid Agonist Treatment (OAT) Medication Adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>OAT medication adherence is defined as the proportion of assigned treatment doses received over the 24-week trial period assessed by both Pharmacy Abstraction and participant self-report.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety will be evaluated by monitoring adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Safety will be evaluated by monitoring adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) throughout the duration of the trial. Adverse events and SAEs will be collected during study visits by means of open questions (e.g., has there been any changes to your health since the last study visit?). Also, the observation of clinically significant change in lab test results, fatal or non-fatal overdoses, and precipitated withdrawal symptoms from buprenorphine/naloxone inductions will be used to document AEs and SAEs. All AEs and SAEs will be documented using an AE Log in which the date and time of onset, the end date and time (i.e., when the AE was resolved or stabilized), the severity of the event, any action taken with respect to the study medication (e.g., no treatment or dose adjustment), and the relationship with study protocol or study medication will be recorded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patient satisfaction to the assigned treatment will be recorded on the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8) and will be administered at 4, 12, and 24 weeks (end of study).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Engagement</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patient engagement in treatment will be measured through self-report questionnaires administered at Treatment Initiation, week 4, week 12, and week 24 visits. The primary measure of ongoing patient engagement will be administered at Treatment Initiation and every 2 weeks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of Life (QoL) will be evaluated via self-report questionnaires administered at Treatment Initiation and every 4 weeks.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pain will be assessed via self-report questionnaire at Screening to determine eligibility, Treatment Initiation and every 4 weeks for the 24 week intervention period.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Participants who Initiate Taper</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of patients who initiate taper will be assessed by using a standardized induction case report form completed via both pharmacy abstraction and self-report. The pharmacy record abstraction will collect information on opioid agonist treatment use and on the days between follow up visits, as well as information on end or switching of opioid agonist treatments, missing doses and reason any change in medication status or dose change. The participant will also be asked about his/her use of opioid agonist treatments in the past 2 weeks or since the last study visit collecting information similar to that information collected in the pharmacy abstraction.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Cost-effectiveness</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Information on health service utilization will be collected at baseline and every 4 weeks for the 24-week intervention period. Items were selected from modules selected from the European Addiction Severity Index which collect self-report data on income, medical/medication status, healthcare provider visits, and criminal activity. This information will either be collected on paper source or entered by the participant directly into the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system.</description>
