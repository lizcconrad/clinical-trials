      Background: Objective diagnostic methods for obstetric anal sphincter rupture, (OASR) such as
      endoanalt ultrasound (EAUS), show missed ruptures that can lead to anal incontinence. To
      perform EAUS after all deliveries at all hours, although it may lead to diagnostic
      improvement is not feasible in most delivery wards. Another objective method for screening
      women after delivery to identify OASR would be of value. Bidigital palpation of the perineum
      is often suggested without specifying what results are relevant.

      AIM:

      The aim of this study was to establish if the palpated anovaginal distance after delivery
      could be confirmed by perineal ultrasound and correlated to the extent of the perineal tear.

      MATERIALS AND METHODS:

      A structured educational programme for midwives (palpation) and doctors (perineal ultrasound)
      was accomplished. Midwives were instructed to record the palpated anovaginal distance in
      primiparae with spontaneous vaginal delivery and no episiotomy. If the AVD was found to be
      shorter than 2 cm, she recorded a primary diagnosis of probable grade 2, suspected grade 3 or
      probable grade 3 and called the doctor. The AVD was then measured by perineal ultrasound by a
      doctor aware of a laceration but not it´s extent, which was then established by clinical exam
      and perineal ultrasound.
