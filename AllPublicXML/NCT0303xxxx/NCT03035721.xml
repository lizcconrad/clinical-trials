  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to evaluate the tolerance and safety of a low-protein formula in healthy
      full-term infants by investigating effects on growth and gastrointestinal tolerance and by
      identifying any adverse effects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infants were randomized to receive either a standard protein formula or a low-protein
      formula. The composition of the low-protein formula vs the standard formula was: energy (65
      vs. 68 kcal/100 mL), protein (1.2 vs. 1.7 g/100 mL).

      To investigate the safety of the low-protein formula without any bias, a 4-month intervention
      period was selected during which the infants were fed only formula.

      Anthropometric parameters (weight, length, and head circumference) and body composition were
      assessed at enrollment, at 2 and 4 months' of age. Parents were asked to keep a diary on the
      occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms or any other symptoms and were contacted every two
      weeks either by clinic visits or phone calls.

      The reference group was constituted by a cohort of healthy, exclusively breastfed, full-term
      infants.

    <description>Weight (g) of each baby was measured on an electronic scale accurate to 0.1 g (PEA POD Infant Body Composition System; Cosmed, Concord, CA, US). Body length was measured to the nearest 1 mm on a Harpenden neonatometer (Holtain, Crymych, UK).</description>

    <measure>Evaluate body composition (fat mass and fat free mass)</measure>
    <time_frame>enrollment, 2 months and 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Body composition [fat mass and fat free mass (g)]was assessed using an air-displacement plethysmography (PEA POD Infant Body Composition System; COSMED, Italy).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate weight increase</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months, 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Weight increase (g/day) was calculated as a change in body weight from weight at study enrollment divided by the time interval from enrolment to the assessment at 4 months Fat mass (g/day) and fat free mass (g/day) increases were also calculated.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate gastrointestinal tolerance</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months and 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Parents were asked to keep a diary on the occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms or any other symptoms and were contacted every two weeks either by clinic visits or phone calls.
The occurrence of spitting up, vomiting and colic, defined as intermittent attacks of abdominal pain when the baby screamed and drew up his/her legs but was well between episodes, was recorded. Colic was further classified as severe if the episodes were more than twice per day. Daily frequency of stool passage was also collected.</description>

    <measure>Evaluate occurence of adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months and 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events were assessed based on inquires to the parents and on their daily records.</description>
