      This is a randomized, open-label, cross-over study comparing the bioequivalence of
      bedaquiline administered in whole tablet form versus bedaquiline administered in crushed
      (experimental) form in healthy adult volunteers.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, cross-over, bioequivalence study with two single treatment
      periods, separated by a 14-day wash-out period, conducted among 24 healthy adult males and
      females, who receive 400mg (4 x 100mg) bedaquiline orally in one of two sequences: either
      first in whole tablet form and second in crushed (experimental) form, or vice versa under fed
      conditions. The bioequivalence evaluation will be based on primary pharmacokinetic (pk)
      parameters affecting the extent of absorption, i.e., the bioavailability. If bioequivalence
      is not shown, the knowledge about the differences in bioavailability between whole and
      crushed tablets will be used for assessing the need of dose adjustment in children receiving
      the crushed form.
