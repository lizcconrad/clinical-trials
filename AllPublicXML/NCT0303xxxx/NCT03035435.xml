  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the last years, a lot of surgical fast track programs (SFTP) have been created and
      developed. This is due to the steady growing number of interventions on knee and hip; after
      the surgical treatment, a period of physical rehabilitation (PR) is established to be useful
      and effective, it usually takes 2-3 weeks. The recovery of strength, range of motion (ROM),
      independence, the reduction of pain and disability are the aims of PR. With the SFTP and a
      specific rehabilitation program named fast track rehabilitation (FTR) these times can be
      reduced. First of all because the length of stay (LOS) it's also caused by organizational
      problems of the hospitals, not only for the factors related to the patient. It's already been
      demonstrated that an early mobilization decreases the risk of thromboembolic complications
      and of pain, furthermore an early rehabilitation increase the patient autonomy and reduces
      the lost of residual abilities. Moreover a PR program studied for fast track patient will
      reduce minimum by a 50% the LOS in hospital, decreasing so the sanitary efforts that are
      always a problem for all the countries. The aim of this study is therefore to propose a fast
      track rehabilitation program based on an 8 days program for hip and knee arthroplasty being
      operated with an SFTP.
