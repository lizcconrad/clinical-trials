      The purpose of this study is to determine whether apatinib plus irinotecan can improve
      progression free survival compared with single irinotecan in patients with advanced gastric
      cancer or adenocarcinoma of esophagogastric junction who failed one lines of chemotherapy.

    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in China. Most patients are unresectable
      or metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis,so the prognosis is poor.Systemic therapy was
      required for the patients with advanced stage. Platinum combined with fluoropyrimidines
      always were considered as first line treatment. After failure of initial therapy, single
      agent of irinotecan was used as second line treatment,but limited survival benefit.Apatinib,
      a novel targeted inhibitor of VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2).The purpose of this study is to
      determine whether apatinib plus irinotecan can improve progression free survival compared
      with single irinotecan in patients with advanced gastric cancer or adenocarcinoma of
      esophagogastric junction who failed one lines of chemotherapy.
