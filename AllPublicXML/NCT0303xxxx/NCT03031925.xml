  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is substantial clinical and biological intra and inter-patient variability in SLE.
      Vascular, renal and neurologic deficiency can be organ-threatening or even life-threatening,
      leading to increased morbidity and mortality.

      Thus, biomarkers of disease activity and prognosis are required for regular follow-up of SLE
      patients.

      Implication of Toll-like Receptors (TLRs) in SLE has been extensively studied in mice models
      and humans. Self nuclear antigens bind to TLRs which are located on the surface of dendritic
      cells, B-cells, and endothelial cells, leading to production of pro-inflammatory cytokines
      and pathologic autoantibodies involved in organ dysfunction of SLE patients. Moreover, TLR
      expression in SLE is significantly higher and significantly correlated with disease activity.

      Annexin A2 (ANXA2) is a member of the annexins superfamily which exists as a monomer or
      heterotetramer and is implicated in several biological processes. Most notably, it binds to
      ẞ2GP1/anti-ẞ2GP1 antibodies and mediates endothelial cell activation via a TLR4 signaling
      pathway, highlighting its key role in Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS) frequently associated
      with SLE.

      ANXA2 is also involved in the physiopathology of SLE. Anti-DNA autoantibodies can bind with
      ANXA2 expressed on mesangial cells in lupus nephritis. Besides, a french study carried out in
      Amiens' University Hospital showed that vascular lesions in lupus nephritis were associated
      with a significant increase in vascular expression of ANXA2.
