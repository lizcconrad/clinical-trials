      OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to identify an SCP process that is patient-centered,
      effective in promoting appropriate survivorship care and can be successfully implemented for
      patients with different types of cancer who are being treated in a broad range of clinical
      settings. There is a need for research related to SCP that prioritizes outcomes that are most
      highly valued by patients, caregivers and clinical stakeholders.

      BACKGROUND: Each year, approximately 1.6 million people are diagnosed with cancer and the
      relative 5-year survival rate across all cancer types approaches 70%. As of 2014, there were
      almost 15 million Americans living with a history of cancer. Cancer survivors face a variety
      of health care needs, including surveillance for recurrence, treatment for long-term and late
      effects of cancer and its treatment, general primary and preventive care, management of any
      comorbidities, encouragement of healthy lifestyle behaviors, and attention to psychosocial
      issues. In 2005, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) report 'From Cancer Patient to Cancer
      Survivor: Lost in Transition' highlighted the challenges that cancer survivors face as they
      transition from acute treatment (Hewitt, M., Greenfield, S., &amp; Stovall, E., 2005). The
      completion of acute cancer treatment is a critical juncture at which patients are in need of
      better support and communication to ensure optimal health and quality of life outcomes as
      they transition to long-term survivorship. Cancer survivors face substantial deficiencies in
      the quality of care that they receive, including both underuse of recommended care and
      overuse of services that are not recommended for routine follow-up. The 2005 IOM report
      called for all patients completing acute treatment to be provided with a survivorship care
      plan (SCP) that summarizes treatments received and outlines future healthcare priorities in
      order to facilitate effective management of health care between survivors and their oncology
      and primary care providers.

      STUDY PROCEDURES: The primary aim of this trial is to assess whether there is a difference
      among three SCP models of varying levels of resource intensity and patients' receipt of
      recommended health services in the months following completion of acute treatment. We will
      conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to measure whether the provision of the SCP to
      the survivor and PCP is associated with survivors' receipt of cancer follow-up care as
      outlined on their SCP (primary outcome). Avoidance of non-recommended care, receipt of
      recommended primary and preventive care, and patient-reported outcome measures will serve as
      secondary endpoints.

      Participants in the RCT will have been treated for breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer.
      This RCT will be conducted in four oncology clinics in two medical systems. We will enroll
      survivors of Stage I-III breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer who are completing treatment
      and transitioning to long-term survivorship, and use a stratified randomization to assign
      participants to one of three study conditions (Arms A, B or C). This study will focus
      specifically on the period following completion of acute treatment (e.g., surgery, radiation,
      and chemotherapy); patients receiving long-term adjuvant endocrine/antibody therapies will
      also be eligible.

      The proposed trial will be conducted at Johns Hopkins Medical Institution (JHMI) and
      Peninsula Regional Medical Center (PRMC). JHMI is a large, academic medical center in an
      urban setting with distinct treatment programs based on disease site. At JHMI, we will
      recruit from the Breast Cancer Program, the Genitourinary Cancer Program (prostate cancer),
      and Gastrointestinal Cancer Program (colorectal cancer). These programs operate across
      disciplines (e.g., medical, radiation, and surgical oncology) but separately from each other,
      enabling evaluation of 3 separate clinical settings within JHMI. In addition, the trial will
      include the PRMC Richard A. Henson Cancer Institute, a community cancer program located in
      the rural area of Maryland's eastern shore. At PRMC there is a single general oncology
      practice. The four programs differ in the extent to which survivorship care planning is
      already a part of routine care. As yet, none of the clinics in this study has a consistent
      format for the delivery of SCP universally at the completion of acute treatment. Our study
      design (cancer types, clinical systems and SCP models) is intended to enable the development
      of real-world best practices for the implementation of SCPs and assess whether these are
      consistent or vary across a wide range of clinical contexts and survivor characteristics.

      Each participant will be followed for 18 months, with the number of visits dependent on the
      randomization arm (described below). We will abstract 18 months of follow-up data for
      enrolled patients from medical records, as well as from patient reports of health service
      use; data will be collected at months 6, 12, and 18. We will obtain and abstract medical
      records guided by the information in the summary document (see Health Services Use Summary
      included as a supplemental study document) and from the patient using provided tracking tools
      of providers they have seen, tests they have undergone, etc. (see Tip Sheet in supplemental
      study documents). Patient-reported outcomes will be collected at baseline, 6, 12, and 18
      months primarily via a REDCap form, with telephone or in-person data collection as a back-up
      when needed.
