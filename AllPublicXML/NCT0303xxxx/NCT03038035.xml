  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MLC601 (Neuroaid) is a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) having neuroprotective and
      neuroproliferative properties in cellular and animal models of brain injury. It contains 9
      herbal and 5 non-herbal components. MLC901 (Neuroaid II), a simplified formula of MLC601,
      containing only the 9 herbal components yet showing the same efficacy has become available.

      This study is carried out to find out if NEUROAID II (MLC901) is safe to be taken together
      with other established medicines for Alzheimer's disease and whether NEUROAID II (MLC901)
      helps in slowing down the Alzheimer's disease progression.

      This study will be a 6-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, followed by
      an open extension study in which all subjects who completed the main 6 month trial
      (irrespective of treatment allocation) will be offered open-labelled MLC901 for another 6
      months.
