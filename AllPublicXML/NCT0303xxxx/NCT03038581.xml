      Self-inflicted wrist injuries require special psychiatric knowledge and tactical skills.
      There is no protocol for treating such injuries. We analyze self-inflicted wrist injuries and
      compare them to traumatic wrist injuries.

    <textblock>
      Self-inflicted wrist injuries are regularly treated in hand surgery centers. These injuries
      involve risks that require special psychiatric knowledge and tactical skills. There is no
      protocol for treating such injuries. Therefore, the investigators analyze self-inflicted
      wrist injuries and compare them to traumatic wrist injuries.
