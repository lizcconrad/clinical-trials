  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sixty healthy subjects aged between 18 and 50 will be randomly allocated into three treatment
      groups: Conventional Cryolipolysis, Contrast Cryolipolysis or Recovery Reperfusion
      Cryolipolysis. The region will be treated according to the individual need, in the region of
      abdomen and flanks. Assessments of body composition will be performed at baseline and 30, 60
      and 90 days after randomization. Blood collections will also be performed at baseline and
      between 14 and 21 days after randomization for evaluation of lipid profile and liver
      function.
