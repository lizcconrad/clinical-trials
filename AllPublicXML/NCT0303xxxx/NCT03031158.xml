  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain (LBP) is extremely common in older adults and is associated with a host of
      negative consequences, including decreased physical function and increased healthcare
      utilization. Among older adults with LBP, hip impairments indicative of hip joint disease are
      more prevalent and associated with greater disability than among older adults without LBP.
      This study will investigate a novel intervention designed to improve LBP-related disability
      by combining a typical spine-focused exercise program with a hip-focused intervention.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age 60-85

          2. Low Back Pain for â‰¥ 3 months with pain of at least moderate intensity every day or
             almost every day that requires activity modification.

          3. Presence of at least 1 hip impairment denoted by the American College of Rheumatology
             as potential indicators of hip osteoarthritis: hip pain, pain on hip internal rotation
             or morning stiffness of the hip of &lt;60 minutes.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous hip fracture repair or total hip replacement

          2. Prominent component of radicular pain: CLBP with distal radiation below the knee

          3. Known spinal pathology other than osteoarthritis: (e.g., a history of back surgery or
             recent trauma, spinal stenosis, vertebral compression fractures, ankylosing
             spondylitis, carcinoma metastatic to the spine)

          4. Non-ambulatory, or severely impaired mobility (i.e., require the use of a wheelchair)

          5. Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination score of &lt;24

          6. Severe visual or hearing impairment.

          7. Red flags indicative of a serious disorder underlying the LBP: Red flags that would
             require specialized medical attention include fever, significant unintentional weight
             loss, a sudden recent change in the character or intensity of pain, trauma that
             preceded the onset of pain, or signs and symptoms of caudae equinae (i.e. loss of
             sensation over saddle region, significant disturbances in bowel and bladder function).

          8. Significant pain in parts of the body other than the back or acute LBP.

          9. Acute, ongoing illness.

         10. Inability to participate in the study for the full six months for any known
             reason.(i.e. moving away, extended vacation)

         11. Received physical therapy for their LBP within in the last 3 months.
