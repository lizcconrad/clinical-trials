  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nasal intubation is frequently used for dental procedures to promote an unimpeded view of the
      oral cavity. A nasal RAE endotracheal tube is longer than a standard oral endotracheal tube
      (ETT) and it is shaped so that end of the tube which attaches to the ventilator exits upward
      toward the forehead. This unique shape ensures that the tube will not interfere with surgical
      exposure of the oral cavity and mandible. The nasal RAE ETT can be placed in the trachea
      using either direct laryngoscopy (DL) or video laryngoscopy (C-Mac) . Sometimes this is
      possible without an adjuvant, but frequently a pair of specially shaped forceps, known as
      Magill forceps, is required to guide the distal tip of the Nasal RAE into the glottis due to
      the curvature of these ETT. Magill forceps are introduced into the mouth and are used to
      grasp the distal end of the Nasal RAE and direct it into the glottis. Contrary to what the
      current literature suggests, it has been our experience that nasal intubations using the
      C-Mac frequently do not require the use of Magill forceps at nearly the same rate as DL. This
      technique may improve the time and ease to intubation because of not having to use the Magill
      forceps. The use of Magill forceps can be awkward for the clinician, with poor visualization
      due to obstruction of the view by this tool in the airway, and small working space within the
      posterior oropharynx. For these reasons, the possibility of not having to use Magill forceps
      because the investigators are using a C-Mac as the only tool to intubate is a potentially
      inviting one.

    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the need for the use of standard Magill forceps
      when performing a nasal intubation with either conventional DL or VL with a C-Mac.
      Secondarily the investigators will also examine the time to intubate (TTI) for both methods
      as well.

      Once the patient is recruited, the patient will then be randomized to either intubation using
      DL or VL with a C-Mac. Once the patient is under anesthesia, the intubation will be performed
      by an attending pediatric anesthesiologist or experience pediatric CRNA who has experience
      both DL and with the C-Mac and will attempt to intubate the patient with or without Magill
      forceps as needed.

      The investigators will record the time to intubation (TTI) from the time the laryngoscope or
      C-Mac is placed in the mouth to the first appearance of end tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2). the
      investigators will record the presence or absence of nasal bleeding, and the grade of
      laryngeal view. The investigators will also record any general narrative comments about the
      ease or difficulty of intubation in both groups.

      The study will be performed at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center.

      Patients between the ages of 3 and 14 scheduled for comprehensive dental treatment under
      general anesthesia will be included.

      Normal appearing airway upon pre-operative assessment. The investigators have calculated a
      sample size of 35 patients in each group to be able to detect a significant difference in the
      rate of use of Magill forceps to place a nasal RAE ETT in this patient population.
