  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open , multicenter, interventional clinical trial to conform the role of of
      miR-122 a real-time detection biomarker of drug-induced liver injury by chemotherapy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The endorsed standard serum biomarkers, like ALT, AST, total bilirubin, are not
      tissue-specific, and cannot detect drug-induced liver injury (DILI) at a very early stage,
      thus unable to properly guide risk assessment and patient management. miR-122 is a
      liver-enriched miRNA. Many studies have demonstrated that miR-122 is a sensitive and specific
      biomarker when DILI occurred. However, there is a lack of a standard quantification method
      for miR-122 and confirmatory studies using a comprehensive list of drugs and patients. The
      investigators have developed the miRNA-derived Fragment Length Polymorphism (miRFLP) assay
      for the simultaneous quantification of multiple miRNAs.The methodology improves detection
      reliability by eliminating intra-assay variables. In this study, the investigators will
      investigate the role of miR-122 as a real-time detection biomarker of drug-induced liver
      injury utilizing the miRFLP assay. In addition, the investigators will try to identify the
      normal physiological range of miR-122 in healthy population and the relationship of miR-122
      and hepatic failure in patients of intensive care unit.

    <description>A total of 120 malignant tumor patients who need to receive chemotherapy are involved for miR-122 detection. They are from 3 centers, 40 for each center. For the first cycle of chemotherapy, the investigators will collect 0.5-1ml blood from the remained blood sample after routine blood test during chemotherapy for each patient.Each patient will have a routine blood test before(±3 days) each cycle of chemotherapy and 7(±3)days after chemotherapy. A routine blood test will include the test of ALT,AST,ALP and TBIL. Sample collection will stop after 4 cycles of chemotherapy. All blood samples collected by investigators are the remained sample after routine tests. Patients in routine care will also have blood tests before each cycle and on day 7(+/- 3) of each cycle of chemotherapy. These patients will also have blood test at these time points even if they are not in this trial.</description>
