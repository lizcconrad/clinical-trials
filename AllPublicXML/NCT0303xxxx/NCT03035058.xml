      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vedolizumab intravenous
      (IV) in non-end-stage primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) participants with underlying
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

      The drug being tested in this study is called vedolizumab. Vedolizumab is being tested to
      treat people who have non-end-stage primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) with underlying
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This study will look at changes in fibrosis staging in
      people who take vedolizumab.

      The study will enroll approximately 258 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by
      chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the three treatment groups in ratio 1:1:1—which will
      remain undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an
      urgent medical need):

        -  Vedolizumab 300 mg once every 4 weeks (Q4W)

        -  Vedolizumab 300 mg once every 8 weeks (Q8W)

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a tablet that looks like the study drug but has
           no active ingredient

      All participants will be administered vedolizumab or placebo via intravenous infusion

      This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study is up to 124 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic and will be
      contacted by telephone 6 months after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 106</time_frame>
    <description>Assessments will be performed from liver biopsies with histology assessed by 2 independent blinded central readers for Ishak fibrosis staging score. Ishak fibrosis staging scoring is as follows: 0=No fibrosis, 1=Fibrous expansion of some portal areas with or without septa, 2=Fibrous expansion of most portal areas with or without septa, 3=Fibrous expansion of most portal areas with occasional portal to portal bridging, 4=Fibrous expansion of portal areas with marked bridging (portal to portal and/or portal to central), 5=Marked bridging with occasional nodules (incomplete cirrhosis), 6=Cirrhosis, probable or definitive. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change in Ishak Necroinflammatory Grading Score from Baseline to the Week 106 Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 106</time_frame>
    <description>Assessments will be performed from liver biopsies with histology assessed by 2 independent blinded central readers for Ishak fibrosis staging score. Ishak necroinflammatory grading score is based on assessments from 4 subscales: (A) Periportal or periseptal interface hepatitis (piecemeal necrosis) 5-point subscale (0=Absent to 4=Severe), (B) Confluent necrosis 7-point subscale (0=Absent to 6=Panacinar or multiacinar necrosis), (C) Focal (spotty) lytic necrosis, apoptosis and focal inflammation 5-point subscale (0=Absent to 4=More than ten foci per times 10 objective), and (D) Portal inflammation (0=Absent to 4=Marked, all portal areas). A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>
