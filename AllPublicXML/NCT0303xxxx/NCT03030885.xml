    <intervention_model_description>This is a Phase 1, open-label, single-arm, dose ascending, out-patient study to evaluate the radiopharmaceutical 131I-MIP-1095 in men with mCRPC. The study consists of three phases: Screening, Treatment, and a Follow-up Phase. The Screening Phase consists of subject evaluation for study eligibility and dosimetry assessment. The Treatment Phase consists of two parts: Part 1, dose escalation (Cohorts 1-5), and Part 2, an additional cohort at a selected optimized dose based on safety and efficacy.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>This is a phase 1 dose escalation study of 131I-MIP-1095 in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. There are a maximum of five doses under consideration. Dose escalation cohorts will be studied if acceptable toxicity is observed. A dose limiting toxicity is defined as the occurrence of any of the following drug-related toxicities during the first cycle.</description>

             prostate

          -  Subjects must be castration resistant with evidence of progressive prostate cancer
             despite castrate levels of testosterone (≤ 50 ng/dL) according to the PCWG3 criteria

          -  Subjects must have metastatic disease detectable by either bone scan or cross
             sectional imaging by CT or MRI as per the PCWG3 guidelines

          -  Subjects must have progressive disease at study entry defined as 1 or more of the
             following 3 criteria that occurred while the subject was on androgen deprivation
             therapy:

               -  PSA progression defined by a minimum of two rising PSA levels with an interval of
                  ≥1 week between each determination. Subjects who received an anti-androgen as
                  part of their primary hormonal therapy must demonstrate progression after
                  withdrawal. The PSA value at screening should be ≥ 2 μg/L (2 ng/mL).

               -  Soft tissue disease progression defined by RECIST 1.1

               -  Bone disease progression defined by PCWG3 with two or more new lesions on bone
                  scan.

        Note: For subjects enrolling on the basis of soft tissue or bone progression, the baseline
        scan must show progression relative to a comparison scan performed during prior therapy. If
        the comparison scan is not available, the baseline scan report must reference the previous
        scan to document progression

          -  Subjects who received combined androgen blockade as their first-line hormonal therapy
             with an antiandrogen must have shown PSA progression after discontinuing the
             antiandrogen for ≥ 6 weeks prior to study treatment. No washout is needed after
             abiraterone or enzalutamide are discontinued. First generation antiandrogens such as
             bicalutamide must be withdrawn if given as first-line therapy.
