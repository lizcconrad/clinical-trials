  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a safety study to evaluate the risk of low blood pressure in subjects with Primary
      Immune Deficiency disorder (PID) treated with Bivigam™ or another commercial product under
      real world conditions. No study medication will be provided to subjects in this study. Study
      physicians will make all treatment decisions according to their usual practice and will
      provide prescriptions for his/her subjects, as appropriate. The only addition is the
      collection and structured documentation of data generated through usual practice.

    <time_frame>During infusion and up to 72 hours post infusion.</time_frame>
    <description>The number of events of hypotension in subjects treated with Bivigam or other immune globulin intravenous (IGIV) products.
Hypotension is defined as a systolic decrease of 30mmHG or a systolic blood pressure less than 90mmHG and clinical symptoms of hypotension including 1 or more of the following: dizziness, light-headedness, fainting (syncope), chest pain, or diaphoresis.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of Hepatic Impairment</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout the duration of study participation, up to approximately 140 days.</time_frame>
    <description>The number of events of hepatic impairment in subjects treated with Bivigam or other immune globulin intravenous products. The criterion for defining hepatic impairment is transaminases three times the upper limit of normal evaluated based upon medical history, treatment history and the presence of co-morbid conditions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Rate of Renal Impairment</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout the duration of study participation, up to approximately 140 days.</time_frame>
    <description>The number of events of renal impairment in subjects treated with Bivigam or other immune globulin intravenous. The criterion for defining hepatic impairment is creatinine values greater than three times the upper limit of normal evaluated based upon medical history, treatment history and the presence of co-morbid conditions.</description>
