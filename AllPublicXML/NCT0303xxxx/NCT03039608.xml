  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The method of esophageal endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) to remove superficial
      esophageal neoplasms has gained widespread acceptance as an alternative to surgery recently
      these years especially in Asian countries. However, besides of perforation and bleeding,
      another complication postoperative esophageal stricture is frequently observed after the
      removal of large-sized esophageal neoplasms by ESD. Dysphagia caused by postoperative
      stricture substantially decreases the patient's quality of life, requiring further therapy.
      Although the exact incidence is unknown, esophageal stricture is supposed to be related to
      the extent of the circumference being resected. In previous study by Ono et al，it is reported
      that 90% of patients with lesions of circumferential extension of more than three-fourths
      experienced postoperative stricture after esophageal ESD. There were some reported studies
      exploring new ways to prevent esophageal stricture after ESD, such as oral prednisolone and
      local corticosteroid injection. Corticosteroids can inhibit not only collagen synthesis but
      also enhance collagen breakdown, thereby inhibiting stricture formation. Some studies reveled
      that just oral prednisolone oral is effective option for the prevention of post-ESD
      stricture. However, most of the reported studies were non RCTs with small sample. In the
      primary study, the investigators search a new method of combination of both oral and local
      injection to prevent esophageal stricture，as a result，stricture at 8 weeks after ESD was
      found in 19 of 36 patients in the no corticosteroid group but only 4 of 34 in the
      corticosteroid group. Unfortunately，the study was also retrospective. So, the investigators
      plan to undertake a prospective, randomized controlled trial to evaluate the prophylactic
      effects of combination of local steroid injection with oral steroid administration for
      esophageal stenoses complicating extensive ESD.
