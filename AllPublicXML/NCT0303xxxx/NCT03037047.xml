      This parallel, double blind, randomized, controlled, multi-center study will evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of salvianolate injection in elderly patients with unstable angina
      pectoris. Patients will treated with or without salvianolate injection on the basis of
      conventional therapy for 14 days. The primary measures of effectiveness include the change
      from baseline to the end of treatment in the angina scores.(Angina score table :sum of 4
      items), the variation of EKG (level of the S-T segment)., Additional measures of
      effectiveness include the change from baseline to the end of the treatment in the Seattle
      Angina Questionnaire(SAQ),EuroQol-5 Dimensions(EQ-5D) will be performed throughout the study.
      Patients who complete the double-blind portion of the study will be followed up 28 days.
      Effectiveness will be assessed at 7 days, 14 days and 28 days. Safety evaluations (incidence
      of adverse events,, physical examinations, laboratory tests) will be performed at at 7 days,
      14 days and 28 days of the study.
