  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This triple-blinded randomized placebo control trial aims to investigate the safety and
      efficacy of Nutri-PEITC jelly, a functional food, in head and neck cancer patients. The
      primary outcome measure includes adverse events and health-related quality of life. The
      secondary outcome includes tumor response and functional status.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previously, Nutri-jelly, a novel edible nutritious gel for patients with chewing and
      swallowing difficulties, was shown to be effective in improving the quality of life of head
      and neck cancer patients. Recently, Nutri-PEITC jelly is recently developed by addition of
      Phenethyl Isothiocyanate (PEITC), a phytochemical compound with chemopreventive action in
      animal bearing oral cancer. It intends to be a functional food for cancer survivor. The dose
      of PEITC in Nutri-jelly was based on safe and effective dose determined in animal studies.
      Furthermore, Nutri-PEITC jelly was proven safe in healthy volunteers who daily consumes for a
      consecutive month with no serious adverse events. The purpose of this study is to determine
      safety and efficacy of Nutri-jelly with PEITC in head and neck cancer patients.

      independent variable: continuous Nutri -jelly with PEITC intake dependent variable (outcome):
      adverse effects, health-related quality of life score, tumor response and functional status
