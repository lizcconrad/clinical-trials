    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, exploratory, non-comparative and open-label study to investigate the
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK) and PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) relationship of
      RO7034067 in adults and children with Type 2 and Type 3 Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) who
      have been previously enrolled in a study with a survival of motor neuron 2 (SMN2)-targeting
      therapy.

          -  Previous participation in a study with an SMN2-targeting antisense oligonucleotide or
             SMN2 splicing modifier other than RO7034067

          -  Negative blood pregnancy test at screening and agreement to comply with measures to
             prevent pregnancy and restrictions on sperm donation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to meet study requirements

          -  Concomitant participation in any investigational drug or device study

          -  Previous participation in an SMN2-targeting antisense oligonucleotide or SMN2 splicing
             modifier study other than RO7034067 within 90 days prior to screening

          -  Previous participation in any investigational drug or device study, other than SMN2
             targeting antisense oligonucleotide or SMN2 splicing modifier study, within 90 days
             prior to screening, or 5 half-lives of the drug, whichever is longer

          -  Any history of gene or cell therapy

          -  Unstable gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, endocrine, or cardiovascular system
             diseases as considered to be clinically significant by the Investigator

          -  Presence of clinically significant electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities before study

             Investigator.

          -  Significant risk for suicidal behavior, in the opinion of the Investigator as assessed
             by the C-SSRS

          -  Any major illness within one month before the screening examination or any febrile
             illness within one week prior to screening and up to first dose administration

          -  Recently initiated treatment (within less than [&lt;] 6 months prior to enrollment) with
             oral salbutamol or another beta 2-adrenergic agonist taken orally

          -  Any prior use of chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, retigabin, vigabatrin or
             thioridazine, is not allowed

          -  Concomitant disease or condition that could interfere with, or treatment of which
             might interfere with, the conduct of the study, or that would, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, pose an unacceptable risk to the participant in this study

          -  Recent history (less than one year) of ophthalmological diseases that would interfere
             with the conduct of the study as assessed by an ophthalmologist. Participants in whom
             Organic Cation Transporter or Spectral Domain-Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT)
             measurement of sufficient quality cannot be obtained at screening will not be enrolled
