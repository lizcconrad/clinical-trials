      The objective of the ADDIA clinical Proof-of-Performance study is to validate the performance
      of ADDIA' blood biomarkers for diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.

      ADDIA clinical study is a multi-centre, non-interventional, prospective, proof-of-performance
      study with only one visit.

      About 800 well-characterized subjects will be recruited into 3 groups in 2:1:1 ratio, namely
      patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), patients with non-AD neurodegenerative disease (NAD)
      and 200 control subjects (healthy as compared to their age).

        -  400 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD): 200 patients with mild AD, 200 patients with
           moderate-to-severe AD,

        -  200 patients with non-Alzheimer's neurodegenerative diseases (NAD),

        -  200 controls (healthy as compared to their age).

             AD. MMSE score &gt; 21 in subjects with mild AD with sporadic or a familial form of AD
             due to mutation in APP or PSEN1 or PSEN2 genes.

          -  FCSRT, MoCA tests (MoCA measured in the last 3 months).

          -  Neuroimaging compatible with a diagnosis of AD:

                  40-75 years and ≥ 3 in patients aged above 75 years. For patients younger than 60
                  years, and with familial form of AD, who may have normal MTA-scores, Koedam score
                  (0-3) for Parietal Atrophy showing atrophy of the precuneus characteristic of AD
                  may be used with a Koedam score from 1 to 3.

        Other neuroimaging data (retrospectively available) including PET Amyloid scan and FDG PET

        For NAD group:

        For all patients of the group NAD, except PSP subgroup (when PSP has a clear-cut typical
        phenotype, sometimes called Steele-Richardson phenotype), the CSF biomarker data must show
        levels for CSF biomarkers Aβ1-42, phosphorylated-Tau and total-Tau, compatible with the

             be a member of family with a known mutation in one of the FTD related genes: MAPT,
             PGRN. The predominant phenotype in the kindred must be cognitive/behavioural (i.e.
             kindred in whom Parkinsonism or Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis is the predominant
             clinical phenotype among affected relatives is excluded).
