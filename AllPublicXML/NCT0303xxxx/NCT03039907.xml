  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to examine the factors that allow patients that undergo
      total knee arthroplasty to return to recreational sports and/or work activities, and to
      achieve recommended physical activity levels.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are three purposes of this study. The first purpose is to examine the factors that
      allow patients that underwent total knee arthroplasty with the Journey II to return to
      recreational sports and/or work activities, and to achieve recommended physical activity
      levels (defined by the American Heart Association and the American College of Sports
      Medicine).

      The second purpose is to examine the factors that limit the ability of patients to resume
      sports, work, and physical fitness training, including comorbidities, general health,
      complications, and other factors.

      The third purpose is to use advanced sports medicine rehabilitation principles that involve
      staged progressive protocols to safely prepare patients for sports, work, and physical
      fitness training. Objective measurements of muscle strength, endurance, balance, and
      neuromuscular control will be used to determine when patients may be cleared to participate
      in these activities.

    <measure>Analysis of Number of Participants That Return to Recreational and Fitness Activities</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete a questionnaire that determines the type of physical activities they routinely participate in (for instance, swimming, bicycling, hiking, golf). Patients will also complete two questions regarding their general fitness level in accordance with current standards of the American Heart Association. These questions are contained in the study patient registry.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of Effect of Charlson Comorbidity Index on Return to Recreational and Physical Activities</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>Patient comorbidities will be documented by the surgeon using the weighted Charlson Comorbidity Index. An analysis will be conducted to determine if the index score has a deleterious effect on recreational activities or general fitness activities at follow-up.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of Postoperative Complications on Return to Recreational and Physical Activities</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>All postoperative complications will be documented in the study patient registry with a list related specifically to TKA from the AKS and a second general list that was generated from complications recorded by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (2015 update). An analysis will be conducted to determine if complications have a deleterious effect on recreational activities or general fitness activities patients return to after surgery.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of Effect of Preoperative Body Mass Index on Return to Recreational and Physical Activities</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>Patient body mass index will be collected before surgery and will be designated as either obese, over weight, or within normal limits according to WHO classification of obesity. Determination will be made of the effect of BMI on return to recreational or general fitness activities at follow-up.</description>
