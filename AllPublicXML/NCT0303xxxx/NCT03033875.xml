    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the psychoeducational program &quot;Tele-Savvy.&quot; Tele-Savvy
      is an internet based, group education program developed from an in person program called
      Savvy Caregiver. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the Tele-Savvy group
      (receiving only the Tele-Savvy education) or the Healthy Living Education Program (receiving
      healthy lifestyle education and then Tele-Savvy education 6 months later). Each program takes
      43 days to complete.

      43 days to complete. In those 43 days, participants will be asked to take part in a video
      conference once per week (60-90 minutes) and view daily video lessons (7-15 minutes). They
      will participate in 5 interviews over the course of the 12 month study. These interviews will
      discuss participant's experience as a caregiver. All interviews will be limited to 60
      minutes.

    <description>The ADRQL is a research instrument used to assess health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in persons with Alzheimer disease (AD) and other types of dementia. The total score for the ADRQL is computed by summing the values assigned to the responses, dividing the sum by the maximum value for the scale and multiplying the results by 100 to obtain a percentage score of 0 to 100. A higher score reflects a higher quality of life.</description>

    <description>The PROMIS Anxiety short form measures anxious misery, fear, hyperarousal, and somatic symptoms associated with arousal and is based on the subjects' recall of feeling anxious in the past 7 days. There are 7 items in which answers are provided on a Likert-type scale. Higher score reflects greater anxiety.</description>

    <description>The Ways of Coping Scale is a 42-item scale with 4-point Likert responses. It identifies emotion- and problem-focused coping responses. Raw scores describe the coping effort for each of the eight types of coping. High raw scores indicate that the person often used the behaviors described by that scale in coping with the stressful event.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Revised Memory and Behavior Problem Checklist (RMBPC) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Follow Up (Month 12)</time_frame>
    <description>The RMBPC is a 22-item Likert scale instrument that assesses patient behaviors and caregiver responses to them. Scores are computed for the presence or absence of each problem first, and then for caregiver &quot;reaction&quot; or the extent to which caregivers were &quot;bothered&quot; or &quot;distressed&quot; by each behavior.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Self-Rated Health Score</measure>

    <description>The Tele-Savvy program engages groups of six dementia family caregivers in a program that extends over 43 days.The program begins with a scheduled 75-minute group videoconference led by facilitators; similar group videoconferences then take place weekly for six weeks. In between the video-conferences, caregivers will receive daily emails with links to 5-15 minute on-line video lessons that can be watched on their own schedule as often as they wish.The videoconferences allow caregivers to report enactment of learned and self-developed management strategy behaviors into their own caregiving and allow them to raise questions. Each daily video presents a teaching point linked to the overall curriculum. The lesson is carried forward by brief, scripted talks by experts or is enacted in vignettes in which a fictional family caring for a father living with Alzheimer's demonstrates effective caregiving techniques linked to the day's teaching points.</description>

    <description>The Healthy Living Education Program contains video and text materials on exercise, diet, and healthy living. Participants will be asked to log into the Canvas site daily over the course of six weeks to view the videos. Each participant will also receive 7 weekly brief scripted phone or video calls from a project facilitator to inquire about participants' use of the materials. Additionally, all participants will convene weekly for a video conference centered on the application of healthy living strategies. Facilitators will greet and check in with each of the caregivers, coach and debrief caregivers on the homework, answer questions and/or respond to feedback about the week's material, review key points and concepts from the week's video sessions and introduce new material, report on any activities that caregivers may have implemented based on the materials, and provide homework assignments.</description>
