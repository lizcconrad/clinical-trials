  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deficient cognitive control (CC) and the use of dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies
      (ERS) are both central characteristics of major depression. Both are associated with reduced
      activity of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Transcranial direct current
      stimulation (tDCS) is a safe, simple and effective non-invasive method to modulate the
      cortical excitability. The goal of this randomized, sham-controlled, double blind clinical
      trial is to examine the effect of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on the CC
      and ERS in depressed patients compared to healthy subjects. Overall, the study will include
      44 participants (22 depressed Patients and 22 healthy subjects). Each participant will
      complete a CC task while receiving sham tDCS in one session and anodal tDCS in the other
      session (counterbalanced). Afterwards the ERS 'rumination' will be measured during a resting
      phase by means of a questionnaire and psychophysiological measures (heart rate variability).
      The investigators hypothesize (a) an amelioration of CC by anodal tDCS and (b) a reduced use
      of the dysfunctional emotion regulation strategy 'rumination' after anodal tDCS. Overall this
      experiment will provide new and reliable data for the development of new treatment methods.

      1. Working hypothesis: anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the
           dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) can enhance healthy and impaired cognitive
           control (CC) and reduce the use of dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies.

        2. Previous work of the investigators: The investigators previous work has provided
           decisive evidence for polarity-specific activity-dependent effects of tDCS to the left
           dlPFC on cognitive planning and control of emotional information processing in healthy
           subjects and patients with MD. Particularly, reduced prefrontal brain activity during a
           working memory task in patients with MD was found by using near infrared spectroscopy
           (NIRS). In addition, the investigators demonstrated that a single session, anodal,
           activity enhancing tDCS to the left dlPFC ameliorates deficient CC in patients with
           depression, whereas cathodal, activity reducing tDCS, induces a depression-like
           negativity bias in healthy subjects. Furthermore, the investigators showed that during
           anodal tDCS of the left dlPFC healthy subjects showed (a) better performance in a CC
           task (b) no increase in angry mood after the task compared to a control group and (c)
           that elevated angry mood was associated to a worse performance in the CC task.

        3. Aims and workplan: to investigate the effects of anodal tDCS of the left dLPFC in
           healthy and depressed subjects the investigators will conduct a double-blind,
           randomized, sham-controlled, cross-over design. In two sessions each participant (22
           depressed and 22 healthy subjects, N= 44) will complete a CC task while receiving anodal
           tDCS (1 mA) to the left dlPFC in one session and sham tDCS in the other session
           (counterbalanced). Afterwards the ERS 'rumination' will be measured during a resting
           phase by means of a questionnaire and psychophysiological measures.
