    <textblock>
      This project will combine the data collected from structural and functional MRI scans and
      neuropsychology performance post-TBI in children. Patients will be followed for a year, in
      order to examine the brain and cognitive recovery post head injury.

    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury in childhood has an cumulative effect that leads to impairments in
      cognitive functions such as deficits in memory, executive functions and attention. The
      cognitive impairment is the main cause of disabilities in the injured population, and has a
      different effect depending on the type and severity of the injury.

      Imaging after brain trauma serves as a useful diagnostic tool in identifying the head
      trauma's results. Therefore, in recent years, using imaging methods, studies have tried to
      find measures which will be able to predict the functional outcome after brain injury in
      children, and assist in developing a personalized rehabilitation program. The combination of
      advanced imaging techniques with neuropsychological assessment within the early stage of the
      injury and during a year of followup, will allow us to establish the relationship between
      those measures and the functional recovery result of the children. This multi-analysis will
      enable us to have a deeper understanding of the neuroplasticity process and the functional
      recovery after brain injury in the developing young brain.
