  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of the study is to look at the effects of intranasal oxytocin on the brain in
      Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Oxytocin is a hormone that exists naturally in the body and
      the brain. It affects a wide range of social behaviors and emotions. Investigators also seek
      to study how the effects of oxytocin treatment can be affected by genetic, immune and
      environmental factors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of investigating the effects of several doses of acute administration of
      intranasal oxytocin on brain activity in adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). There is
      increasing evidence for the role of intranasal oxytocin (IN-OT) in enhancing social skills in
      ASD. Nevertheless, there is still a need of determining target engagement for oxytocin's
      action on brain and behavior. Here, investigators are studying the effects of different doses
      of IN-OT on the modulation of behavioral outcomes and neural responses in a double blind
      crossover study in individuals with ASD.

      The aims of the research are to:

        1. Study the effects of IN-OT doses on the modulation of brain functional connectivity
           between key socio-emotional brain regions during resting state in ASD

        2. Study the effects of IN-OT doses on the BOLD activity of key emotional and perceptual
           brain networks in response to social cues (such as faces)

        3. Study the effects of IN-OT on the BOLD activity of brain regions during an interactive
           social environment (ball game) in ASD

      Investigators will compare the neuroimaging and behavioral results of individuals with ASD to
      control healthy males who will receive intranasal placebo. Investigators are also
      investigating the role of genetic factors, behavioral or clinical sub-groups of ASD, immune
      and environmental factors in modulating the effect of IN-OT on brain and behavior.

      Participants will undergo 4 clinical visits during which they receive various randomly
      assigned doses of intranasal oxytocin and placebo. Both participants and the experimenter
      will be blind to the type of the treatment administered.

      There will be only one visit for healthy controls who will all receive placebo spray. The
      visit for healthy controls will be conducted in a single-blind design. The experimenter will
      be aware that the subject is receiving placebo. However, the participant will be told that he
      might receive oxytocin or placebo.

    <measure>Difference in Resting State Functional Connectivity (rsFC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Post Intervention (Up to 40 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will study the effects of intranasal oxytocin (IN-OT) on the resting state functional connectivity between key socio-emotional and social salience brain regions using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).Resting state functional connectivity is a task-independent metric of brain activity that is based on correlations between low-frequency fluctuations of the blood oxygen level-dependent signal between several brain regions. It reflects the strength of a functional connection that is in good agreement with the underlying neuroanatomy and provides a system-level understanding of brain function.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) Activity in Response to Social Cues</measure>
    <time_frame>Post Intervention (Up to 50 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>BOLD activity level will be assessed via fMRI during completion of the face perception task of emotional and neutral faces (FPT). Difference is defined as the difference in BOLD activity during the FPT in ASD between the different treatment conditions.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) Activity in Response to Dynamic Social Cues</measure>
    <time_frame>Post Intervention (Up to 70 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>BOLD activity level and functional connectivity between socio-emotional brain regions during the perception of emotional facial videos will be measured while playing a ball-game. Differences between the different treatment conditions (including placebo and oxytocin doses) will be assessed to study the impact of oxytocin on brain function in ASD.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adapted Version of the Global Clinical Interview</measure>
    <time_frame>Post Intervention (Up to 180 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical improvements will be rated by a clinician as based on a videotaped interview conducted after the MRI scanning session. Differences between the different treatment conditions will be assessed to study the effect of IN-OXT on ASD at the clinical level. The improvement will be assessed based on the quality of social interaction between the experimenter and the participant.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Eye Gaze</measure>
    <time_frame>Post Intervention (Up to 50 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>Eye gaze will be recorded via an eye tracker inside the MRI scanner during the face perception task (FPT). Differences between different treatment conditions will be assessed in ASD.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Social Learning Test (SLT) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Post Intervention (Up to 130 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>During the SLT, participants are asked to complete an implicit association test that will include the use of faces and words. There are several sessions in this test. The participant is asked to match the face or the word that is presented in the middle of the screen to one of the two categories that is presented to the top left and top right of the screen. Differences between treatment conditions will be assessed in ASD.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Emotion Matching Test (EMT) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Post Intervention (Up to 150 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>During the EMT, participants are asked to identify the emotion that is displayed on a face by matching the emotional face that appears on the left to one of the faces that appears to the right (different faces but same emotion). A higher score indicates more matches.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Post Intervention (Up to 170 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>The TAS is a 20-item instrument that is one of the most commonly used measures of alexithymia. Alexithymia refers to people who have trouble identifying and describing emotions and who tend to minimise emotional experience and focus attention externally. The TAS-20 is a self-report scale that is comprised of 20 items. Items are rated using a 5-point Likert scale whereby 1 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly agree. The TAS-20 uses cutoff scoring: equal to or less than 51 = non-alexithymia, equal to or greater than 61 = alexithymia. Scores of 52 to 60 = possible alexithymia. Differences between treatment conditions in ASD will be assessed. Correlations between scores in this measure and brain function during resting state and the other social tasks will be also considered.</description>
