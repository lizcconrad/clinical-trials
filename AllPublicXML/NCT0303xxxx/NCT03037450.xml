  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neurotrophic keratitis (NK) is a degenerative disease of the cornea due to the impairment of
      the nasociliary branch of the ophthalmic nerve. Reduced corneal sensation lead to several
      corneal lesions including spontaneous ulcerations, delayed wound healing, corneal scarring,
      neovascularization, thinning, perforation or infection. An important and permanent visual
      loss of is frequently associated with the condition. NK can be congenital or acquired. Its
      acquired forms can be due to traumatic, infectious (herpes, zoster), neoplastic or iatrogenic
      causes. There is currently no specific medical treatment. Surgical reconstruction techniques
      of sensory neurotizations have recently been described in young patients suffering traumatic,
      congenital or neoplastic NK using supratrochlear nerves as the sensory donor nerves and sural
      nerve as healthy graft. A neurotization involves the transfer of a healthy donor nerve
      segment into a tissue to reestablish either motor or sensory innervation. The aim of the
      present study is to assess the outcomes of a novel sensory neurotization technique for the
      treatment of severe NK in adult patients (Stages 2 and 3 of Mackie classification). Corneal
      neurotizations will be performed using either ipsilateral supraorbital nerve as donor nerve
      (direct neurotization) or contralateral supraorbital nerve as donor nerve and a segment of
      the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve as graft. Small-size skin incisions (less than 3
      centimeters) will be made in one or both eyebrow and an endoscopic device will help the
      surgeons to localize and dissect the supraorbital nerve. Donor nerves or graft will be
      sutured to the neurotrophic corneas. Adult patients with unilateral NK due to infectious,
      traumatic or iatrogenic causes will be included.
