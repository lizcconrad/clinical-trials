      Head trauma patients were evaluated for readiness to be weaned off mechanical ventilation. If
      they had completed an Spontaneous Breathing Trial (SBT) before extubation. To measure
      Semiquantitative Cough Strength Score (SCSS), the investigator will put the patients at 30°
      to 45°, measure SCSS, first. The investigator enhance the patient to cough with as much
      effort as, when the investigator disconnect the ventilator. The cough strength was scored
      from 0 to 5 as follows: 0 = no cough on command, 1 = audible movement of air through the
      endotracheal tube but no audible cough, 2 = weakly (barely) audible cough, 3 = clearly
      audible cough, 4 = stronger cough and 5 = multiple sequential strong coughs.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The study included 80 adult male and female patients' their ages between 18-65 years
             admitted to trauma ICU with head trauma, on mechanical ventilation more than 24 hours
             and was ready to be weaned off from mechanical ventilation after successful
             spontaneous breathing trial and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score &gt; 8 before extubation

        Exclusion Criteria:

        • Patients who had undergone tracheostomy before extubation, GCS ≤ 8, chest trauma (ribs
        fracture and lung contusion) and patients with chronic chest disease (Chronic obstructive
        pulmonary disease, tuberculosis and cancer lung) were excluded from the study.
