      The Precious study is likely to help determine the frequency (percentage) of subclinical
      hypothyroidism among pregnant women in Pakistan It will also help to determine the risk
      factors for developing subclinical hypothyroidism during pregnancy

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Frequency of subclinical hypothyroidism in pregnant females</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Continuous variables with normal and non-normal distributions would be reported as mean (SD) and median [inter-quartile range (IQR)], respectively. Prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism with 95% confidence Interval (CI) will be calculated. Continuous variables between group will compared by using Independent sample t test, and categorical variables will compare by using the chi-square test.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The risk factors that might be associated with subclinical hypothyroidism in all enrolled pregnant patients.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Odds Ratios (OR) and their 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) will be estimated using Logistic Regression. The likelihood ratio test used to assess the association between the explanatory variables and the risk of the subclinical hypothyroidism. Univariable analyses will perform to examine the effect of each variable on the risk of subclinical hypothyroidism. In multivariate analysis all insignificant variables (p &gt;0.05) will check for their confounding and interaction effects before their removal from the final model.</description>
