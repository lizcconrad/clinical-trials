  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis, also called eczema, is a disease with dry, scaly, itchy skin. Those with
      atopic dermatitis may have complications from skin infections such as eczema herpeticum after
      herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. Symptoms of eczema herpeticum include fever and
      clusters of itchy blisters which crust over and form sores. Although exposure to HSV is
      widespread, most people clear the virus and only a subset of individuals with atopic
      dermatitis develop eczema herpeticum.

      The purpose of this study is to determine why some individuals with atopic dermatitis are at
      higher risk for recurrent skin infections with HSV. The study team will compare how people
      with atopic dermatitis with a history of recurrent eczema herpeticum, people with atopic
      dermatitis without a history of eczema herpeticum, and people without atopic dermatitis
      respond to HSV.

      This study uses whole genome sequencing (WGS) technology to identify genetic variants that
      confer risk of recurrent atopic dermatitis with a history of eczema herpeticum (ADEH+), with
      ≥3 eczema herpeticum (EH) episodes.

      A small subgroup of individuals with atopic dermatitis (AD) suffer from life-threatening
      disseminated herpes simplex virus (HSV) skin infections, termed eczema herpeticum (ADEH+).
      The manifestation of ADEH+ however is not simply a consequence of herpes simplex virus type 1
      (HSV-1) infections, since the majority of the US population is latently infected with HSV-1
      from an early age. Most importantly, there is a bimodality in the recurrence of eczema
      herpeticum (EH) episodes; most individuals have only a single episode but a subgroup of ADEH+
      individuals has 3 or more episodes.

      This study aims to conduct an extreme trait investigation of ADEH+ with recurrent EH, ≥3
      episodes, compared to AD without a history of eczema herpeticum (ADEH-), using whole genome
      sequencing.
