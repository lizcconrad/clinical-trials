  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common peripheral entrapment neuropathy with
      involving compression of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel. Rather than other progressive
      disease, CTS is characterized by remission and recurrence. The hydrodissection could decrease
      the entrapment of nerve to restore blood supply. Despite the hydrodissection was pervasively
      used in clinical practice, current researches contain small participant without control group
      or randomized leading to foreseeable selection bias. The investigators design a randomized,
      double-blind, controlled trial to assess the effect of different method of ultrasound-guided
      hydrodissection in patients with CTS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After obtaining written informed consent, patients with bilateral CTS will been randomized
      into intervention and control group. Participants in short-axis group received one-dose
      ultrasound-guided hydrodissection with short-axis approach and long-axis group received
      one-dose ultrasound-guided injection with long-axis approach. No additional treatment after
      injection through the study period. The primary outcome is visual analog scale (VAS) and
      secondary outcomes include Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire (BCTQ),
      cross-sectional area (CSA) of the median nerve, sensory nerve conduction velocity of the
      median nerve, and finger pinch strength. The evaluation was performed pretreatment as well as
      on the 2nd week, 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 6th month after the treatment.
