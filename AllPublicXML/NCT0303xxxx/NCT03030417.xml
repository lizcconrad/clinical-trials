  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      The new drug LMP744 damages DNA. This causes cell death. Researchers want to see if it can
      treat certain kinds of cancer. They want to understand how the drug works and how it affects
      the body.

      Objective:

      To test the safety of LMP744 and find out the dose of the drug that can be safely given to
      humans.

      Eligibility:

      Adults at least 18 years old who have metastatic solid tumors or lymphoma, which have
      progressed after other treatment.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

        -  Vital signs taken

        -  Blood and urine tests

        -  Heart tests

        -  Scans or ultrasound

      Some participants will have a tumor sample taken 2 times. A small piece of tumor is removed
      by a small needle. A scan or ultrasound will guide the process.

      The study will be done in 28-day cycles.

      Each cycle, participants will get the study drug in a vein for 60 minutes once a day for 5
      days.

      For day 1 of cycle 1, participants will be admitted to the clinic and have blood and urine
      taken several times.

      At the beginning of each cycle, participants will have a clinic visit and repeat some
      screening tests. They will also do this twice in the middle of cycle 1 and once in the middle
      of cycle 2.

      After participants stop taking the study drug, they will be followed for 30 days. They may
      give blood samples. They will be contacted by phone to see how they are doing.

      Background:

        -  Indenoisoquinolines are non-camptothecin inhibitors of topoisomerase 1 (top1)
           withimproved characteristics over their predecessors. Indenoisoquinolines have better
           chemical stability, producing stable DNA-top1 cleavage complexes, and exhibit a
           preference for unique DNA cleavage sites, compared with their camptothecin counterparts.

        -  They have demonstrated activity against camptothecin-resistant cell lines and produce
           DNA-protein crosslinks, which are resistant to reversal. They also show less or no
           resistance to cells overexpressing the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, ABCG2,
           and multidrug resistance (MDR-1).

      Primary Objectives:

      -To establish the safety, tolerability and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of LMP744 (NSC
      706744) administered intravenously (IV) daily for 5 days (QD x 5) schedule in patients with
      refractory solid tumors and lymphomas.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of LMP744.

        -  Evaluate the effect of LMP744 on markers of DNA damage ( &gt;=H2AX, pNbs1, pATR, ERCC1,
           RAD51) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and
           pre- and post- treatment tumor biopsies in patients at the expansion cohort.

        -  Assess preliminary antitumor activity of LMP744.

      Eligibility:

      -Adult patients must have histologically documented, relapsed solid tumors that are
      metastatic or unresectable, or lymphoma which had progressed after all FDA-approved therapy,
      therapy associated with overall survival benefit, or for which no standard of care therapy
      exists.

      Study Design:

        -  Cycle 1 and subsequent cycles: Patients will receive LMP744 administered IV QD over 1
           hour plus minus 10 minutes on days 1 5 followed by 23 days without drug (28-day cycle).

        -  PK and PD samples will be collected. Tumor biopsies will be optional during the
           escalation phase and mandatory during the expansion phase and mandatory during the
           expansion phase.

    <description>Indenoisoquinolines, such as LMP744, are potent inhibitors of the enzyme topoisomerase I (Top1). Top1 is necessary for transcription, replication, recombination, and the repair of double-strand DNA breaks. It relaxes the supercoiled DNA by introducing a single-strand break, generating a free strand that rotates around the Top1-bound DNA complex. In the absence of external triggers, Top1-DNA cleavage complexes are generally short lived. Top1 inhibitors are potent anticancer agents because they stabilize the formation of the Top1- DNA cleavage complex in tumor cells, which induces DNA damage, delays DNA repair, and results in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. LMP744 exhibited antitumor activity with lower toxicity than other agents in preclinical studies. Treatment of patients with LMP744 is expected to reduce tumor burden at doses that are well-tolerated.</description>

               8. Patients must have recovered to grade 1 or baseline from adverse events (AEs)
                  and/or toxicity of prior chemotherapy or biologic therapy. They must not have had

                  prior to entering the study. Palliative-intent radiotherapy (30 Gy or less) must
                  be completed at least 2 weeks prior to start of treatment, and may not be to a
                  lesion that is included as measurable disease. Patients must be greater than or
                  equal to 2 weeks since any investigational agent administered as part of a Phase

              11. HIV-positive patients are eligible provided the following criteria are met: CD4
                  count &gt;350/mm3, an undetectable viral load, and not receiving prophylaxis
                  antibiotics.

              12. The effects of LMP744 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason,
                  women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
                  (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry
                  and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or
                  suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study,
                  she should inform her treating physician immediately. Women and men treated or
                  enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to
                  the study, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion
                  of LMP744 administration.

              13. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent
                  document.

              14. Willingness to provide blood and new tumor biopsy samples for research purposes
                  if on the expansion phase of the study.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.

          2. Patients with clinically significant illnesses which would compromise participation in
             the study, including, but not limited to active or uncontrolled infection, immune
             deficiencies, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, uncontrolled diabetes, uncontrolled
             hypertension, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,
             myocardial infarction within the past 6 months, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, or

             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements.

          3. Patients with known brain metastases or carcinomatous meningitis are excluded from
             this clinical trial, with the exception of patients whose brain metastatic disease
             status has remained stable for greater than or equal to 1 month after treatment of the
             brain metastases. Patients on anti-seizure medications or steroid therapy may be
             enrolled at the discretion of the Principal Investigator.

          4. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because LMP744 is an agent with the
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with LMP744, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated.

        INCLUSION OF WOMEN AND MINORITIES:

        Both men and women of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial.
