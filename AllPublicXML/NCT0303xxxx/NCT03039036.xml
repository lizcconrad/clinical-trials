  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Amniotomy (breaking the bag of water) is commonly used in the induction of labor. However,
      the timing is highly variable. The purpose of this study is to determine if first time
      mothers undergoing induction of labor with a Foley catheter experience a decrease in their
      labor time when undergoing early amniotomy (breaking the bag of water within 1 hour of Foley
      catheter removal) than when undergoing delayed amniotomy (breaking the bag of water at least
      4 hours after Foley catheter removal). Other aims include the relationship between timing of
      amniotomy and cesarean section, postpartum hemorrhage, intrauterine infection, neonatal Apgar
      score &lt;7 at 5 minutes, neonatal need for intensive care.

      The investigators hypothesize that induction of labor with Foley catheters followed by early
      amniotomy will result in a decreased duration of labor compared to those who undergo delayed
      amniotomy.

    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial of consenting nulliparous women undergoing induction of labor
      with a Foley catheter seeks to determine whether use of early amniotomy (defined as amniotomy
      within 1 hour of Foley catheter removal) improves obstetrical outcomes when compared with
      delayed amniotomy (defined as amniotomy at least 4 hours following Foley catheter removal).

      This project will include 110 women recruited from the obstetrical service at Prentice
      Women's Hospital. Women will be included if they are at least 37 weeks gestation, have a
      singleton pregnancy, have intact membranes and are undergoing an induction of labor using a
      Foley catheter. Following removal of Foley catheter, women will be assessed for safety of
      amniotomy and if appropriate, randomized to either early amniotomy or delayed amniotomy.

      Women will be randomized with equal probability to the intervention group using block
      randomization stratified by use of Foley catheter alone or Foley catheter-misoprostol use.

      Women in the early amniotomy group will undergo amniotomy within 1 hour of Foley catheter
      removal. Women in the delayed amniotomy group will undergo amniotomy at least 4 hours
      following Foley removal. The remainder of labor management will be at the discretion of each
      woman's obstetric provider.

      Prior to discharge from the hospital, baseline demographic and clinical data will be obtained
      via chart review

    <description>Neonatal Apgar scores consist of measurements of neonatal skin color, respiratory rate, heart rate, muscle tone, and irritability. Each parameter is given a score of 0, 1 or 2 based on standardized parameters. It is standard to perform this on all neonates at 1 minute and 5 minutes of life. Apgar scores are performed and calculated by nursing staff or members of the pediatric team. For this outcome, we are interested in scores less than 7 out of 10 at 5 minutes of life.</description>

    <description>Foley catheter device is commonly used for cervical ripening during labor induction. It is used independently or in combination with pharmacologic augmentation. It is inserted in the cervix and the balloon is then inflated with 60 cc of saline. It is removed when either 1. it falls out under gentile traction during labor checks or 2. it is de-inflated at 12 hours after placement. If at the time of de-inflation at 12 hours, the desired affect has not been achieved, the provider may choose to place another foley balloon or use an alternative method of induction (misoprostol). This is an eligibility criteria and only patients who are undergoing induction with a Foley Catheter will be approached for enrollment.</description>

    <description>Misoprostol is a medication that is commonly used for cervical ripening during labor induction.

Use of this medication will be decided by the provider.</description>
