      This clinical trial studies how well a long-term follow-up works in patients with prostate
      cancer after surgery. Long-term follow-up data may serve as a resource to help ask clinical
      questions, describe health-related quality of life and long-term complications related, and
      facilitate future studies focusing on interventions to improve health status and
      health-related quality of life in prostate cancer survivors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To provide comprehensive long-term follow-up care to prostate cancer survivors at the City
      of Hope who underwent definitive surgical therapy.

      II. To use the information obtained from follow-up of prostate cancer survivors who underwent
      definitive surgical therapy to serve as a resource that will help answer clinical questions,
      generate and test hypotheses, describe the incidence of long-term complications, and
      facilitate future studies focusing on interventions for long-term complications of prostate
      cancer and its therapy.

      III. To use the information gained from follow-up of prostate cancer survivors who underwent
      definitive surgical therapy to describe health-related quality of life (HRQL) concerns and to
      serve as a resource to facilitate future studies focusing on interventions to improve health
      status and HRQL in prostate cancer survivors.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo long-term follow-up and receive a written survivorship care plan including
      comprehensive health evaluation and health education beginning 1 year post surgery.
