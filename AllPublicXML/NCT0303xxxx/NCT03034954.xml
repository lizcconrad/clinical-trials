  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As we age, a number of factors can reduce our cognitive (or thinking) abilities. This study
      will evaluate whether transcranial electrical stimulation (TES), which uses small amounts of
      electricity to modulate brain functioning, can improve cognitive abilities. Here, the effects
      of TES on working memory, learning, and memory, will be evaluated in a group of healthy older
      adults.

    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to investigate the cognitive effects of high definition anodal tDCS
      (HD-tDCS; anode at center electrode) at 3 mA (for 20 minutes) on learning, memory, and
      working memory. Participants will be randomized to active or sham stimulation and will
      complete a series of cognitive tests both during and after stimulation.

      Tolerability and blinding will also be evaluated using standard side effect questionnaires.
