    <textblock>
      This feasibility trial studies how well the Optune device works in treating younger patients
      with recurrent/refractory/progressive supratentorial malignant glioma and ependymoma. The
      TTFields generated by Optune device may inhibit the growth of tumor.

      Primary Objectives:

      I To establish the feasibility of treatment with the Optune device in pediatric patients with
      recurrent/refractory/progressive supratentorial malignant glioma and ependymoma.

      II To describe the Optune device treatment-related toxicities in children with
      recurrent/refractory/progressive supratentorial malignant glioma and ependymoma.

      Secondary Objectives:

      I To estimate the response rate and Event-Free Survival (EFS) as markers of anti-tumor
      activity of the Optune device within the context of a feasibility trial.

      II To assess the association of anti-tumor activity with compliance in Optune device use
      within the context of a small feasibility study.

      III To explore the impact of the Optune device on the children and families undergoing this
      therapy, and to explore the association between demographic (e.g., SES, gender), disease
      (e.g., risk status), treatment, and behavioral variables with health-related quality of life
      (QoL) changes.

      IV To explore the association of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values within the tumor
      and correlate with response to Optune treatment and EFS.

      Outline:

      The Optune will be worn for a minimum of 18 hours a day, with a recommendation of 22
      hours/day for at least 23 days in a 28-day cycle. Cycle 1 includes 7 days training period,
      followed by 28 days treatment (total 35 days). The patients will receive multiple 28-day
      cycles of continuous Optune treatment. In the absence of treatment related serious adverse
      events or disease progression, Optune will continue up to 26 cycles.

      The patients will be followed up for 30 days after the last application of the Optune device.
