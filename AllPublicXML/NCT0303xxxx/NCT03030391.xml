      Background:

      The new drug 18F-PF-06445974 has a little radioactivity. This can be seen by a positron
      emission tomography (PET) scan. The drug helps researchers see a protein, PDE4B, in the
      brain. Looking at PDE4B in the living brain might show how it is involved in psychiatric and
      neurological disorders. One part of the study will look at how the study drug is distributed
      in the brain. Another part will study how brain measures vary.

      Objectives:

      To measure the protein PDE4B in the brain. To test how a new radioactive chemical,
      18F-PF-06445974, is distributed in the body.

      Eligibility:

      Healthy adults ages 18 and older

      Design:

      Participants will have 1-3 visits over a year. Each will be 2-5 hours.

      Women will have a pregnancy test each time.

      Objective:

      Phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4) terminates signal transduction of guanine nucleotidebinding
      proteins (G-protein)-coupled receptors by metabolizing the second messenger 3 &lt;=,5 &lt;=- cyclic
      adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). PDE4 is selective to cAMP over cyclic guanosine
      monophosphate. PDE4 has four isozymes A, B, C, and D and basic studies indicate that type B
      (PDE4B) plays a key role in cognitive function and neuroinflammation. Thus, PDE4B inhibitors
      would be expected to improve cognitive function and have anti-inflammatory effects. Pfizer
      has developed a new PET ligand, 18F-PF-06445974, to selectively image PDE4B; the ligand has
      shown promising results in non-human primates.

      This protocol covers four phases:

        1. Phase 1: whole body imaging of one subject with a low injection activity of 2 mCi to
           confirm that no organ has prominently high uptake of 18F-PF-06445974;

        2. Phase 2: kinetic brain imaging with up to 5 mCi injection to quantify PDE4B in brain
           relative to concurrent measurement of the parent radioligand in arterial plasma;

        3. Phase 3: if 18F-PF-06445974 is successful in Phase 2 in the first couple of subjects, we
           will estimate the radiation-absorbed doses by performing whole body imaging with 5 mCi
           injection;

        4. Phase 4: test-retest analysis of brain binding relative to concurrent measurement of the
           parent radioligand in arterial plasma (5 mCi per scan).

      Study Population:

      Healthy adult female and male volunteers (n=22, ages 18 or older) will undergo brain imaging.
      An additional eight healthy volunteers will undergo whole body dosimetry analysis, for a
      total of 30 healthy volunteers.

      Design:

      For quantification of 18F-PF-06445974, 22 healthy controls will undergo brain PET imaging
      using 18F-PF-06445974 and an arterial line. Some of them will have a test-retest scan. Eight
      additional subjects will have a whole body PET scan for dosimetry. For dosimetry, no arterial
      line will be used.

      Outcome Measures:

      To assess quantitation of PDE4B with 18F-PF-06445974, we will primarily use two outcome
      measures, namely the identifiability and time stability of distribution volume (VT)
      calculated with compartmental modeling. In the test-retest study, we will calculate the
      retest

      variability. We will assess whole-body biodistribution and dosimetry of 18F-PF-06445974 by
      calculating doses to organs and effective dose to the body.
