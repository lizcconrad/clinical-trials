    <textblock>
      This is a pilot biomarker study designed to compare frequencies of mutations between groups
      of malignant, benign and normal tissue or blood of patients with parathyroid disease and
      identify the potential genes showing molecular aberrations as other types of cancer.

      The purpose of this study is dual-fold:

        1. To determine the differences in clinical behavior and immunohistochemical (IHC)
           biomarkers between parathyroid carcinoma (PC), atypical neoplasm (AN) and parathyroid
           adenoma (PA). This will allow to use these markers as a diagnostic and screening tool
           when evaluating parathyroid tumors.

        2. To determine which potential genes can be used in patients with parathyroid tumors for
           diagnostic purposes. Genomic analysis of tumor samples will be performed to identify
           molecular aberrations for which novel targeted therapies have been recently developed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient cohort for this study consists of all patients within the prospectively
             maintained parathyroid database within the Department of Surgical Oncology at the
             University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) or from collaborating sites,
             with tissue or blood available from 1968-2015, previously consented for the use of the
             tissue for research purposes (via Protocols LAB 08-0034, PA11-0695 and LAB03-0320 or
             the appropriate external mechanism for collaborating sites).

          2. All patients with a known diagnoses of PHPT operated/treated in the Department of
             Surgical Oncology of MDACC or at a collaborating site. Patients that have provided
             consent for the use of the tissue or blood for research purposes will then be
             considered for our study (via Protocol LAB03-0320 and LAB 08-0034 or the appropriate
             external mechanism for collaborating sites).

          3. All consented patients with known diagnoses of PHPT with a histopathological diagnosis
             of: parathyroid carcinoma, atypical parathyroid neoplasm or parathyroid adenoma. There
             will be no restrictions on age, gender, or ethnicity

          4. Selected patients obtained through outside collaboration who meet the selection
             criteria for tissue availability and diagnostic suitability for inclusion in the study
             (See Criteria 3 for diagnostic criteria).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        1. Patients without tissue available for analysis.
