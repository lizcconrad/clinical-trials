  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The infantile brain has to pass essential, mayor steps in the first 36 months of life. During
      that period of development it is particularly vulnerable to toxic, exogenic influences. This
      study wants to review the long-term effects of children who were exposed to anesthesia in the
      first three years of their life. Therefore the investigators will examine children at age of
      4-10 that were exposed to anesthesia and compare their neurocognitive capacity to children
      who did not have any exposure to anesthesia. The investigators plan on measuring the
      intelligence quotient using standardized tests which will be performed by a trained
      psychologist. In addition there will be a questionnaire concerning behavioral characteristics
      and educational development which is filled by the parents. The exposed children will be
      recruited from our preexisting database, the control group will be recruited from
      practitioners and the pediatric walk-in-clinic.
