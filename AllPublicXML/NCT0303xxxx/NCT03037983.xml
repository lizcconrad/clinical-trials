    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether repetitive transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (rTMS) is effective in remediating cognitive deficits while also improving
      functionality in Veterans with schizophrenia.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High-frequency, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), the dysfunctional brain region most implicated in cognitive
      deficits in schizophrenia, has recently been shown to improve cognition in non-Veteran
      samples with schizophrenia. The investigators' goal is to confirm the efficacy of this
      treatment modality to remediate cognitive deficits and improve functionality in Veterans with
      schizophrenia, as well as to gain a better understanding of the neural mechanisms responsible
      for cognitive deficits and their remediation. The investigators propose conducting a
      small-scale study to generate pilot data supporting the feasibility of conducting rTMS with
      Veterans and the effectiveness of rTMS in this population. In addition, the investigators
      will conduct neurophysiologic experiments to test whether certain neural maker of abnormal
      brain function improves with rTMS.

    <measure>Change in Working Memory performance accuracy</measure>
    <time_frame>before treatment and after 6-week treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in scores for Working Memory performance accuracy will serve as dependent measure for testing the hypothesis that rTMS improves cognition . The hypothesis will be supported if the investigators find greater WM-difference in the active compared to the sham-rTMS-treated groups as revealed by t-tests and two-sided tests at an alpha level of 0.05.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Gamma oscillation</measure>
    <time_frame>before treatment and after 6-week treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will also be conducting electroencephalography (EEG) to measure gamma oscillation before and after rTMS. This will enable us to correlate changes in this measure with changes in cognitive performance using Pearson's bivariate correlation. A positive correlation between these variables will support the hypothesis that rTMS improves cognition by increasing gamma oscillations. The investigators will explore the possibility that pre-treatment gamma predicts rTMS responsiveness. The investigators will evaluate this possibility by conducting a median split analysis in which subjects will be binned by their baseline gamma levels. The investigators predict that those in the lower half of the distribution will show higher gamma and WM.</description>

    <measure>Change in Global Functioning score</measure>
    <time_frame>before treatment and after 6-week treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in scores Global Functioning ( GF) will serve as dependent measure for testing the hypothesis that rTMS improves functioning. The hypothesis will be supported if the investigators find greater GF-difference in the active compared to the sham-rTMS-treated groups as revealed by t-tests and two-sided tests at an alpha level of 0.05.</description>

    <description>rTMS is a non-invasive procedure, in which the administration of a transient magnetic field induces electrical currents in specific, targeted brain regions. The intervention will be administered in 20 sessions lasting 50 minutes each over the course of 2-6 weeks. Up to two sessions may be scheduled per day with a one-hour interval in-between.</description>
