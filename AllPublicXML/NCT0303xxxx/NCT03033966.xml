  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral hypoperfusion and hypoxia are the major determinants of neurological outcomes
      following acute brain injury as proved in Traumatic Brain Injury/Sub Arachnoid Haemhorrhage
      literature. How the brain injury affects cerebral oxygenation in patients with CVT is not
      currently known. Some of the factors that can affect cerebral oxygenation in patients with
      CVT are Hemoglobin, PO2, PCO2, Cerebral Perfusion Pressure (or MAP) and change in
      Intracranial Pressure after Decompressive Craniectomy. This study is designed to study how
      these factors affect cerebral oxygenation and impact of Decompressive Craniectomy on the
      cerebral oxygenation.
