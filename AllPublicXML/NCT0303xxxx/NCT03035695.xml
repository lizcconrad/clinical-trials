      The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety to use external haemostatic
      between Axiostat® (Chitosan haemostatic dressing) and conventional cotton gauze dressing as a
      pre hospital acute hemorrhagic control in trauma in ambulance settings.

      Abstract:

      Accidents and trauma comprise leading causes of death and disability throughout the world. In
      developing countries such as India, where emergency trauma care is still in its infancy, it
      accounts for almost 10% deaths every year. Lack of adequate pre-hospital care and
      uncontrolled bleeding from wound site are stated to be the prominent reasons for such deaths.

      In this study, a novel chitosan-based haemostatic dressing (Axiostat®, Axio Biosolutions,
      India) was investigated as an initial hemorrhage controlling device in pre-hospital scenario.
      The study was conducted with the help of 35 Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs).

      A total of 133 patients with scalp wound injury were identified for the study, of which 104
      patients meeting the selection criteria were included in the study. The selected patients
      were randomly assigned into two groups, the test group consisting of 47 subjects received
      Axiostat® treatment; whereas, 57 subjects in the control group were treated with a
      conventional cotton-gauze dressing. All subjects needed suturing as the subjects included in
      the study were brought with open scalp wounds.

      The Axiostat® showed a superior efficacy in controlling bleeding in comparison to the cotton
      gauze. The average time for haemostasis with cotton gauze dressing was about 18.56 ± 5.04
      minutes; while with Axiostat® haemostasis was achieved in less than 5 minutes (4.68 ± 1.04
      min).

      On analyzing this study, it was evident that Axiostat® dressing enables early haemostasis
      which prevents much blood loss and the wound becomes very clean on removal of dressing for
      later wound suturing when compared to normal cotton gauze.

      These findings demonstrated the potential of Axiostat® as a first-line intervention in
      controlling acute hemorrhage in the pre-hospital scenarios.

    <description>Device: Axiostat® Size: 8 x 5 cm Axiostat® is a sterile, non-absorbable haemostatic dressing intended to control profuse bleeding within minutes of application by providing an active mechanical barrier to the wound site.
Mechanism of action is such that Axiostat® is an extremely positive dressing that becomes very sticky in the presence of negatively charged blood and thus seals the wound area.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years.

          -  Patient and/or patient's legal representative and/or impartial witness have been
             informed of the nature of the study and agree to its provisions and have provided
             written informed consent as approved by the IEC of MIMS, Kerala, India.

          -  Patients with bleeding wounds over scalp which can due to any injury.

          -  The wounds must be bleeding at the time of baseline assessment.

          -  The targeted wound size should be such that it should be covered by single available
             size of the study device as per the instructions for use.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The exclusion criteria for the study involved prior diagnosis of disease or medical
             condition affecting the ability of blood to clot (e.g., hemophilia).

          -  A non-survivable injury as per the investigators' discretion.

          -  Patients who in the opinion of the investigator may not complete the study for any
             reason, e.g. Patients requiring immediate suturing. Grossly infected wounds that may
             reasonably be expected to require multiple debridement procedures prior to clearance
             of bacteria and non-viable tissue from the wound, in case of old wound.

          -  Patient is currently participating in an investigational drug or device study that has
             not yet completed its primary endpoint or interferes with procedure and assessments in
             this trial.
