    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a novel
      medical food utilizing a nutritional strain of yeast for management of Iron Deficiency
      Anemia.

      The investigational product is a medical food and is the result of discoveries following
      extensive research on two preclinical models carried out by a team of researchers at Penn
      State University. This study will utilize the standard &quot;3+3&quot; rule-based dose-escalation
      schemes, which use predetermined dose levels and cohorts of three patients. The total time
      commitment for each subject is approximately three months.

    <intervention_model_description>Individuals will receive 300 mg capsules of the novel medical food. The iron content of these capsules is 7.4mg. Our initial dose is set at 22.2 mg of iron. This dose was chosen as the initial starting dose because it is within the range of the RDA for iron for adult women (18mg). Thus this dose is considered the minimum that would be utilized in any setting for maintenance of a healthy iron status. The dosing increases to a maximum of 88.8mg of iron per day which is significantly below the standard amount of iron (165-195mg per day) recommended for an iron deficient individual or the amount of iron given intravenously (1000 mg) for some iron deficient conditions. As mentioned, the total element iron given a patient treated with FAS is up to 190mg of iron. Assuming a 10% absorption rate these patients get 19mg of iron. So if our goal is approximately 19mg of iron absorbed per day and we assume a 50% absorption rate then our target dose is 6-9 capsules per day (44.4-66.6 mg iron).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>This medical food takes advantage of the stability and high level of solubility of the human H-ferritin protein to be absorbed by the body as an iron source; indeed H-ferritin is enriched in breast milk as the mechanism for transferring iron from mother to infants. Once the ferritin has been absorbed from the gut, uptake into each organ is regulated by a specific extracellular receptor pathway to deliver iron in the body's preferred bioavailable form.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Hemoglobin, (Hgb) 7-10 g/dL; transferrin saturation &lt;20%; and serum ferritin &lt;20ng/mL

        Exclusion Criteria:

             are not willing to use an acceptable form of contraception (tubal ligation or
             otherwise be incapable of pregnancy, hormonal contraceptives, spermicide plus barrier

             not containing iron, such as the multivitamin Centrum Silver. No washout period is
             necessary since it will be apparent from the ongoing anemia that any current
             supplements are ineffective.

          -  Current anemia not attributed to immune deficiency, (ID) (e.g. other microcytic anemia
             or hemolytic, macrocytic, sideroblastic or myelosuppression or chemotherapy or
             radiotherapy induced anemia).

          -  Active malignancy within 1 year. Basal or squamous cell skin cancer is not
             exclusionary.

          -  Aspartate Aminotransferase, (AST) or Alanine Aminotransferase, (ALT) at screening
             greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal.

          -  Known positive hepatitis B with evidence of active hepatitis.

          -  Known positive HIV-1/HIV-2 antibodies (anti-HIV).

          -  Patient has a current diagnosis of asthma and is actively using an anti-asthmatic
             therapy.

          -  Received an investigational drug within 30 days of screening.

          -  Hemochromatosis or other iron storage disorders.

          -  Unregulated hypertension

          -  Chronic kidney disease.

          -  Chronic inflammatory condition including but not limited to Lupus and Rheumatoid
             Arthritis.

          -  Significant cardiovascular disease, including but not limited to myocardial infarction
             or unstable angina within 6 months prior to study inclusion or current history of New
             York Heart Association, (NYHA) Class III or IV congestive heart failure.

          -  Smoking

          -  Irritable Bowel Syndrome

          -  Any other laboratory abnormality, medical condition or psychiatric disorder which in
             the opinion of the investigator puts the subject's disease management at risk or may
             result in the subject being unable to comply with study requirements.

          -  Breastfeeding planned on or after enrolling in the study.

          -  Known allergy to yeast
