      EPICS-8: Reasons for Emergency Department utilization by patients with non-urgent conditions:

      Emergency Departments (EDs) are an important interface between primary and secondary health
      care sectors in Germany. The number of outpatient visits in the ED´s is still increasing. The
      reasons for ED utilization by patients with non-urgent conditions are nearly unknown in
      Germany and will be investigated in this project.

      EPICS-8: Reasons for Emergency Department utilization by patients with non-urgent conditions:

      Emergency Departments (EDs) are an important interface between primary and the secondary
      health care system in Germany. The number of outpatient visits in the ED´s is still
      increasing. The reasons for ED utilization by patients with non-urgent conditions are nearly
      unknown in Germany and will be explored in this project.

      EPICS-8 is a pilot study to establish a research structure for the linkage of ED-data with
      data of the primary health care sector. Data linkage will be conducted for patients with the
      Manchester Triage System categories blue, green and yellow. A secondary aim of the EPICS-8
      study is to develop a valid questionnaire for the assessment of reasons for ED utilization by
      non-urgent patients.

      Primary objective:

      Establishing of a research structure for the linkage of inhospital-data with data from the
      primary health care System. Records of 5,000 patients who attended one of the two EDs at the
      Charité University Medicine Berlin will be linked to Primary health care data.

      Secondary objectives:

        1. Development and testing of a questionaire for the identification of reasons for
           emergency department utilization by patients with non-urgent conditions (n=100)

        2. Characterization and quantification of non-urgent emergencies

        3. Explorative analysis of patient pathways and influencing factors for ED-visits with
           non-urgent conditions.
