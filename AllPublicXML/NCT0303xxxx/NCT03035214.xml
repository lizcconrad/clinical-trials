  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most preterm babies require supplemental oxygen for a variable period of time, up to several
      weeks or months after birth. The aim of oxygen therapy is to achieve adequate oxygen supply
      to the tissues without causing oxygen toxicity and oxidative stress. The current routine
      monitoring relies on oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry without identifying the underlying
      pathology, as lung parenchyma and pulmonary vascular disease can be contributed in
      pathophysiology at variable degrees.

      Steroids usage for prevention of Bronchopulmonary dysplasia also has been shown to have
      adverse neurodevelopmental outcome. Available data are conflicting and inconclusive;
      clinicians must use their own clinical judgment to balance the adverse effects of
      Bronchopulmonary dysplasia with the potential adverse effects of treatments for each
      individual patient. Very low birth weight infants who remain on mechanical ventilation after
      1 to 2 weeks of age are at very high risk of developing Bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

      When considering corticosteroid therapy for such an infant, clinicians might conclude that
      the risks of a short course of glucocorticoid therapy to prevent Bronchopulmonary dysplasia
      are warranted.

      This is a prospective study. 30 Preterm infants admitted to neonatal intensive care units of
      Maadi, Ghamra military hospitals, and Ain Shams University hospitals, will be prospectively
      enrolled within 24 hours after birth. Daily evaluation of oxygen histograms with measurement
      of the cumulative time of oxygen saturations below 80%, (risk of hypoxemia and potential
      tissue hypoxia), and arterial oxygen saturations Sao2 above 95% (potential risk of hyperoxia
      and increased oxidative stress). Evaluation window will be on a weekly basis as long as the
      infant is on oxygen support and by applying oxygen tolerance test. The treating clinical team
      will be blinded to all results of Oxygen tolerance test.

    <description>Failure of lung tolerance to oxygen reduction will be defined as oxygen saturation 80 to 87% for 5 minutes, or &lt;80% for 1 minute, then inspired oxygen will be increased back to the base line. This will be considered as an early predictor of evolving bronchopulmonary dysplasia. If there is no hypoventilation, dexamethasone will be given 0.25 mg/ kg/ d divided twice for 5 days intravenous.</description>

    <description>Is to describe the use of integrated assessment of respiratory physiology using Targeted Neonatal Echocardiography, assessment of optimal Functional Residual Capacity and the tolerance of lung oxygen uptake at different oxygen levels, and hence early prediction of Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia and the underlying pathophysiology by periodic application of the oxygen tolerance test; which may help early targeted treatment of this common disease.</description>
