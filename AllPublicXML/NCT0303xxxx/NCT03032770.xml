    <textblock>
      Placenta accreta is a substantially life threatening condition and one of the causes of
      maternal morbidity and mortality in the world. According to study done in United Kingdom, The
      estimated incidence of placenta accreta/increta/percreta was 1.7 per 10,000 maternities
      overall and 577 per 10,000 in women with both a previous cesarean delivery and placenta
      previa. in a tertiary south Italian center, The incidence increased from 0.12% during the
      1970s, to 0.31% during the 2000s.While in United States of America, the prevalence of
      placenta accreta was 3.7 per 1000 deliveries.
