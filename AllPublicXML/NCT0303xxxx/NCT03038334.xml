  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to examine the possible effect of supplementing Magnesium sulfate on patients
      with Alzheimer Disease (AD) in controlling or reducing the amount of amyloid present in the
      brain, and increasing cognitive ability in individuals that have amyloid deposits.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent findings suggest magnesium may be effective in ameliorating symptoms in an Alzheimer's
      disease-like pathological progression by reducing AÎ²-plaque, thus preventing synapse loss and
      memory decline in transgenic mice. Common forms include magnesium sulfate.

      As a nutritional adjunct in hyperalimentation, the precise mechanism of action for magnesium
      is uncertain. Predominant deficiency effects are neurological, e.g., muscle irritability,
      clonic twitching and tremors. Hypocalcemia and hypokalemia often follow low serum levels of
      magnesium. While there are large stores of magnesium present intracellularly and in the bones
      of adults, these stores often are not mobilized sufficiently to maintain plasma levels.
      Parenteral magnesium therapy repairs the plasma deficit and causes deficiency symptoms and
      signs to cease.

      To provide a comprehensive clinical evaluation of the effects of Magnesium sulfate in AD
      patients, this study is designed to assess the impact of magnesium sulfate on amyloid plaque
      to generate valuable data on clinical utility for the use of diagnostic algorithms and
      foundation for the development of possible treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Outpatients with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.

          -  Exhibiting an onset and progression of cognitive dysfunction during at least 3 months
             prior to the screening period.

          -  Subject or representative is willing to sign the consent for prior to enrollment into
             the study and to participate in all aspects of the study. Prospective subject must
             give verbal assent if unable to sign written consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with neurodegenerative diseases other than Alzheimer's disease.

          -  Patients with cognitive dysfunction due to cerebral damage resulting from a lack of
             oxygen, a brain injury, etc.

          -  Patients with clinically significant cardiovascular disease.

          -  Patients with history of clinically-evident stroke.

          -  Patients with history of cancer in the last 5 years.

          -  Patients with clinically-significant systemic illness that may affect safety or
             completion of the study.

          -  Currently taking any medications that are known to interact with magnesium.

          -  Currently taking antibiotics as the study product may reduce the absorption of
             antibiotics. A washout period of 2 weeks is allowed.
