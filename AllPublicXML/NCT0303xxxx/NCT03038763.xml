  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to determine the prevalence of hepatitis C in the adult children of
      female baby boomers. During the years baby boomers were becoming pregnant, hepatitis C
      testing was either not available or was not standard of care. Because of this, participants'
      children may be unaware of participants' risk of hepatitis C.

        between 1945-1965 who have or have had hepatitis C

        Investigators will only be recruiting subjects who are black or white as hepatitis C is
        most common in these two populations. Using these populations maximizes the
        generalizability of our results. HCV is not only significantly less common among Asian
        women and women of other races, but these women also represent a minority of the patient
        population at Penn.
