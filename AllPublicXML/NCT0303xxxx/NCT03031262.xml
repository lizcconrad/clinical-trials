    <textblock>
      In this open-label, randomized, prospective clinical trial, CBF acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
      patients who have reached CR are randomised into two groups and receive high-dose cytarabine
      (HDAC) or high-dose cytarabine plus chidamide.The safety and efficacy of chidamide is
      evaluated.

      In this open-label, randomized, prospective clinical trial, CBF AML(including AML1-ETO or
      CBF-MYH11 mutated patients) patients who have reached CR are randomised into two groups and
      receive HDAC or high dose of cytarabine plus chidamide.

      In experimental group, patients receive cytarabine at a dose of 3g/㎡/d on the first, third
      and fifth day and chidamide at a dose of 20mg/d twice a week for 3 months.Patients in control
      group only receive cytarabine at the same dose.

      The safety and efficacy of chidamide is evaluated. The primary outcome is relapse-free
      survival rate after treatment.
