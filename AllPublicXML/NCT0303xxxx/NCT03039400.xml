  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity is a crucial component to wellness and is associated with multiple health
      benefits. Persons with MS may find it challenging to participate in regular physical activity
      or exercise, which is activity done to improve health and/or fitness. This research will test
      an innovative web-based intervention to help persons with moderate-to-severe disability
      manage their condition through a maintenance exercise program with specialized
      physiotherapist guidance and support. The researchers will examine adherence to the web-based
      physiotherapy program compared to standard physiotherapy care. Forty-five people with MS will
      be randomly assigned to the web group or standard care group at a rate of 2:1. Participants
      in the web group will receive supported and individualized web-based physiotherapy.
      Participants in the standard care group will receive a written exercise program. Regular
      participation (adherence) in the exercise programs will be evaluated in both groups over six
      months. The research will also examine participant satisfaction with the programs, safety, MS
      symptoms, and physical function. A web-based approach may be widely accessible to persons
      with MS in their own homes and could support long-term participation in physical activity
      important to wellness.

    <description>Those in the web-based physio group will have an individual exercise program set up by a treating physiotherapist on webbasedphysio.com after an initial face-to-face assessment. They will be encouraged to undertake their exercise program at least twice per week and diarize their work. Participants will receive a weekly phone call from their treating physiotherapist for the first two weeks. The treating physiotherapist will review the exercise diary of each participant every two weeks, and remotely alter the participant's exercise program as appropriate, by changing exercises, level of difficulty or number of repetitions.</description>

    <description>Those in the standard care group will have their exercise program explained to them at an initial face-to-face assessment with a treating physiotherapist as per usual care. They will receive a written, home-based exercise program. Participants in the usual care group will also be encouraged to undertake their exercise program at least twice per week, and will be asked to keep an exercise diary, in paper format. Participants in the usual care group will also receive a weekly phone call from the physiotherapist for the first two weeks to check on progress.</description>
