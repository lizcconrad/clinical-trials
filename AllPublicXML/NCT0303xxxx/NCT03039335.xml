  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to prospectively assess whether there is any interval between
      first symptom and initial diagnosis that is experienced by patients with newly diagnosed
      alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) and then to assess whether this diagnostic interval is
      associated with worsened clinical status at the time of initial diagnosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study protocol proposes to assess participants' clinical status based on the results of
      spirometry tests that are performed by the patient's managing physician as a routine part of
      clinical care of individuals with AATD within +/- 6 months of the initial diagnosis,
      subjects' St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) at the time of initial diagnosis, and
      their COPD Assessment Test (CAT) result at the time of initial diagnosis of AATD (hereafter
      called &quot;time zero&quot; or T0 defined as the day on which the patient's test shows AATD from the
      blood work submitted for testing to Biocerna LLC by the patients' managing physicians as part
      of their routine clinical management). After offering verbal consent, subjects will complete
      a survey that assesses various clinical domains, including demographic features, how was AATD
      ascertained, initial symptom ascribable to AATD, the number of healthcare providers (and
      specific types of providers) seen before initial diagnosis, and clinical status at T0 or
      within a defined, relatively narrow temporal window (+/- 6 months) of T0. As in prior
      studies, the diagnostic interval will be defined as the duration between self-reported
      initial symptom of AATD (usually dyspnea in &gt; 80% of cases3) and initial confirmed diagnosis
      of AATD (T0).
