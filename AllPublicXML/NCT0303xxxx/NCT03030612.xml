      The purpose of this Phase I/II study is to investigate the safety and tolerability (Phase I)
      and the efficacy/clinical benefits (Phase II, proof-of-concept) of ARGX-110 in combination
      with standard doses of azacytidine (AZA) in subjects with previously untreated acute myeloid
      leukemia (AML) or high risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who are eligible for AZA
      treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed ICF indicating an understanding of the purposes, risks, and procedures required
             for the study and willingness and ability to participate in the study

          2. AML or high risk MDS (refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation; RAEB T)
             (according to 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) classification definition of ≥ 20%
             blasts) Note: Subjects can be rescreened if excluded based on the blast count
             previously

          3. Age ≥ 18 years

          4. Expected life expectancy ≥ 3 months, at the discretion of the investigator

          5. ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior or concurrent malignancy, except for the following:

               -  adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, or

               -  any other cancer from which the subject has been disease-free for more than 2
                  years

          2. previous AML cancer treatment (with the exception of hydroxyurea/Litalir® for
             leukocyte control which should be discontinued by the first day of AZA, local
             radiation therapy, therapy for basal cell carcinoma of the skin)

          3. Treatment with any investigational product within 4 weeks before the first
             administration of ARGX-110

          4. Abnormal organ function defined as follows (any single parameter to fulfill
             condition):

               -  aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt; 3 x
                  upper limit of normal (ULN); or in case of liver infiltration by AML, AST and/or
                  ALT &gt; 5 x ULN

               -  Alkaline phosphatase (AP) &gt; 2.5 x ULN, or in case of liver infiltration by AML,
                  AP &gt; 5 x ULN

               -  Serum (total) bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x ULN; or in case of liver infiltration by AML,
                  serum (total) bilirubin &gt; 5 x ULN

               -  Serum creatinine &gt; 2.5 x ULN or GFR (MDRD) of &lt; 40 mL/min for subjects with
                  creatinine levels above the normal limit.

          5. Use of immune-suppressive agents for the past 4 weeks before the first administration
             of ARGX-110 on Day -14. For regular use of systemic corticosteroids, subjects may only
             be included after stepwise discontinuation to be free of steroids for a minimum of 5
             days before the first administration of ARGX-110

          6. Any known active or chronic infection, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
