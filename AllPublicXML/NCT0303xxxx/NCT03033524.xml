      Study Design - Multicenter, open-label, 3 arms, stepwise, phase Ⅱa clinical trial

      Study objective:

        1. Primary - To evaluate the safety of TTAC-0001 in patients with recurrent glioblastoma.

        2. Secondary - To determine the efficacy of TTAC-0001 in patients with recurrent
           glioblastoma.

        3. Exploratory

             -  To evaluate pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of TTAC-0001 in patients with recurrent
                glioblastoma

             -  To evaluate pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters by clinical biomarker test

      Study Methodology

      Patients will be sequentially enrolled from the 1st arm. An enrollment criterion to the next
      arm is defined as no patients in the previous treatment arm showing grade ≥3 of hemangioma or
      other Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT). A safety review committee (SRC) will convene to
      determine the patient's safety with a decision on enrollment into the next arm or change in
      dosing frequency of study drug in the above case.

      A patient who is withdrawn from the study before the completion of the 1st cycle can be
      replaced with another patient. Patients will be treated for up to 1 year, unless a cause for
      termination occurs, such as progression of disease (PD) or the withdrawal of consent.
