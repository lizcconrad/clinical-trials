  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research clinical trial of double-blind, stratified randomized, parallel group,
      two-centre study. It will be conducted in a total of 250~300 male and female subjects from
      the Department of Psychiatry at National Cheng Kung University Hospital. Eligible subjects
      will be psychiatric out- and in-patients, aged between 18~65 years old, who have psychiatric
      evaluation with clinically suspected of having bipolar II disorder and fulfill the inclusion
      and exclusion criteria. The add-on double-blind study treatment with dextromethorphan/place
      will commence at randomization for while patients continue open-label valproate. Subjects
      will be enrolled for 12 weeks double-blind add-on treatment and randomly assigned to (1) 30mg
      dextromethorphan+valproate, (2) 5mg memantine+valproate, (3)
      dextromethorphan+memantine+valproate or (4) placebo+valproate. Concomitant benzodiazepine
      medication (preferably up to 8mg lorazepam) may be used for daytime sedation, agitation or
      insomnia during the study. For the consideration of the less influence to immune-system,
      resperidone 1-3mg/daily and fluoxetine maximum 20mg/daily will be chose. We will measure the
      treatment response and side effect to clarify the curative effect of DM and memantine add-on
      therapy to valproate in the treatment of bipolar disorders. This study is being performed to
      investigate the possibly significant beneficial effects on the subtypes of bipolar disorders
      psychopathology.
