    <textblock>
      The estimated annual cost of dementia in Canada is $15 billion, with a projected cumulative
      economic burden of $800 billion by 2038. Effective prevention of dementia at a population
      level will need to include lifestyle factors such as promoting higher levels of physical
      activity. Physical inactivity is a modifiable risk factor for Alzheimer disease (AD) and
      cognitive decline, but the mechanisms by which physical activity exerts its protective effect
      on the brain remain unknown. Motivated by the need to develop strategies to prevent and treat
      AD and related dementias (ADRD), the investigators' overall research goal is to discover why
      the aging brain develops ADRD. To achieve this goal the investigators adopt a translational
      physiology approach (i.e., study of physiology from molecule/cell to population) to
      investigate how exercise improves cognitive performance, and the underlying mechanisms by
      which exercise prevents and/or slows down age-related declines in brain health and cognition.
      This approach allows the investigators to determine how physiological function is related to
      ADRD, with important implications for health. The investigators' prior work demonstrated a
      significant relationship between fitness, vascular regulation and cognition in older adults
      free of overt disease. These findings have implications for vascular cognitive impairment and
      ADRD, in which hypoperfusion and dysregulation of cerebral blood flow are thought to be
      important pathophysiological factors. The investigators' central hypothesis is that regular
      aerobic exercise mitigates age-related decreases in vascular function and cerebrovascular
      reserve, which in turn benefits cognition. Work by the investigators and others has provided
      the necessary data justifying a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the role of exercise
      in the prevention of ADRD.

      The investigators are well equipped to undertake this trial; the investigators have dedicated
      institutional support and necessary expertise in vascular regulation, cognition, aging,
      neuroimaging and genetics.

      The overall objective of this proposal is to test an exercise intervention for secondary
      prevention of ADRD in adults between 50 and 80 years old who are at increased risk for ADRD
      (with memory impairment symptoms but without dementia). The rationale for this trial is the
      urgent need for dementia prevention: an exercise intervention, which harnesses a
      translational physiology framework, holds such promise. The investigators will conduct this
      trial to determine the effects of aerobic exercise on the development of age-associated
      cognitive decline and dementia. The exercise intervention is designed with input from Alberta
      Health Services, the universal healthcare provider for Albertans, so that the intervention
      can be readily adopted into clinical practice if this trial is successful. The trial will
      address three specific aims.

      SPECIFIC AIM 1: Determine the independent effect of exercise on cognitive performance in
      previously inactive older adults at increased risk of ADRD. The investigators hypothesize
      that participants randomized to our six-month aerobic exercise intervention will perform
      better on cognitive tests, compared to control participants randomized to a stretching-toning
      exercise group.

      SPECIFIC AIM 2: Determine underlying biological mechanisms that influence cognitive
      performance after exercise training. The investigators hypothesize that exercise improves
      cognition due to changes at molecular/cellular (biomarkers), vascular (cerebral blood flow,
      cerebrovascular reserve), anatomical and functional (neuroimaging), and behavioural (sleep
      quality) levels. Further, the investigators hypothesize that ADRD-specific genetic risk
      scores, reflective of targeted genetic variants, moderate exercise-related cognitive and
      brain outcomes.

      SPECIFIC AIM 3: Determine the extent to which changes in cognition, resting cerebral blood
      flow and cerebrovascular reserve persist 12 months after participants complete a 6-month
      exercise training intervention. The investigators hypothesize that the effects of improved
      aerobic fitness will be maintained over time as a function of persistent lifestyle changes
      and behavioural support programs. This trial will provide evidence needed to make clinical
      recommendations for exercise programs in adults at risk for ADRD, with the goal of preventing
      dementia. Given the investigators' extensive stakeholder input, this intervention will be
      easily translated to other jurisdictions. This research into the mechanisms of effect for
      exercise will identify patient subgroups most likely to benefit, surrogate outcome markers
      for use in future trials to refine intervention dose/duration, and new therapeutic targets
      for future interventions.

    <description>Participants will take part in a supervised 6-month-long aerobic (walk/jog) training program held 3 days/week. Each session will include a 5-min warm-up, 20-40 min of aerobic exercise (walking, jogging), 5-min cool-down, and stretching. Exercise prescriptions will follow current principles and guidelines established by ACSM/AHA, including sufficient warm-up, cool-down, and ongoing provision of safety precautions/exercise tips. As participants progress, the duration of aerobic exercise will increase from 20 (month 1) to 30 (months 2-3) and 40 min (months 4-6), with proportional increases to warm-up and cool-down periods. Exercise intensity will be based on individual maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max), measured at baseline. Intensity will build from 30-45% (months 1-3) to mitigate the risk of injury and will progress to 60-70% (months 4-6) heart rate reserve (HRR).</description>
