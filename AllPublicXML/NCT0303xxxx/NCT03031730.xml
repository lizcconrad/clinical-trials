    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of MDM2 inhibitor AMG-232 when
      given together with carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone in treating patient with
      multiple myeloma that has come back of has not responded to previous treatment. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as MDM2 inhibitor AMG-232, carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone,
      work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by
      stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate safety and tolerability of MDM2 inhibitor AMG-232 (AMG-232) in combination with
      carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (KRd). (Part A) II. Determine the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of AMG-232 in combination with
      carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (KRd). (Part A) III. Confirm the safety and
      tolerability of AMG 232 in combination with carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone
      (KRd) at MTD/tentative RP2D in a goal of 10 subjects with relapsed and/or refractory myeloma.
      (Part B)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate progressive disease (PD) effects of AMG-232 through serum MIC-1 levels. (Part A)
      II. Assess AMG-232 exposure-response relationships (PD, toxicity, and efficacy). (Part A)
      III. Evaluate the overall response rate of AMG 232 in combination with carfilzomib,
      lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (KRd) in relapsed/refractory myeloma by International Myeloma
      Working Group (IMWG) criteria. (Part B) IV. Evaluate PD effects of AMG 232 through serum
      MIC-1 levels. (Part B) V. Assess AMG 232 exposure-response relationships (PD, toxicity, and
      efficacy). (Part B)

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity of AMG-232 in combination with carfilzomib,
      lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (KRd) in relapsed/refractory myeloma by International Myeloma
      Working Group (IMWG) criteria. (Part A) II. Evaluate ribonucleic acid (RNA) expression levels
      of relevant genes in the TP53 pathway that may predict response to therapy using pre- and
      post-treatment bone marrow biopsies. (Part A) III. Evaluate ribonucleic acid (RNA) expression
      levels of relevant genes in the TP53 pathway that may predict response to therapy using pre-
      and post-treatment bone marrow biopsies. (Part B)

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of MDM2 inhibitor AMG-232.

      Patients receive MDM2 inhibitor AMG-232 orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-7, carfilzomib
      intravenously (IV) over 10-30 minutes on days 1-2, 8-9, and 15-16 of courses 1-12 and on days
      1-2 and 15-16 of courses 13-18, lenalidomide PO on days 1-21, and dexamethasone PO or IV on
      days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unexpected toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.

    <description>Safety parameters will include severe adverse events, treatment-emergent adverse events, physical examination findings (including Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status), vital sign measurements, and standard clinical laboratory parameters (serum chemistry, hematology, urinalysis).

    <measure>Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) assessed by NCI CTCAE version 5.0</measure>

    <description>A TEAE is defined as an adverse event that emerges during the treatment period (from first dose date till 30 [+/- 5] days after the last dosing date), having been absent at pre-treatment; or reemerges during treatment, having been present at baseline but stopped prior to treatment; or worsens in severity after starting treatment relative to the pre-treatment state, when the adverse event is continuous. The number and percentage of subjects reporting TEAEs will be tabulated by the worst NCI-CTCAE grade, system organ class, and preferred term. Similarly, the number and percentage of subjects reporting treatment-emergent severe adverse event (SAE)s will be tabulated, as well as TEAEs/SAEs considered related to treatment.</description>

             considered irreversible [defined as having been present and stable for &gt; 6 months],
             such as grade 2 chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, may be allowed if they are
             not otherwise described in the exclusion criteria AND there is agreement to allow by

          -  Subjects with known central nervous system involvement of myeloma should be excluded
             from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often
             develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of
             neurologic and other adverse events

          -  Subjects with history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar
             chemical or biologic composition to AMG 232 or carfilzomib, lenalidomide, or

          -  All herbal medicines (e.g., St. John's wort), vitamins, and supplements consumed by
             the subject within the 30 days prior to receiving the first dose of AMG 232, and
             continuing use, if applicable, will be reviewed by the principal investigator

          -  Use of any known CYP3A4 substrates with narrow therapeutic window (such as alfentanil,
             astemizole, cisapride, dihydroergotamine, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, or
             terfanide) within the 14 days prior to receiving the first dose of AMG 232 is not
             permitted; other medications (such as fentanyl and oxycodone) may be allowed per
             investigator's assessment/evaluation

          -  Treatment with medications known to cause QTc interval prolongation within 7 days of

             study requirements; subjects with myocardial infarction within 6 months of study day
             1, symptomatic congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class III

             positive hepatitis total core antibody with negative HBsAG (suggestive of occult
             hepatitis B), or detectable hepatitis C virus RNA by a polymerase-chain reaction (PCR)

             antibody [HepCAb], followed by hepatitis C virus RNA by PCR if HepCAb is positive);
             subjects with hepatitis B virus suppressed on therapy, and previously
             treated/eradicated hepatitis C virus are eligible for study

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive subjects positive for human
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are NOT excluded from this study, but HIV-positive
             subjects must have:

               -  A stable regimen of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART)

                  PCR-based test

             control include sexual abstinence (men, women); vasectomy; or a condom with spermicide
