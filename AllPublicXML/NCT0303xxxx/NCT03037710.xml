  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, non-randomized, non-interventional study to evaluate the accuracy of
      a remote monitoring and analytical platform for prediction of heart failure exacerbation. The
      platform acquires continuous multivariate vital signs from HF patients using a new ambulatory
      wearable (attached by an adhesive) multi-sensor device and analyzes the data using a novel
      machine learning algorithm.

    <textblock>
      The analytics being investigated includes a Similarity-Based Modeling technique, that
      empirically estimates the expected physiological behavior of a subject based on prior learned
      dynamic data, for comparison to actual measured behavior from the subject, to reveal
      discrepancies hidden by normal variation. The measurements are typically an ensemble of vital
      signs that effectively characterizes the physiological &quot;control system&quot; of the subject. This
      technique is multivariate: multiple variables are leveraged, because single variables in
      isolation have little context - a high heart rate by itself could mean a person is exerting
      himself, or it could mean his physiology is in distress even though he is not exerting
      himself. With reference to several other variables, however, such as respiration rate,
      oximetry and motion/activity, a high heart rate might be recognized as a normal state when
      accompanied by the corroborating data showing a high respiration rate, a normal oximetry and
      a high level of motion - the person is exercising.

      A wearable adhesive multi-sensor device will be used to collect continuous vital sign and
      other data from study subjects, including heart rate, respiration rate, bodily
      motion/activity, skin temperature, pulse, electrocardiogram and peripheral capillary oxygen
      saturation. Subjects are provided with a smartphone or cellular tablet that will be paired
      with the multi-sensor device to receive data and upload it to the analytics server via
      cellular network or WiFi internet. Study staff will interact with the subject during visits
      scheduled for routine heart failure follow-up to capture pre-specified heart failure medical
      events. All standard of care clinic and hospitalization notes and procedure reports including
      echocardiograms, right heart catheterizations, pulmonary function tests, six minute walk
      tests and radiology reports will be collected as they occur.
