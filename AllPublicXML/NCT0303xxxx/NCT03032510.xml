             condom) during the study and for 14 days following the last dose if sexually active
             with a female of childbearing potential

          7. If female, not pregnant or nursing or, if of childbearing potential: must commit to
             either use at least two medically accepted, effective methods of birth control (for
             example, condom, spermicidal gel, oral contraceptive, indwelling intrauterine device,
             hormonal implant /patch, injections, approved cervical ring) during study drug dosing

             or replaced within 72 hours of enrollment (for example, nephrostomy tubes, stents,
             urethral and suprapubic catheters).

         15. Known concomitant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection with CD4 counts below

             example, immunosuppressive therapy, chemotherapy, class IV heart or lung disease, end
             stage renal disease, or requiring hemodialysis) that would, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, jeopardize the safety of a participant and/or their compliance with the
             protocol
