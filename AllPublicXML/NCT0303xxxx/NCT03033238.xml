      The purpose of this study is to investigate opportunities for prevention and treatment of
      knee osteoarthritis (OA) by evaluating potentially modifiable risk factors for disease and
      poor pain and physical function outcomes especially among those with early or mild knee
      symptoms. The goal of the study is to find novel strategies to prevent disease at an early
      stage and to limit the impact of disease once it has occurred.

      MOST study participants in the &quot;Existing Cohort&quot; (3,026 subjects) were enrolled in the
      original study in 2003-2005. Surviving Existing Cohort participants without end-stage knee
      osteoarthritis will be asked to participate in the 144-, 152-, 160- and 168-month follow-up
      contacts. In addition, in 2016-2018 the cohort will be enriched by the recruitment of an
      additional 1,500 &quot;New Cohort&quot; participants with early or mild knee symptoms. The goal of the
      study is to find novel strategies to prevent disease at an early stage.
