  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The small RCT will assess feasibility, acceptability, and impact of a real-time intervention
      on ART adherence and clinical outcomes for HIV-positive adolescents. All subjects will use a
      wireless pill container (WPC) to monitor adherence. Intervention subjects will receive a
      personalized triggered reminder (cellphone message/call or bottle-based flash/alarm) when
      they miss a dose, and engage in monthly counseling sessions informed by their adherence data.
      Comparison subjects will receive usual care and an offer of counseling at monthly clinic
      visits.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A major priority in HIV care and treatment is identifying effective interventions for
      adolescent patients, including those that make use of new technologies, to help them achieve
      and maintain high levels of adherence to antiretroviral treatment (ART), particularly as they
      take responsibility for their own medication-taking in the transition to adult care. The
      research planned here will contribute to the scientific evidence base on approaches to
      support ART adherence effectively among youth by 1) conducting formative research on
      adherence challenges among adolescents and refining options for a personalized adherence
      intervention package; and 2) implementing a small randomized controlled trial (RCT) to assess
      the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of a novel real-time feedback intervention that
      permits adolescent patients to tailor intervention features to suit their individual
      preferences.

    <description>The core intervention will utilize innovative wireless technology to provide patients with 1) real time, personalized wireless reminder messages when ART doses are not taken on time, and 2) 'feedback' on adherence behavior via monthly interactive counseling sessions informed by summaries of their previous month's behavior. The core intervention will be personalized by each intervention arm patient, who may choose features to suit their preferences.</description>

    <description>Core intervention: 1) real time, personalized wireless reminder messages when ART doses are not taken on time, and 2) 'feedback' on adherence behavior via monthly interactive counseling sessions informed by summaries of their previous month's behavior. Personalized features of the intervention will be selected by each patient and may include 1) reminders sent to the WPC (light or chimes) or to patient's or caregiver's cell phone if dose is late; 2) content of text messages from a menu of options; 3) use of &quot;youth-friendly&quot; WPC adherence reports for interactive counseling sessions; 4) additional counseling by clinic staff; 5) a &quot;buddy&quot; system, by choosing someone to review the adherence report with him/her; and 6) a &quot;reward message&quot; after a pre-selected time period of excellent adherence.</description>
