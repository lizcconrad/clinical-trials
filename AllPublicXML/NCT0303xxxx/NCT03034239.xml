      Purpose: to study the effect of insect protein on performance and hypertrophy during 8 weeks
      of resistance training.

      Hypothesis: Insect protein supplementation enhances the effect of resistance training on
      muscle mass and muscle strength.

      Primary outcome: Muscle hypertrophy and muscle strength

      Design: Two groups of healthy young men (age: 18-30 years) with resistance training
      experience, but no structural resistance training performed for the last 12 months.
      Randomized controlled intervention study +/- insect protein (placebo group ingest isocaloric
      carbohydrate). Both groups perform 8 weeks of progressive resistance training (4/week) aiming
      to induce muscle hypertrophy.
