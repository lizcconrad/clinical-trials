      An Open-Label Phase I Study to Assess the Safety and Tolerability Profile of Three Escalating
      Doses of DCB-DM101 in Healthy Volunteers and Optimum Dose of DCB-DM101 as Add-on Treatment in

    <textblock>
      This is a single center, open-label, phase-I study consisting of two stages: Stage 1 will be
      dose-escalation study to assess the safety and tolerability profile of three escalating doses
      of DCB-DM101 in healthy volunteers and Stage 2 will apply optimum dose of DCB-DM101 as add-on
      treatment in T2DM patients. In Stage 2, patients are allowed to receive metformin for T2DM
      for routine use of which the dosing regimen should not be adjusted. No other
      medication/treatments for T2DM are allowed. Stage 2 can only be proceeded upon the approval
      of health authority in Taiwan. After determining the optimal dose for Stage 2, the reasons
      for determining such dose together with relevant supporting data should be submitted to
      health authority in Taiwan for review and to determine whether stage 2 can be proceeded and
      which dose should be employed for stage 2.

    <time_frame>7 months</time_frame>
    <description>Primary endpoint, DLT is defined as: Any causally related adverse event as judged by investigator is greater than or equal to Grade 2. The causality of each adverse event to investigational product will be judged by investigator during the conduction of each dosing cohort in Stage I. DSMB will reevaluate the causality of each DLT after the completion or termination of this dosing cohort judged by investigator to determine whether dose escalation or entering to stage 2 can be proceeded.Optimal Dose will be one tablet or two tablets or 4 tablets. the optimal dose for stage 2 is defined using rules as follows but will be determined by sponsor and investigators.</description>

    <measure>Stage 2: Number of Participants with Adverse events and Serious adverse events that are related to treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Specified:Primary endpoint, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a study medication and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a study medication, whether or not related to the study medication.
A Serious Adverse Event is defined as an AE meeting one of the following conditions. Death during the period of protocol defined surveillance. Life threatening Event defined as a participant at immediate risk of death at the time of the event. An event requiring inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization during the period of protocol defined surveillance. Results in congenital anomaly or birth defect. Results in a persistent or significant disability and incapacity.</description>

    <description>Biomarker consists of serum insulin. Insulin will be measured at all the same time points where blood glucose is measured including OGTT test time points for Visits 1 (-30 to 1 days), 2 (Day 1), and 4(Day 14), and single blood sampling besides laboratory test for Visits 3 (Day 8) and 5 (Day 28).</description>
