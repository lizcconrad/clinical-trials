  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be randomly allocated to either Yakult ingestion or a control group. For
      the first 20 days, subjects will consume their normal diet (keeping a detailed food diary
      throughout). On days 21-28 they will switch to a high-fat/high-calorie diet.

      The investigators hypothesise that consuming a high-fat, high-energy diet for 7 days will
      alter the composition of the gut microbiota and induce metabolic endotoxaemia / systemic
      inflammation as well as decreasing whole body insulin sensitivity (as we have shown
      previously). In contrast, the investigators hypothesise that consuming Yakult for 21 days
      before and 7 days throughout the high-fat diet will maintain a favourable gut microbiota and
      prevent metabolic endotoxaemia / systemic inflammation and thus maintain insulin action /
      insulin sensitivity.

                  analysis) is below 21% in males and 31% in females, then the subject may still be
                  recruited at the PI's discretion.

             previous 3 months.

          -  Participants who know they would not be available for all the lab visits during the
