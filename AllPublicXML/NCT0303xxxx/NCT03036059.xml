  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Global Program for the Elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) has been in operation
      sing the year 2000, with the aim of eliminating the disease by the year 2020, following 5-6
      rounds of effective annual Mass Drug Administration (MDA). The treatment regimen is
      Ivermectin (IVM) in combination with Diethylcarbamazine (DEC) or Albendazole (ALB). In Ghana,
      MDA has been undertaken since 2001. While the disease has been eliminated in many areas,
      transmission has persisted in some implementation units that had experienced 15 or more
      rounds of MDA. Alternative intervention strategies, including twice yearly MDA and sleeping
      under insecticidal nets have significantly accelerated transmission interruption in some
      settings of high transmission intensity. Thus, it is evident that new intervention strategies
      could eliminate residual infection in areas of persistent transmission and speed up the LF
      elimination process. This study therefore seeks to test the hypothesis that biannual
      treatment of LF endemic communities will accelerate interruption of LF transmission.

      Two cluster randomized trials will be implemented in LF endemic communities in Ghana. The
      interventions will be yearly or twice-yearly MDA delivered to entire endemic communities.
      Allocation to study group will be by clusters identified using the prevalence of LF. Clusters
      will be randomised to one of two groups: receiving either (1) annual treatment with IVM+ALB;
      (2) annual MDA with IVM +ALB, followed by an additional MDA 6 months later. The primary
      outcome measure is the prevalence of LF infection, assessed by four cross-sectional surveys.
      Entomological assessments will also be undertaken to evaluate the transmission intensity of
      the disease in the study clusters. Costs and cost-effectiveness will be evaluated. Among a
      random subsample of participants, microfilaria prevalence will be assessed longitudinally. A
      nested process evaluation, using semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions and a
      stakeholder analysis, will investigate the community acceptability, feasibility and scale-up
      of each delivery system.

    <description>The primary outcome, the prevalence of LF infection, will be measured through cross-sectional parasitological surveys conducted at baseline and at 24 months.

    <description>For the secondary outcome, a subsample of individuals from the clusters in each of the study groups will be followed longitudinally for two and half years, in order to better understand the transmission dynamics of LF and to estimate key parameters for mathematical modelling of transmission dynamics and treatment impact.</description>
