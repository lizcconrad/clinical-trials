  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a nested case-control study within an ongoing rotavirus vaccine immunogenicity trial
      in Karachi, Pakistan. The primary study aim is to compare the fecal microbiota composition
      and diversity of infants who do (control) and do not (case) demonstrate immune seroconversion
      to rotavirus vaccination. The infants will be matched for vaccination dose, age and
      breast-feeding practices.

    <description>The primary study objective is to see if there are significant differences in the fecal microbiota composition between rotavirus vaccine (Rotarix TM) immune responders (defined as anti-RV IgA antibodies at a concentration of &gt; or = to 20 U/ml in a previously seronegative individual 4 weeks after the last Rotarix dose) and rotavirus vaccine immune non-responders (defined as anti-RV IgA antibodies at a concentration of &lt;20 U/mL 4 weeks after the last Rotarix dose)</description>
