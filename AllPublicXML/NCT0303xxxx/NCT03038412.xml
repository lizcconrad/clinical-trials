  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the applicability of auto-fluorescence imaging
      system to detect and quantify caries and dental plaque. Participants were advised to rinse
      their mouth with distilled water to exclude any chance of fluorescence from food debris. A
      well trained physicist majored in optical spectroscopy captured auto-fluorescence images of
      buccal aspects of two maxillary central incisors and occlusal aspects of four first molars
      from each patient in a dark room. Then they chewed a disclosing agent to assess the Quigley
      Hein plaque index modified by Turesky of each tooth. Furthermore, participants were also
      required to brush their teeth for 3min, then International Caries Detection and Assessment
      System（ICDAS）codes of relevant teeth to evaluate degrees of caries were recorded by an
      experienced dentist using a mouth mirror and explorer. The Spearman rank correlation
      coefficient between colorimetric parameters of fluorescence image and the plaque index and
      ICDAS code were calculated to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of auto-fluorescence
      imaging system.

        The study population consisted of 60 patients are from the Affiliated Stomatology Hospital
        of Medical College, Zhejiang University. They have caries in their mouth and need to be
        treated by dentists with filling cavity. Two maxillary central incisors and four first
        molars exist in each patient.
