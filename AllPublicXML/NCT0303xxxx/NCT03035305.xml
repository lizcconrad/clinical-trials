    <textblock>
      SMC LNS Mali is a interventional matched-pair clustered cohort carried out between August and
      November 2017 in 18 health areas in Kolokani Circle, Koulikoro region, Mali.

      The objective of this study is to determine whether the association SMC and LNS reduces the
      number of confirmed malaria cases among children 6-59 months during the monthly SMC
      distribution sessions.

      Main objective:

      To compare confirmed cases of malaria among children aged 6-59 months between the group
      receiving SMC combined with LNS (intervention group) and the group receiving only SMC
      (control group) during the monthly SMC distribution sessions (4 rounds)

      Secondary objectives:

      To compare among children aged 6-59 months between two groups

        -  Fever cases

        -  Acute malnutrition cases (global, moderate and severe)

        -  Medical referral cases and their reasons

      Study site:

      The study is conducted in 18 health areas in Kolokani Circle, Koulikoro region, Mali. Each
      group (intervention and control groups) is composed of 9 health areas.

      Number of participants:

      Between 17500 and 22000 in each group (estimation)

    <description>Malaria case is confirmed by a positive malaria rapid diagnostic test. This outcome will be defined as the occurrence of at least one confirmed malaria case from the 2nd through the 4th round of SMC distribution.</description>

    <description>Fever case is defined by an axillary temperature greater than 37.5⁰C measured by electronic thermometer or notion fever within 48 hours. This outcome will be defined as the occurrence of at least one fever case from the 2nd through the 4th round of SMC distribution.</description>

    <description>Moderate acute malnutrition is defined by MUAC between 115-124mm (orange color MUAC). This outcome will be defined as the occurrence of at least one moderate acute malnutrition case from the 2nd through the 4th round of SMC distribution.</description>
