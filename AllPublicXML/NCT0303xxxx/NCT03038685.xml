  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Belgian Stroke Council initiated a project to improve risk factor control and medication
      adherence in ischemic stroke patients by developing an individualized in-hospital initiated
      and post- discharge, digital coaching program addition to standard practice (strokecoach.be).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this project is to further improve subacute and chronic stroke care in the
      Belgian context with main focus on the patients' quality of life, stroke recurrence and
      secondary cardiovascular prevention. Main focuses are on patient-empowerment, shared-decision
      making and health literacy, as these items are linked with better therapeutic adherence and
      self-care for chronic diseases.

      In case of a positive result, implementation of this individualized chronic stroke care
      program executed by a personal stroke coach, initiated during hospitalization and using a
      web-based intervention program, can easily be unrolled in other Belgian stroke units. The
      program can be cost-effective if better clinical outcome, stroke recurrence rates, number of
      in-hospital consultations, number of rehospitalisations are reduced. This will be evaluated
      in a in-depth healt-economic analysis.

    <description>A historical cohort of Sint-Janhospital (2011 - Bruges, Belgium) with prospectively collected data will be used as comparator for the experimental arm. These data were published in Vanacker P, Couvreur T, Vanhooren G. Can we improve cerebrovascular risk reduction in real-life? A single centre's experience.

    <intervention_name>Strokecoach.be - digital coaching program for stroke patients</intervention_name>
    <description>The stroke coach gives patients two education sessions during hospitalization (risk factor management, review of medications and clinical evolution). During these sessions, study participation will be proposed. Eligibility will partially depend on their historical use of the internet and e-mail. The aim is to have the digital platform personalized for his/her individual needs, risk factors and remaining neurologic signs/symptoms. Tips and tricks to deal with lifestyle modification will be delivered on regular basis. Meanwhile, patients will be asked to complete on a pre-specified frequency their data regarding their cardiovascular risk profile. Additionally, participants will be contacted at 0.5-1-2 and 6 months by phone calls or videoconsultancy. To standardize, an adapted, digital version of the standardized WSO Post-Stroke Checklist shall be used as a decision-support flowchart. A report of the consultation will be derived after the videoconsultancy.</description>
