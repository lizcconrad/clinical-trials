    <textblock>
      Transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURB) for bladder tumor excision is the
      mainstream treatment. However, the beneficial effects of sugammadex after general anesthesia
      for TURB have not been thoroughly evaluated. Investigators hypothesized that deep NMB and the
      use of sugammadex as a reversal agent may be associated with better endoscopic surgical
      condition and recovery profile compared with moderate NMB during TURB.

      This study was designed to compare patients with deep neuromuscular blockade (NMB) with
      moderate NMB during transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURB) in terms of surgical
      condition and postoperative recovery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURB) is the mainstream treatment of bladder
      cancer. TURB may be performed under regional anesthesia or general anesthesia. During
      regional anesthesia for TURB, obturator nerve block should be performed to prevent adductor
      contraction and possible inadvertent bladder perforation. Additionally, some patients prefer
      not to be conscious during the surgery and patients with spinal deformity or previous spinal
      fusion surgery are prone to fail regional anesthesia. Therefore, general anesthesia with
      neuromuscular blockade (NMB) is frequently conducted for patients with TURB.

      During general anesthesia for TURB, NMB is needed for intubation and optimal endoscopic
      surgical condition via obturator nerve block. TURB is a relatively short procedure but
      patients with NMB usually need sufficient time to be reversed with the conventional NMB
      reversal agents (anticholinesterases). Additionally, inadequate reversal from NMB may result
      in respiratory complication during recovery. Sugammadex, a newer reversal agent, is a
      selective relaxant-binding agent that allows for rapid reversal of rocuronium-induced NMB.
      With the introduction of sugammadex, immediate reversal of deep NMB has become possible
      without residual NMB.

      Several previous studies evaluated the effect of NMB on surgical condition for relative short
      surgeries such as laparoscopic cholecystectomy or laryngeal micro-surgery. They suggested
      that deep NMB and reversal with sugammadex improved surgical condition without postop
      respiratory complications. TURB is a urological endoscopic procedure performed in a narrow
      bladder space but the beneficial effects of deep NMB with sugammadex reversal for TURB have
      not been thoroughly evaluated. We hypothesized that deep NMB and the use of sugammadex as a
      reversal agent may be associated with better endoscopic surgical condition compared with
      moderate NMB during TURB. Therefore, this study was designed to compare deep NMB with
      moderate NMB during TURB in terms of surgical condition and recovery profiles in patients
      with general anesthesia.

    <description>5-point surgical condition scale was evaluated as follows.
Extremely poor
unable to work because of coughing or because of the inability to obtain a endoscopic view because of inadequate muscle relaxation. Additional neuromuscular blocking agents (NMB) must be given.
Poor
severely hampered by inadequate muscle relaxation with continuous muscle contractions, movements, or both with the hazard of tissue damage. Additional NMB is needed.
Acceptable
a wide endoscopic view but bladder contractions, movements, or both occur regularly causing some interference with the surgeon's work. There is the need for additional NMB to prevent deterioration.
Good
a wide endoscopic working field with sporadic muscle contractions, movements, or both. No immediate need for additional NMB unless there is the fear of deterioration.
Optimal
a wide endoscopic working field without any movement or contractions. No additional NMB is needed.</description>

        <description>5-point surgical condition scale was evaluated as follows.
Extremely poor
unable to work because of coughing or because of the inability to obtain a endoscopic view because of inadequate muscle relaxation. Additional neuromuscular blocking agents (NMB) must be given.
Poor
severely hampered by inadequate muscle relaxation with continuous muscle contractions, movements, or both with the hazard of tissue damage. Additional NMB is needed.
Acceptable
a wide endoscopic view but bladder contractions, movements, or both occur regularly causing some interference with the surgeon’s work. There is the need for additional NMB to prevent deterioration.
Good
a wide endoscopic working field with sporadic muscle contractions, movements, or both. No immediate need for additional NMB unless there is the fear of deterioration.
Optimal
a wide endoscopic working field without any movement or contractions. No additional NMB is needed.</description>
