  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neurogenic dysphagia is one of the most frequent and prognostically relevant neurological
      deficits in a variety of disorders, such as stroke, parkinsonism and advanced neuromuscular
      diseases. Flexible endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) is now probably the most
      frequently used tool for objective dysphagia assessment in Germany. It allows evaluation of
      the efficacy and safety of swallowing, determination of appropriate feeding strategies and
      assessment of the efficacy of different swallowing manoeuvres. The literature furthermore
      indicates that FEES is a safe and well-tolerated procedure. The FEES-Registry aims at
      evaluating findings and side effects of FEES in a heterogeneous collective of patients with
      neurogenic dysphagia.
