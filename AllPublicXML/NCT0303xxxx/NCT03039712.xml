    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study is to meet the CMS mandated Coverage with Evidence
      Development requirement in the National Coverage Determination for Leadless Pacemakers as
      they apply to Medtronic Micra devices. The study uses administrative claims data of the
      Medicare population implanted with single-chamber ventricular pacemakers

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Micra CED study is a study of the Medicare beneficiary population implanted with
      single-chamber ventricular pacemakers, and will be executed by analyzing administrative
      claims data. The study consists of two primary objectives: estimate the: (1) acute overall
      complication rate and (2) the 2-year survival rate of patients implanted with a Micra
      leadless pacemaker. As part of the secondary objectives of the study, a comparative analysis
      of Micra leadless pacemakers to single-chamber ventricular transvenous pacemakers will be
      conducted.

      The analysis will be in CMS claims data and is subject to a central IRB. However, individual
      hospitals are not engaged in research and local IRB oversight is not necessary.

    <description>Single-chamber ventricular pacemaker system and/or procedure related complications at 30 days. Acute complications include embolism/thrombosis, event at the puncture site, cardiac effusion/perforation, device-related complication, or other complications following the implantation of a single-chamber ventricular pacemaker system. Subjects' administrative claims data will be reviewed to determine the occurrence of an acute complication.</description>

    <description>Device-related re-interventions are procedures associated with the insertion/replacement, revision, or removal of either a leadless or transvenous pacemaker system or components following the index implantation of a single-chamber ventricular pacemaker. Device-related re-intervention rates will be reported at six month intervals for two years following the index implantation of a single-chamber ventricular pacemaker. Subjects' administrative claims data will be reviewed to determine the occurrence of a device-related re-intervention</description>
