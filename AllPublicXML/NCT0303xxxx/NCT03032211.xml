      1. Summary of Clinical Investigation

      A summary of the clinical investigation is provided below and includes the primary objective
      of the study, the safety and feasibility endpoints, the number of subjects to be enrolled,
      the study duration, the subject follow-up and the inclusion/exclusion criteria.

        1. Primary Objective

           The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of the
           alfapump® System indication for use in the management of fluid in NYHA Class III and
           ambulatory NYHA Class IV heart failure patients who have an eGFR of &gt; 15 to &lt; 60
           mL/min/1.73m2.

        2. Study Endpoints

             1. Primary Safety Endpoint

                The primary safety endpoint will be an assessment of the occurrence of adverse
                events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) related to:

                  1. Surgical implant of the alfapump®

                  2. Device malfunctions

                  3. Dialysate infusion

             2. Secondary Safety Endpoints

                The secondary endpoint will be an assessment of:

                  1. Time to first hospitalization related to fluid management after the activation
                     of the alfapump® System and initiation of dialysate infusion has occurred

                  2. Rate of occurrence of re-hospitalizations related to fluid management

                  3. All-cause mortality

             3. Assessment of Feasibility for Fluid Management in Heart Failure Indication The
                feasibility of the alfapump® System for management of fluid in NYHA Class III and
                ambulatory NYHA Class IV heart failure patients with renal dysfunction will be
                assessed by the net fluid balance as measured by the ability of the alfapump®
                System to move more fluid to the bladder than dialysate instilled.
