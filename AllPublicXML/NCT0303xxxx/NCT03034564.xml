  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing droxidopa to placebo
      for fatigue in Parkinson's Disease. The primary outcome measure is change in the Parkinson's
      Disease Fatigue Scale, a 16-item scale that measures the physical effects of fatigue as well
      as the impact of fatigue on daily functioning and activities, including socialization.
      Secondary outcomes are the PDQ-39, a 39-item self-report questionnaire assessing Parkinson's
      disease-specific health related quality over the last month in 8 different dimensions of
      function and well-being, and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, a questionnaire querying 8
      situations for which the subject will rate the likelihood of falling asleep. There will be a
      screening visit (SC), baseline visit (BL), 2 clinic visits at 6 and 12 weeks (V01, V02), and
      telephone contact at 4 weeks and 8 weeks (T1, T2). In-person visits will include review of
      informed consent, concomitant medication review, adverse event review, pill counts, vital
      signs (including supine blood pressure), and outcome measurements. Telephone visits will
      include review of informed consent, concomitant medication review, and adverse event review.

          -  Diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease

             weakness)

          -  No objective orthostasis (significant drop in blood pressure when standing)

          -  No supine hypertension (high blood pressure while laying down) judged to be of
             clinical significance by the investigator

          -  Well-controlled depression

          -  Stable dopaminergic medication regimen for 6 weeks prior to screening

          -  No concurrent use of fludrocortisone, midodrine, or other medications that may raise
             blood pressure

          -  PD Fatigue Scale Score of 50 or above

        Exclusion Criteria:
