  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to assess whether children 12-18 months of age who are exposed to
      multiple large-scale vitamin A programs, and who are likely to have vitamin A intakes above
      the tolerable upper intake level (UL), have higher total body vitamin A stores and biomarkers
      of excessive vitamin A status, compared to children 12-18 months of age who have adequate
      vitamin A intake.

    <textblock>
      This is an observational study with 3 groups, which are identified using a screening tool to
      obtain information on exposure to vitamin A programs and consumption of vitamin A-rich foods
      and supplements. Children and their mothers are studied over the course of one month to
      determine 1) child total body vitamin A stores, using the 13C retinol isotope dilution
      method, 2) the child's vitamin A intake, using multiple dietary assessment methods, 3) total
      breast milk intake (among breastfeeding children), using the dose-to-mother deuterium
      dilution method, and 4) potential biomarkers of excessive vitamin A status, including markers
      of bone and liver health. Blood collection is structured in a &quot;Super-Child&quot; design, to
      construct plasma retinol kinetic curves. Other indicators related to vitamin A nutrition
      among children will be measured, in addition to the vitamin A intake and breast milk vitamin
      A concentration (for breastfeeding mothers) of the mother.

          -  The child has moderate or severe anemia (Hb &lt;10 g/dL)

          -  The mother or child has signs or symptoms of vitamin A deficiency (Bitot's spots,
             conjunctival xerosis, nightblindness)

          -  The child has weight for length &lt; -2 z-scores of the median of the WHO growth
             standards

          -  The mother is breastfeeding more than one child
