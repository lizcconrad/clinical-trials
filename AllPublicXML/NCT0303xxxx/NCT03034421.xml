  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic valve therapy is an effective therapy for patients with severe emphysema and low
      interlobar collateral ventilation. Although, valve therapy is a minimal-invasive treatment
      approach, it is associated with complications the most common of which is pneumothorax with a
      rate of 18-25%. Modifying post-operative medical care including bed rest for 48 hours after
      valve implantation may reduce the risk of post-interventional pneumothorax.

      Patient enrolment and data acquisition is to be carried out on a prospective basis. It is
      planned to enrol a total of 130 patients with advanced emphysema and low collateral
      ventilation. Patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive modified medical
      care including a 48 bed rest or standard medical care following valve implantation. All
      patients will undergo treatment at one study centre in Heidelberg.
