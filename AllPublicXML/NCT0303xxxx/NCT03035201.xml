  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The parent trial (COcoa Supplement and Multivitamin Outcomes Study, COSMOS; NCT02422745) is a
      randomized clinical trial of cocoa extract supplement (containing a total of 600 mg/d
      flavanols, including 80 mg. (-)-epicatechins), and a standard multivitamin supplement to
      reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer among men aged 60 years and older and
      women aged 65 years and older. A cognitive ancillary study (COSMOS-Mind) is being conducted
      among men and women, 65 years and older, who are enrolled in COSMOS and will examine whether
      the cocoa extract supplement or the multivitamin supplement improves cognitive function and
      reduces risk of cognitive impairment, including AD and other related types of dementia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Identifying a safe, affordable, and well-tolerated intervention that prevents cognitive
      decline in older adults is of critical public health importance. There is compelling evidence
      from basic science, and small clinical studies that cocoa flavanols may protect cognitive
      function in older adults and reduce risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementia.
      Thus, this intervention could have important downstream benefits for health care utilization
      and cost, caregiver burden, and overall quality of life for older adults. Cocoa flavanol
      effects on cognition, however, need to be assessed in a definitive clinical trial.

      The parent trial (COSMOS) will enroll 18,000 women and men nationwide, drawn from the Women's
      Health Initiative (WHI) participant cohort and the VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL)
      non-randomized respondent cohort, and will be conducted primarily by mail to assess whether
      high-potency cocoa flavanol extract and a multivitamin - alone or in combination - will
      reduce risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer over 3 years of follow-up.

      Once participants are enrolled in COSMOS, the study team at Brigham and Women's Hospital will
      provide contact information and other parent trial outcomes for COSMOS-Mind participants to
      the Wake Forest team using a secure web-based data transfer system. This seamless exchange of
      information between sites will permit timely accounting to ensure that the targeted
      demographics for enrollment are achieved (e.g. gender, age, race, ethnicity).

      COSMOS-Mind will administer a telephone cognitive assessment to all participants at
      enrollment (baseline), and annually for 3 years of follow-up by trained and certified staff
      of the Wake Forest COSMOS-Mind team.
