    <textblock>
      This study will use semi-structured interviews with participants in a prospective cohort
      study to explore women's experiences of pain and preferences in pain management during first
      trimester surgical abortion to create a more patient centered experience. We will analyze two
      study cohorts of women undergoing first trimester surgical abortion: women choosing oral
      anesthesia and women choosing nitrous oxide.

      This study will utilize an open-ended semi-structured interview format to elicit a broader
      understanding of the multi-dimensional pain experience of woman undergoing an abortion
      procedure. This study seeks to provide further evaluation of the pain experience and
      preferences of women receiving alternative methods of pain management such as oral sedation
      and nitrous oxide.

      The study will use semi-structured interviews to explore women's experiences of pain and
      preferences in pain management during first trimester surgical abortion and will include a
      procedural pain outcome using the visual analog scale (VAS) to create a more patient centered
      experience.

    <description>Patients in this group will receive a standard procedure first trimester abortion using oral sedation for pain management following the clinic's protocol.
Patients in both groups will be administered a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) assessing pain on an unmarked 100mm VAS scale with anchors at 0mm (left) being &quot;no pain&quot; and 100mm (right) being &quot;pain as bad as it could be&quot; before their procedure and immediately following procedure completion.</description>

    <description>Patients in this group will receive a standard procedure first trimester abortion using titrated nitrous oxide for pain management following the clinic's protocol.
Patients in both groups will be administered a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) assessing pain on an unmarked 100mm VAS scale with anchors at 0mm (left) being &quot;no pain&quot; and 100mm (right) being &quot;pain as bad as it could be&quot; before their procedure and immediately following procedure completion.</description>
