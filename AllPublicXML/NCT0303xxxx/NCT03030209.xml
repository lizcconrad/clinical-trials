    <textblock>
      Glucose homeostasis changes after distal pancreatectomy are not well understood. This study
      aim to identify the incidence of and risk factors for, a change in glucose homeostasis in
      patients who underwent distal pancreatic resection.

    <textblock>
      The development of sophisticated surgical procedures, improved postoperative care, and the
      capacity for early diagnosis of disease, have prolonged life expectancy after pancreatic
      resection. For these patients, the endocrine function of the pancreas is a critical factor
      that influences quality of life. In this study, the investigators recruit patients who
      underwent distal pancreatectomy in Peking Union Medical College Hospital within the last 10
      years. Demographic characteristics, operative parameters and short-term postoperative
      outcomes were collected in a prospective database maintained by the Pancreatic Surgical
      Centre, Peking Union Medical College Hospital. These patients are followed up regularly by
      outpatient visiting or telephone for long-term outcomes. The primary outcome of this study is
      new-onset diabetes mellitus; second outcomes include impaired fasting glucose, impaired
      glucose tolerance, exocrine insufficiency and disease recurrence. This study aim to determine
      the cumulative rates of endocrine insufficiency, and identify risk factors for DM development
      in a large cohort of patients undergoing distal pancreatectomy.

    <measure>Number of participants with new-onset diabetes mellitus as defined by American Diabetes Association</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 3 year</time_frame>
    <description>The criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes developed by American Diabetes Association (1) FPG (fasting plasma glucose) ≥ 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L). Fasting is defined as no caloric intake for at least 8 h.* OR (2) 2-h PG (plasma glucose) ≥ 200 mg/dL (11.1mmol/L) during an OGTT (oral glucose tolerance test). The test should be performed as described by the WHO, using a glucose load containing the equivalent of 75 g anhydrous glucose dissolved in water.* OR (3) A1C ≥ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol). The test should be performed in a laboratory using a method that is NGSP certified and standardized to the DCCT assay.* (lower-upper limit: 4.5%-6.3% in PUMCH) OR (4) In a patient with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis, a random plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L).
*In the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, results should be confirmed by repeat testing.</description>

    <measure>Number of participants with new-onset prediabetes as defined by American Diabetes Association</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 3 year</time_frame>
    <description>The categories of prediabetes (increased risk for diabetes)
(1) Impaired fasting glucose (IFG): FPG 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) to 125 mg/dL (6.9 mmol/L). (3.6 - 6.1 mmol/L in PUMCH) OR (2) Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT): 2-h PG in the 75-g OGTT 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) to 199 mg/dL (11.0 mmol/L). The test should be performed as described by the WHO, using a glucose load containing the equivalent of 75 g anhydrous glucose dissolved in water.
OR (3) A1C 5.7-6.4% (39-46 mmol/mol)</description>
