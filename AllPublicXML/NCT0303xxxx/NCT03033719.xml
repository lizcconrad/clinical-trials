      The purpose of this study is to compare the postoperative global morbidity between patients
      who have been operated on for a colon cancer by laparotomy and those operated on by
      laparoscopy

      The present study is a national, multicenter, open-label randomized, 2-arm superiority trial.
      Patients aged 75 years or older with uncomplicated colonic cancer or precancerous colonic
      lesion non-endoscopically resectable, will be randomized to either colectomy by laparoscopy
      or laparotomy. All patients that might be included will have a comprehensive geriatric
      assessment performed within the 30 days before randomization with the following scores: MMS
      (Mini Mental Score), ADL scale (Activities of Daily Living), IADL scale (Instrumental
      Activities of Daily Living), GDS (Geriatric Depression Scale) and TGUG test (&quot;Timed
      Get-Up-and-Go&quot; test).
