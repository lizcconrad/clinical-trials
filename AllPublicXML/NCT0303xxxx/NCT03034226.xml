      This study compares the hypoglycemic counter regulatory response in type 1 diabetics and in
      healthy control subjects with and without antecedent hypoglycemia
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Iatrogenic hypoglycemia is one of the main limiting factors for optimal glycemic management
      of diabetes. It causes recurrent morbidity in most people with type 1 diabetes and in many
      patients with type 2 diabetes and can be fatal. Episodes of hypoglycemia impair
      physiologically protective mechanism in subsequent episodes of hypoglycemia. This phenomenon
      is known as hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure (HAAF), the clinical syndromes of
      defective glucose counter regulation and hypoglycemia unawareness.

    <description>Insulin sensitivity before, during hypoglycemia and after recovery from hypoglycemia on day 2 (one episode of hypoglycemia) compared with day 4 (two consecutive episodes of hypoglycemia). Insulin sensitivity is measured as M-value derived from the Glucose Infusion Rate (GIR) during a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp / hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemic clamp</description>
