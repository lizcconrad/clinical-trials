  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and efficacy of an experimental drug,
      OMP-305B83, when given in combination with FOLFIRI. OMP-305B83 is a humanized bispecific
      monoclonal antibody and was developed to target cancer stem cells. Based on preclinical
      studies, it is believed that OMP-305B83 may block the growth of cancer stem cells and may
      also impair the productive growth of new blood vessels, which tumors need to grow and spread.

      The study is sponsored by OncoMed Pharmaceuticals, which is referred to as OncoMed or the
      Sponsor.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase 1b dose escalation and expansion study of OMP-305B83 plus
      FOLFIRI to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of OMP-305B83 in combination
      with FOLFIRI in patients with metastatic Colorectal Cancer. This study consists of a
      screening period, a treatment period, and a post-treatment follow-up period in which patients
      will be followed for survival for up to 5 years. Patients will be enrolled in two stages: a
      dose-escalation stage and an expansion phase.
