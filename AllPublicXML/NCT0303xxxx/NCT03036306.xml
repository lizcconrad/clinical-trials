    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and local tolerability of two different
      concentrations of of SCX-001 cream, as compared to placebo, when topically applied twice a
      day for 21 days to artificially induced dermal wounds in healthy volunteers. In addition, the
      absorption and elimination of profiles of this topically applied product will be determined
      through pharmacokinetic sampling. Assessments for effect of SCX-001 vs. placebo will be done
      but are considered exploratory.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female volunteers aged ≥18 - ≤65 years who have voluntarily signed and dated
             an Informed Consent Form (ICF).

          2. Subjects with, in the opinion of the Investigator, clinically acceptable results at
             screening for the laboratory tests specified in the trial protocol.

          3. Women of child bearing potential must provide a negative pregnancy serum/urine test at
             time of screening and have to be compliant with an effective form of birth control
             throughout the entire study.* Non-child bearing potential means subjects have had a
             history of tubal ligation or a hysterectomy or are post-menopausal with no menses for
             at least 1 year prior to enrolment in the study.

          4. Subjects, who are, in the opinion of the Investigator, able to understand the study,
             co- operate with the study procedures and are willing to return to the clinic for all
             of the required follow-up visits.

          5. Subjects must be able to cooperate with requirements of the study (e.g. able to speak,
             read and write English, expect to be available for adverse event monitoring for the
             duration of the study).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who have scarring from previous interventions or evidence of thermal,
             electrical or radiation burn scars, tattoos, birthmarks or moles within 5 cm of the
             treatment site.

          2. Subjects with a history or family history of keloid formation.

          3. Subjects with a concurrent illness or condition that may have interfered with wound
             healing like neoplastic, immune-mediated, or primary infectious disease (e.g.
             carcinoma, vasculitis, connective tissue disease, immune system disorders, rheumatoid
             arthritis, chronic renal impairment, significant hepatic impairment, inadequately or
             uncontrolled congestive heart failure or diabetes mellitus) or any clinically
             significant medical condition or history of any condition which may impair wound
             healing.

          4. Subjects with a skin disorder that is chronic or currently active and which the
             Investigator considers will adversely affect the healing of acute wounds or will
             involve the areas to be examined in this trial (including psoriasis, dermatitis,
             eczema)

          5. Subjects with a body mass index &lt;15 or &gt;35 kg/m2.

          6. A history of radiotherapy to the study scar area.

          7. Subjects who have used nicotine-containing products (including vaping) within one
             month prior to the screening visit.

          8. Subjects who are positive for HIV, hepatitis B or C.

             or any of the constituents of SCX-001 Cream.

         10. Subjects who have known sensitivities to EMLA cream, chlorhexidine or adhesive
             dressings

         11. Subjects with a history of any malignancy in the five years prior to the screening
             visit.

         12. Subjects with a life expectancy of &lt;9 months, terminal conditions or factors making
             follow-up difficult (e.g. no fixed address, telephone etc.).

         13. Subjects with planned major surgical intervention during the course of the study.

         14. Subjects who have received corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents, anticoagulants,
             radiation therapy or chemotherapy at a dose that might have interfered with wound
             healing within the last 90 days prior to study enrolment.

         15. Subjects who have received NSAIDS or ASA in the past week.

         16. Subjects with a creatinine clearance of 80 ml/min or less.
