      Sodium heparin tube collections will be performed at baseline, at each restaging CT scan and
      at time of first disease progression. K3-EDTA tubes will be collected at baseline and at
      disease progression.

      In patients who are planning an EGD for the purpose of obtaining a tumor biopsy, portal vein
      sampling will be offered. Under EUS guidance, a 19-gauge EUS fine needle will be advanced
      transhepatically into the portal vein and as many as four 7.5 mL K3-EDTA samples of blood
      will be aspirated, as previously described. Research biopsy will be performed at baseline
      and, if feasible, at disease progression.
