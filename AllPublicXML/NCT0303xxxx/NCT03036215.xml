  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot project is to determine the feasibility and acceptability of
      proposed methods for a subsequent clinical trial of a tailored self-management program (PACT)
      designed to decrease pain in participants with temporomandibular disorders (TMD). The PACT
      program is a personalized program of exercise and behavioral changes implemented through a
      web-based program supported by a health coach. For this feasibility and acceptability study,
      80 adults with TMD pain will be randomized either to the PACT program or to traditional
      self-care.

      The primary study objectives of the PACT study are two-fold:

        1. Evaluate the feasibility of methods to conduct a full-scale multi-site randomized
           clinical trial comparing PACT self-management with traditional self-care for TMD. The
           study will also evaluate strategies to: identify, recruit, consent, and enroll eligible
           subjects into both groups meeting target goal; evaluate adherence to intervention and
           identification of barriers; evaluate adherence to outcomes assessment, and evaluate the
           on-line web-site functionality and acceptability.

        2. To demonstrate ability to accurately capture outcome measures to be used in the
           multi-site study.

      Primary study objective: Recruitment is measured through achievement of target sample, number
      of patients identified that meet eligibility criteria, and number (%) of subjects consenting
      compared with total contacted.

      Intervention adherence is measured by: number of participants enrolled in both groups, number
      of participants accessing on-line materials, completion of practice logs, and identification
      of self-reported barriers of participation in self-care. Outcome adherence is measured by the
      number of participants who complete the baseline assessment, complete the two and four month
      follow-up assessments, complete the program evaluation, and complete qualitative post-study
      interview. Website acceptability is measure by identification of problems and barriers during
      use and quality and ease of use at the post-intervention evaluation.

      Second objective: Efficacy of the program is measured by self-reported outcome assessments.
      The primary outcomes include TMD symptoms, jaw functioning, and emotional functioning.
      Secondary outcomes measures include symptom severity with the temporal aspects of pain, pain
      interference, and patient ratings of improvement. Additional information on mediators and
      modifiers will also be gathered to help inform the how and why the intervention has an
      effect. Mediators will be measured to identify factors that help explain why PACT may have an
      effect including self-efficacy, patient activation, exercise level, sleep quality, and social
      support. Contextual process factors to identify in whom the intervention does and does not
      work include disability status, catastrophizing, depression, repetitive strain from oral
      habits, and perceived stress.

    <intervention_model_description>The pilot study design is a 2-arm randomized clinical trial to test the methods that will be used in a future proposal for a full-scale multi-site clinical trial. The two aims include: 1) evaluate the feasibility of methods to conduct a full-scale multi-site randomized clinical trial comparing the PACT self-management with usual self-care for TMD and, 2) estimate the parameters needed to plan for a larger multi-site trial including the effect size and standard deviation for primary outcomes of pain and function. A traditional self-care control arm is added to determine the acceptability of randomization and the feasibility of collecting baseline and follow-up data from a traditional care control arm for the full-scale study.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The study will employ a self-management program, entitled Personalized Activated Care and Training (PACT) that is a tailored 8-week progressive web-based training program supported by a health coach to enhance understanding, compliance, and success in improving TMD pain. The program provides 8 weeks of structured didactic and experiential training on exercises and cognitive- behavioral training to reduce risk factors that contribute to delayed recovery and enhance protective factors that have evidence of improving TMD pain.</description>
