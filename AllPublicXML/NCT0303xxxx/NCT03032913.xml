  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposal aims at determining whether liquid biopsy approaches are valid in the diagnosis
      of pancreatic cancer. Step1 will test 3 CTC isolation methods and analyse by flow cytometry
      the presence of onco-exosomes in the culture media of pancreatic cell lines. Step 2 will
      examine the diagnostic accuracy of these blood tumor elements for the diagnosis of cancer of
      patients with PDAC suspicion or recent diagnosis and their value for disease monitoring.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) incidence has increased with a high rate during the
      past few years (+4.7% per year between 2005 and 2012, source InfoCancer 2013). No cure is
      currently available for this deadly disease, with an overall survival &lt;5%. Survival can reach
      20% when surgery is possible, giving the best chance to the patients. If patients present
      locally advance disease, it is crucial to quickly establish resectability to avoid unneeded
      and even deleterious surgery in patients with metastatic stages. It is also important to
      increase the rate of true R0 resection with effective preoperative therapy. However, when the
      cancer is suspected, neoadjuvant chemotherapies are often delayed because the mandatory
      histologic proof is difficult to make with non-informative biopsies. It is necessary to find
      new markers to help for rapid diagnosis that could allow neoadjuvant therapies and surgery
      when anatomo-pathologic proof is not available. New developments in the field of liquid
      biopsy hold great promise in providing valuable information for diagnosis assistance. The
      project will be run in two steps. First, several methods will be compared for tumor cell
      recovery after cell spiking in blood of non-cancer patients and pancreatic cell line
      onco-exosomes will characterized by flow cytometry. Second the best method will be used to
      detect and enumerate CTCs in 20 PDAC patients and 20 non-cancer patients. In parallel GPC1+
      exosomes from patients' plasmas will be quantified. Diagnosis accuracy will be established
      and compared. Correlations between circulating tumor elements presence and clinical and
      biological parameters will be evaluated at the time of the diagnosis. Patient clinical
      outcome will be assessed according to initial circulating element quantification.
