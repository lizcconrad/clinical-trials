  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to determine feasibility of using a continuous glucose monitor in
      pediatric, adolescent and young adult hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients,
      and to identify the incidence and risk factors for malglycemia in primary admission for
      pediatric, adolescent and young adult HSCT patients as well as to characterize the
      relationship between outcomes and malglycemia in this population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective observational cohort analysis examining the rate of malglycemia
      in the pediatric HSCT population and the effect of malglycemia on important post-HSCT
      outcomes. In addition to usual care during the peri-HSCT period, participants in this trial
      will be asked to wear a continuous glucose monitor for the duration of their initial hospital
      admission. Participants will wear this monitor while admitted to the hospital for up to one
      week prior to transplant, and up to 60 days after transplant.
