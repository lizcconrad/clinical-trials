  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this 12-week, open-label pilot study, the investigators will enroll 20 subjects with
      Parkinson's Disease to determine if two doses of Zonisamide are tolerable and demonstrate
      clinical benefit for Dyskinesias. The primary outcome measure is tolerability, as determined
      by number of subjects able to complete the study on their originally assigned dosage.
      Secondary outcome measures will use the Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale (UDysRS), comprised
      of an Objective Section and a Historical Section, to compare baseline to 6 and 12-week
      measurements. Additional analysis of the effect of Zonisamide on quality of life will be
      measured by the Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire (PDQ-39).

    <description>assesses involuntary movements encountered in the treatment of Parkinson's Disease. It consists of a Historical Section, divided into questionnaires about 1) on-dyskinesia and 2) off -dystonia, and an Objective Section, divided into 3) impairment and 4) disability scales. The Historical Section is scored from 0-60, and the Objective section is scored 0-44, where higher scores reflect greater difficulty or impairment.</description>
