  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether certain brain training activities can promote
      cognitive, emotional, and physical health in caregivers of a spouse with dementia. Numerous
      studies show that family dementia caregiving can be stressful, and can increase mental and
      physical health risks. This study aims to understand how to reduce those risks.

    <measure>Useful Field of View test performance at 12 months after the intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Useful Field of View computerized test of speed of processing and attention; lower score (in milliseconds) reflects better performance</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Resting high frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV) at 12 months after the intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>HF-HRV is derived by spectral analysis of the electrocardiograph (ECG) waveform and is a measure of parasympathetic control of the heart; Higher resting HF-HRV (in Hz) reflects greater parasympathetic regulation of the heart</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Emotion regulation at 12 months after the intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Measured as change in negative affect (from responses to the self-assessment manikin on a 9-point scale) from before to after a mental challenge; less increase in negative affect score suggests better emotion regulation</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Emotional well-being at 12 months after the intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The primary index of emotional well-being will be depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiology Studies Depression scale); a lower score on this measure indicates less depressive symptoms</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Immune aging</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Identified from blood samples; lower levels of inflammation (measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay) and T-lymphocyte profiles that reflect larger ratios of naïve T-cells relative to mature T-cells (measured from flow cytometry) will index less aging of the immune system</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  English-speaking (consent process and assessments will be conducted in English only)

          -  Currently living with, and the primary caregiver for, a spouse with dementia—for the
             purposes of this study, &quot;spouse&quot; may also include couples who had divorced or were
             legally separated from each other, or who had never married each other but were in
             established relationships ('significant others').

          -  Currently experiencing moderate to high levels of perceived stress and caregiver
             burden. Spousal caregivers will be screened for stress levels and caregiving burden
             using the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS 10) and the Modified Caregiver Strain
             Index (MCSI), respectively. Caregivers scoring above the population mean (approx.) on
             the PSS 10 (&gt; 11), reporting at least moderate caregiver strain (score &gt; 5) on the
             MCSI will be eligible for participation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  cognitive impairment or dementia (identified by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment
             (MoCA) score &lt; 24)

          -  current major depression (current Major Depression diagnosis and/or Geriatric
             Depression Scale (GDS 15) score &gt; 10)

          -  no recent (within 2 months) major surgery

          -  History of events that cause neurological injury (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic
             attack, traumatic brain injury or head injury with loss of consciousness)

          -  Serious psychiatric or alcohol/substance use disorders, including current alcohol
             dependence, current non-alcohol psychoactive substance use dependence, psychotic
             disorders or features (current and lifetime), bipolar disorder (determined from Mini
             International Neuropsychiatric Exam (MINI) modules)

          -  Autoimmune disorder (e.g., Crohn's disease, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis)

          -  Active neoplastic disease or receiving immunosuppressive therapy for cancer (or &lt; 6
             months post-chemo or radiation) or other diseases (&lt; 3 months prior to enrollment)

          -  No significant immunodeficiency disorder (e.g., alymphocytosis, hepatitis B or C, HIV)

          -  Serious cardiovascular disease (e.g., congestive heart failure, pacemaker) or
             myocardial infarction within past 6 months

          -  Physical condition precluding required activities as part of the computerized
             cognitive training (e.g., inability to use a computer mouse; inadequate visual acuity)
