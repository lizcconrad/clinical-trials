  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Project IMPACT is a school-based health center intervention program that institutes
      guideline-based chronic asthma care and provides supervised administration with daily
      preventive asthma medications to improve asthma symptoms and lung function, reduce emergency
      visits, and decrease missed days of school among children from communities with health
      disparities.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Project IMPACT in schools is a 7 month randomized control intervention pilot trial. Sixty
      students, ages 6 to 16 years, with moderate to severe asthma, or who utilize acute care
      facilities frequently for their asthma, will be recruited from 3 urban SBHCs in the fall of
      2017. All students will receive NHLBI guideline-based asthma assessments to determine
      eligibility and proper dosing of preventive medication. The asthma assessment will include
      spirometry testing. All enrolled students and parents will receive asthma education at the
      time of enrollment. Eligible students will be randomized to an intervention or usual care
      group using permuted block randomization stratified by SBHCs. In collaboration with the
      student's PCP, the SBHCs' mid-level providers will prescribe the preventive medication to the
      students in the intervention group. These students will receive the morning dose of their
      preventive medication from the school nurse each school day for the remainder of the school
      year. Students and their parents will be responsible to administer the evening and non-school
      day doses. Students randomized to the usual care group will be referred back to their PCP for
      further asthma management. All participants will be re-evaluated at 1, 3 and 7 months after
      enrollment, and medication dose adjustments will be made in the intervention group as needed.
