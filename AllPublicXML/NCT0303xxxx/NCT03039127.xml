      Thermotherapy is a technology aiming at destroying tissue, for example tumor tissue.
      Immunostimulating Interstitial Laser Thermotherapy (imILT) is a specific form of
      thermotherapy, which, in addition to destroying tumor tissue, has been optimized to cause a
      tumor specific immunologic response. In laboratory animals the imILT method has also been
      shown to induce a so called abscopal effect. This means that when one tumor is treated with
      imILT other, untreated, tumors also decrease in size. The immunologic response has previously
      been characterized in breast cancer patients after receiving imILT treatment , and presumed
      abscopal effects induced by imILT have also been described in a malignant melanoma patient.

      The purpose of this trial is to investigate the functionality and safety of the imILT
      treatment method in patients diagnosed with breast cancer.

      The treatment method has successfully been used for treatment of patients with breast cancer
      and malignant melanoma. Treatment of breast cancer patients caused an increase of cytotoxic T
      lymphocytes in the treated tumor, as well as activated dendritic cells at the tumor border.
      Regulatory T lymphocytes decreased in the regional lymph nodes.

      This trial is explorative, prospective, open and non-randomized. Five breast cancer patients
      will be treated in this trial, which is estimated to be carried out during a time period of 9
      months.
