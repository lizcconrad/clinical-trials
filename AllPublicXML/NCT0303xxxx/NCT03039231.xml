      The Freespira Breathing System (FBS) developed by Palo Alto Health Sciences, Inc, is a
      portable home device , and has been employed in breathing biofeedback in adults with panic
      disorder (PD). The FBS has received FDA clearance for the treatment of PD adults and is
      currently commercially available.

      This study is a prospective, single arm, un-blinded investigation of the Freespira Breathing
      System in the PTSD population.

    <description>The Freespira Breathing System (FBS) developed by Palo Alto Health Sciences, Inc, is a portable home device used for breathing biofeedback in adults with panic disorder (PD). FBS has received FDA clearance for the treatment of PD adults and is currently commercially available with more than 150 therapist providing the treatment nationally. FBS has not yet been tested for efficacy in an adult post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) population. It has been suggested that there is overlap in the presence and persistence of symptoms between PD and PTSD patients. The primary goal of this study is to determine whether the FBS will produce similar benefit (both in quality and magnitude) in the defined population of patients with PTSD.</description>
