  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are interested in learning more about choline, a nutrient required by the
      body. The body does make some choline, but it does not make enough to support health and the
      rest must be acquired through diet. Eggs, and especially egg yolks, are a major dietary
      source of choline. Choline can also be given as a dietary supplement. Ingestion of choline
      supplements has been linked to an increased concentration of a compound called TMAO
      (trimethylamine N-oxide). Elevated TMAO levels have been linked to higher heart disease risk.
      With this study, the investigators hope to learn whether there is a difference in the way
      your body responds to the ingestion of a choline supplement versus the choline found within
      eggs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The principal goal for the study is to examine whether there is a difference between the
      ingestion of choline through supplements versus choline found within eggs on plasma TMAO
      levels. The investigators have previously shown that dietary intake of trimethylamines,
      including the choline group of phosphatidylcholine (PC), is mechanistically linked to
      cardiovascular disease risk and that the metabolism of these trimethylamine nutrients in
      humans is modulated by the intestinal microbes (gut microbes). Additionally, extensive animal
      studies link an essential role of gut microbiota to the metabolism of choline and the
      production of metabolites that promote / accelerate atherosclerotic processes. The
      investigators have also recently shown a 10-fold increase in plasma TMAO levels following
      supplementation with choline bitartrate supplements. However, another pilot study by a
      collaborator (unpublished) did not show the same increase in plasma TMAO levels following the
      ingestion of whole eggs, a major dietary source of choline. Therefore, with this study the
      investigators wish to examine the differences, if any, between the ingestion of an equivalent
      mass of total choline in the free form (as bitartrate salt) as a supplement vs. within whole
      eggs.

      Eggs, and specifically the egg yolk, contain a large amount of total choline. However, egg
      white contains potential anti-microbial peptides that could influence gut microbial
      composition and function, and therefore impact conversion of choline into TMA and TMAO
      observed in subjects. Therefore, the investigators hypothesize that the consumption of whole
      eggs (hardboiled) will not elevate plasma TMAO levels to the same extent as a comparable
      amount of total choline ingested in capsule form as the choline bitartrate salt. The
      investigators further hypothesize that the consumption of egg white with choline bitartrate
      tablets may result in less of a rise in TMAO levels than ingestion of the choline bitartrate
      supplement alone.
