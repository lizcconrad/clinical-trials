  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PI is studying if sorafenib/hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) will have improved efficacy when
      compared to sorafenib alone and in patients progressing of sorafenib the addition of HCQ
      would lead to disease stability in patients with advanced hepatocellular cancer (HCC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase 2 study with two cohorts:

      Cohort 1: As second-line treatment, we will add HCQ to SOR dose the patient was tolerating at
      the time of progression.

      Cohort 2: SOR-naïve patients receive SOR 400 mg by PO twice daily on Cycle1 Day1 (C1D1). On
      Cycle 1 Day 15, HCQ 400 mg PO daily will be started. In clinical practice, dose reduction of
      SOR may be required. On C1D15 SOR maybe kept as starting dose or reduced for toxicity. On
      Cycle 2 Day 1 of toxicity of HCQ and SOR will be assessed.

      Each cycle is 28 days.

      Blood samples will be collected at Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 1 Day 15 and Cycle 2 Day 1 to assess
      for biomarkers.

      Disease evaluation every 2 cycles.

      Dose reductions due to adverse events are allowed for both sorafenib per standard of care
      and/or HCQ for grade 3 or more adverse event was related to study medication. Dose reductions
      are also permitted based on investigator clinical decision.

    <description>Sorafenib (SOR)-naïve patients receive SOR 400 mg by PO twice daily on Cycle1/Day1 (C1D1). In clinical practice, dose reduction of SOR is often required. Therefore, on C1D15, the clinician will dose-reduce sorafenib based on toxicity and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) 400 mg PO daily will be started. C2D1 of each cohort, toxicity of HCQ will be assessed. Dose reductions due to adverse events (AEs) to each agent are allowed for SOR per standard of care and/or HCQ for grade 3+ AE.</description>

          -  Not a candidate for curative treatments (i.e., resection, transplantation)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients receiving prior therapy with HCQ.

          -  Patients with uncontrolled brain metastases. Patients with brain metastases must be
             asymptomatic and off corticosteroids for at least one week.

          -  Due to risk of disease exacerbation, patients with psoriasis are ineligible unless the
             disease is well controlled, and they are under the care of a specialist for the
             disorder who agrees to monitor the patient for exacerbations.

          -  Patients with previously documented macular degeneration or or untreated diabetic
             retinopathy (stable retinopathy is allowed).

             composition to HCQ.

          -  Patients requiring the use of enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic medication (phenytoin,
             carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone or oxcarbazepine) are not eligible for entry
             into the study.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  QTc &gt; 500 milliseconds (ms) at baseline.

          -  Gastrointestinal tract disease resulting in an inability to take oral medication or a
             requirement for IV alimentation, prior surgical procedures affecting absorption, or
             active peptic ulcer disease. Patients with NG-tube, J-tube, or G-tube will not be
             allowed to participate.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because sorafenib has the potential for
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects. For this reason, women of childbearing potential
             and men must also agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of
             birth control) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation.

          -  Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this
             study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Because there is an
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with sorafenib, breastfeeding should be discontinued.

          -  Informed Consent - No study specific procedures will be performed without a written
             and signed informed consent document. Patients who do not demonstrate the ability to
             understand or the willingness to sign the written informed consent document will be
             excluded from study entry.
