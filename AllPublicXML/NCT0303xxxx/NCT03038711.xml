             clinically significant arrhythmias, sinus syndrome, hypertension, symptomatic
             orthostatic hypotension, atrioventricular block of any degree, bradycardia, syncope,
             clinically significant ECG abnormalities, or any congenital heart disease

          -  Patients with any acute or chronic bacterial, fungal (except history of tinea pedis or
             ongoing onychomycosis will not be exclusionary) or viral infection within the last 3
             months prior to screening, as well as any febrile illness or viral infection within
             the last 3 months prior to screening, as well as any febrile illness of unknown origin
             within 14 days of screening

          -  Patients who have received any live vaccines within 1 month of study drug
             administration, or who plan to have a live vaccine at any time during the study,
             including during the follow up period
