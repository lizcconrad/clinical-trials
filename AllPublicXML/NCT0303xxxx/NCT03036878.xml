      To evaluate the use of ReNu™ allograft for the augmentation of marrow stimulation for
      osteochondral lesions
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-randomized, longitudinal study of up to 8 evaluable participants
      recruited from two separate practices. Male and non-pregnant female patients between the ages
      of 18 and 55 years of age will be screened for study recruitment. Female patients must be
      actively practicing a contraception method, abstinence, be surgically sterilized, or be
      postmenopausal. Participants will receive ReNu™ as an adjunct to their standard of care
      marrow stimulation for the treatment of osteochondral defects.

      At each follow-up visit, concomitant medications and adverse events shall be collected from
      each subject, and each subject shall complete the following questionnaires:

      IKDC Health Assessment (Includes Short Form-36) Tegner KOOS Knee Survey VAS Pain Scale SANE
      score

      The subjects will be assessed at Baseline using these scales an again at all subsequent study
      follow-up visits.
