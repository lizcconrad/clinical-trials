  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bladder and sexual dysfunction consistently ranks as one of the top disorders affecting
      quality of life after spinal cord injury. The insights of how activity-based training affects
      bladder function may prove to be useful to other patient populations with bladder and sexual
      dysfunction such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's, and stroke, as well as stimulate
      investigations of training's effects within other systems such as bowel dysfunction.
      Locomotor training could help promote functional recovery and any insights gained from these
      studies will enhance further investigation of the effect of bladder functioning after spinal
      cord injury. In addition, as suggested by a study of one of our initial participants, a
      reduction in the use and/or dosage of medication to enhance sexual function is a possible
      outcome, medications which carry risks and side effects.

      Objectives: To determine the effects of weight-bearing task-specific training for locomotion
      (stepping on a treadmill) after traumatic incomplete and complete spinal cord injury in
      humans on a) urodynamic parameters and b) sexual function outcomes. Weight-bearing
      (stand-only) and non-weight-bearing exercise (i.e. arm crank) will serve as controls.
