    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1b dose escalation study of the safety and pharmacodynamics of brontictuzumab
      in combination with chemotherapy for subjects with previously treated metastatic colorectal
      cancer. This study consists of a screening period, a treatment period and a post-treatment
      follow up period in which patients will be followed for survival for up to 24 months.
      Patients will be enrolled in two stages: a dose-escalation stage and an expansion phase.

      Approximately 34 patients will be enrolled in this study at approximately 5 study centers in
      the United States.
