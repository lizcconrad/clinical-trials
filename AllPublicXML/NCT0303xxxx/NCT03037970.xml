  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ABSOLVE Biologic Wound Matrix is a combination of recombinant human platelet-derived growth
      factor BB homodimer (rhPDGF-BB) and a bovine type I collagen wound dressing matrix. ABSOLVE
      is under development for the treatment of chronic and acute wounds. This study investigates
      the safety and efficacy of ABSOLVE in chronic diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with diabetes are at risk for developing serious health problems that may affect the
      feet, eyes, kidneys, skin and heart. Foot ulcerations are of great significance to the lives
      of millions of diabetic patients, representing one of the most common and serious
      complications in these patients. Up to 25% of diabetics will develop a diabetic foot ulcer
      (DFU) at some point in their lifetime. The prevalence of DFUs among diabetics is 4% to 10%.
      More than half of all foot ulcers will become infected requiring hospitalization and 1 in 5
      will require amputation. Foot ulcers account for 85,000 non-trauma related lower limb
      amputations annually in the USA. Every 20 seconds, somewhere in the world, a limb is lost as
      a consequence of diabetes. Moreover, 85% of leg amputations are preceded by DFUs and more
      than 60% of non-traumatic lower extremity amputations (LEA) performed in the United States
      each year occurs secondary to complications of diabetes mellitus. After a major amputation,
      50% of patients will have another limb amputated within two years. Mortality rates subsequent
      to amputation are alarmingly high - up to 40% at 1 year and 80% at 5 years. Patients with a
      history of a DFU have a 40% greater mortality rate compared to patients with diabetes alone.
      Improved treatments for DFUs are clearly a matter of great significance.

      In this study, the investigation will be focused on the safety and efficacy of ABSOLVE in
      treating diabetic foot ulcers.
