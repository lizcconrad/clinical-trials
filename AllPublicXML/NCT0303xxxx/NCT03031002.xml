  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with anxiety disorders oftentimes express fear responses to more than only one
      fear-inducing object. The principal aim of this study is to examine whether the beneficial
      effects of exposure on fear reduction in spider phobia can extend to stimuli which are
      conceptually similar to spiders (i.e. cockroaches), but have never been presented during the
      respective treatment.

      Fear extinction has evolved as the central mechanism underlying exposure-based treatments.
      Findings from conditioning studies indicate that fear reduction following a fear extinction
      procedure can generalize from the extinction stimulus to other conceptually and perceptually
      related stimuli. This study is aimed at translating these findings to a clinical application
      and will hence examine whether the basic principles of extinction generalization are
      applicable to exposure.

      Patients with spider phobia will either receive two sessions of in-vivo exposure with spiders
      or no treatment. Prior to as well as after treatment, patient's fear of spiders will be
      assessed using the Behavioral Approach Test (BATs) and self-report questionnaires. In
      addition, BATs with cockroaches will be conducted to examine the effects of exposure therapy
      on extinction generalization.
