  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety is a common problem encountered in a about 43 % of critically ill patients. Its
      occurrence can be related to several causes, mainly dominated by invasive procedures.

      anxiety management is typically based on a combination of prevention, evaluation, and
      therapeutic agents. However, it appears important to develop adjuvant approaches. Touch
      massage is one of them and that has been evaluated in various medical conditions.

      The aim of our study is to evaluate the anxiolytic effect of touch massage in critically ill
      patients during potentially painful nursing procedures.
