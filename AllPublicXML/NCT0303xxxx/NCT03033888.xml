  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal is to build a sustainable, community-based outreach program to promote
      cervical cancer screening among women living with HIV (WLH), thereby reducing related
      morbidity and mortality. The strategy for achieving this goal is to develop an intervention
      incorporating health literacy approaches and principles of community-based participatory
      research. Health literacy is a relatively new concept that has been applied mainly toward
      identifying high-risk individuals rather than toward changing health behaviors and outcomes.
      The proposed intervention is the first to integrate health literacy into educating WLH to
      promote cervical cancer screening. Community Health Workers (CHW) support has also rarely
      been incorporated into cancer screening interventions targeting WLH, making the proposed
      intervention a uniquely comprehensive approach. Building on recent successful testing by the
      investigators of a health literacy-focused intervention to promote cervical cancer screening
      in recent immigrant women, the investigators will test whether health literacy-focused
      interventions delivered by trained CHWs will be effective in promoting health literacy and
      increasing Pap test rates in a new population, WLH. The investigators hypothesize that,
      compared to WLH in the control group, WLH who receive the health literacy-focused CHW
      intervention will demonstrate: (1) higher rates of Pap test, (2) greater levels of health
      literacy, (3) higher levels of cervical cancer knowledge, and (4) higher self-efficacy.

    <description>Participants medical records will be audited to verify completion of a Pap test within 6 months of completing baseline survey. The measure of completion of Pap testing by 6 months after baseline visit will be tested using a one-sided, two-group test of proportions set at an alpha of 0.05. Known covariates of Pap test screening (e.g., age, education, insurance, and provider recommendation) will be controlled in the analyses.</description>

    <measure>Change scores for health literacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Health Literacy scores will be measured using Assessment of Health Literacy-Cancer, a cervical cancer specific instrument with 52 items. Scores on the scale range from 0-52 with a score &gt; 26 signifying a high health literacy score and scores &lt;26 signifying low health literacy score. The rationale for using change scores is to account for differences in baseline performance for study participants, and to focus on improvement in scores after intervention. Differences in change scores between groups will be tested using a one-sided, two-group test of means with p=0.05</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change scores for cervical cancer knowledge</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Cervical cancer knowledge will be measured with the Cervical Cancer Knowledge Test, a 22- item which measures knowledge of cervical cancer using a binary (true/false) scale. Higher scores indicate higher cervical cancer knowledge. The rationale for using change scores is to account for differences in baseline performance for study participants, and to focus on improvement in scores after intervention. Differences in change scores between groups will be tested using a one-sided, two-group test of means with p=0.05</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change scores for self-efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Self-efficacy will be measured with the Self Efficacy Scale, a 4- item instrument which measures how confident a woman is in carrying out tasks in relation to Pap testing. Higher scores indicate higher self-efficacy. The rationale for using change scores is to account for differences in baseline performance for study participants, and to focus on improvement in scores after intervention. Differences in change scores between groups will be tested using a one-sided, two-group test of means with p=0.05</description>

    <description>Intervention includes: Trained community health workers will deliver 1) 1.5-2 hour health literacy training offered in a group format at an approved community site that is most convenient to the majority of participants ; and 2) monthly phone follow-up and navigation assistance for 6 months. We will offer a Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) mobile app for participant's adolescent/young adult child (11-26 yrs), as an option rather than part of the standardized protocol. The app will be introduced at the end of the health literacy group training session for the intervention group; those who choose to download the app will be given a link with study specific password. They will be encouraged to go through the key HPV related contents with their children at home at a time that is most convenient for them.</description>
