  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a Phase I, first in human, monocenter study, aiming at assessing the safety and
      immunogenicity of a genetically detoxified pertussis toxin (PT) when administered via the
      cutaneous route with Viaskin patches to healthy volunteers at 2 different doses of 25 mcg or
      50 mcg PT protein compared to Viaskin placebo.

      Two cohorts of 30 subjects will be successively enrolled. Safety of the product will be
      assessed throughout the 10-week study and its immunogenicity will be assessed at regular
      intervals with collection of blood samples for immunological analyses.

      Four weeks after the second Viaskin application (at Day 42 of the study), all subjects will
      receive a dose of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine (Boostrix® dTpa) to ensure the optimal
      recall of their immunity against pertussis.
