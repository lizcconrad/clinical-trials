      Thus study aims to characterize the local, nerve-specific effects of acupuncture on the
      median and ulnar nerves in the forearm, using nerve conduction studies and quantitative
      sensory testing. All participant will have carpal tunnel syndrome and the affected median
      nerve will be compared to the healthy ulnar nerve. Additionally, we aim to compare the local,
      nerve-specific effect of manual acupuncture to that of low-frequency electroacupuncture and
      of high-frequency electroacupuncture.

      The purpose of this study is to measure the local effects of acupuncture on the median and
      ulnar nerves in patients with median neuropathy at the wrist (carpal tunnel syndrome), using
      nerve conduction studies (NCS) and quantitative sensory testing (QST) as outcomes. Our
      secondary aim is to compare acupuncture's effect on the functioning of a diseased nerve
      (median nerve in CTS) to its effect on a healthy nerve (ulnar). Additionally, we aim to
      compare the local, nerve-specific effect of manual acupuncture to that of low-frequency
      electroacupuncture and of high-frequency electroacupuncture.

      In a mechanistic study of acupuncture, 60 subjects with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) will be
      randomized to manual acupuncture (MA), low-frequency electroacupuncture (LF-EA) and
      high-frequency electroacupuncture (HF-EA) groups. Baseline measurements will consist of QST
      (vibration and cold detection thresholds), as well as NCS of both median and ulnar nerves.
      Then, each group will undergo acupuncture to the median nerve (Pericardium channel points)
      and to the ulnar nerve (Heart channel points), one week apart, order counterbalanced,
      followed by post-acupuncture NCS and QST measurements in both nerves' territories.

    <measure>Change in Cold Detection Threshold (CDT) post-acupuncture compared to pre-acupuncture</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1, Week 2</time_frame>
    <description>Cold Detection Threshold (CDT) will be assessed using the Computer-Aided Sensory Evaluator IV (CASE IV) System (WR MEDICAL ELECTRONICS CO. Maplewood, MN, USA).
The CASE IV Thermal Stimulator uses a four‑degree‑per‑second ramp up and down, and is typically operated in a range from 8 degrees to 50 degrees C., with an accuracy of 1.25 to 0.25 degrees C., depending on temperature. For high-magnitude thermal (cooling) stimuli, the absolute temperature is limited to 8 degrees C. Thermal stimuli are approximately 6 seconds in duration. CDT will be assessed over the thenar eminence and hypothenar eminence with the hand on an even surface, supinated and palm facing up.
The CDT will be determined using the 4, 2 and 1 stimulus presentation algorithm, developed by Dyck et al (Dyck PJ, O'Brien PC, Kosanke JL, Gillen DA, Karnes JL. A 4, 2, and 1 stepping algorithm for quick and accurate estimation of cutaneous sensation threshold. Neurology. 1993 Aug;43(8):1508-12.)</description>

    <measure>Change in Vibration Detection Threshold (VDT) post-acupuncture compared to pre-acupuncture</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1, Week 2</time_frame>
    <description>VDT will be assessed using the Computer-Aided Sensory Evaluator IV (CASE IV) System (WR MEDICAL ELECTRONICS CO. Maplewood, MN, USA).
Vibration Stimuli will be delivered as 25 discrete levels ranging from 0.0 to 350 micrometers (μm) of displacement, based on previously established &quot;Just Noticeable Difference&quot; (JND) values. Each stimulus is presented with an exponential onset, and turns off with an exponential decay, in order to eliminate the touch-pressure artifact, which is caused by an instantaneous on/off. Stimulation will be delivered to the lateral aspect of the 2nd digit nailbed and the lateral aspect of the 5th digit nailbed, with the hand on an even surface, pronated and palm down.
The VDT will be determined using the 4, 2 and 1 stimulus presentation algorithm. Dyck PJ, O'Brien PC, Kosanke JL, Gillen DA, Karnes JL. A 4, 2, and 1 stepping algorithm for quick and accurate estimation of cutaneous sensation threshold. Neurology. 1993 Aug;43(8):1508-12.</description>
