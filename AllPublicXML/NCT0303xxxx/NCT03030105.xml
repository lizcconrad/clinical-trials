      This is a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 6-period crossover study to
      evaluate the effects of BPN14770 10 mg and 50 mg in reversing scopolamine-induced cognitive
      impairment in healthy volunteers. A positive control, donepezil 10 mg, will be included, and
      additivity of BPN14770 50 mg to donepezil 10 mg in reversing scopolamine effects will also be
      evaluated.

      A total of 38 subjects will be enrolled into the study. The study duration will be up to 12
      weeks with 6 weeks of single-dose Treatment Visits. The study will consist of a Screening
      Visit (up to 28 days prior to first study drug administration), six inpatient Treatment
      Visits (Periods 1 through 6), and a Follow-Up/Early Termination Visit (7-10 days after the
      last dose of study medication). An additional study visit may be necessary to complete the
      required cognitive test familiarization if not completed during the Screening Visit. Each
      Treatment Visit will occur approximately one week apart, allowing a 6 to 8 day washout
      period.

      Subjects will be randomized to 1 of 6 treatment sequences based on a computer-generated
      randomization schedule. Subjects will receive all 6 treatments as specified by the treatment
      sequence according to a 6 Ã— 6 Williams Latin square design. The following treatments will be
      administered:

      A. Scopolamine placebo + BPN14770 placebo + donepezil placebo

      B. Scopolamine 0.5 mg + BPN14770 placebo + donepezil placebo

      C. Scopolamine 0.5 mg + BPN14770 10 mg + donepezil placebo

      D. Scopolamine 0.5 mg + BPN14770 50 mg + donepezil placebo

      E. Scopolamine 0.5 mg + donepezil 10 mg +BPN14770 placebo

      F. Scopolamine 0.5 mg + BPN14770 50 mg + donepezil 10 mg

      During each of the Treatment Visits (Periods 1 through 6), subjects will be admitted to the
      Clinical Research Unit (CRU) the day prior to each study drug administration (Day -1) and
      discharged the day after study drug administration (Day 2). On the morning of study drug
      administration (Day 1), subjects will be given study drug (BPN14770, donepezil, or placebo)
      with 240mL of room temperature water 2 hours prior to the scopolamine or scopolamine placebo
      sc injection. The timing for study drug administration will be referred to as t-2 (Hour -2).
      Breakfast should be available approximately 30 minutes following the morning drug
      administration. Two hours after study drug administration, the scopolamine or scopolamine
      placebo sc injection will be administered. The time at which the scopolamine or scopolamine
      placebo sc injection is administered will be referred to as t0 (Hour 0).

      Cognitive testing will be performed 30 minutes prior to treatment with scopolamine injection
      and at hours 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 post-scopolamine injection.

      PK samples will be collected during the treatment period to confirm study drug is present.

      Safety assessments throughout the study will include physical exams, ECGs, vital signs,
      chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis.

          2. Body mass index between 18 kg/m2 to 33 kg/m2, inclusive, and body weight of &gt;50 kg
             (110 pounds).

          3. Female subjects must be surgically sterile (bilateral tubal ligation, hysterectomy, or
             bilateral oophorectomy at least 6 months prior to first study drug administration), at
             least two years post-menopausal, or willing to either (1) utilize hormonal
             contraception plus use one barrier method or (2) use two barrier methods of

             Barrier methods of contraception include diaphragm, cervical cap, male condom, female
             condom, and spermicidal foam and sponges. An intrauterine device (IUD) is also
             considered a barrier method of contraception in this study; if the subject is using an
             IUD, she will need to use an additional barrier method of contraception. Menopausal
             status will be verified by testing for follicle stimulating hormone (FSH â‰¥25 mIU/mL)
             at Screening. In addition, all females must have a negative blood test for pregnancy
             within 28 days during the Screening period and negative urine test for pregnancy on
             Day-1 of each Treatment Visit regardless of childbearing potential.

          4. Male subjects must be willing to inform female partners of their participation in the
             study and must agree to use adequate contraceptive methods (vasectomy performed at
             least 6 months prior to first study drug administration, or use at least one barrier
             method of birth control).

          5. Able to understand the study procedures, voluntarily consent to participate in this
             study, and provide written informed consent prior to start of any study-specific
             procedures.

          6. Willing and able to remain in the study unit for the required periods and return for
             each treatment of the six treatment periods, including the outpatient visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          8. Clinically important or significant conduction abnormalities on single ECG or evidence
             or history of long QT syndrome based on supine ECG values obtained at Screening.
             Out-of-range results may be repeated once at Screening.

          9. Current or past history of gastric or duodenal ulcers or other diseases of the
             gastrointestinal tract that could interfere with absorption of study drug. Note:
             Subjects with a history of appendectomy or cholecystectomy may be enrolled.

             drugs, sedative antihistamines, or other centrally active medications [e.g., CNS-
             penetrant beta blockers], and moderate to strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4,
             CYP2D6, or other cytochromes) 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug (Period 1,
             Day 1) and during the study (Follow-Up). Other prescription or non-prescription drugs
             such as antihypertensive or cholesterol lowering drugs are allowed, if, in the
             Investigator's judgement, they would not interfere with the study medication or the
             cognitive testing.

         12. Unable to discontinue and abstain from over-the-counter, herbal preparations, dietary
             supplements, nutraceuticals, vitamins and minerals at least 7 days prior to the first
