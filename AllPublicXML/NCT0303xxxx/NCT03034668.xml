    <textblock>
      Purpose: To evaluate the acute and chronic effects of a botanical supplement on strength,
      muscle function, and lean body mass

      Participants: The acute phase will include 30 participants, and the chronic phase will
      include 84 participants. All participants must be healthy recreationally active males between
      the ages of 18 and 35 years.

      Procedures (methods):

      Acute phase: Participants will complete three testing visits as part of as part of a
      cross-over design, during which strength and muscle function will be assessed prior to and
      following consumption of a supplement. The experimental supplement is a blend of the
      botanical extracts; treatment arms will include a full dose (FULL; 350 mg capsule), half dose
      (HALF; 175 mg plus maltodextrin), or placebo (PLA; maltodextrin).

      Chronic phase: Body composition, muscle cross-sectional area, a complete blood count and
      metabolic panel, subjective surveys, and strength will be measured prior to and following an
      8-week supervised resistance training program, in conjunction with daily supplementation of
      FULL, HALF, or PLA.
