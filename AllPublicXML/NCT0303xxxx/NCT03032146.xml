  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to examine the contribution of a cardiac rehabilitation program on
      the active participation in daily life six months after an acute coronary event.

      100 patients will be recruited for the study, 3-10 months after a myocardial infarction and
      hospitalization in the Emek Medical Center in Afula, Israel.

      50 patients recruited for the study who had participated in cardiac rehabilitation will be
      the experimental group. 50 patients who have not participated in rehabilitation- will be the
      control group. The groups will be matched for diagnosis, sex and age. Sociodemographic data
      on patients will be taken from the medical records of the cardiology department and the
      Cardiac Rehabilitation Institute of the Emek Medical Center..

      Course of study: Participants will sign an informed consent form and fill out questionnaires
      that evaluate active participation in the community. In addition, the physical function and
      muscle strength of the participants will be evaluated with designated tests. The duration of
      each meeting will be 60 minutes.

      HYPOTHESES

        1. Patients who participate in a cardiac rehabilitation program will exhibit higher indices
           of participation in the community than patients who do not participate.

        2. Patients who participate in a cardiac rehabilitation program will display higher levels
           of physical activity when compared with patients who do not participate.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac rehabilitation is a multidisciplinary framework which focuses on improving the
      functioning of heart disease patients to facilitate and optimize the return to a regular
      routine as early as possible. The rehabilitation program provides the tools for the
      maintenance of a healthy lifestyle, encouraging participants to take part in recreational
      activities and includes extending their daily functioning. (IADL- Instrumental Activities of
      Daily Living). A sedentary lifestyle is a major risk factor for heart disease. Increased
      levels of physical activity and an active lifestyle have a beneficial effect on most of the
      risk factors for the heart and blood vessels, including lipid profile, blood pressure and
      body composition.

      In addition to the purely physical component, active participation in managing the household,
      returning to work and leisure activities in the community, have a positive impact on the
      mental state and contribute to the quality of life of cardiac patients.

      Few studies address the return to a normal social life, most focus on the return to work.
      Since most cardiac rehabilitation program participants are pensioners, it is important to
      examine other aspects of their participation in society and everyday life in order to measure
      the effectiveness of a cardiac rehabilitation program.

      The setting up of an initial interview and approval in principle to take part in the study
      will be arranged with a telephone call to the potential participant and a date will be
      determined for the meeting..

      The interview will be conducted in the subject's home. The interviewer will make sure that
      the participant understands and agrees to the terms of the research. The participant then
      will fill in and sign a consent form giving the hospital authorization to use his personal
      details and medical data (gender, age, religion, place of residence).
