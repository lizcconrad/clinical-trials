      In this pilot study, the investigators will determine the response of the natriuretic peptide
      (NP) hormone system after a dose of intravenous dexamethasone (a steroid medication). The
      goal of the proposed project is to generate preliminary data that will be used to develop
      power calculations, inform cutoff ranges, and inform the timing of the NP response for larger
      subsequent studies aimed at developing a diagnostic test for &quot;NP deficiency,&quot; which has
      important implications for cardiometabolic risk. The investigators propose a pilot study in
      10 healthy lean individuals.

      Aim: To determine the range of distribution and time course of natriuretic peptide (NP)
      responses to a single dose of dexamethasone IV 4 mg in healthy lean individuals.

      Hypothesis: Determination of the NP responses (the range and time course of changes in NP
      levels) to dexamethasone in 10 healthy individuals will inform the time course and frequency
      of blood sampling in a definitive prospective study designed to understand the diagnostic
      values/cutoffs of a diagnostic test, as well as enable investigators to perform a sample size
      calculation for a definitive prospective study.

    <textblock>
      The cardiac natriuretic peptide (NP) system may protect against the development of
      cardiometabolic risk. The classical actions of the natriuretic peptides include natriuresis,
      vasodilation, and inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which
      support a key role for these hormones in blood pressure regulation. There is accumulating
      biological evidence that the NPs have a wide range of favorable metabolic effects as well,
      including reduced fat accumulation, activation of brown fat, and improved glucose tolerance.
      These results suggest that the NPs may help protect against cardiometabolic risk.

      Despite a propensity for hypertension and hypervolemia, obese individuals have reduced NP
      levels.1,2 Low NP levels may reflect a &quot;deficiency&quot; in obese persons, as opposed to an
      appropriate response to cardiovascular stimuli. Such a deficiency could have a deleterious
      impact on cardiometabolic risk, creating a &quot;vicious cycle&quot; by which obese individuals have
      increased susceptibility to further fat accumulation and glucose intolerance via impaired NP
      production.

      As stated above, NP hormones may protect against cardiometabolic risk. Large epidemiologic
      studies have shown that resting NP levels are lower in certain groups of individuals.
      However, it is difficult to say for certain whether these low resting levels of NPs reflect a
      true &quot;deficiency,&quot; as a low NP level may be biologically appropriate in certain situations
      (e.g. if an individual is volume depleted). At this time, there is no test to diagnose &quot;NP
      deficiency.&quot;

      Studies in animals suggest that glucocorticoids potently stimulate NP production. There are
      limited studies in humans showing that glucocorticoids stimulate NP production; however, the
      NP response specifically to dexamethasone, the glucocorticoid which has been shown in animal
      data to potently stimulate NP production, has not been defined in humans.

      Moreover, the range of normal responses to glucocorticoids in healthy individuals is not
      well-defined. Understanding this range of normal responses is an important first step in
      developing a diagnostic tool to detect NP deficiency. The investigators propose a pilot study
      to characterize the NP response (range of NP levels, time course of response) to
      dexamethasone in healthy controls. This data will be used to develop power calculations and
      inform cutoff ranges for future studies aimed at developing a diagnostic test for &quot;NP
      deficiency.&quot; Developing a test to diagnose NP deficiency could have potentially important
      clinical implications in understanding cardiometabolic risk.
