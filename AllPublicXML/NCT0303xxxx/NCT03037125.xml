  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Split crest technique is a technique for horizontal bone augmentation used in case of narrow
      alveolar ridges as an alternative to the more aggressive techniques such as onlay bone
      grafting, guided bone regeneration (GBR) and distraction osteogenesis

      The study goal is to evaluate whether if there will be any benefit of using platelet rich
      fibrin (PRF) with the split crest technique regarding bone width gain and healing response in
      comparison with split crest technique alone, where PRF is considered an autologous, growth
      factor containing material which is easy to collect and is of low cost.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with at least one missing tooth in the maxillary region

          2. All the selected patients have a bucco-palatal width of the edentulous alveolar ridge
             from 3.5-5.5mm.

          3. All the selected patients have at least 12 mm residual bone height at the edentulous
             area

          4. The recipient site of the implant should be free from any pathological conditions.

          5. No diagnosed bone disease or medication known to affect bone metabolism.

          6. Patients who are cooperative, motivated, and hygiene conscious.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients unable to undergo minor oral surgical procedures.

          2. Patients with a history of drug abuse or catabolic drugs.

          3. Patients with a history of psychiatric disorder.

          4. Patients with unrealistic expectations about the esthetic outcome of implant therapy.

          5. Patients with insufficient vertical inter-arch space, upon centric occlusion, to
             accommodate the available restorative components.

          6. Patients in the growth stage with partially erupted teeth.

          7. Patients who have any systemic condition that may contraindicate implant therapy.

          8. Patients who have any habits that might jeopardize the osseointegration process, such
             as smoking and alcoholism.

          9. Patients with parafunctional habits that produce overload on the implant, such as
             bruxism and clenching.
