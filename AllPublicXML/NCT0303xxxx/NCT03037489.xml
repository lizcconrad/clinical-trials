        Inclusion Criteria:

        - Previously enrolled in the MIV-711-201 study including completion of Visit 8 either by

          -  Receiving MIV-711 200 mg and had non-significant clinical worsening on the primary
             endpoint as defined by NRS increase of ≤2 OR by

          -  Receiving placebo and had a clinically significant worsening on the primary endpoint
             as defined by NRS increase of ≥2

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The presence of any inflammatory arthritis

          -  Any generalized pain condition that may interfere with the evaluation of the target
             knee pain (e.g., fibromyalgia) as judged by the investigator.

          -  Any clinically severe or significant uncontrolled concurrent illness, which, in the
             opinion of the Investigator, would impair ability to give informed consent or take
             part in or complete this clinical study.

          -  Known or suspected intolerance or hypersensitivity to the investigational product,
             closely related compounds, or any of the stated ingredients.
