  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies how well copper Cu-64 TP3805 positron emission tomography
      (PET)/computed tomography (CT) works in imaging patients with urothelial cancer undergoing
      surgery or biopsy. Radioactive tracers, such as copper Cu-64 TP3805, may bind to tumor cells.
      PET/CT imaging performed with copper Cu-64 TP3805 may be a better way to detect urothelial
      cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if copper Cu-64 TP3805 (Cu-64-TP3805) shall image urothelial carcinoma (UC)
      as confirmed by postsurgical or biopsy histology.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine blood clearance of Cu-64-TP3805. II. To determine in vivo stability of
      Cu-64-TP3805.

      TERTIARY:

      I. To determine if Cu-64-TP3805 is bound to malignant cells and if it is internalized.
