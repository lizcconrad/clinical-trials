      carbohydrate on free fatty acids and insulin in obese patients undergoing elective first time

      Obese patients scheduled for bypass surgery randomly assigned to three groups:

      Group I (Glucose-group): patients received 500 cc of glucose 10% containing 50 g of glucose
      and providing patients with 200 Kcal with an osmolarity of 556 mosm/L.

      Group II (Lipid-group): patients received 100 cc of lipid solution (soybean 30%, medium chain
      triglycerides 30%,olive oil 25%,fish oil 15% and 20 mg vitamine E) containing 20 g lipid and
      provides patients with 200 Kcal with an osmolarity of 380 mosm/L.

      Group III (Control-group): patients fasted overnight from 11 pm till 9 am except for clear
      fluids which were allowed till 5 am.
