      The aim of this study is to adjust and test an existing internet-based tool for collecting
      patient-reported outcome measures and to use the internet-based tool in an multidisciplinary
      follow-up of patients treated for malignant hematological diseases. The patient-reported
      outcome measurements will be used in describing the patients' health-related quality of life
      (HRQoL) and to investigate whether the HRQol will increase due to participation in
      multidisciplinary follow-up.
