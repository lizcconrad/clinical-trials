  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To test the potential and acceptance of wireless activity tracking in palliative care
      patients leaving hospital care. Explorative study, collaboration project of the Clinic of
      Radiation-Oncology, University Hospital Zurich and the Wearable Computing Laboratory, Swiss
      Federal Institut of Technology. Patients receive a tracking bracelet and a smart phone in
      order to gather objective physical activity parameters as step count, sleep duration, heart
      rate, social activity patterns (e.g. making calls) as well as subjective ratings of pain and
      distress. Quality of life (QoL) will be captured by paper questionnaire. Correlations between
      patients' physical activity patterns and the pain and distress level assessed from electronic
      scales as well as QoL-questionnaire will be performed. Acceptance will be evaluated by
      quantitative questionnaires and interviews. The proposed study is meant to be preparatory
      work for an intervention study to test the effect of wireless monitoring of palliative care
      patients on fostering early interventions for symptom relief and support of QoL.
