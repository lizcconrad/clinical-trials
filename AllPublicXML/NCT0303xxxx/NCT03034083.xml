  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the healthy marriage and relationship
      education program Elevate: Taking Your Relationship to the Next Level results in improved
      couple, parenting, and co-parenting behaviors that lead to reduced child abuse/neglect
      potential.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is based on the theory that couples can learn skills through participating in the
      Elevate curriculum that will help them function better as a couple resulting in improved
      relationship quality/stability, improved co-parenting skills, improved financial management,
      and reduced financial stress. As a result of improved relationship skills and better
      management of stress, couples will then provide more supportive, safe, and stable family
      environments for children.

      Individuals who are eligible (biological parents of children 0-18 who were removed from their
      home and were recently re-unified) and agree to participate in the study are randomly
      assigned to a treatment group or a control group. Both groups receive a needs assessment and
      referral to appropriate agencies to address their needs. Treatment group participants will
      participate in the Elevate intervention (8 hours of classes over a 4-week period).
      Individuals in the control group do not participate in the intervention but are wait-listed
      and eligible to participate in Elevate after they complete the study (12 months).

      The impact study of Elevate will examine whether participation in the study improves couple
      functioning and parenting skills and decreases instances of child abuse/neglect. Members of
      both the treatment and control groups are surveyed three times. The surveys include items
      related to couple functioning behaviors, relationship quality/stability,
      parenting/co-parenting skills, and financial management and distress. At the end of 12
      months, Georgia's Department of Family and Children Services (DFCS) will provide information
      on whether or not the families (in both the treatment and control groups) have had any
      substantiated reports of child abuse or neglect. The impact of Elevate will be measured by
      whether or not families have substantiated reports of child abuse/neglect and thereby
      re-enter the DFCS system.
