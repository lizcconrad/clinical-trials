  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing knee replacement typically report improved health-related quality of
      life, increased physical function, and reduced pain. Despite these improvements, physical
      activity levels remain unchanged, or only minimally increase from pre-operative levels, yet
      do not reach the same level of activity observed among healthy populations. Knee replacement
      patients often expect their activity levels and function to improve following surgery, but
      the majority of patients' activity levels 5 years post-operatively did not meet their
      pre-operative expectations. Even though improvements are observed in pain and function,
      reasons for the maintenance of low levels of activity are unknown. Technology has the
      potential to increase physical activity levels in these patients, particularly as 81% of knee
      replacement patients in our recent study had a smartphone, and 40% were willing to wear a
      wrist-worn physical activity monitor. As the average age of knee replacement continues to
      decrease, we anticipate that the percent of patients with a smartphone and willingness to
      wear an activity monitor will increase. In addition to technology, social support is
      associated with greater outcomes following knee replacement. Thus, wearing a wrist-worn
      physical activity monitor and providing additional opportunities for social support via the
      technology may increase physical activity levels in these patients. The current pilot study
      aims to gain preliminary data on the influence of wearables and social support on physical
      activity in knee replacement patients following surgery. Specifically, we aim to recruit 20
      patients who will be randomized to one of two conditions: Fitbit vs. Fitbit+Support.
      Participants in the Fitbit group will receive a Fitbit and be encouraged to wear it for 4
      months. Participants in the Fitbit+Support group will be asked to identify a &quot;buddy.&quot; Both
      the participant and &quot;buddy&quot; will be given a Fitbit and they will be asked to friend each
      other via Fitbit and wear the monitor for 4 months.
