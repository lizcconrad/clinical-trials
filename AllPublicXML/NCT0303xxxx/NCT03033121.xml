  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Growth hormone (GH) treatment in patients with GH deficiency (GHD) is commonly administered
      daily, although the pulsatile GH secretion is unlikely to be achieved and this regimen is
      often not complied. The auxological effect of three injections per week (TIW) regimen is
      controversial, while the metabolic effects were never evaluated in children. The objective of
      this study was to evaluate whether two different regimens of weekly injections could lead to
      similar auxological and metabolic effects in children with GHD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty-two children with growth hormone (GH) deficiency (25 males, mean age 10.5 ± 2.2 yr)
      were randomly assigned to receive daily (group A, No 16) or three injections per week (group
      B, No 16) GH therapy for 12 months.

      Auxological parameters, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), glucose and insulin during an
      oral glucose tolerance test, glycosylated hemoglobin, lipid profile, the oral disposition
      index (DIo), the homeostasis model assessment estimate of insulin resistance (Homa-IR), the
      quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) and the insulin sensitivity index (ISI)
      were evaluated in the two groups of patients.

    <description>Sixteen growth hormone (GH) deficiency children were assigned to receive daily growth hormone therapy for 12 months. The investigators used an initial weekly dose of 0.175 mg/kg (corresponding to the daily dose of 0.025 mg/Kg) of GH with a gradual increase every 6 months in order to always maintain the insulin growth factor (IGF)-I levels in the normal range. In detail, from months 1 to 6 the investigators used the mean weekly dose of 0.175 mg/kg and from months 6 to 12 the mean weekly dose of 0.20 mg/kg.</description>
