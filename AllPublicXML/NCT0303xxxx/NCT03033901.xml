  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Sleep disorders, including sleep apnea, are common after traumatic brain injury
      and affect recovery and negatively influence participation in rehabilitation. Sleep apnea is
      a breathing problem while persons sleep and causes further brain damage and problems with
      thinking, daily functioning, and overall health. Earlier diagnosis and treatment is important
      for TBI survivors to maximize the recovery process. There is little information that guides
      TBI doctors on how to identify sleep apnea during inpatient TBI rehabilitation, a phase in
      which people experience the potential for a rapid pace of improvement. The Agency for
      Healthcare Research has highlighted gaps in best methods for identifying sleep apnea and
      separately in helping consumers with TBI rehabilitation choices. Partnering with survivors,
      caregivers, and administrators, investigators developed this study to compare sleep apnea
      screening and diagnostic tools in TBI rehabilitation settings. This information will provide
      clinicians, providers, and patients with the best information for early identification of
      sleep apnea to remove negative influence on the pace of recovery in early phases after TBI.

      The Goal: Investigators will compare existing screening (Aim 1) and diagnostic tools (Aim 2)
      in TBI patients undergoing inpatient rehabilitation. For the second aim, investigators will
      determine if a more accessible diagnostic test is sufficient to diagnose sleep apnea compared
      to the traditional method used which is less accessible to consumers. If the more accessible
      test is good enough, this will increase recognition of this problem and increase patient
      access to earlier sleep apnea treatment.

      Stakeholders and Products. TBI survivors, caregivers, researchers, and policymakers working
      together on this study helped develop the study questions. Idea exchanges included ways to
      reach clinicians and TBI survivors/caregivers via existing educational programming and online
      tools for consumers such as fact sheets and patient/caregiver-focused videos. Other
      traditional methods will include targeting professional magazines, conferences, and research
      journals that reach professionals working with TBI survivors and their families at the time
      of admission to rehabilitation and during the recovery process. This study will occur at
      rehabilitation hospitals around the country who enroll TBI survivors into a lifetime study
      called the TBI Model System funded by the Dept. of Health and Human Services and VA.

    <textblock>
      Background and Significance:

      Meta-analyses of TBI studies found prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was 12 times
      higher than community-based studies. Yet, sleep apnea in those with TBI is largely
      undiagnosed. Given that sleep is critical for neural repair and disordered sleep may play a
      role in slowing functional recovery and prolonging rehabilitation, early detection of sleep
      apnea is critical (Stakeholder Input). Minimal guidance exists informing TBI and sleep
      medicine physicians regarding assessment of sleep disorders in the acute rehabilitation
      setting. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's (AHRQ) Comparative Effectiveness
      Review highlighted insufficient comparative effectiveness evidence for diagnostic and
      screening tools. This study proposes to leverage the existing TBI Model System research
      consortium (TBIMS), funded by the Departments of Health and Human Services and Veterans
      Affairs, to improve early detection of sleep apnea in patients with TBI undergoing inpatient
      rehabilitation at six study sites. Study aims are focused around components of phased testing
      for sleep apnea. Findings will inform clinician's decisions for screening and diagnostic
      tests to facilitate earlier recognition of sleep apnea (outcome) and subsequently prescribe
      appropriate treatments.

      Study Aims:

      Aim I: (Screening) For individuals with TBI, determine comparative effectiveness of 2 AASM
      endorsed screening tools (STOPBang vs. Actigraphy) to identify those at high risk of sleep
      apnea as diagnosed through Level 1 PSG. Long-term Objectives: To inform clinician's choices
      for screening measures to determine presence of sleep apnea.

      Exploratory Aim:

      Evaluate alternative screening tools (Berlin, MAPI) to Level 1 PSG in Aim 1.

      Aim II: (Diagnosis) This study will determine the diagnostic accuracy (non-inferiority) of
      Level 3 PSG in determining presence of sleep apnea in patients with acute TBI patients in the
      rehabilitation setting. Level 1 PSG will be used as the criterion standard. Long-term
      Objectives: To inform clinician's choices of diagnostic tests to determine presence of sleep
      apnea and prescribe appropriate treatments. If Level 3 portable PSG is equivalent to the less
      accessible Level 1 PSG, this will increase consumer accessibility.

      Study Design:

      This is a 3-year, multi-center prospective observational cohort study.

      Intervention and Comparators:

      In Aim I, the screening tools STOPBang and ACG will be compared against one another to
      determine their sensitivity and specificity in identifying patients with TBI at risk for
      sleep apnea. In Aim II, the non-inferiority of Level 3 PSG in determining presence and
      severity of sleep apnea in patients with moderate to severe TBI will be compared to Level 1
      PSG.

      Study Population:

      Consecutive participants to neurorehabilitation at an existing NIDILRR or VA funded TBIMS
      Center will make up the study population. Patients will be age 16 and older (18 or older at
      VA sites), with moderate to severe TBI, admitted for rehabilitation in a U.S. TBIMS inpatient
      rehabilitation facility, and sleeping &gt; 2 hours/night suggesting habitual sleep duration.
      Based on historical data from the six study sites participating in this study, investigators
      in this study conservatively estimated that 70% of patients admitted for inpatient TBI
      rehabilitation would consent into this study (N=20/month), resulting in a 13-month enrollment
      estimate of 259 patients. Power analyses of each study aim suggest that a sample size of 237
      is the largest sample size needed for sufficient power. The sites participating in this study
      aim to collectively enroll 259 patients to account for possible further attrition. Based on
      TBIMS data acquired over the past 25-years, 44% of the sample is female, 64% are categorized
      as Non-White, median age is 38 years, with predominantly moderate to severe TBI.

      Primary outcomes consist of:

      1) Positive predictive power of screening tools: STOPBang and ACG, 2) Equivalency in
      detection of sleep apnea via Level 1 and Level 3 PSG, with diagnosis of sleep apnea based on
      overall apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) &gt; 5.

      Analytic Methods:

      Aim 1: Investigators expect that STOPBang values &gt; 5 and abnormal ACG total sleep time (&lt; 5
      hours with desaturation) will produce sufficiently high SEs with reasonable tradeoff in SP
      (noting that SE and SP are inversely related). Similarly, for Level 1 PSG, a diagnosis of
      sleep apnea will be made if AHI ≥ 5. Cross-tabulations of STOPBang and ACG screening for high
      risk of sleep apnea (positive/negative) versus Level 1 PSG diagnosis (positive/negative) will
      be constructed and estimates of diagnostic accuracy (i.e., sensitivity, specificity, positive
      and negative predictive values, and diagnostic accuracy) will be estimated along with 95%
      confidence intervals. To address hypothesis 1.1, two-sided McNemar's tests will be used to
      compare the paired SEs and paired SPs between STOPBang and ACG assuming a significance level
      of α = 0.05.

      Aim 2: The sensitivity (SE) and specificity (SP) of Level 3 PSG (compared to Level 1 PSG, the
      reference gold standard) will each be estimated and compared to fixed hypothesized rates of
      SE and SP of 90% and 60%, respectively, considered sufficiently large enough. Level 1 PSG
      (reference) diagnosis of sleep apnea will be made based on AHI ≥ 5. Level 3 PSG (test)
      diagnosis will be made based AHI ≥ 5. A cross-tabulation of Level 3 PSG (positive/negative)
      versus Level 1 PSG (positive/negative) will be constructed and standard measures of
      diagnostic accuracy will be estimated along with 95% confidence intervals (i.e., sensitivity,
      specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and diagnostic accuracy).To test for
      non-inferiority of the SE to 90% and the SP to 60%, a non-inferiority threshold of 0.1 is
      assumed. If the lower bound on the 95% confidence interval for SE is strictly above 80% and
      the lower bound on the confidence interval for SP is strictly above 50% then non-inferiority
      of Level 3 PSG (compared to Level 3 PSG) can be established.
