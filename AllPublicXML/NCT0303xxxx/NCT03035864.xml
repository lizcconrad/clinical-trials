    <textblock>
      The proposed phase II study is a single-centre, randomized, double masked, parallel arm,
      vehicle-controlled trial, designed to evaluate the preliminary efficacy and safety of rhNGF
      eye drops at 20 µg/ml concentration administered six times daily for 8 weeks in patients who
      underwent cataract and corneal refractive surgery, both known to damage the corneal sensory
      nerve plexus.

      After confirmation of inclusion and exclusion criteria all eligible patients will be
      randomized at 2:1 ratio to rhNGF or vehicle control treatment with 8 weeks of study
      treatments administration with 4 weeks Follow-up.

               3. intend to become pregnant during the study treatment period or,

               4. are breast-feeding or,

                  contraceptives - oral, implanted, transdermal, or injected - and/or mechanical
                  barrier methods - spermicide in conjunction with a barrier such as a condom or
                  diaphragm or IUD (Intrauterine device) - during the entire course of and 30 days
                  after the study treatment periods.

          7. Participation in another clinical study at the same time as the present and within 30
             days of study enrolment;

          8. History of drug, medication or alcohol abuse or addiction.
