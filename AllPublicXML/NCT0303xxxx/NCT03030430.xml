      The purpose of this study is to establish PK similarity in the treatment of BAT1706 and
      comparators.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, randomized, double-blind, single-dose, 3-arm parallel group study to
      compare the PK, and to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity, of BAT1706,
      EU-Avastin and US-Avastin after a single IV infusion in healthy adult male subjects.

      A total of 129 healthy male subjects who meet the required entry criteria will be randomly
      assigned to one of three treatment groups in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a single IV infusion of
      either BAT1706, EU-Avastin or US-Avastin. A total of 117 evaluable subjects are required.

      Initially, subjects will be administered the study drug in staggered groups; the first group
      will comprise 3 subjects, the second group 6 subjects and the third group 9 subjects. Within
      each group subjects will be randomized to ensure equal numbers of subjects receive each of
      the three treatments.

      There will be at least 48 hours between administrations of study drug to each group. Prior to
      administration of study drug to the next group, the safety and tolerability findings of the
      preceding group will be reviewed by the Principal Investigator. The next group will be dosed
      provided there are no serious or unexpected drug-related safety issues. Each subject will be
      required to remain in the clinical center for 48 hours after dosing for safety evaluation.

      After the first 3 groups have been evaluated, the Principal Investigator will decide whether
      to proceed with continuous enrolment according to the clinical center capability.
