      This study is being conducted at Healthcare Global Enterprises Ltd to evaluate the role of a
      novel Tracheo-Esophageal voice Prosthesis for total laryngectomy +/- partial pharyngectomy
      patients. 30 patients will be enrolled as an inpatient or outpatient.

      Patients who are planned to undergo total laryngectomy +/- pharyngectomy surgery and
      trachea-esophageal puncture procedure.(for primary TEP insertion) or patients who have
      undergone total laryngectomy &gt; 6weeks prior and are suitable candidates for secondary TEP
      insertion would be recruited to the study. Insertion of the TEP will be done in primary
      setting or secondary setting. Patients, who are undergoing primary TEP insertion, will be
      evaluated for speech/ voice at an interval of 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 6 months after the
      procedure. Patients who are undergoing secondary TEP insertion to be evaluated on the same
      day of the procedure along with evaluation at an interval of 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 6 months.
      All the patients will be evaluated clinically for a fluid leak (through and around the TEP)
      on the same days of voice analysis by giving test feeds under supervision.

    <description>This device is a biomedical grade silicon voice prosthesis with an inner esophageal flange, a stem and an outer tracheal flange. Insertion would be done through a modified 'romovac' inserter set / curved metal inserter (provided with the TEP) and an oesophagoscope in case of secondary insertion would be used. in patients with existing TEP puncture / who require a TEP change, on out-patient basis, the insertion would be done with a novel two-part inserter device (front loading)</description>
