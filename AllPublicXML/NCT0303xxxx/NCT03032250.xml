    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies how well Prepare to Care kit works in improving caregiver
      support in patients with stage I-IV head and neck cancer. Prepare to Care kit may increase
      knowledge about head and neck cancer and enhance stress-management skills.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess feasibility (accrual, participation, and retention) and acceptability of a
      supported self-management intervention for psycho-education and stress management skills
      building designed for informal caregivers (n=20) of head and neck cancer (HNC) patients
      undergoing radiotherapy (RT).

      II. To obtain preliminary data on caregiver intermediate (self-efficacy for [a] coping with
      cancer and [b] abbreviated progressive muscle relaxation) and outcome variables (burden,
      psychological distress, quality of life) before and after the intervention.

      III. To refine intervention procedures and materials for future studies by examining
      qualitative data from caregivers and interventionist notes.

      IV. To refine intervention procedures and materials for future studies by examining
      quantitative data regarding module utilization.

      OUTLINE:

      Caregivers watch introduction video on a digital video disc (DVD) over 10 minutes at
      baseline. Caregivers receive Prepare to Care kit including 8 workbook modules and complete at
      least 1 module over 30-45 minutes each week. Caregivers also attend interventionist session
      over 10-30 minutes weekly.
