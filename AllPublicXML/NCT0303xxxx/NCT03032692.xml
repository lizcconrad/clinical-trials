  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was designed to evaluate the impact of a novel kinematic biofeedback system - SWORD
      - in the motor performance of patients after stroke. The SWORD system combines inertial
      motion trackers and a mobile app, allowing digitization of patient motion and providing
      real-time audiovisual biofeedback.

      The investigators hypothesize that the biofeedback feedback provided by the SWORD system
      improves patient performance, defined as an increase in the number of correct movements.

      The design of the study is a cross-over randomized clinical trial. Patients will be
      randomized into two groups. Both will perform two separate sessions consisting of one
      exercise - shoulder flexion with elbow flexion at 90 degrees - for 4 minutes in both
      experimental settings: with and without biofeedback. Group 1 will perform the exercise with
      biofeedback first and without biofeedback after, with an interval &gt;24h. Group 2 will perform
      the exercise in the opposite order. The SWORD system will be used to record movement data in
      both sessions, but the feedback was only active in one of them.

    <description>The patient will perform one repetition of the exercise shoulder flexion with elbow flexion at 90 degrees under monitoring from SWORD. The recorded parameters will be used to define: baseline and target angle; execution time; maximum postural sway. Two additional repetitions will be performed to ensure reproducibility. During the session, SWORD will be providing real-time audiovisual feedback. The patient has to start in the baseline position and fill the progress bar without violating movement or posture constraints. If the patient does not reach the goal or violates constraints he will receive a negative audio feedback, the progress bar will turn red and be reset. The patient has to return to the baseline position to restart the movement.</description>

    <description>The patient will perform one repetition of the exercise shoulder flexion with elbow flexion at 90 degrees under monitoring from SWORD. The recorded parameters will be used to define: baseline and target angle; execution time; maximum postural sway. Two additional repetitions will be performed to ensure reproducibility. The patient will then be instructed to perform as many movements as possible during the allocated time (4 minutes), at a comfortable pace, starting at or below the baseline and trying to reach maximum flexion without significant pain or discomfort. During the session, the SWORD system will be recording the patient´s movement without providing feedback to the patient.</description>
