    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of a single dose of
      JNJ-64152348, inactivated poliovirus vaccine produced from Sabin poliovirus strains on PER.C6
      cells (sIPV) in healthy adults, using conventional inactivated poliovirus vaccine produced
      from Salk poliovirus strains (cIPV) as reference.

    <time_frame>Up to Day 8</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be requested to record any occurrences of solicited AEs on a daily basis in a diary on the day of dosing and during the 7 days thereafter (up to Day 8). Solicited local AEs include erythema, swelling/induration and pain/tenderness. If erythema or swelling/induration is present, the diameters will be measured using the ruler supplied and the largest diameter recorded.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Solicited Systemic Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 8</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be requested to record any occurrences of solicited AEs on a daily basis in a diary on the day of dosing and during the 7 days thereafter (up to Day 8). Solicited systemic AEs include fatigue, headache, nausea, myalgia and fever.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>An SAE is any AE that results in: death, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, is life-threatening experience, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect and may jeopardize participant and/or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.</description>

    <measure>Poliovirus Type- and Strain-specific Neutralizing Antibody (NAb) Responses</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Polio NAb titers will be determined against the attenuated Sabin strains (Types 1, 2 and 3) as well as against the wild-type Salk strains (Type 1 [Mahoney], Type 2 [MEF-1] and Type 3 [Saukett]), in accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations for immunogenicity assessment of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV).</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Declared healthy by the investigator on the basis of physical examination, medical
             history, vital signs and clinical laboratory tests performed at screening. If the
             results of the serum chemistry panel or hematology are outside the normal reference
             ranges, the participant may be included only if the investigator judges the
             abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not clinically significant. This
             determination must be recorded in the participant's source documents and initialed by
             the investigator

          -  Heterosexual male participants must not engage in intercourse with a female partner of
             childbearing potential who is not using a highly effective contraceptive method

          -  All female participants of childbearing potential must have a negative urine
             beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) pregnancy test at screening and
             immediately prior to study vaccine administration

          -  Willing and able to adhere to the prohibitions and restrictions specified in this
             protocol

          -  Agrees not to donate blood until the Week 4 visit

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically significant neuro-psychiatric, cardiovascular, pulmonary, liver or renal
             insufficiency (estimated creatinine clearance below 60 milliliter per minute (mL/min)
             using the Cockcroft-Gault Equation); metabolic, gastrointestinal, urologic, or
             endocrine disease that is - in the opinion of the investigator - uncontrolled

          -  Any history of malignancy (exceptions are squamous and basal cell carcinomas of the
             skin and carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or malignancy, which is considered cured
             with minimal risk of recurrence)

          -  Previous severe allergic reaction after vaccination with polio vaccine

          -  Known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to one of the excipients of
             JNJ-64152348, inactivated poliovirus vaccine produced from Sabin poliovirus strains on
             PER.C6 cells (sIPV) or conventional inactivated poliovirus vaccine produced from Salk
             poliovirus strains (cIPV)

          -  Received any polio vaccine within 6 months before study inclusion
