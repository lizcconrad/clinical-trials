      The goal of this research study is to learn about ways to check for malnutrition (loss of
      weight/appetite that may result in health problems) that is due to cancer or cancer
      treatment.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 284 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      If you agree to take part in this study, information from your medical record will be
      collected at each of your standard of care clinic visits. This information may include things
      like your height, weight, BMI, medical history, and performance status (your ability to
      perform normal daily activities).

      If the doctor thinks it is needed, your weight and performance status will be measured at
      standard of care clinic visits.

      If you are feeling distressed and the study staff or doctor thinks it is needed, you may be
      referred to another doctor or therapist for assistance.

      Every 3 months for up to 1 year, you will be contacted by a member of the study staff, either
      by phone or during a regularly-scheduled standard of care visit at MD Anderson. You will be
      asked about your health and weight, about any falls or injuries you may have had, and about
      any hospitalization or ER visits you may have had. If you are called, the phone call should
      last about 15 minutes.

      Length of Study:

      Your participation on the study will be over after the 12-month follow-up visit or phone
      call.
