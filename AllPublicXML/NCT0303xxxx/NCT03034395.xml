  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized non-blinded pilot study for patients with melanoma staging cT2N0M0 who
      are candidates for surgical resection. The primary objective is to determine the feasibility
      of randomizing participants with cT2N0M0 malignant melanoma to surgical treatment with 1cm
      versus 2cm margins. Study will try to determine overall survival for cT2N0M0 malignant
      melanoma after surgical treatment with 1cm versus 2cm margins.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After randomization, participants will undergo surgery with wide local excision with either
      1cm or 2cm margins. The margin will be based upon the previous biopsy site or area of
      pigmentation. The skin and subcutaneous tissue (down to fascia) will be resected. Closure
      considerations may require removal of additional tissue for non-oncologic purposes. As per
      standard of care, sentinel lymph node biopsy will be performed using a dual tracer technique
      (technetium radiolabeled sulfur colloid and isosulfan blue) with or without
      lymphoscintigraphy.
