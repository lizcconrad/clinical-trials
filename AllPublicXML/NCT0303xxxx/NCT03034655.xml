  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of vestibular
      rehabilitation developed using computerized dynamic posturography or a mobile posturographic
      system with vibrotactile stimulation, to improve the balance in older people and reduce the
      number of falls.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Accidental falls, particularly in the elderly, are one of the most important socio-healthcare
      problems of ageing western societies. Many factors condition and favour falls; one of them is
      old age, usually related to a decline in sensorial functions and worsening of balance
      Vestibular rehabilitation has been shown to be effective to improve balance and reduce the
      number of falls in older people. Previous studies have demonstrated that exercises in
      computerized dynamic posturography (CDP) are more effective than other vestibular
      rehabilitation strategies in this group of age. But CDP is very expensive and not widespread.
      It would be important to minimize cost of posturographic vestibular rehabilitation.

      This study compare vestibular rehabilitation with two different posturographic devices (CDP
      and mobile posturographic system with vibrotactile stimulation), in people over 65 years.
      Additionally, we try to assess whether the reduction in the number of vestibular
      rehabilitation sessions (five) leads to an improvement in balance and in reducing the number
      of falls similar to those obtained with ten sessions.

    <masking_description>After the first screening visit, the patients who grant their consent will be included in the study and randomised to one of the following study arms. Randomisation will be performed by C.H.U de Santiago Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics Unit. Once the informed consent form is signed, the care provider will contact the unit, which will give him the code of the arm to which the patient is assigned. A n= 20 block balanced randomisation sequence will be used. The investigator will analyse results and evolution, being blind type and duration of vestibular rehabilitation.</masking_description>

    <description>Group A. The Smart Equitest program was used with a protocol of 10 exercises per session, which were customized depending on each patient´s deficit. The exercises involve visual biofeedback together with sensitive, real-time monitoring of movement. In some exercises, patients must maintain their center of gravity (COG) over the base of support, while in others the COG must be moved to a series of targets. In addition, the support surface and/or visual surround may also move in response to the patient´s own movement. The exercise difficulty was progressively increased throughout the rehabilitation sessions. The duration of each session was approximately 15 minutes. The distribution of sessions was one per day and five per week (2 weeks).</description>

    <description>Group C. Up to six tasks with the most prominent deviations from normative control values were included in the training program. Training was performed by using the training function of Vertiguard1-RT device. This neurofeedback system contains one vibration stimulator on the front, back, left and right side, respectively. Training was performed daily under supervision of a physician over 2 weeks (10 sessions, weekend was excluded). A training session consisted of 5 repetitions of six selected training tasks. The patient received a vibrotactile feedback signal during training in those directions which showed a higher body sway than preset thresholds. Vibration was reinforced with increasing sway No vibrotactile feedback was applied if the patient's sway was below preset thresholds. The exercise difficulty was progressively increase throughout the rehabilitation sessions.</description>
