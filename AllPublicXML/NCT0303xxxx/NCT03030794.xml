      This study aims to assess the effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)
      on Gulf War illness related headaches and pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Headaches (HA) and wide spread pain are some of the most common debilitating symptoms in Gulf
      War Veterans (GWV) with Gulf War Illness (GWI). Migraine like HA and diffuse body pain were
      detected in 64% of GWV with GWI. This high prevalence of chronic HA and diffuse body pain
      conditions are often associated with neuropsychological dysfunction in mood, attention,
      memory and other systemic symptoms, which cast a profound negative impact on patients'
      quality of life. Unfortunately, conventional pharmacological treatments for GWI related
      headaches and pain (GWI-HAP) has not been shown to be effective and drugs such as narcotics
      contain many long term untoward psychosomatic and abusive side effects. Therefore, developing
      and validating non-invasive and low risk innovative treatment for this patient population is
      warranted. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is currently a US FDA approved treatment
      for major depression and migraine HA.

    <time_frame>2 months for each subject (11 visits)</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 15-minute attention task administered on a laptop. The subject is prompted to press the spacebar as quickly as possible after every letter that appears on the screen except for the letter X. The exam is automatically scored by the program and reports omission rate and response latency. The attentional cognitive function is tracked by their change in these scores over time.</description>

    <measure>Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months for each subject (11 visits)</time_frame>

There are 3 trials and they are scored just by the number of words that can be recalled each time, which can be from 0-10 for a total range of 0-30 words. The second part of this test rates their recognition discrimination index by asking if certain words were on the original list. This is scored by taking the number of true positives and subtracting the false positives. The range for this is from 0-12, with 12 indicative of better discrimination within memory.</description>
