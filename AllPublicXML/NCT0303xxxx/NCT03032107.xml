  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a combination of drugs as a possible treatment for metastatic
      breast cancer.

      The interventions involved in this study are:

        -  Pembrolizumab

        -  Trastuzumab emtansine (also called T-DM1)
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational
      intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational
      intervention to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is
      being studied. It also means that the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not
      approved the combination of Pembrolizumab and T-DM1 for use in patients, including people
      with your type of cancer.

      This study will determine what amount (or dose) of Pembrolizumab and of T-DM1 is safe for
      people to take and what effects, good or bad, this combination may have on participants and
      their disease.

      The FDA has not approved Pembrolizumab for this specific disease but it has been approved in
      the United Sates for the treatment of other types of cancer.

      The FDA has approved Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) as a treatment option for this type of
      breast cancer

      The combination of Pembrolizumab and T-DM1 is investigational. It is thought that together
      these drugs to help get the immune system to attack tumor cells and kill cancer cells that
      have the HER2 protein. However, it is not known if giving the two study drugs at the same
      time will have a better anti-cancer effect than giving each treatment on its own.

             in whom inadequate tissue is obtained, are not required to undergo a repeat biopsy in
             order to continue on protocol.

          -  The effects of pembrolizumab on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this
             reason and because tratuzumab, a component of T-DM1, is known to be teratogenic, women
             of child-bearing potential and men of childbearing potential must agree to use
             adequate contraception starting with the first dose of study therapy, for the duration
             of study participation, and for an additional 120 days after the last dose of study
             medication. Note: abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and
             preferred contraception for the subject.

               -  Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her
                  partner is participating in this study, the treating physician and principal
                  investigator should be informed immediately.

               -  While on the study, women should not breast-feed.

               -  Subjects of childbearing potential are defined as those who have not been
                  surgically sterilized and/or have had a menstrual period in the past year

          -  Female subject of child-bearing potential must have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If a
             urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will
             be required.

          -  Patients on bisphosphonates may continue receiving bisphosphonate therapy during study
             treatment.

          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) must be within institutional limits of
             normal as assessed by echocardiogram or MUGA documented within 28 days prior to first
             dose of study drug.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has received another investigational agent within 21 days of the first
             dose of study drug.

          -  The subject has received prior pembrolizumab or any other anti-PD-1 , anti-PD-L1, or
             anti-PD-L2 therapy, or has participated in any prior studies involving pembrolizumab.

          -  Pre-existing neuropathy greater than or equal to grade 2.

          -  Hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab or T-DM1 or any of their excipients.

          -  The subject has any history or evidence of active, non-infectious pneumonitis or
             interstitial lung disease.

          -  Known brain metastases that are untreated, symptomatic, or require therapy to control
             symptoms. Participants with previously diagnosed brain metastases are eligible if they
             have completed treatment at least one month prior to trial therapy initiation, are
             neurologically stable with an absence of new neurological symptoms for at least 4
             weeks prior to study entry, and have recovered from effects of radiotherapy or
             surgery. Any corticosteroid use for brain metastases must have been discontinued
             without the subsequent appearance of symptoms for ≥2 weeks before the first study
             drug. Treatment for brain metastases may include whole brain radiotherapy,
             radiosurgery, or a combination as deemed appropriate by the treating physician.

          -  Known carcinomatous meningitis.

          -  The subject has an uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to,
             uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia,
             congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Class III or IV; see Appendix B),
             active ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction within the previous six months,
             uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, chronic liver or renal disease, or severe
             malnutrition.

          -  Concurrent use of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (see Appendix C), such as ketoconazole and
             erythromycin, should be avoided during the study treatment with T-DM1.

          -  Active infection requiring intravenous antibiotics at cycle 1 day 1.

          -  Individuals with a history of a second malignancy are ineligible except for the
             following circumstances. Individuals with a history of other malignancies are eligible
             if they have been disease-free for at least 5 years and are deemed by the investigator
             to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy. Individuals with the following
             cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 5 years: cervical cancer
             in situ, and non-melanoma cancer of the skin. Patients with other cancers diagnosed
             within the past 5 years and felt to be at low risk of recurrence should be discussed
             with the study sponsor to determine eligibility.

          -  The subject has a medical condition that requires chronic systemic steroid therapy or
             any other form of immunosuppressive medication including disease modifiying agents, or
             has required such therapy in the last 2 years. Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine,
             insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary
             insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.

          -  The subject has an active autoimmune disease or a documented history of autoimmune
             disease or syndrome that requires systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents.

          -  The participant is positive for Hepatitis B surface antigen, or Hepatitis C RNA.

          -  Known HIV-positive participants. HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral
             therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with
             pembrolizumab. In addition, these participants are at increased risk of lethal
             infections with bone marrow suppressive therapy, i.e. nab-paclitaxel. Appropriate
             studies will be undertaken in participants receiving combination antiretroviral
             therapy when indicated.

          -  The subject has received a live vaccine within 28 days of planned start of study
             therapy. Note: seasonal influenza vaccines for infection are generally inactivated flu
             vaccines and are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (i.e. Flu-Mist ®) are
             live attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed
