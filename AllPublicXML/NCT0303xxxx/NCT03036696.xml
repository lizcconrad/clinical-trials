    <textblock>
      This is an interview study that will enroll mothers during 28 weeks or greater of pregnancy
      and assess recruitment, patient-centered outcomes, and stool collection procedures via
      individualized interviews and data collection. Participants will be recruited from the
      greater Gainesville, FL area. Data collection will include questionnaires/surveys as well as
      minimal risk non-invasive biological samples such as stool, human milk, saliva, vaginal swab,
      and urine collection. Participants will be seen at a location convenient for them.

    <description>Pregnant mothers will be interviewed and asked to provide feedback on common strategies used for recruitment, challenges that would preclude them from enrolling and participating in CRTs, their preferences for incentives, data collection, bio-specimen collection and preferences for methods related to non-invasive sample collection.
Data collection for pregnant mothers includes Clinical Health Update (3rd trimester) and Physical Activity questionnaires.
The following will be collected from mothers during the interview: self-reported behavioral data, maternal human milk (HM), stool, urine, saliva, and vaginal swab.</description>
