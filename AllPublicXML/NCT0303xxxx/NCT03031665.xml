  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using an innovative multi-modal imaging approach, this study investigates the role of the
      neurochemical gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), brain activity, as well as hormones in
      understanding sex differences in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Further, the investigators
      will link these markers to symptoms of depression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goals of this research are to investigate: (1) functional and neurochemical features
      associated with depression irrespective of clinical state; (2) moderating effects of hormones
      on stress circuitry in MDD; and (3) sex differences in symptoms. To this end, the study is
      enrolling adults with current depression and remitted depression, along with a control group
      of psychiatrically health adults. Participants will have an magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      exam involving multiple imaging techniques (functional, structural, spectroscopic) while
      performing computer-based tests. Additional questionnaires and tests will be done outside the
      scanner to assess current symptoms and hormone levels. The integration of laboratory-based
      measures of reward and stress sensitivity, with state-of-the-art imaging techniques and
      hormonal assessments promises to provide novel insights in the sex-dependent manifestation
      and pathophysiology of MDD.
