  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age-associated loss of muscle mass, termed sarcopenia, is strongly associated with functional
      impairment and physical disability in the elderly. Maintenance or growth of muscle mass is
      mainly driven by increased muscle protein synthesis (i.e. the generation of new muscle
      protein) in response to exercise and feeding. However, several investigations have shown that
      elderly individuals have a blunted protein synthetic response following protein intake. This
      inability of the elderly to properly respond to growth stimuli has been termed anabolic
      resistance and plays a significant role in the development of sarcopenia. However, the
      precise mechanisms underpinning anabolic resistance are unknown.

      It is well established that muscle protein synthesis at the molecular level is regulated by a
      cellular protein complex called mTORC1. When exposed to a growth stimulus, mTORC1 has been
      shown to associate with lysosomes, i.e. the intracellular organelles responsible for the
      breakdown of cellular proteins, and subsequently moving towards the cell periphery.

      This movement of lysosome-associated mTORC1 within the cell is believed to be vital for the
      activation of protein synthesis, as inhibition of lysosomal movement blunts mTORC1 activation
      in response to amino acids. Thus, dysregulation of lysosomal movement in ageing muscle may
      represent an underlying mechanism in the development of anabolic resistance. However, this
      area of research is unexplored in the context of human skeletal muscle. The investigators
      hypothesize that dysregulation of lysosomal movement plays a central role in the development
      of age-associated skeletal muscle anabolic resistance.
