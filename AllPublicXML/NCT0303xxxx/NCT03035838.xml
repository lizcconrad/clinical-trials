  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain (TBI) injury is the major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide
      especially in population under 40 years of age and has a significant socioeconomic impact.
      TBI results from the head impacting with an object or from acceleration/deceleration forces
      that produce vigorous movement of the brain within the skull, with the resultant mechanical
      forces potentially damaging neurones and blood vessels and causing irreversible, primary
      brain injury. Primary injury leads to activation of cellular and molecular responses which
      lead to disruption of the blood-brain barrier causing the brain to swell. As the intracranial
      space is not expandable (i.e. is fixed), this swelling leads to increase in intracranial
      pressure (ICP) compromising blood supply to the rest of the brain leading to secondary brain
      injury. As we are unable to reverse the primary injury, current protocols use supportive
      measures to control the ICP and ensure optimal blood supply to the brain in an attempt to
      minimize secondary injury. Our understanding of the factors involved in the initiation and
      propagation of brain swelling in TBI is growing and the role of neuroinflammatory cytokines
      in this process is increasingly recognized. In preclinical models of TBI, a specific
      inflammatory cytokine termed substance P (SP) is found to be associated with blood-brain
      barrier disruption and development of brain oedema in the immediate phase following injury.
      The aim of this study is to examine the role of SP in the genesis of cerebral oedema and
      elevation of ICP and thus secondary injury following human TBI. This would be achieved by
      blocking SP function with a SP receptor antagonist Fosaprepitant (IVEMENDÂ®, Merck) in the
      first 24 hours following TBI and then continuously measuring ICP and assessing the evolvement
      of TBI using magnetic resonance imaging.

      All severe traumatic brain injury patients admitted to the Cambridge University Hospital's
      Neurosciences Critical Care Unit who require insertion of a triple bolt for multimodal
      neuromonitoring (intracranial pressure-ICP, microdialysis-MD and brain tissue oxygen partial
      pressure-PbtO2) will be screened for participation in this study. Eligible patients will have
      an initial MRI scan in the first 24 hours from injury. Following this, and within 24 hours
      from injury, IVAMEND (the intravenous formulation of the NK-1 antagonist fosaprepitant)will
      be administered at a dose of 300 mg, intravenously over 1 hour. Patients will then have a
      follow up MRI scan in the 24 hour following IVAMEND administration. Continuous ICP and PbtO2
      monitoring as well as hourly microdialysis sampling will start immediately following
      insertion of monitors and at least 6 hours before and will continue for at least 12 hours
      after IVAMEND administration. ICP will continue to be monitored continuously in the 5 days
      following administration of IVAMEND. Microdialysis samples collected over the period of 6
      hours before and 12 hours after the administration of Fosaprepitant will be stored and
      consequently used to measure the concentration of Substance P, nitric oxide (NO) and
      inflammatory cytokines.
