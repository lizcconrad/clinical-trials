  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently in the UK, TDM is routinely performed for aminoglycosides and glycopeptide
      antimicrobial agents, given fears over the narrow therapeutic window of these agents and the
      serious adverse events associated with toxicity. However, in critical care the role of TDM
      for optimisation of therapy has been demonstrated to help optimise dosing of patients who
      tend to have variable pharmacokinetic parameters (J. A. Roberts et al,). This is of growing
      importance given that low concentrations of antimicrobial agents, below a micro-organisms
      minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is believed to be a major driver of AMR. The
      investigators set out to explore whether similar observations in PK-PD target variability are
      currently being observed across the secondary care setting (outside of critical care) and
      whether these appear to be impacting on clinical outcomes.

      3.1 STUDY PARTICIPANTS

        -  Drug level sampling will be undertaken within the first 120 hours of commencing
           antimicrobial therapy once at steady state (after at least 4-5 doses have been
           administered to those on treatment).

        -  All patients will be consented using the participation information leaflet and consent
           form provided in appendix 1.

      3.2 DRUG LEVEL SAMPLING

        -  An extra 3mls of blood will be collected during the patient's routine daily phlebotomy
           round following their consent. They will be enrolled for up to 72 hours or two days of
           routine blood tests (whichever is shorter). Up to 10 samples may be taken during the 2
           days the patient is enrolled, depending on the number of routine blood tests the patient
           receives during that day. No more than 3mls will be taken per each routine blood sample.
           For example, if the individuals will only have routine blood tests taken at 8am on day 1
           and day 2. Then only two extra samples will be taken (3mls on D1 and 3mls on D2).

        -  The time they received their dose of antimicrobials, the length of infusion time, and
           time the sample was collected will all be recorded.

        -  PK/PD indices for evaluation will be time over minimum inhibitory concentration (T&gt;MIC)

      3.3 SAMPLE PREPARTION AND ANLYSIS

        -  All blood samples will be allowed to clot for 15 minutes at room temperature and then
           centrifuged at 2,400rpm for 10 minutes. Sera from each sample will be separated into
           three vials and stored at -800C.

        -  Beta-lactam concentrations will be measured using validated high-performance liquid
           chromatography methods.

      3.4 PHARMCOKINETIC-PHARMACODYNAMIC MODELLING

        -  Data will be anonymized and analyzed using Pmetrics in R.

        -  Different pharmacokinetic models will be explored using in built statistical analysis
           options and visual predictive checks.

        -  Pharmacodynamic models will then be incorporated into the model using evidence
           identified in the literature for selection of parameters.

        -  Monte Carlo simulation will then be used to for simulation of target attainments and
           analysis of pharmacodynamic outcomes
