    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this trial is to evaluate the impact of empagliflozin, as compared
      with placebo, on hemodynamic parameters (pulmonary artery diastolic pressure) in patients
      with type 2 diabetes and heart failure (reduced or preserved ejection fraction, ischemic or
      non-ischemic etiology) who already have a CardioMEMs device implanted for non-study related
      clinical reasons.

    <textblock>
      A 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to explore the effects of
      once-daily empagliflozin 10mg on hemodynamic parameters (pulmonary artery pressures) in
      patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart failure (reduced or preserved ejection
      fraction, ischemic or non-ischemic etiology) who already have a CardioMEMs device implanted
      for non-study related clinical reasons.

             prior to the screening visit and no changes between the screening and randomization
             visits. Changes in sliding scale insulin dose are not considered to be a disqualifying
             change in insulin dose. Changes in total daily dose of insulin of ≤10% of the baseline
             total daily dose are not considered to be a disqualifying change in insulin dose.

          3. Hemoglobin A1c ≥6.5% and ≤11% at the screening visit

          4. Established diagnosis of heart failure (for at least 16 weeks prior to the screening
             visit) with either preserved (LVEF&gt;40%) or reduced systolic function (LVEF≤40%), due
             to either ischemic or non-ischemic etiology, documented by an imaging modality
             (echocardiography, nuclear imaging, LV angiography, magnetic resonance imaging) within
             the past 24 months.

          5. No major change in diuretic management for 1 week prior to screening visit or between
             the screening and randomization visit (major change defined by doubling of diuretic
             dose or addition of another diuretic medication)

          6. NYHA class II, III or IV heart failure symptoms at the screening and randomization
             visit

          7. Presence of previously (≥ 4 weeks prior to screening visit) implanted CardioMEMs
             pulmonary artery pressure monitor for a clinical indication unrelated to the study.

          8. PA diastolic pressure ≥ 12 mmHg at the time of the screening visit (last measurement
             available prior to the screening visit).

          9. Ability to provide informed consent prior to initiating screening visit procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Decompensated heart failure (hospitalization for heart failure within the 4 weeks
             prior to screening) or between screening and randomization

          2. History of type 1 diabetes

          3. Hemoglobin A1c &gt;11% or &lt;6.5% at the screening visit

          4. Major change in diuretic management during 1 week prior to screening visit or between
             the screening and randomization visit. (major change defined by doubling of diuretic
             dose or addition of another diuretic medications)

          5. Significant variability in baseline PA diastolic pressures during screening period.
             Defined as changes greater than +/- 6 mmHg from average PA diastolic pressure during
             week 1 of the screening phase and average PA diastolic pressure during week 2 of the
             screening phase for those patients with an average baseline PA diastolic pressure
             during week 1 of the screening phase of &lt;30 mmHg. If the average baseline PA diastolic
             pressure during week 1 of the screening phase is ≥30 mmHg, then ≥20% relative change
             in average PA diastolic pressure between week 1 and week 2 of the screening phase will
             be used to define significant variability.

          6. Initiation of hydralazine, long-acting nitrates, beta blockers, ACEI/ARBs or
             Valsartan/sacubitril in the prior 4 weeks prior to screening

             or planned implantation of CRT device within the 90 days after the screening visit.

         12. Participation in any interventional clinical trial (with an investigational drug or
             device) that is not an observational registry within the 12 weeks prior to the
             screening visit.

         13. History of hypersensitivity to empagliflozin
