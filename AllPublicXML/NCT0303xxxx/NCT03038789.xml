  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a local, prospective, non-interventional, regulatory postmarketing surveillance
      study. Adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who are initiating Xigduo XR as indicated
      by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS) will be included.

      -  Primary objective: Descriptive analysis of the proportion (%) of adverse events (AEs),
           serious adverse events (SAEs), unexpected adverse events∙adverse drug reactions and AEs
           of special interest (AESI) in patients who are treated with Xigduo XR for type 2
           diabetes mellitus by physicians in the normal clinical practice setting over a period of
           12 or 24 weeks.

        -  Secondary objective: To follow the changes of values of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting
           plasma glucose (FPG), 2-hr post-prandial glucose (PPG-2hr), blood pressure, abdominal
           circumference and body weight and self-reported data in this cohort of patients from
           baseline to completion of the study.

      To evaluate the safety and tolerability of Xigduo XR in patients with type 2 diabetes
      mellitus based on conducted laboratory test (Laboratory tests are not mandatory because of
      the non-interventional nature of this study)

      <textblock>
        Adult patients who are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) eligible for the
        treatment with Xigduo XR according to prescription information approved by MFDS and as
        decided by the investigator

        Inclusion Criteria:

        -Patients will be enrolled by a continuous registration method. Investigators should enroll
        adult patients who are diagnosed with T2DM and who initiate treatment with Xigduo XR for

        all pertinent aspects of the study will sign the Informed Consent Form for use of data.
        Discontinuation of treatment will be determined by a patient's willingness to continue
        treatment and the investigator's discretion. The reason for discontinued treatment will be
        documented.

          1. Patients aged 18 years and older

          2. Patients with T2DM eligible for treatment with Xigduo XR at first according to the

          3. Patients with evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document
             indicating that the patient (or a legally acceptable representative) has been informed

             glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)&lt; 60mL/min/1.73 m2) which may also result from
             conditions such as cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, and
             septicemia.

          3. Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus or acute or chronic metabolic acidosis
             including diabetic ketoacidosis with or without a coma

          4. Congestive heart failure that medicinal treatment is required

          5. Patients with radiologic studies involving the use of intravascular iodinated contrast
             materials (for example, intravenous urogram, intravenous cholangiography, angiography,
             and computed tomography (CT) scans with intravascular contrast materials)

          6. Patients with severe infection or severe traumatism

          7. In terms of Surgical procedures (except minor procedures not associated with
             restricted intake of food and fluids)

          8. Patients with nutrition poor condition, starvation condition, pituitary insufficiency,
             capsular insufficiency

          9. Patients with impaired hepatic function (Since impaired hepatic function has been
             associated with some cases of lactic acidosis, this drug should generally be avoided
             in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.), respiratory
             failure, acute myocardial infarction, acute or chronic disease causing histotoxic
             hypoxia like shock, an alcoholic, gastroenteric trouble (anhydremia, diarrhea,
             vomiting and etc.)

         10. Pregnant women, women with potential of pregnancy, lactating women

         11. Patients with hereditary problems such as galactose intolerance, Lapp lactase
