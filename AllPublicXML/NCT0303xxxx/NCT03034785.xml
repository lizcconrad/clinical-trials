  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The morbidities associated with very low birth weight (VLBW) infants constitute a major
      health problem and a significant emotional and financial burden for families and our nation.
      The key to reducing this burden is early diagnosis. This research will be the first step
      towards intervention for cerebral growth and long-term neurodevelopmental morbidities of VLBW
      infants.

      The proposed research is to design and fabricate a new technological innovation in wearable
      soft-sensors, called flexi-mitts, for measuring force modulation and joint angles of the hand
      (wrist and fingers) of toddlers. Building upon the investigators' ongoing work, they plan to
      engineer stretchable electronics for safe, toddler-scaled flexi-mitts to measure planning and
      force modulation. Additionally, the investigators plan to have the parent/guardian wear the
      gloves so they can determine the relative contributions of the child and the adult to the
      child's learning. In the same way that the adult assists learning to walk, they may assist in
      learning during play. The force data may be analyzed in the same way as the child's data.

      The investigators' new flexi-mitt technology has the potential to provide a new diagnostic
      technology and the development of clinical assessment norms. With additional trials of the
      technology in large numbers of young children, it may be possible for clinicians and day care
      providers to eventually make measurements of planning and force modulation in play settings.
