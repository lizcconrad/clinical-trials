  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epilepsy is a group of neurological disorders characterized by propensity for spontaneous
      epileptic seizures. Epileptic seizures are the result of excessive and abnormal nerve cell
      activity in the brain. About 0.7-1% of the world population suffers from seizures. The most
      common treatment is based on seizure medications that enables about 2/3 of the patients to
      control their seizures. However, about 20 million patients worldwide, suffer from
      unpredictable seizures without remedy, and are resistant to medication.

      In this study EEG and other physiologic signals are collected using wearable sensors, from
      Epilepsy patients who are at risk of experiencing seizures. The collected signals will be
      used for developing algorithms that may identify pre-seizure and seizure related periods.
