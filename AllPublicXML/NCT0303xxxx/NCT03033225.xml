    <description>the study drug will be given through an IV infusion. approximately one hour later The physician will direct the endoscope that has an ultrasound to your pancreas, and the treatment laser will be guided to the sites on your pancreas where the tumors are located. This will be done using a ultrasound to find the tumor and place a needle from inside the stomach or small intestine into the tumor. This is a standard procedure for obtaining tissue from a tumor. In this study, a special fiberoptic probe will be placed through the needle to allow light to be delivered to the tumor</description>

             pancreatic cancer or other solid pancreatic tumor that is not amendable to curative
             surgical resection or the patient is unfit for surgery

          2. Measureable disease as defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
             (RECIST)

          3. ECOG performance status 0,1 or 2

          4. Estimated life expectancy of at least 12 weeks

          5. Capable of giving informed consent

          6. adequate biliary drainage (serum bilirubin &lt; 2.5 ULN) with no evidence of active
             uncontrolled infection (patients on antibiotics are eligible)

          7. Women of childbearing potential with a negative pregnancy test (qualitative serum HCG)
             prior to study entry and must be using adequate contraception method and continue this
             for one week after PDT

          8. Must be willing and able to travel to study site for screening, treatment and all
             follow up visits

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Evidence of metastases other than lung or liver and if lung or liver metastases are
             present, greater than three lesions, and any lesion greater than 5cm. in diameter

          2. Porphyria; Pregnant or breast-feeding

          3. Locally advanced disease involving &gt;50% circumference of the duodenum or a major
             artery (hepatic, gastro-duodenal) with in the treatment area

          4. ECOG performance status of 3 or 4

          5. Previous treatment with curative intent for current disease in the last 12 weeks (i.e.
             prior resection, radical radiotherapy or chemotherapy)

          6. Any psychiatric disease making reliable informed consent impossible

          7. A history of documented hemorrhagic diathesis or coagulopathy, currently on
             therapeutic anticoagulation. History of prior or concomitant other malignancy that
             will interfere with the response evaluation

          8. Any evidence of severe of uncontrolled systemic disease or laboratory finding that in
             the view of the investigator makes it unsafe for the patient to participate in the
             study

          9. Contrast allergy not amendable to treatment with steroids and antihistamines
