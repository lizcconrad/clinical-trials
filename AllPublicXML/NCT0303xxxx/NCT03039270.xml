  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, controlled clinical trial, triple-blind, split-mouth type was conducted
      aiming to assess the absolute risk of sensitivity with and without sonic activation of a
      desensitizing gel previously to the in-office bleaching in adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial evaluated the effect of sonic activation of a desensitizing gel on the
      occurrence of sensitivity associated with office bleaching. For this, 31 patients had their
      anterior superior teeth divided into right and left, according to the sonic activation (AS)
      or not (SS) of the desensitizer. Prior to bleaching, a desensitizing gel containing 5%
      potassium nitrate and 2% sodium fluoride (Desensibilize KF2%, FGM Dental Products,SC, Brazil)
      was applied. Sonic activation was performed with a sonic device (Smart, FGM Dental Products,
      SC, Brazil) at the 170 MHz frequency. A hydrogen peroxide gel (Whiteness HP Maxx, FGM Dental
      Products, SC, Brazil) was used in two whitening sessions. It was also performed, evaluation
      of the presence of cracks in enamel, through transillumination. The color change was verified
      using two color scales and a spectrophotometer. The dental sensitivity was recorded through a
      sensitivity diary answered by the patient, in the period up to 48 hours after each bleaching
      session. The absolute risk of tooth sensitivity was compared using the McNemar test (= 5%).
      The color change was analyzed from the variation of units of scale vita (SGU) and through the
      value of ΔE, which were compared through Student t test (α = 5%).

    <description>The operator applied a desensitizing gel containing 5% potassium nitrate and 2% sodium fluoride (Desensibilize KF 2%, FGM, SC, Brazil) on the vestibular surfaces of the participant's anterior teeth. In the sonic activation side, immediately after the gel's application, sonic activation(Smart Sonic Device, FGM, SC, Brazil) was performed for 1.5 minutes in total for side (30 seconds per tooth). After the time of 30 seconds in each of the three anterior teeth of the respective side, the gel was removed from teeth with cotton. After removal of the desensitizing gel, gingival tissues were isolated and the bleaching gel were applied.</description>
