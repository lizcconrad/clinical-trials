      This study is a single sequence, 3-period, multiple-dose study to evaluate the
      pharmacokinetics of D565 and the drug effect of D565 on pharmacokinetic characteristics of
      D930 in healthy male volunteers.

      Subjects will receive D565 just one time on period 1 for evaluate the pharmacokinetics. And
      afterward, subjects will receive multiple dose of D930 for 9 days, and D565 with D930 for 9
      days to evaluate the drug effect on period 2 and 3.

      When period 1 finished, there are 3 days of washout period, but between period 2 and 3, there
      is no washout period.
