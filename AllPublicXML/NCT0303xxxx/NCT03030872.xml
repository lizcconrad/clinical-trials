      The objective of this study is to compare the diagnostic value of MR DSC-Perfusion (Perfusion
      Module), MR DWI (Diffusion Module) and MR DTI (Diffusion Module) in CARESTREAM Vue PACS
      (&quot;investigational device&quot;) to the Olea Sphere PACS with Perfusion and DWI Modules (&quot;predicate
      device&quot;). Therefore, there will be several separate objectives depending on the type of
      acquisition:

      The following study objectives/aims will be used to evaluate imaging performance of the
      CARESTREAM Vue PACS 12.2 MR Perfusion module using the oSVD (oscillation singular value
      decomposition), sSVD (standard singular value decomposition), and cSVD (block-circulant
      singular value decomposition) algorithms. Please reference Tables 1, 2, and 3 below.

        1. The MR Relative Cerebral Blood Volume (rCBV) of the investigational Perfusion module
           will be evaluated by comparing it to the predicate Perfusion module using retrospective
           de-identified patient images.

        2. The MR Relative Cerebral Blood Flow (rCBF) of the investigational Perfusion module will
           be evaluated by comparing it to the predicate Perfusion module using retrospective
           de-identified patient images.

        3. The MR Mean Transfer Time (MTT) of the investigational Perfusion module will be
           evaluated by comparing it to the predicate Perfusion module using retrospective
           de-identified patient images.

        4. The MR Time To Peak (TTP) of the investigational Perfusion module will be evaluated by
           comparing it to the predicate Perfusion module using retrospective de-identified patient
           images.

        5. The MR Time To Maximum (TMAX) of the investigational Perfusion module will be evaluated
           by comparing it to the predicate Perfusion module using retrospective de-identified
           patient images.

        6. The MR Leakage Map (K2) of the investigational Perfusion module will be evaluated by
           comparing it to the predicate Perfusion module using retrospective de-identified patient
           images.

           The following study objectives/aims will be used to evaluate imaging performance of the
           CARESTREAM Vue PACS 12.2 MR Diffusion module. Please reference Tables 4 and 5 below.

        7. The Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) of the investigational Diffusion module will be
           evaluated by comparing it to the predicate DWI module, if available, using retrospective
           de-identified patient images.

        8. The Exponential ADC of the investigational Diffusion module will be evaluated by
           comparing it to the predicate DWI module, if available, using retrospective
           de-identified patient images.

        9. The Isotropic b-value data of the investigational Diffusion module will be evaluated by
           comparing it to the predicate DWI module, if available, using retrospective
           de-identified patient images.

       10. The Fractional Anisotropy (FA) of the investigational Diffusion module will be evaluated
           by comparing it to the predicate DWI module, if available, using retrospective
           de-identified patient images.

       11. The Relative Anisotropy (RA) of the investigational Diffusion module will be evaluated
           by comparing it to the predicate DWI module, if available, using retrospective
           de-identified patient images.

       12. The Trace Weighted (TW) of the investigational Diffusion module will be evaluated by
           comparing it to the predicate DWI module, if available, using retrospective
           de-identified patient images.

       13. The Volume Ratio (VR) of the investigational Diffusion module will be evaluated by
           comparing it to the predicate DWI module, if available, using retrospective
           de-identified patient images.

       14. The ADC/Mean Diffusivity (MD) of the investigational Diffusion module will be evaluated
           by comparing it to the predicate DWI module, if available, using retrospective
           de-identified patient images.

       15. The Axial Diffusivity (AD) of the investigational Diffusion module will be evaluated by
           comparing it to the predicate DWI module, if available, using retrospective
           de-identified patient images.

       16. The Radial Diffusivity (RD) of the investigational Diffusion module will be evaluated by
           comparing it to the predicate DWI module, if available, using retrospective
           de-identified patient images.

      The collection of retrospective de-identified patient images will be completed at Hospital
      Lariboisiere, located in Paris, France. The Reader Study to evaluate the imaging performance
      of MR Perfusion and MR Diffusion will be completed by comparing the investigational device to
      the predicate device.
