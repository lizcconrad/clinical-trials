  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current research is being undertaken as part of a professional doctorate in clinical
      psychology, which aims to evaluate the feasibility of a group programme to address self-harm
      within 23 days, to provide evidence for a controlled trial. The intervention will include
      four group sessions conducted over 2 weeks, based on Dialectical Behavioural Therapy.
      Specifically the aims are to determine 1) means and a standard deviation for two pre and post
      treatment outcome measures in order to estimate sample size for the main study, 2) the need
      for an inpatient intervention for self-harm measured by number of participants eligible and
      accepting of the treatment, 3) retention of participants for 4 groups given the predicted
      short stays of patients on wards, and 4) the acceptability of the research process for this
      client group through feedback.

    <measure>The Distress Tolerance Scale (DTS)</measure>
    <time_frame>23 days</time_frame>
    <description>The DTS consists of 15 items, which measure a person's appraisal of their emotional distress, their ability to tolerate this distress and any regulation efforts to alleviate it. It will be administered pre- and post-intervention.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants will be screened by their allocated clinician and included if they are
             aged between 18-65

          -  admitted to hospital

          -  have a history of or engaged in at least one episode of self-harm, iv) have capacity
             to understand the information sheet.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants will be screened by clinicians and they will exclude people if i) they
             are Non-English speakers (due to translation costs)

          -  they lack the capacity to give informed consent (assessed by their key clinician)

          -  their symptoms prevent them from concentrating for an hour at a time (i.e. severe
             thought disorder), and therefore not benefiting from the group (assessed by their key
             clinician)
