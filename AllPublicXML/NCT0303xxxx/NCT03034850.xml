  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) with hyperthermic intraperitoneal peroperative chemotherapy
      (HIPEC), indicated for patients with peritoneal metastases from digestive or gynecological
      malignancies alike, demonstrates a considerable impact on hemostatic metabolism, both on
      platelet and on coagulation level. The potential hemostatic interference in CRS and HIPEC is
      phase dependent. This study demonstrates the combined use of ROTEM (rotational
      thromboelastometry), PACT (platelet activation test) and CAT (thrombin generation test)
      assays during CRS and HIPEC with a follow-up of 7 days postoperative.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to quantitatively assess the impact of CRS and HIPEC, on
      various components of hemostasis. Routine laboratory assays such as activated clotting time,
      activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, or platelet count might, as
      demonstrated previously, insufficiently provide specificity and/or sensitivity to assess
      coagulation and platelet disorders. Therefore, additionally thrombin generation (TG) was
      analyzed by the calibrated automated thrombogram assay (CAT). Also, platelet function was
      quantitatively assessed by the PAC-t-UB assay and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) was
      used to elucidate the contribution of platelets, intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways
      in peri-operative bleeding. The hypothesis of this study was that the procedure exposed an
      increased thrombotic risk, resulting in a faster and increased TG and hyper platelet
      function?

    <description>Blood loss and administration of red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma and platelets. Blood loss is quantitatively assessed based on surgical drainage volume measurements, recorded every hour. Once the surgical drains are removed (average 7 days), blood loss is quantified by hemodynamic instability and abrupt, significant decrease of hemoglobin concentration. Blood loss is assessed from the date of CRS/HIPEC surgery until 7 days postoperative or date of death from any cause, whichever came first.</description>

    <description>The generic surgical approach involved peritonectomy procedures and visceral resections called CRS as described by Sugarbaker (1995). Peritoneal disease burden was assessed using the perito- neal cancer index (PCI), which scores 13 intra-abdominal sites on a scale of 0 (no disease) to 3 (lesion size &gt; 5 cm), thus giving a range of possible scores from 0 to 39. The same team performed the surgical procedure of all included patients. Before connection to the patient, the circuit was filled with dextrose 5% (2 L/m2 body surface area) and warmed to 37°C.</description>
