      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the MASCT-I alone and in combination with
      chemotherapy drug are safe and effective in the treatment of advanced bladder cancer and soft
      tissue sarcoma

      The multiple-antigen specific cell therapy which was developed by Hengrui Yuanzheng is
      optimized continuously and has been upgraded from the first-generation MASCT technology to
      MASCT-I. MASCT-I is to add PD1 antibody in vitro cell culture process of MASCT technology to
      block PD1 receptor on immunocytes, relieving the brake at immunocytes' reinfusion and
      interaction with tumor cells for enhancing the effectiveness of immunocytes killing tumor
      cells. At present, the development and validation of manufacturing process has been
      completed, and it is urgently needed to conduct the validation of clinical effect. This study
      is primarily to assess the safety and anti-tumor effect of MASCT-I technology to provide a
      basis for II/III phase clinical trials.

      This is a single-center,phase I clinical study for evaluating the safety and efficacy of
      MASCT-I technology in patients with advanced solid tumors and preliminarily assessing the
      antitumor effectiveness of MASCT-I alone and in combination with chemotherapy drugs. About
      33-36 cases of adult patients with advanced solid tumors (only limited to bladder cancer and
      soft tissue sarcoma ) are to be recruited.

      This study is divided into two stages:

      Stage I is a small sample safety observation stage where the &quot;3+3&quot; design including groups A
      and B. Group A represents the group of MASCT-I alone where patients with advanced solid
      tumors that various standard therapies failed in clinical practice are included;Group B
      represents the combination group of MASCT-I plus chemotherapy drug or group of MASCT-I alone
      where patients with recurrent or metastatic advanced solid tumor who achieved the clinical
      benefit after chemotherapy (CR, PR, SD) are included.

      Stage II is a dose expansion stage to observe the safety and anti-tumor effectiveness. The
      patients enrolled in the stage II are the same in group B subjects.
