  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antibiotic overuse and misuse contributes to the development of antibiotic resistant
      infections and adverse drug reactions. The majority of all antibiotic prescribing occurs in
      outpatient settings; most of which are for respiratory illnesses. It is estimated that 50% of
      these prescriptions are unnecessary. The most important factor that leads to overprescribing
      is inadequate parent-provider communication. This study will recruit providers and eligible
      parents of children 1-5 years of age. Parents in both arms will receive identical brief
      antibiotic education via tablet computers. Providers will be randomized to the
      parent-provider education or communication skills intervention arm and trained accordingly.
      Parent data will be collected via a tablet computer RedCap survey administered in the exam
      room prior and immediately following the child's visit. Additional data will be garnered from
      the medical record (antibiotic prescribing) and a 2-week follow-up telephone call with
      parents (re-visits and adverse drug reactions).

      Significance: Antibiotic overuse and misuse contribute to the development of antibiotic
      resistant infections that kill at least 23,000 Americans and cause an additional 2 million
      infections annually. If left unchecked, antibiotic resistant infections are estimated to
      cause 10 million deaths worldwide by 2050. Antibiotic associated adverse drug reactions
      (e.g., rash, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting) also result in over 140,000 Emergency Department
      visits annually.

      The majority of all antibiotic prescribing occurs in outpatient settings where children
      receive 49 million prescriptions annually. Over 70% of these are for respiratory infections
      and nearly 8.5 million of these prescriptions are inappropriate (i.e., either an unnecessary
      broad-spectrum antibiotic or to treat a viral illness). There are many factors that lead to
      overprescribing, but chief among them is inadequate parent-provider communication.

      Innovation: This study is the first US multi-site randomized controlled trial comparing the
      effectiveness an education vs. communication skills provider intervention to stimulate high
      quality parent-provider communication and judicious use of antibiotics.

      Approach: 1,600 eligible parents (or caregivers) of children between the ages of 1 and 5 will
      be enrolled and exposed to one of the interventions based on the provider they see for their
      visit. English and Spanish speaking parents will be recruited from the Children's Mercy
      Hospital Primary Care Clinic (CMH PCC) in Kansas City, Missouri and the Heartland Primary
      Care Clinics in Kansas City, KS and Lenexa, KS. Parents in both arms will receive identical
      brief negatively behavioral framed antibiotic education via tablet computers. Providers will
      be randomized to the parent-provider education or communication skills intervention arm and
      trained accordingly. Primary outcomes are parental ratings of shared decision-making and
      satisfaction. Secondary outcomes are rates of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing, re-visits
      and adverse drug reactions. Data will be collected via a tablet computer administered RedCap
      survey administered in the exam room prior and immediately following the child's visit.
      Additional data will be garnered from the medical record (antibiotic prescribing) and a
      2-week follow-up telephone call with parents (re-visits and adverse drug reactions).

      Public Health Impact: This study could have significant public health implications and meet
      the goals outlined in the 2014 Executive Order on Combating Antibiotic Resistance, which
      seeks to slow the emergence of resistant bacteria and prevent the spread of resistant
      infections through the judicious and appropriate use of antibiotics.

    <masking_description>Providers will be randomly assigned to the education or communication skills intervention study arms. Both groups will receive identical training on the appropriate prescribing of antibiotics for ARTIs, but only those in the communication intervention will receive additional training on communication skills. Once providers have been randomized and trained, eligible patients will be enrolled and exposed to one of the interventions based on the provider they see for their visit. Patients will not be informed of their provider's study arm.</masking_description>

    <ipd_description>We will create a clean, de-identified copy of our final dataset that will be available to other researcher groups, upon request, within 9 months of the end of the final year of funding. Prior to data sharing, we will remove or convert all identifying information (date of birth will be converted to age and other identifiers will be removed). There may remain the possibility of deductive disclosure of subjects with unusual characteristics. Thus, we will make the data and associated documentation available to users under a data-sharing agreement.</ipd_description>
