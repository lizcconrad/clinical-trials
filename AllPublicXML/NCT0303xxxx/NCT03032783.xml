      This phase II trial studies the how well donor stem cell transplant works in treating
      patients with high risk hematologic malignancies. Giving total-body irradiation and
      chemotherapy before a donor stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cells in the bone
      marrow, including normal blood-forming cells (stem cells) and cancer cells. It may also stop
      the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When the healthy stem
      cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make
      stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. The donated stem cells may
      also replace the patient's immune cells and help destroy any remaining cancer cells.

      Primary Objective:

      1. To assess 2 year probability of OS in high risk patients undergoing a myeloablative 2 step
      HSCT utilizing strategies to decrease relapse.

      Secondary Objective:

        1. To assess relapse incidence at 2 years post-HSCT of patients undergoing treatment on
           this protocol.

        2. To assess regimen related toxicity and GVHD incidence at 2 years post-HSCT and severity
           in patients undergoing treatment on this protocol.

        3. To assess the consistency and pace of engraftment.

        4. To assess the pace of T cell and B cell immune recovery.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        This treatment is for patients with high risk hematologic malignancies. High risk is
        defined as:

          -  Any patient with a hematologic malignancy in which allogeneic HSCT is pursued with the
             expectation of cure. Patients may have post-treatment residual disease, but the
             disease should be stable or minimally progressive and must be responsive to
             chemotherapy.

          -  Any patient with an untreated hematologic malignancy in which allogeneic HSCT is
             thought to be the sole or the best option for cure and in Patients without morphologic
             evidence of disease but with high risk features which would predict for relapsed
             despite remission at HSCT such as adverse cytogenetics, 3rd or greater CR, or failure
             to recover peripheral blood counts to normal ranges. While these patients do not have
             detectable disease by current methods, like all patients they have non-detectable
             disease which in their case is highly aggressive.

          -  Patients must have one related donor who is HLA mismatched in the GVHD direction at
             two or more HLA loci (except as described below)

          -  Patients must have adequate organ function:

          -  Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) of ≥50%

          -  DLCO (adjusted for hemoglobin) ≥50% of predicted and FEV-1 ≥50%

          -  Adequate liver function as defined by a serum bilirubin ≤1.8, Aspartate
             aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 x Upper Limit of Normal
             (ULN)

          -  Creatinine clearance of ≥ 60ml/min

          -  Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) of ≥80% on the modified KPS tool (see Appendix)

          -  Patients must be willing to use contraception if they have childbearing potential

          -  Able to give informed consent

          -  Age ≥ 18 years of age

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Modified KPS of &lt;80%

          -  &gt; 5 Comorbidity Points on the Hematopoietic Cell Transplant Co-Morbidity Index (HCT
             CI) (See Appendix)

          -  Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) positive

          -  Active involvement of the central nervous system with malignancy

          -  Psychiatric disorder that would preclude patients from signing an informed consent

          -  Pregnancy, or unwillingness to use contraception if they have childbearing potential

          -  Patients with life expectancy of ≤ 6 months for reasons other than their underlying
             hematologic/oncologic disorder

          -  Alemtuzumab treatment within 8 weeks of HSCT admission

          -  ATG within 8 weeks of HSCT administration

          -  Patients with active inflammatory processes including T max &gt;101 or active tissue
             inflammation are excluded up to and including the day of admission

          -  Inability to tolerate cyclophosphamide or undergo total body irradiation at the doses
             specified in the treatment plan.
