  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Quinoa is possible alternative to wheat, corn and rice due to its high nutritional value and
      possible properties against cardiovascular diseases and for improving gut health. There are
      some animal studies to suggest that some important class of compounds like fibre,
      antioxidants and protein, found naturally in quinoa, have beneficial effects against markers
      of cardiovascular diseases. However, the effects of quinoa on humans has rarely been
      investigated. This study will investigate the effects of daily consumption of quinoa for four
      weeks on markers of cardiovascular risk, including blood cholesterol and resting blood
      pressure, and on gut health in a randomised cross-over study design.

      Quinoa is a possible alternative to wheat, corn and rice due to its high nutritional value
      and possible properties against cardiovascular diseases. There are some animal studies which
      suggest that quinoa has beneficial effects against markers of cardiovascular diseases,
      particularly blood lipid profile. The grain has a unique nutritional profile, with high fibre
      levels and a wide range of phytochemicals which may influence gut bacteria and improve
      gastrointestinal health.

      However, the effects of quinoa on humans has rarely been investigated with just two small
      interventions published. These studies also showed an improvement in blood lipid profile
      after consuming quinoa daily. There have been no studies which have investigated the effects
      of quinoa on gut bacteria and gastrointestinal health. Therefore, this human dietary
      intervention study aims to determine the effects of quinoa consumption on markers of
      cardiovascular diseases, the gut microbiome and gastrointestinal health.

      The study is a randomized cross-over designed dietary intervention study with 4-week study
      periods separated by a 4-week wash-out period. The treatment will be the daily consumption of
      a test bread roll containing quinoa to deliver 20g quinoa per day (one roll per day). The
      control will be the same amount of a refined wheat roll. Markers of cardiovascular disease
      risk, including fasting blood lipid profile, plasma glucose and insulin concentration,
      resting blood pressure will be compared at the beginning and end of each treatment period.
      Changes in the numbers and species of gut bacteria, and products of bacterial fermentation
      will be made in stool samples collected at the beginning and end of each intervention period
      as indicators of gastrointestinal health.
