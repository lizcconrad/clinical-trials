    <textblock>
      This protocol allows for treatment of 100 men in two groups (placebo and active treatment) of
      22-70 years of age with mild (IIEF EF of 17 to 25 at baseline) vasculogenic erectile
      dysfunction of at least 6 months duration with low intensity extracorporeal shock wave
      therapy utilizing the Dornier Aries 2 device.

    <textblock>
      This trial is a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind pivotal study, with
      an open-label extension. The study will include 4 sites and multiple investigators. A total
      of 100 men with at least a 6-month history of ED and who have responded to PDE5 inhibitors
      will be enrolled. The trial comprises two arms to achieve equal characteristics, where
      patients are randomly assigned to active treatment or sham treatment.

      All patients on active treatment will receive LI-ESWT treatment using the Dornier Aries 2.
      Patients assigned to the placebo group will receive the Dornier Aries 2 treatment using a
      sham applicator. The time between two treatments is 6-7 days to allow for angiogenesis and
      perfusion improvements to occur. The subjects' duration of participation will be a total of
      34 weeks Subjects will also be asked to maintain their current level of sexual activity while
      participating in the study.

    <masking>Double (Participant, Investigator)</masking>
    <masking_description>Study subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either active treatment or the control. The investigator and his staff do not know which applicator is the sham/placebo control and which are the active applicators. For the active treatment, a regular EMSE shockwave applicator will be used. The treatment group is further split into two equal groups, with both groups receiving the identical active treatment. In order to preserve the blinding of the investigator, the treatment devices are provided with two applicators (one for each of the active treatment groups), which while identical in function, differ slightly in appearance.
For the sham treatment, a placebo applicator, including an absorber without emitting shockwaves, will be used. However, all three applicators (two to use with the active device and one with the sham) are going to produce exactly the typical shock wave sound with equivalent noise to reduce or eliminate bias from the investigator</masking_description>
