  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate if oral administration of 240mg PAC of cranberries can reduce the number of
      episodes of acute bacterial cystitis and improve general QoL in women with recurrent
      bacterial cystitis. In addition, the effect on vagina and rectal flora will studied and the
      adverse effect profile of the drug will be reported.

      Women with â‰¥3 symptomatic episodes of lower UTIs at the previous year will be recruited from
      the outpatient population who present to their family physician or specialist with
      symptomatic recurrent UTI. Informed consent will be obtained from all patients and they will
      be divided in groups according to their age. Urinary culture, vaginal and rectal swab will be
      taken from all the patients. Antibiotic treatment will be prescribed (using the drug of
      choice according to the urine culture and the treating physician choice). Subsequently, they
      will be randomized to receive combined antibiotic treatment with one capsule of Cysticlean
      240mg PAC two times per day or antibiotic treatment with placebo. At 14th day post treatment
      and after a negative urinary culture patients will continue to receive per os, daily, one
      capsule of Cysticlean 240mg at bed time for 12 months or placebo respectively.

      Study visits will occur at 3rd, 6th , 9th and 12th month treatment phase. A urine collection,
      vaginal swabs and rectal swab will be taken at study entry and at the month 3, 6, 9 and 12
      visits.

      Participants will be asked about medication usage, any side effects they may be experiencing
      at each study visit. If participants develop a UTI at any time during the study, they will be
      asked to visit the study site within 24 hours.
