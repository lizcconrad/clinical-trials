  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to quantify and compare the three-dimensional kinematics of the
      cruciate retaining (CR), fixed bearing ATTUNETM TKA to the kinematics of the PFC Sigma Curved
      CR Fixed Bearing TKA (both DePuy Synthes, Johnson and Johnson) during daily activities.

      The secondary objective is to describe the kinematics in terms of range of motion, patterns
      of anterior-posterior motion of the nearest medial and lateral points (&quot;posterior femoral
      rollback&quot;) and tibio-femoral internal/external rotation as well as the kinetics during daily
      activities, such as level gait, a deep knee bend (only ATTUNETM subjects), sitting down onto
      a chair, standing up from a chair and stair descent by means of video-fluoroscopy.

      Furthermore, the encoded data will be handed over to DePuy Synthes (Johnson and Johnson) and
      to the Center for Orthopaedic Engineering of the University of Denver, where it will be used
      within a musculoskeletal model with the aim of simulating tibiofemoral contact mechanics and
      changes in the musculoskeletal system due to the TKA.

    <description>With video-fluoroscopic assessment it is possible to directly measure the kinematics of the tibial and the femoral components in vivo during daily activities, such as level walking, a deep knee bend (only ATTUNETM subjects), sitting down onto a chair, standing up from a chair and stair descent. Thus, for the first time the present study provides in vivo assessed data of the 3D motion of the ATTUNETM System during daily activities and allows a comparison to a conventional TKA based on the same methodology. The knowledge of the in vivo kinematic behaviour of the ATTUNETM System in comparison to the conventional TKA leads to an improved understanding of the design principle.</description>

        This is a prospective, observational study on 15 subjects with the ATTUNE TM CR Fixed
        Bearing TKA and 15 subjects with PFC Sigma Curved CR Fixed Bearing TKA during level
        walking, deep knee bend (only ATTUNE TM subjects), sitting down onto a chair, standing up
        from a chair and stair descent. The present study extends the subject groups of a previous
        feasibility study (KEK-ZH-Nr. 2014-0468) from 5 to 15 ATTUNE TM and from 6 to 15 PFC Sigma
        Curved CR Fixed Bearing TKA subjects. Based on a power analysis of the existing data of 5
        ATTUNE TM subjects and 6 subjects with a PFC Sigma Curved CR Fixed Bearing TKA in the
        previous feasibility study (KEK-ZH-Nr. 2014-0468) the minimal sample size for the
        comparative evaluation of 15 subjects within each group was estimated. The participants
        must be able to perform the daily activity tasks mentioned above
