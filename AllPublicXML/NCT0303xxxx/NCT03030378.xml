    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of pembrolizumab and recombinant
      interleukin-12 in treating patients with solid tumors. Monoclonal antibodies, such as
      pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Recombinant
      interleukin-12 may kill tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor and by stimulating
      white blood cells to kill tumor cells. Giving pembrolizumab and recombinant interleukin-12
      may work better in treating patients with solid tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of
      recombinant human interleukin (rhIL)-12 in combination with MK-3475 (pembrolizumab).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the safety of the regimen by continuously monitoring adverse events that will be
      documented utilizing Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v).4.0.

      II. Evaluate the overall response rate (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST]
      v.1.1) and the progression free survival of patients enrolled on the study.

      II. Measure CD8+ T cell infiltration by immunohistochemistry in tumor biopsies obtained at
      baseline, after one week of rhIL-12 and after 2 cycles of MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) in
      combination with rhIL-12.

      IV. Conduct exploratory translational laboratory correlative studies utilizing banked
      biospecimens (tumor and blood) obtained at baseline and during therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of recombinant interleukin-12.

      Patients receive recombinant interleukin-12 subcutaneously (SC) on days 2, 5, 9, and 12 and
      pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 8 of course 1 and day 1 of subsequent
      courses. Treatment continues for 28 days for course 1 and repeats every 21 days for
      subsequent courses for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients then receive recombinant interleukin-12 SC on days 2, 5, 9, and 12.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 3 years.
