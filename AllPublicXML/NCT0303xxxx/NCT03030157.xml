  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 30-40% of the patients may develop bladder recurrance after radical nephroureterectomy
      for primary upper tract urothelial carcinoma. Bladder tumor needs transurethral resection,
      which is associated with costs of treatment and potential poor prognosis. Although several
      randomized controlled trial have shown that prophylactic intravesical chemotherapy could
      prevent bladder tumor recurrence, the optimal schedule and duration of treatment are unkown.
      The investigators want to determine the efficiacy of single instillation versus long-term
      intravesical instillation of pirarubicin for bladder recurrence after radical
      nephrouretectomy for primary upper tract urothelial carcinoma.

    <description>A single instillation of pirarubicin (THP) plus one year long-term intravesical instillation after nephroureterectomy was performed. The Ô¨Årst instillation was initiated within 24 hours after surgery, followed by four times weekly and 11 times monthly (16 times in total in one year time) . Every time, THP 30 mg in 30 mL of normal saline was delivered into the bladder through a catheter and was retained for 30 minutes.</description>
