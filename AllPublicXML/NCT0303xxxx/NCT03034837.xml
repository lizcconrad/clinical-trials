  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eruption of the first permanent molar is the earliest in our oral cavity, leading to a high
      occurrence of dental caries in its pits and fissures. Early prevention of pit and fissure
      caries in this tooth is therefore of great importance for the preservation of a healthy
      dentition in one's life long time.

      It has been shown that sealing the occlusal surface with pit and fissure sealant is a highly
      effective method to prevent pit and fissure caries. It has also been shown that the
      performance of sealing pits and fissures by glass ionomer materia l (the high viscosity,
      classification type 2 GIC material) using finger press method used in the atraumatic
      restoration method is as significant as that of using the traditional resin sealant material
      and technique.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness performance of the
      two sealing materials in the prevention of pits and fissures caries in young permanent molars
      of schoolchildren in a dental public health program to be held in primary schools. The
      findings will provide valuable information for decision making on the election of proper
      material and method for use in dental public program, especially for child population in the
      rural or social-economically deprived areas.

      Primary school children will be recruited and cluster randomized into three groups. Baseline
      dental check-up will be conducted to all the recruited children and dental status will be
      recorded. Placement of resin sealant or sealant using the glass ionomer material to the
      eligible permanent first molars or providing of oral health education will be interventions
      to the three groups respecively according to the group allocation. All the interventions will
      be provided only once in this study, and the children will be followed for at least 24 months
      at an six month interval to motor the dental caries of the included permanent first molars.
      Cost-effectiveness of placement of resin sealant and glass ionomer sealant will be evaluated
      and reported.
