  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Relating the electroencephalogram findings of patients with tinnitus before and after a
      therapeutic modality is still scarce in the literature, especially with neuromodulatory
      methods, more specifically with Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation - tDCS. This study is
      a double blind, sham-controlled clinical trial aiming investigate the impact of tDCS on
      patterns of brain electrical activity in patients with chronic tinnitus. 36 volunteers with
      tinnitus will be allocated randomly in 2 groups: the first (n = 18) will receive anodic tDCS
      in the temporoparietal left area and cathode in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and
      the second group (n = 18) correspond to the sham group. In addition, healthy individuals (n =
      18) will be recruited for comparative purposes of brain electrical activity with and without
      tinnitus, totaling 54 participants. Patients with tinnitus will receive transcranial direct
      current stimulation for 20 minutes for 5 consecutive days (1 week) and will be assessed
      before and after intervention by electroencephalogram, Acuphenometry, Visual Analogue Scale -
      VAS and questionnaire Tinnitus Handicap Inventory- THI. Follow-up of volunteers will also be
      performed after 1 month of the end of treatment with tDCS.
