  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine if treatment with Medical Air (21% oxygen in room air)
      compared to supplemental oxygen (100% oxygen) will lead to similar improvements in the
      central apnea-hypopnea index (CAHI) for infants with Prader-Willi Syndrome.

      Despite the vast amount of research investigating the cause of central sleep apnea, there
      remain gaps in knowledge, lending to further research efforts. The decision to compare oxygen
      to medical air is based on several theorized mechanisms. The first of which is the
      supposition that provision of medical air may act as an arousal stimulus for the
      hypothalamus, thereby preventing sleep disordered breathing. Secondly, the hypercapnic
      challenge performed by Livingston et al demonstrated a delayed hypercapneic arousal response
      in PWS subjects despite simultaneous hyperoxia, leading us to question if therapeutic oxygen
      really plays a significant role in treating CSA. Lastly, the delivery of medical air via
      nasal prongs may provide sufficient arousal to terminate the cycle of events leading to
      central apnea, as described by Urquhart et al.

      A deeper understanding of central sleep apnea is essential to ameliorating its adverse
      sequelae, which include symptoms of ADHD, impaired attention, behavioral problems, and
      academic difficulties.

    <intervention_model_description>The screening visit will occur during a regularly scheduled clinic visit. The patients that have consented for the study will all undergo the baseline PSG. Only patients with clinically significant CSA after Visit 1 will undergo randomization and complete Visit 2.
Those who have a CAHI greater or equal to 5 will be randomly assigned to Arm A or Arm B. Randomization will be performed using a computer with random numbers drawn. Arm A will receive Medical Air followed by Oxygen and Arm B will receive Oxygen followed by Medical Air.</intervention_model_description>

Arm A and Arm B will be analyzed blindly.</masking_description>
