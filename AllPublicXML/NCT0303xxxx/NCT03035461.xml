  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in the elderly
      population of the industrialized world. AMD is a progressive degenerative disease affecting
      the central area of the retina, responsible for distinct vision. Vision loss arises from
      aberrant new vessel growth which causes the accumulation of blood or fluid within the
      retina's thickness and eventually leads to permanent scarring. The two major forms of AMD are
      exudative, or neovascular or &quot;wet&quot;, and non-exudative, or &quot;dry&quot;.

      Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) represents the key modulator of the angiogenetic
      process and is involved in the pathophysiology of AMD. Anti VEGF therapies are used to treat
      wet-AMD.

      After diagnosis and explanations of the practionner, the patients and their close relatives
      have still frequently many questions about the intravitreal injections, the prognosis, the
      risk of visual impairment, etc. Few teams have studied the modalities of diagnosis
      announcement and the understanding of the patients on the disease course.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the feelings after the AMD diagnosis announcement as
      well as the understanding of the possibilities of treatment and the clinical surveillance.
