      This is a multi-centre, double-blind, randomized phase III trial comparing metformin to
      placebo in patients with advanced prostate cancer starting intermittent androgen deprivation
      therapy.

      The primary objective of this study will determine if there are differences between arms with
      respect to the proportion of patients who meet the diagnostic criteria for metabolic syndrome
      after 18 months of study treatment.

      It is estimated that one in seven Canadian men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in
      their lifetime. In 2015, approximately 23,600 Canadian men were estimated to be diagnosed
      with prostate cancer and 4,000 died of this disease.

      Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is a standard first-line treatment for men with incurable
      prostate cancer and has long been known to improve overall survival. It was recently shown
      that intermittent ADT (iADT) is non-inferior to continuous therapy, with modest improvement
      in quality-of-life measures being provided by the intermittent approach. Thus, iADT is
      considered a standard of care in patients with rising PSA after definitive local therapy.

      Although the effectiveness of ADT is well established in patients with advanced prostate
      cancer, it is associated with important adverse effects as outlined below. The development of
      metabolic syndrome in particular is clinically important as it is associated with worsened
      quality of life and increased all-cause morbidity and mortality.

      As ADT is now employed, alone or in combination with other therapies, in virtually all men
      with advanced prostate cancer for increasingly long periods of time (median survival of men
      presenting with newly diagnosed metastatic disease from recent clinical trials is at least 3
      years, during which they are typically on continuous hormonal therapy), the burden of ADT
      toxicity among men with prostate cancer is significant and increasing.

      The investigators hypothesize that the addition of metformin to a program of intermittent ADT
      will reduce the proportion of patients with metabolic syndrome at 18 months after initiation
      of ADT and will reduce the severity of individual components of metabolic syndrome in men
      with advanced prostate cancer. To test this hypothesis, this is a randomized, double-blinded,
      placebo-controlled phase 3 clinical trial of metformin in patients undergoing iADT treatment.

    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will undergo quality of life measurements by the EORTC QLQ-C30 core questionnaire (63) and prostate-specific module. The instruments are well validated and widely used in the population of interest. The questionnaire items are transformed for 5 functional domains, global QOL, and specific symptom scales/items relevant to the study intervention.
The statistical analysis plan will use the standard CCTG QOL approach (Osoba et al., 1998), and will focus on change of mean scores from baseline over time by treatment allocation group. Depending on the amount of missing data, generalized linear equation modeling of mean scores may be required. The analysis will also consider the proportion of patients improved, stable or deteriorated at 18 months compared to baseline using a cut-point minimal clinical difference of 10 points on all scales. A sensitivity analysis will be executed using a cut-point of 7 points.</description>
