  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The risk of cardiovascular disease is determined by the complex interplay between an
      individual's genetic make-up, lifestyle, and the environment. We are investigating three
      potential genetic risk factors in this observational, cross-sectional, epidemiology pilot
      study to investigate if and how functional variants identified in large-scale genome wide
      association studies can explain a predisposition to cardiovascular disease. By determining
      the molecular mechanisms that are regulated at the EDNRA, PNPLA3 and PROCR CVD risk loci, we
      hope to translate findings from this study into the clinical setting for better diagnosis,
      prevention and treatment for patients suffering with cardiovascular disease. Volunteers will
      enter into one of the study's three arms based on their genotype: EDNRA locus (Arm 1), PNPLA3
      locus (Arm 2), or PROCR locus (Arm 3).

      Members of the Cambridge Bioresource who match for the target alleles will be invited to
      participate and will enter into one of the three study arms. All study assessment visits will
      take place at Addenbrooke's Hospital in collaboration with the University of Cambridge.

      Volunteers will participate in the study for a maximum of 12 months and depending on study
      arm they are assigned to, they will complete procedures including a medical, demographic and
      lifestyle factors questionnaire; height, weight and body fat assessments; in addition to
      blood pressure/heart rate measurements. Minimally invasive procedures including forearm blood
      flow and venepuncture will be performed to assess the primary objectives of the study.

      The hypothesis for arm 1 is that the genetic variant we are investigating at the EDNRA gene
      locus alters the function of the endothelin receptor A leading to an increased risk of
      coronary artery disease and large artery stroke.

      For study arm 2, we hypothesize that the genetic variant we are investigating in PNPLA3 will
      increase the risk of Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease but reduce the risk of Coronary Heart
      Disease.

      For study arm 3, we hypothesize that the genetic variant we are investigating in the PROCR
      locus triggers molecular events that potentially increase the risk of Venous
      Thrombosis/Venous Thromboembolism nut reducing blood pressure. Furthermore we aim to
      investigate the anti-inflammatory effects to see if there is an effect on explaining reduced
      risk of CHD.

      This study is funded from the BHF Cambridge Center of Excellence and the Wellcome Trust
      Institutional Strategic Support Fund.

        The study will only recruit healthy volunteers who have previously consented to being
        contacted for future studies by the NIHR Cambridge BioResource which is a panel of around
        20,000 volunteers, both with and without health conditions, who are willing to be
        approached to participate in research studies investigating the links between genes, the
        environment, health and disease. Volunteers who join the Cambridge BioResource have donated
        their DNA via a blood or saliva sample which is used together with other information, such
        as gender and ethnicity, to match them to specific research studies. Participants for this
        study are therefore identified by having the appropriate genetic sequence in one of the
        three genetic loci we are investigating (EDNRA, PNPLA3 or PROCR).
