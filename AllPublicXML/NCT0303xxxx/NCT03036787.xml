  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infant born preterm have an increased risk of adverse long-term developmental outcomes.The
      risk associated with preterm birth increase as gestational age decreases, and vulnerability
      remains in extremely- very preterm (&lt;32 weeks) and moderate- late preterm (&gt;32 weeks). There
      are many studies in the literature showed that the prevalence of developmental delay
      increases with premature birth. However, there is no study in the literature investigates
      long term follow up motor and cognitive development in subgroups of preterm infants . Hence
      the aim of this study is to evaluate the differences in motor and cognitive development in
      moderate-late (&gt;32 weeks) and extremely-very preterm infants.

      A convenience of infants with premature birth recruiting from Gazi University, Faculty of
      Health Science, Department of Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation. Babies divide into two groups
      according to the gestational ages. Babies with gestational ages between 32-36 weeks and 6
      days (including the given days) are categorized as moderate-late preterm, while those born
      before 32 weeks are grouped as extremely and very preterm. Each group contains 20 babies.
      First, sociodemographic information and histories of babies are obtaining. Ages and contact
      information of the parents are recording. Prenatal and natal risk factors of the mothers are
      querying. Gestational ages and height, weight, and head circumferences of babies at birth are
      recording. Number of pregnancies, live births and abortions, type of delivery, multiple
      pregnancies for mothers as well as consanguinity between parents are asking.The Alberta
      Infant Motor Scale is using to evaluate spontaneous motor movements of the baby. It evaluates
      the baby at prone, supine, sitting, and standing positions. Bayley Scales of Infant and
      Toddler Development scales screen for cognitive, language, and motor development in babies.
      All infants will be testing in 3-6-9-12-15-18-24 months of ages.
