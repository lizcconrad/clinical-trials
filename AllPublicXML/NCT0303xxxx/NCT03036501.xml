      This is an open-label, non-randomized study investigating the excretion balance, PK and
      metabolism of a single oral dose of [14C]-labeled RO7034067 in healthy male participants.
      This study will assess the characterize mass balance, routes and rates of elimination of
      [14C]-labeled RO7034067, using conventional analytical methods and assess the
      pharmacokinetics of total drug related [14C]-radioactivity, RO7034067 and its metabolite(s).
