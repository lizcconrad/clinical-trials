  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, multi-part study to evaluate the relative oral
      bioavailability of a tablet formulation of AL-3778 (formerly NVR 3-778) administered under
      fasted and fed conditions (Parts 1 and 2) and the drug-drug interaction between AL-3778 and
      entecavir or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Part 3).
