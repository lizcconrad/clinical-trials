  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sensitivity and specificity of current screening methods for congenital cataracts in neonates
      is poor. This results in delayed diagnosis and management which can decrease the visual
      prognosis following cataract surgery. It also results in many false positives with resultant
      unnecessary healthcare costs in specialist paediatric ophthalmology services. The
      investigator has developed a new digital technique to improve the accuracy of screening for
      congenital cataract and this study will compare this new test with the current test
      performed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All babies born in the United Kingdom undergo eye screening at birth and 6-8 weeks to enable
      the early diagnosis and management of congenital cataract, a treatable but potentially
      blinding condition affecting 1 in 2000 newborns. The current technique involves the
      assessment of the &quot;red reflex&quot; - the orange/red glow in the pupil seen during ophthalmoscopy
      (or flash photography) due to reflectance of light from the back of the eye. In reality,
      testing can be technically difficult because the pupil constricts to light during the
      examination and , particularly in babies of Asian and Afro-Caribbean ancestry, the red-reflex
      can be dim due to the effect of ocular pigmentation. As a result less than 50% of congenital
      cataracts are currently identified up by screening. Early visual experience is required for
      good visual development and a delay in the surgical management of cataracts results in
      sub-optimal visual development and visual impairment.

      The neonatal congenital cataract screening tests are performed by a range of healthcare
      professionals including nurses, midwives and doctors.

      The investigators have developed a new digital camera imaging system based on a modified
      mobile phone which improves the detection of choroidal reflectance, improving the pick up
      rate of cataract and other congenital eye malformations and allowing documentation of the
      examination and telemedicine of the digital image. The investigators predict that this will
      facilitate screening and improve the early detection and management of congenital cataract
      worldwide.
