  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The MED-EL EAS Extended Follow-up Study is an extended follow-up of the subjects who were
      enrolled in the pivotal study to assess long-term safety and device performance.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted as a prospective, non-controlled, non-randomized, multicenter
      study at the 14 sites. Up to 68 available subjects who were enrolled in the pivotal study
      will be invited to participate in the extended follow-up. Study subjects will be followed for
      a minimum of 5 years post-implantation of the device.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18 years of age or older at the time of implantation

          -  Severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss for frequencies greater than 1500 Hz
             (i.e., threshold no better than 70 dB HL at 2000-8000 Hz)

          -  Low-frequency thresholds up to and including 500 Hz no poorer than 65 dB HL

          -  CNC word recognition score less than or equal to 60% in the ear to be implanted

          -  CNC word recognition score less than or equal to 60% in the contralateral ear

          -  English spoken as the primary language

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Conductive, retrocochlear, or central auditory disorder

          -  Hearing loss in the ear to be implanted that has demonstrated a recent fluctuation at
             two or more frequencies of 15 dB in either direction in the last 2 years

          -  Any physical, psychological, or emotional disorder that interferes with surgery or the
             ability to perform on test and rehabilitation procedures

          -  Developmental delays or organic brain dysfunction

          -  Unrealistic expectations on the part of the subject, regarding the possible benefits,
             risks, and limitations

          -  Unwillingness or inability of the candidate to comply with all investigational
             requirements
