    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this proposed study is to assess the reliability of plasticity measured
      by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) interleaved with intermittent theta-burst
      stimulation plasticity measures and to assess the influence of an acute bout of aerobic
      exercise on TMS plasticity measures.

    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to assess the reliability of TMS plasticity measures
      recorded one week apart, on healthy individuals. The secondary aim is assess TMS plasticity
      measures on healthy individuals after an acute bout of aerobic exercise. Participants will
      complete 3 visits. Visits 1 and 2 comprise TMS plasticity testing, and on visit 3,
      participants will complete a short bout of aerobic exercise before undergoing TMS plasticity
      testing.

          -  Primary language is English

          -  Exercise clearance

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of cognitive, neurologic or orthopedic conditions that could affect
             performance of the testing and training procedures

          -  History of migraines

          -  History of fainting spells of unknown or undetermined etiology that might constitute
             seizures

          -  History of seizures, diagnosis of epilepsy, history of abnormal (epileptiform) EEG or
             family history of treatment resistance epilepsy

          -  Any current history of psychiatric illness

             following:

          -  The subject's past medical history, drug does, history of recent medication changes or
             duration of treatment, and combination with other central nervous system active drugs.

          -  The published TMS guidelines review medications to considered with TMS (Rossi, Hallet,
             Rossini, Pascual-Leone, &amp; Safety of TMS Consensus Group, 2009)

          -  Any metal in the brain, skull or elsewhere unless approved by the responsible MD

          -  Any medical devices (i.e. Cardiac pacemaker, deep brain stimulator, medication
             infusion pump, cochlear implant, vagal nerve stimulator)

          -  Intracranial lesion

          -  Substance abuse or dependence within the past six months
