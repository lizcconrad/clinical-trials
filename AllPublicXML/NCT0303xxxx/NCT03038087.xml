  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find out whether a device for monitoring bleeding in
      patients with acute hemorrhagic stroke will show similar findings as CT scans performed to
      evaluate the stroke.

    <description>The change in received power (PR) measured by the SENSE device will be calculated and the accuracy of the SENSE algorithm will be tested for the SENSE measurements that correspond with the first, 12 hour, and 72 hour CT scans; and PR will be compared to the hemorrhage volume on the corresponding CT scan.</description>

    <description>The SENSE device transmits a low power tailored electro-magnetic pulse across the patient's brain and detects changes in the signal that may indicate intracranial hemorrhage. The device consists of two parts:
A molded plastic headpiece containing the antenna array, and
A processing control unit.
The SENSE device will be placed on the subject within 15 minutes of a baseline head CT, or as soon as practicable. The SENSE device will be set to scan every 10 minutes until the device is removed after completion of the SENSE measurement corresponding to the 72 hour CT scan. The investigator will be blinded to the data collected from the SENSE device.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female patients age 22 years and older

          2. Diagnostic head CT scan within 24 hours of primary spontaneous ICH symptom onset

          3. ICH &gt;3mL and &lt;90mL, as measured by the ABC method

          4. Signed written informed consent by study subject or, if subject is unable, by
             subject's next of kin or legal guardian

          5. Willingness and ability to comply with schedule for study procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Female patients who are pregnant or lactating

          2. Patients with any history of seizure or seizure at stroke onset

          3. Presence or history of any other condition or finding that, in the investigator's
             opinion, makes the patient unsuitable as a candidate for the SENSE device monitoring
             or study participation or may confound the outcome of the study

          4. Any intraventricular hemorrhage on the diagnostic (pre-enrollment) CT with planned
             placement of an intraventricular catheter

          5. Secondary cause of ICH suspected (e.g., arteriovenous malformation, cavernoma,
             aneurysm, hemorrhagic transformation ischemic stroke, venous sinus thrombosis, trauma)

          6. Planned withdrawal of care within 24 hours of enrollment

          7. Planned surgical evacuation within 24 hours of enrollment

          8. Current participation in a medical or surgical interventional clinical trial

          9. Presence of subdural, epidural or aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage on diagnostic
             scan

         10. Planned continued use or prescribed use during the study of medications that, in the
             investigator's best clinical judgment, are known or suspected to lower the seizure
             threshold

         11. Planned continued use of medications that, in the investigator's best clinical
             judgment, could increase the chances for subsequent uncontrolled hemorrhage

         12. Planned or current use of continuous EEG monitoring
