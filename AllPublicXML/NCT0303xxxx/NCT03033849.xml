      The user performance evaluation shows whether people with diabetes are able to obtain
      accurate measurement results with a blood glucose monitoring system. In this study, user
      performance evaluation will be performed for Contour® Next One (Ascensia Diabetes Care GmbH),
      Accu-Chek® Aviva Connect (Roche Diabetes Care GmbH), FreeStyle Freedom Lite (Abbott Diabetes
      Care Inc.), OneTouch® Verio (LifeScan Europe) and GlucoMen® areo A. Menarini Diagnostics
      S.r.l. (based on ISO 15197:2013; EN ISO 15197:2015, clause 8.

      For each BGMS, measurement procedures for user performance evaluation will be performed with
      1 test meter and 1 reagent system lot by the study subjects.

      The same meter and an additional test meter will be used for double measurements performed by
      study personnel (with the same reagent system lot used by subjects).

    <description>This is a user performance study, that is intended to show whether people with diabetes are able to obtain accurate measurement results with a blood glucose monitoring system (BGMS).
The subjects' measurement technique (e.g. applying blood onto the system reagent, reading the result) will be observed and documented by study personnel.
Immediately after the measurement by the subject, the study personnel will perform a measurement with the same test meter.
Measurement results obtained by the subjects with the BGMS will be compared to measurement results obtained with the comparison method.
Sample collection for the comparison measurement will be performed by study personnel within 5 min after the subject's measurement with the test meter.
The samples will be collected from the subjects' skin puncture (if possible), an additional skin puncture (if required) will be documented.
An additional skin puncture will be performed by study personnel with single-use lancing devices.</description>
