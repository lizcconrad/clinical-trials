      This study aims to describe incidence of right ventricular dysfunction after major lung
      resection with echocardiography criteria.

    <textblock>
      Few clinical trial studied the incidence of right ventricular dysfunction after major lung
      resection and time frame of occurrence.

      In this prospective observational study the right ventricular function will be mesure with
      echocardiographic criteria. Echocardiographic exam will be standardised and be realised day
      before surgery (at the same time that inclusion), day 1, day 2 and day 3 after surgery.

      In order to assess prognostic value of right dysfunction after lung resection, data as
      hospitalization stay, complications and survival will be collected at 6 months.

      Cardiac cycles will be recorded and be analysed by a single observer blind to the clinical
      finding and other echocardiographic measurements.
