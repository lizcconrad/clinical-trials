  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The OLIVA device will enable to perform shallow slashes on the ovarian cortex in patients
      undergoing oophorectomy. Prior to the resection of the ovary from the pedicle we will perform
      5 parallel slashes 3 cm long. following oophorectomy investigation by the pathologist as to
      the depth of cuts and proximity to blood vessels and later.

    <description>The pathologist will measure the ovarian tissue after oophorectomy. The pathologist will assess whether the cuts into the cortex are superficial or penetrating the cortex into the medulla of the ovary. Another assessment is proximity of the cuts to ovarian vessels. The pathology report will aggregate the results of all measurements and will assess the safety of the OLIVA device</description>

    <description>OLIVA device is a laparoscopic device with a standard handle and a tip built of 5 parallel razor blades enclosed by protective cap opened by a separate button.
This device will enable to perform shallow slashes on the ovarian cortex following the grasping of the ovary without damaging other abdominal and pelvic organs</description>
