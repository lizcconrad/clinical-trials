  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postpartum depression (PPD) affects over 14,000 women in Ontario each year and can have
      profound effects on mothers, their children, and their families. The cost of one case of PPD
      exceeds $150,000, a significant proportion of which is related to its impact on offspring.
      However, difficulties accessing preferred treatments (e.g., psychotherapy) result in fewer
      than 15% of women receiving care. While Public Health Units have played an important role in
      PPD detection in Ontario, Public Health Nurses (PHNs) currently lack the skills to deliver
      evidence-based treatment to women. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) delivered in group
      format is effective for treating depression in the perinatal period, and as PHNs are often
      the first point of contact for women experiencing PPD, with specialized training it is likely
      that they can deliver high-quality CBT.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine if PHNs can be trained to deliver group
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) to acutely treat PPD, reduce relapse and recurrence,
      improve mother-infant attachment and parenting and optimize infant emotional functioning.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In addition to its effects on maternal health, PPD can adversely affect mother-infant
      attachment, parenting, and the development and health of her children. The negative effects
      of PPD on offspring can include an increased risk of insecure attachment, poorer cognitive,
      language, and behavioral development, as well as an increased risk of emotion regulatory
      problems. To determine if PHNs can effectively deliver group CBT for PPD that is superior to
      postnatal care as usual, the investigators will proceed with a randomized controlled trial
      (RCT). Women in the treatment group will attend a 9-week group CBT intervention delivered by
      trained PHNs. Those in the control group will receive standard postnatal care.

      This RCT will compare the effects of group CBT to postnatal care as usual on maternal
      depression, anxiety, mother-infant attachment, parenting, healthcare utilization and social
      support, as well as infant development, emotion regulation, and healthcare utilization

    <description>Corticolimbic brain activity at the scalp will be assessed using electroencephalography (EEG). Greater left frontal asymmetry (greater activity in the left frontal hemisphere) is thought to reflect positive emotionality and indicate a greater tendency to engage in more adaptive emotion regulation strategies. However greater right activity reflects a tendency to engage in withdrawn behaviours and negative emotionality.</description>

    <description>Group CBT for PPD. Women in the treatment group will attend a 9-week group CBT intervention for PPD. This intervention was developed at the Women's Health Concerns Clinic (WHCC) at St. Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton. It was designed to be brief, simple, and applicable to women in community settings. It consists of 9 weekly 2-hour sessions where core CBT skills are learned and practiced, and a new psychoeducational topic is introduced and discussed by women each week.</description>
