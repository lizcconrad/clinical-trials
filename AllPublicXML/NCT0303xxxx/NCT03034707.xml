  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The B vitamin biotin is widely available as an over the counter supplement, often advertised
      and used to promote health of hair, skin and nails. Commercially available over the counter
      biotin supplements contain dose ranges up to 10 mg/day (ie 333 times higher than the
      recommended dietary allowance). The biotin molecule is also sometimes used as part of the lab
      technology to measure hormone and protein levels in the blood. It is possible that high doses
      of ingested biotin may interfere with accurate hormone or protein measurement using biotin
      related in vitro measurement systems. Such interference, if present, could lead to
      misdiagnosis. The study will analyze laboratory levels obtained with streptavidin-biotin
      assay systems while ingesting biotin in currently available high dose supplements. The data
      will be compared to measurements obtained prior to and one week after stopping the biotin
      supplement.

      Specimens will be collected by venipuncture at 3 time points, including baseline (time 0),
      after one week of biotin supplementation (time 1, day 7), and then one week later (time 2,
      day 14). The time 1 specimen will be drawn approximately 2 hours after the last ingested dose
      of biotin on day 7. Specimen collection will include three 10 ml red top (no gel) tubes at
      each timepoint.

      Specimens will be separated for isolation of serum using routine methods of the clinical
      chemistry laboratory. Serum will be stored at -80 degrees C until batch measurements as
      described Measurements Biotin levels will be measured on each sample. Hormone measurements
      will be performed using specific commercially available streptavidin-biotin assays and using
      different analyzers as indicated below. Immunoassay methods, not employing
      biotin-streptavidin methodology, will be used for negative assay controls.
