  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we aim to investigate the value of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis in
      the diagnosis, treatment, and surveillance of patients with surgically resectable colorectal
      cancer, by performing serial analysis of ctDNA, next-generation sequencing of surgical
      specimens, and observation of patients undergoing radical resection of the tumor with or
      without adjuvant chemo- and/or radiotherapy.

      A prospective, observational study to determine the value of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)
      for predicting the therapeutic effects of the combined modality treatment for colorectal
      cancer and the patients' long-term prognosis.

      Research objects: patients with surgically resectable colorectal cancer. After giving fully
      informed consent, the prospective participants will undergo the classical combined modality
      treatment according to NCCN guidelines. Serial analysis of ctDNA will be performed at
      specific time points including pre-treatment, (post-NCRT for NCRT patients), postoperative
      week 1, post-ACT, postoperative year 1, 2, and 3. The next-generation sequencing of surgical
      specimens will be performed as well. Participants will be observed and examined during the
      entire course of treatment and the follow-up period. The 3 year disease free survival
      (3y-DFS) will be the primary end-point.
