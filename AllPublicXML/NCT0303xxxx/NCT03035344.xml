      Study of the intermediate metabolism in children diagnosed with ALL compared to healthy
      matched controls.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary cause of this study is to investigate the changes that ALL may cause to the
      metabolome of pediatric patients, in order to better understand its mechanism of action and
      target metabolic pathways for potential therapies.
