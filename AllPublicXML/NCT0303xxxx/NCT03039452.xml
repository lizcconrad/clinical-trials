      Purpose: The purpose of this study will be to examine the feasibility and acceptability of a
      6-week high intensity interval training (HIIT) program in patients with knee OA symptoms
      ranging from mild to severe. A secondary purpose will be to evaluated changes in whole body
      metabolism induced by 6-weeks of HIIT.

      Participants: Fifteen patients (age 40-70 yrs; BMI 20-35 kg/m²) with symptomatic knee OA

      Procedures (methods): All participants will be assigned to the single-arm of the study in
      which all participants will receive 6 weeks of HIIT, delivered twice per week. Outcomes will
      be assessed at baseline and 6 weeks. The primary outcome will evaluate tolerability,
      feasibility, acceptability, compliance, and adherence to the HIIT program. Secondary outcomes
      will include whole body metabolism markers, inflammation, and a set of physical function
      including knee osteoarthritis symptomatic burden and pain, cardiorespiratory fitness,
      isometric knee extensor and flexor strength (factors associated with physical function and
      symptomatic knee OA progression), and body composition.
