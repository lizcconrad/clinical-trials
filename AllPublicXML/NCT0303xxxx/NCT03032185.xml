      Introduction: Menopause is the last menstrual period, it is a natural phenomenon to all
      women. Postmenopausal, some women may experience unpleasant symptoms such as hot flushes,
      urogenital pain, headache and pains in the musculoskeletal system. That happens due to the
      decreased ovarian hormone secretion and changes in the autonomic system. Pain is also caused
      by a complex autonomic activity. For pain management, a therapeutic electrical stimulation of
      the peripheral nervous system promotes modulation of nociceptive incentives and release of
      endogenous opioids. According to reviewed studies, the use of transcutaneous electrical nerve
      stimulation (TENS), by directly stimulating the central nervous system, has presented results
      of manipulation of the autonomic system, being observed change in heart rate and cognitive
      improvement in dementia. Given this possibility, the present study aims to investigate
      whether the use of Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation in low frequency can generate
      autonomic and psychophysical changes in healthy postmenopausal women.

      Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation on
      autonomic and psychophysical parameters in postmenopausal women.

      Methods: randomized, crossover, double-blind. A sample of thirty patients will be selected
      according to inclusion and exclusion criteria previously established. The autonomic and
      psychophysical functions will be evaluated by Quantitative Sensory Testing and Conditioned
      Pain Modulation (pain thresholds to heat and modulation of conditioned pain, respectively),
      as well as scales to evaluate catastrophism and sleep quality (by scale of Pittsburgh Sleep
      Quality Index). After application of the scales, the participants will be subject to active
      Ttranscutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation session or sham with a fortnight washout as
      randomization. All the research subjects will be invited to participate in the study and sign
      an Informed Consent and Informed (ICI). This study will be registered in the Clinical Trials.
