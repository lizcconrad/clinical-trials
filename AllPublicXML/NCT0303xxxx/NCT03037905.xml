    <textblock>
      Anxiety prior to surgery is an expected emotion. Research has not been conducted on methods
      to reduce anxiety in the operating room itself. STERIS Corporation has developed an automated
      surgical suite environmental system, called SignatureSuite™, that controls the level of
      lighting, images on OR monitors, and ambient background audio via preset, computerized
      automation for use before and after anesthesia. This study aims to determine if this new type
      of operating room environment decreases anxiety, as measured by patient responses on anxiety
      visual analog scales, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and postoperative analgesic use.
      The proposed study will be a two-arm, randomized controlled trial comparing anxiety levels
      for patients that have thyroid or parathyroid surgery in the SignatureSuite room at Cleveland
      Clinic Marymount Hospital versus the standard operating room environment. Randomization will
      occur at the surgeon level. There will be a maximum 100 patients divided equally between the
      experimental and control arms of the study.

      Problem: Anxiety prior to surgery is an expected emotion. Research has been conducted on
      methods to reduce anxiety prior to entering the operating room (OR). These studies have
      involved some form of distraction, almost all finding that some form of distraction prior to
      entering the OR decreases both physiologic signs and patient reports of anxiety. Very few of
      these studies have carried the intervention into the OR itself. Steris Corporation has
      developed an automated surgical suite environmental system, called SignatureSuite™, that
      controls the level of lighting, images on OR monitors, and ambient background audio via
      preset, computerized automation for use before and after anesthesia. The research question
      is: What is the effect of the SignatureSuite OR environment on patient anxiety and analgesic
      use? Study methods: The proposed study will be a two arm randomized controlled trial.
      Randomization will occur at the surgeon level, based on SignatureSuite operating room
      environment (experimental group) versus a standard Marymount Hospital operating room
      environment (control group).

      Data collection: The study will take place in the perioperative department of Cleveland
      Clinic's Marymount Hospital. Patient anxiety will be measured before and after surgery using
      an anxiety visual analog scale (VAS). Data about patient characteristics will be retrieved
      retrospectively by chart review. The effect of SignatureSuite on OR time will also be
      determined.

      Sample characteristics: The patient sample will comprise patients undergoing thyroid and/or
      parathyroid surgery at Cleveland Clinic Marymount Hospital.

      Sample size: 40 subjects per group will provide adequate power to detect large effect sizes
      (0.80) and is feasible in a reasonable period of time.

    <description>Change (difference) in anxiety level as measured by a 100 millimeter line visual analog scale from baseline (pre-operative) to arrival in post anesthesia care unit (post-operative).The anxiety visual analog scale quantifies current state of anxiety. It is measured on a 100 millimeter line with anchors &quot;No anxiety&quot; to &quot;The most anxiety I can imagine.&quot; Participants make a mark across the line to represent their current state of anxiety. A millimeter ruler is used to measure from left to right with the number of millimeters recorded where the mark crosses the line, minimum score is 0 and maximum score is 100. Higher number means more anxiety.</description>

SignatureSuite™ OR Integration System by STERIS Corporation: SignatureSuite™ OR Integration System by STERIS Corporation is a product that includes software to control the audio and visual components of the operating room in order to provide a more relaxed and calming environment for patients prior to their surgery. It automatically dims lights, plays pleasant music or sounds of nature over the in-room speakers, and provides scenes of nature on video screens stationed in viewing range of the patient. As anesthesia is administered to the patient, the system automatically adjusts the light and sound systems to come up to surgeon-preferred preset stations. The process happens in reverse as the patient emerges from general anesthesia so that they awaken in the same environment as when they arrived in the OR.</description>

          <title>Kindler Preoperative Anxiety Scale Total Score</title>
          <description>The Kindler preoperative anxiety scale quantifies 10 factors that cause preoperative anxiety. Each factor is measured on a 100 millimeter line with anchors &quot;No anxiety&quot; to &quot;The most anxiety I can imagine.&quot; Participants make a mark across the line to represent their current state on each factor. A millimeter ruler is used to measure from left to right with the number of millimeters recorded where the mark crosses the line, minimum score is 0 and maximum score is 100. Higher number means more anxiety. The average of the scores represents the total preoperative anxiety score.</description>

SignatureSuite™ OR Integration System by STERIS Corporation: SignatureSuite™ OR Integration System by STERIS Corporation is a product that includes software to control the audio and visual components of the operating room in order to provide a more relaxed and calming environment for patients prior to their surgery. It automatically dims lights, plays pleasant music or sounds of nature over the in-room speakers, and provides scenes of nature on video screens stationed in viewing range of the patient. As anesthesia is administered to the patient, the system automatically adjusts the light and sound systems to come up to surgeon-preferred preset stations. The process happens in reverse as the patient emerges from general anesthesia so that they awaken in the same environment as when they arrived in the OR.</description>

            <description>Patients who's surgeon has been randomized into the SignatureSuite operating room. The intervention is the unique operating room environment created by the product.
SignatureSuite™ OR Integration System by STERIS Corporation: SignatureSuite™ OR Integration System by STERIS Corporation is a product that includes software to control the audio and visual components of the operating room in order to provide a more relaxed and calming environment for patients prior to their surgery. It automatically dims lights, plays pleasant music or sounds of nature over the in-room speakers, and provides scenes of nature on video screens stationed in viewing range of the patient. As anesthesia is administered to the patient, the system automatically adjusts the light and sound systems to come up to surgeon-preferred preset stations. The process happens in reverse as the patient emerges from general anesthesia so that they awaken in the same environment as when they arrived in the OR.</description>
