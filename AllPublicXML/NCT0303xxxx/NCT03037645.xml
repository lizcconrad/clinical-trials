  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase 1b (Dose Escalation) in primarily CLL/SLL patients will evaluate safety and
      pharmacology of self-administered twice a day oral doses beginning at 25 mg/dose for 4 weeks
      with succeeding cohorts at escalating doses until establishing dose limiting toxicity or,
      recommended Phase 2 dose. Patient data will be assessed before authorizing dose escalation
      cohorts. Phase 2 (Cohort Expansion) will follow in cohorts using the recommended dose to
      explore clinical activity, safety, pharmacology of SNS-062 (vecabrutinib) as monotherapy.

      Phase 1b (Dose Escalation) This portion of the study will evaluate the safety and
      pharmacology of a range of SNS-062 (vecabrutinib) dose levels administered to subjects with
      previously treated B-lymphoid malignancies, including: chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small
      lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL), lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma/Waldenström's macroglobulinemia
      (LPL/WM), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the activated B-cell
      subtype (DLBCL-ABC), and follicular lymphoma (FL).

      All subjects will self-administer SNS-062 orally BID. The dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) window
      will be 4 weeks (1 cycle in length). Assessments on study will be performed in 4-week cycles.
      Cohorts of 3 to 6 subjects will be sequentially enrolled at progressively higher dose levels
      of SNS-062 using a standard 3+3 dose-escalation design.

      Based on the pattern of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) observed in the first cycle (4
      weeks), escalation will proceed to define a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or a recommended
      dose (RD) that may be the MTD or a lower dose. An additional 6 subjects may be accrued at the
      MTD or the RD to confirm SNS-062 safety and pharmacology as a prelude to further clinical
      evaluation. Assessments regarding DLTs and dose escalation will be performed by a Safety
      Review Committee (SRC) comprising, but not limited to, the principal investigators, the
      medical monitor and the study sponsor drug safety representative.

      Phase 2 (Cohort Expansion) This portion of the study provides cohort expansion to further
      explore the clinical activity, safety, and pharmacology of SNS-062 monotherapy. Accrual will
      occur independently for each of the 4 disease and mutation-specific cohorts. Subjects will
      self-administer SNS-062 orally at the RD of SNS-062 identified in the Phase 1b portion of the
      study. The SRC will meet regularly to assess the efficacy and safety for each cohort.
