    <textblock>
      The patients admitted in hospital who had midline catheter inserted in upper limb are
      followed-up for the presence of complications related to catheter introductions. The symptoms
      and signs of upper limb thrombosis are recorded. The diagnosis is confirmed by sonography
      examination. In the selected group of asymptomatic patients sonography examination is done 8
      to 10 days after cathether insertion in order to detect the incidence of the asymptomatic
      thrombosis

      The patients admitted in hospital who had midline catheter inserted in upper limb are
      followed-up for the presence of complications related to catheter introductions. The symptoms
      and signs of upper limb thrombosis are recorded. The diagnosis is confirmed by sonography
      examination. The age, gender, principal diagnosis, the vein were midline catheter is inserted
      and number of vein punctures for catheter insertion are recorded. Afterward the patients are
      treated in the ward and the possible complications are recorded. The main concern is about
      the incidence of upper limb thrombosis. All the complications are recorded as well as date
      when they has appeared. The statistical analysis is done in order to evaluate the incidence
      of upper limb symptomatic thrombosis, the duration since insertion to thrombosis
      manifestation a≈Ñad its associations with age, gender, principal diagnosis, selected vein, its
      size and number of punctures is analysed.

      In the selected group of the asymptomatic patients 8 to 10 days after midline insertion upper
      limb sonography is done in order to detect the presence of the asymptomatic upper limb
      thrombosis and the same type of analysis as for symptomatic thrombosis is undertaken.
