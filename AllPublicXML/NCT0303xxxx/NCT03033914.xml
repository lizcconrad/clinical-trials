  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to improve the chance of cure for people with higher risk Hodgkin
      lymphoma. The purpose of the Phase I study is to test any good and bad effects of the study
      drug called Nivolumab when combined with ABVD for the front-line treatment of HL.The purpose
      of this Phase II study is to test whether including nivolumab in treatment for untreated
      Hodgkin lymphoma can improve the chance of cure for patients with abnormal PET scans after 2
      cycles of ABVD.

    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>For this objective, the standard 3+3 scheme will be used. Initially, 3 patients will enroll onto dose level 1. If no patients experience DLT, enrollment will proceed to the next dose level. If 1 DLT is observed, 3 additional patients will enroll onto dose level 1. If 1 or fewer patients out of 6 experience DLT, enrollment will proceed to the next dose level. If 2 or more DLTs are observed at a given dose level, the previous dose will be declared the MTD. Adverse events will be assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03. If CTCAE grading does not exist for an adverse event, the severity of mild, moderate, severe, and life-threatening, corresponding to Grades 1 - 4, will be used.</description>

    <description>The study will employ a 3+3 design and include 3 treatment cohorts. In each cohort, patients will receive 6 cycles of A(B)VD and 8 doses of nivolumab. In dose level 1, patients will receive nivolumab in combination with AVD during cycle 6 only followed by 6 additional doses of nivolumab. In subsequent dose levels, nivolumab will be combined with increasing numbers of cycles of AVD. Based upon safety data from another study with Nivolumab, we will no longer need to evaluate dose level 2. If we determine that dose level 1 is safe, the next group of patients will enroll onto dose level 3. A PET scan will be performed after 2 cycles of ABVD and those with a PET-negative response (defined by Deauville 1, 2 or 3) will proceed with 4 additional cycles of ABVD or AVD (per treating physician preference).</description>

          -  Cohort A overview: Patients age less than 60 with untreated stage III or IV classical
             Hodgkin lymphoma will be eligible for cohort A. In phase I, patients could enroll onto
             cohort A if they had have a baseline IPS â‰¥3 OR if their PET scan after 2 cycles of
             ABVD is positive (Deauville 4 or 5). Enrollment onto phase I has now ceased and
             enrollment will begin for phase II. In phase II, patients less than 60 years of age
             with stage III or IV HL are eligible. Patients may enroll anytime within the first 2
             cycles of ABVD or after PET-2.

          -  Cohort B overview: Patients 60 or older with untreated classical Hodgkin lymphoma
             (regardless of stage) will be eligible for cohort B.

        The following eligibility criteria applies to both cohort A and B except when stated
        otherwise:

                  testing may be waived for these patients.

               -  WOCBP must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25
                  IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 24 hours prior to the start of study
                  drug. Women who undergo fertility preservation within 2 weeks of beginning
                  chemotherapy are expected to have false-positive pregnancy tests and therefore
                  testing may be waived for these patients.

               -  Women must not be breastfeeding
