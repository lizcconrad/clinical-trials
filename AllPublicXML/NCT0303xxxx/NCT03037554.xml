  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A home-based, sham-controlled, double-blind, crossover study evaluating the effects of
      wearing sleepwear with lateralized thermal characteristics on subjective and objective sleep
      measures, proximal skin temperature, and sternal skin moisture in menopausal women
      complaining of sleep disturbance and vasomotor symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sixteen menopausal women who have given informed consent to participate will be medically
      screened to rule out physiological sleep disorders. Sleep schedules will be regulated to the
      average bedtime of a two-week baseline sleep log. Subjects will undergo two six-night,
      home-based monitoring phases, one an experimental and one a control condition, separated by a
      washout period of at least two weeks. The order of conditions will be counterbalanced between
      subjects in double-blind fashion. In the experimental condition subjects will wear sleepwear
      constructed of two fabric types arranged bilaterally, with typical cotton spandex insulating
      material on one side and specialized conductive material on the other. In the control
      condition subjects will wear sleepwear that is similarly lateralized in terms of appearance
      but constructed with typical cotton spandex insulating material on both sides. Ambulatory
      monitoring will include body position, EEG, actigraphy, skin temperature at multiple proximal
      sites, and sternal skin moisture. Subjective scales of insomnia severity and menopausal
      symptoms will also be employed.
