      MEDI-APEX is a non-interventional, retrospective, cohort study to characterize PD-L1
      expression among NSCLC patients and to assess the clinical characteristics and outcomes of
      these patients with specific attention to EGFR, ALK, and KRAS mutations. The study will
      determine whether PD-L1 is a prognostic factor in the Asia-Pacific patient population; The
      study will enrol NSCLC patients with disease diagnosis between January 2010 and December
      2014; The patients will be recruited from Asia-Pacific, potentially China, Japan, and South
      Korea. A total of approximately 750 patients will be enrolled in the study; around 250 NSCLC
      patients will be enrolled per country.
