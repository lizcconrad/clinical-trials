      This study aims to observe the safety and efficacy of the Xyntha Solofuse prefilled syringe
      in the setting of routine practice. The primary objective is to detect medically significant
      events (factor VIII inhibitor). The secondary objective is to observe the overall efficacy
      and safety of the Xyntha Solofuse prefilled syringe including serious adverse events. In this
      open-label, non-comparative, observational, non-interventional, retrospective and
      multi-center study, post-marketing surveillance data will be collected retrospectively for up
      to 6 months from the initial administration day of the Xyntha Solofuse prefilled syringe
      injected into patients who have been administered the Xyntha Solofuse prefilled syringe.

      As specified in the product approval issued by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, the
      study will be conducted for 4 years from the approval date. At least 600 study subjects will
      be enrolled in this study to meet the MFDS requirements. Although 600 is the assigned number
      of study subjects, the number of cases will be adjusted considering the actual number of
      enrolled subjects after the study start day.

        The study population is Hemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency) patients who have
        been administered the Xyntha Solofuse prefilled syringe (as part of routine treatment at
        the Korean health care canter which has certified investigators).

        -. Inclusion criteria

        To be eligible to enroll in this study, the study subjects will have to meet all the
        following inclusion criteria:

          1. Hemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency) patients who have been administered
             according to the indication of the product 1) Control and prevention of bleeding
             episodes and for routine and surgical prophylaxis in patients with hemophilia A
             (congenital factor VIII deficiency) 2) This drug does not contain von Willebrand
             factor and, therefore, is not indicated in von Willebrand's disease

          2. Those who have been administered the Xyntha Solofuse prefilled syringe at least once -
             Exclusion criteria

        Patients who satisfy the following criteria are not included in the study according to the
        local labeling:

          1. Patients who have a history of hypersensitivity to the Xyntha Solofuse prefilled
             syringe or the ingredients of this drug.

          2. Patients who have a history of hypersensitivity to hamster proteins.

          3. Patients who have bleeding disorders other than hemophilia A.

          4. Patients who have a history of FVIII inhibitors, or currently have or are suspected of
             having FVIII inhibitors. In case inhibitor titers quantified in Bethesda Units in the
             laboratory test results are within the normal laboratory range or at least 0.6 BU/mL.
             If laboratory tests cannot be performed, the investigator will determine whether or
             not inhibitors exist based on the clinical assessment results that show a decrease in
             efficacy of the replacement of FVIII (e.g. bleeding at least once, if the replacement
             of anti-bleeding agents is needed to be administered, and if frequency or dosage of
             replacement FVIII therapy needs to be increased).

          5. Use of immunomodulatory therapy. (e.g. intravenous injection of immunoglobulin, use of
             regular systemic corticosteroids, cyclosporine, and mediators of anti-TNF-Î±)
