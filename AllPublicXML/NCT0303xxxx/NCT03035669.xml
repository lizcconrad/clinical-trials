  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study will investigate the effects of a mindfulness training on emotion
      regulation and social cognition, using several psychological, behavioral, psychophysiological
      and neuroimaging methods.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to evaluate the impact of a mindfulness intervention,
      particularly the mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), on the capacities of emotion
      regulation and social cognition, in caring/helping professions which are vulnerable to
      stress. In the context of a longitudinal intervention study, a randomized controlled trial,
      the efficacy of the MBSR to increase the capacity for self-emotion regulation, empathic
      attunement, and compassion capacities will be measured. For doing this, several
      psychological, behavioral, psychophysiological and neuroimaging brain measurements will be
      used.
