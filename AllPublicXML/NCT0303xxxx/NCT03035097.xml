      The purpose of this research study is to establish a research database and biorepository for
      patients at National Jewish Health (NJH) who served in Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) or
      Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). This study will also include civilian contractors who
      worked as part of these military operations in Iraq or Afghanistan. The biorepository would
      store blood samples obtained from these patients during a clinic visit. The research database
      would store prospectively and retrospectively collected clinical and exposure data that would
      enable us to comprehensively characterize each case.

      If informed consent is obtained, test results and other information collected for clinical
      reasons will be entered in a research database designed and maintained by DEOHS staff. The
      clinical data collected are part of the routine diagnosis and care of these patients. No
      additional procedures are required for the purpose of this research database. Collection of
      symptom and exposure data using a questionnaire designed for this study.

      All NJH patients who served in southwest Asia will be approached for inclusion in the study.
      This will also attempt to contact patients evaluated previously at NJH for deployment-related
      lung disease to obtain informed consent to include data from their medical record and the
      research questionnaire in the database.

      If patients consent to having blood and tissue collected for the biorepository, the samples
      will be collected during a clinic visit. Two DNA PAXgene tubes will be used to collect 17ml
      of blood and two RNA PAXgene tubes would be used to collect 5 ml of blood. In addition,
      excess bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from a clinically-indicated bronchoscopy would also
      be collected. Blood and BAL fluid will be frozen and stored in -80 degree C freezers in the
      Occupational Medicine Laboratory until processed. If a patient will have a surgical or
      transbronchial biopsy as part of his or her clinical evaluation, any excess lung tissue that
      has been formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded will also be collected and stored in the
      Occupational Medicine facilities.

        Patients who served in the southwest Asia will be approached for inclusion in the study. If
        patients agree to participate in the biorepository, a one-time blood draw will occur. If
        the subject has had a previous bronchoscopy or a surgical lung biopsy and has excess
        samples the study would collect those to add to the biorepository.
