  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blinded pilot study to determine whether patients undergoing
      ambulatory total knee arthroplasty (TKA) using a subvastus approach benefit from the addition
      of a continuous adductor canal nerve block (cACB) catheter along with an existing multimodal
      approach to postoperative analgesia. Outcomes include the 15-item Quality of Recovery Scale
      (QoR-15) (Miles 2016), pain scores, opioid consumption, opioid-free days, functional outcome
      as measured by the Time Up and Go (TUG) test, patient satisfaction, patient's rating of
      catheter effectiveness, and complications.
