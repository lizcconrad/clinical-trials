      To determine the pharmacokinetics of epinephrine during cardiac arrest.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of out study is to determine the pharmacokinetics in humans during cardiac arrest,
      following a single dose of epinephrine. Venous samples will be withdrawn every minute the
      first five minutes following a single dose.

      The aim of the study is to determine T1/2 in a clinical setting and to determine time to peak
      concentration.

    <measure>Concentration of epinephrine (ng/mL) as a function of time the first five minutes following administration</measure>
    <time_frame>Blood samples will be drawn within minutes, and the survivors transported to hospital. The data according to Utstein-style, will also be collected. Blood samples will be analysed within weeks.Total timeframe for the study is estimated to one year.</time_frame>
    <description>Blood concentration of epinephrine will be determined the first five minutes following administration. For every minute starting With administration of epinephrine, blood samples will be drawn to determine the concentration (ng/mL). In total, six samples will be drawn. The administered dose (1 mg) will also be related to the patients weight, either estimated, or for those survivors admitted to hospital, measured in the Intensive Care Unit. Further, data according to the Utstein-template will be recorded.However, the primary outcome is to determine the plasma concentrations in every patients the first five minutes.</description>
