  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether tear secretion in patients with Parkinson's
      disease will be altered to exhibit a characteristic or diagnostic biomarker profile, that
      will be reflected in changes in the protein composition of tear fluid, which can be measured
      relatively easily, cost-effectively, and non-invasively. Tear fluid samples will be collected
      from Parkinson's patients, and through biochemical assays, the profile of proteins in tears
      will be characterized and compared to that from control subjects. The profiles will be
      analyzed with respect to any differences between Parkinson's patients and control subjects.
      If differences appear, the levels of these potential biomarkers in Parkinson's patients will
      be compared to the severity of their disease.

        The investigators will recruit participants with Parkinson's disease and controls from the
        Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorder Center at the University of Southern California
        (USC) and from the surrounding community.
