  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient age 45 year old and above who presented with rectal bleeding at three tertiary
      hospitals in South West Nigeria were invited for colonoscopy. The clinical information of the
      patients and the colonoscopy data were analyzed

      Patient age 45 year old and above who presented with rectal bleeding at Obafemi Awolowo
      University Teaching Hospitals Complex, Ile Ife, Nigeria, University College Hospital, Ibadan,
      Nigeria, and University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital, Ilorin Nigeria were invited for
      colonoscopy. Categorical variables were compared using Ï‡2-test or Fisher's exact test while
      the Kruskal-Wallis test was used for quantitative variables. Multivariate analysis was
      performed using logistic regression model. All statistical tests were two-sided and p-values
      below 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis was carried out
      using SAS 9.4 and R 3.3.1.

    <description>The hypothesis for this study was that colonoscopy surveillance of a high-risk cohort of patients with rectal bleeding would demonstrate that 10-20% of these patients have pre-malignant colorectal polyps(adenomas) or cancers.</description>
