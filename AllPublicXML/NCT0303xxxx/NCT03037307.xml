    <textblock>
      The objective of this study will be to compare bite force (BF) measurements over a 12-hour
      period of a currently marketed denture adhesive cream based on carbomer technology (test),
      with a positive control and a negative/no treatment control.

      This will be a single centre, randomized, crossover, 3-treatment, 3-period study to compare
      BF measurements over a 12 hour period of a currently marketed denture adhesive cream based on
      carbomer technology (test), with a positive control, and a negative/no treatment control. A
      short questionnaire regarding the flavor and texture characteristics of each denture adhesive
      after a single use will also be used to generate data for these attributes. This study
      included four visits: Visit 1 (screening visit), Visit 2, 3, 4 (treatment visits).

    <measure>Area over baseline over 12 hours (AOB0-12) for the incisal bite force</measure>
    <time_frame>Upto 12 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Area over baseline over 12 hours (AOB0-12) was assessed to measure the incisal bite force. AOB0-12 was calculated as area under the curve over 12 hours [AUC0-12])/12 hours minus baseline bite force (pounds [lbs]). AUC0-12 was calculated using the trapezoidal method. This transformation returned the measurement to the same scale as the original observations. Higher values of AOB0-12 demonstrate a stronger bite force overtime than lower values.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Demonstrates understanding of the study procedures, restrictions and willingness to

             qualified designee: No clinically significant and relevant abnormalities in medical
             history or upon oral examination; absence of any condition that could affect the
             participant's safety or wellbeing or their ability to understand and follow study
             procedures and requirements.

          -  Diagnosis: a) Completely edentulous maxillary arch restored with a conventional full
             acrylic based upper complete denture, b) Dentate, partial or full edentulous
             mandibular arch. Partial or full edentulous arch may be restored with a stable
             complete, partial or implant supported denture, c) Maxillary dentures must be
