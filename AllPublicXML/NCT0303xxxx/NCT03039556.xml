  <brief_summary>

      This study investigates the effects of two weeks of reduced daily ambulation and a subsequent
      return to normal physical activity on metabolic health of older adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aging results in a progressive loss of muscle mass that is accelerated by periods of muscular
      disuse, common for older adults during hospitalization or convalescence from illness.
      Transient physical inactivity has been shown to cause muscular atrophy and impairments in
      insulin sensitivity in both younger and older adults. However, the recovery capacity of older
      adults after such physical inactivity remains unknown. This study aims to determine the
      impact of two weeks of daily step reduction to ≤1000 steps per day, an experimental model
      mimicking short-term physical inactivity, on glycemic control in older adults and further
      investigate whether older adults are able to recover from the consequences of this inactivity
      simply by returning to their habitual activity for 14 days.
