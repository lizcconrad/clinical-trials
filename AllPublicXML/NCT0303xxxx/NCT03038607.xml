  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intrauterine growth restriction refers to a fetus that has failed to get a specific measures
      by a gestational age. Asymmetric type of Intrauterine growth restriction is known by normal
      sized head with smaller abdomen.It is important to recognize the growth restricted fetuses,
      because these fetuses may have fetal or neonatal complications.

      When blood flow is increased, the oxygen and nutrients will deliver good to the fetus. The
      role of low-dose aspirin therapy in management of intrauterine growth restriction is
      controversial. It has been used, in many studies, in prevention of intrauterine growth
      restriction especially in women at high risk of pre-eclampsia or obstetrical antiphospholipid
      syndrome.
