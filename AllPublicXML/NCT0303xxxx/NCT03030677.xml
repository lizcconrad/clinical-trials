  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are trying to establish an easy technique for insertion of a catheter for
      continuous infusion while performing pectoral type 2 (serratus) block, as a post operative
      pain controlling measure for cases undergoing simple mastectomy, using ultrasound guidence

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As the space between the pectoralis minor and the serratus anterior is a fashial plane with a
      connective tissue occupying. we are trying to demonstrate a simple technique for inserting a
      catheter within that fashial plane and making sure of the catheter position, to ensure post
      operative analgesia for cases performing simple mastectomy.

      Now the Pectoralis type 2 block (PECS type 2) is an established technique as regional block
      technique for chest wall procedures.

      We are trying to maximizing the benefit of the block with a catheter insertion to use it for
      continuous infusion of bupivacaine for controlling post operative pain in cases performing
      simple mastectomy procedure
