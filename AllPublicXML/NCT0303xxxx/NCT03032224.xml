  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The occurrence of dysphagia is a well-known early feature of esophageal cancer that may
      reduce caloric intake and thus cause weight loss. Sarcopenia is considered to be a
      consequence of such involuntary nutritional restriction. The prevalence of sarcopenia in
      patients with esophageal cancer before and after surgery is not well known and its possible
      consequences have been debated.

      Aim: The aim of this study was to prospectively explore body composition and function in a
      cohort of patients with esophageal cancer before and after surgery with curative intent. In
      particular, to investigate the prevalence and development of sarcopenia and body composition
      as a consequence to surgery for esophageal cancer and the possible relation to morbidity,
      length of stay and quality of life (QoL).

      Methods: In a cohort of 76 patients who had esophageal- or cardia-cancer and were planned for
      surgery with a curative intent, data on body-composition measured with bioimpedance, working
      capacity (cardiac stress test), grip strength and QoL (European Organisation for Research and
      Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaires (QLQ)-C30 version 3.0) were
      prospectively collected. Data regarding dysphagia was derived from an esophagus related
      quality of life form (EORTC QLQ-OES18). Data on tumour stage and type, complications, length
      of stay and preoperative weight loss were collected from medical charts.

        The study was a prospective collected cohort study in 76 patients who were referred to the
        surgery clinic at the Sahlgrenska University hospital 2005-2010. Patients with esophageal
        cancer or cancer of the gastroesophageal junction (Siewert I or II), who were scheduled to
        undergo resection surgery with curative intent, were asked to participate. Patients were
        excluded if they were found to have an advanced tumour stage or if they declined
        participation.
