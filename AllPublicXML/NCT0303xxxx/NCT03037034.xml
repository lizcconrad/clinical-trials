  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic submucosal tumor resection using biopsy forceps was performed for 11 consecutive
      patients who had clinical indications for lesion removal. Following the injection around a
      submucosal tumor, the adjacent mucosa or submucosa was grasped with the forceps and pulled
      away to form a &quot;tent&quot;. The tissue was dissected using an electrocoagulating current. In
      brief, the tumor was dissected from the muscularis propria layer and then carefully removed
      using forceps. Demographic data, indication for intervention, safety of the procedure and
      follow‚Äêup will be assessed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After the target lesion was identified, several marking dots were made around the lesion,
      using the hot biopsy forcep. A 0.9% saline solution mixed with epinephrine (1:10,000) and
      indigo carmine dye was injected along the border of the tumor to raise the gastric mucosa.
      Then, a circumferential incision was made along the margin of the targeted lesion, using the
      hot biopsy forceps, and the superficial mucosa was removed. Repeated injection was performed
      into the submucosal layer. The surrounding tissue was then carefully dissected using the hot
      biopsy forceps to the level of the deepest submucosal layer. The adjacent tissue was grasped
      using the forceps and pulled away, forming a &quot;tent&quot;. To ensure complete resection, the
      muscular fibers and stalks that connected the tumor to the propria layer were shelled along
      the capsule of the tumor, using the coagulating forceps. The investigators used a coagulating
      forceps when strip the tissue of the outer longitudinal layer. Visible blood vessels in the
      submucosal layer were directly coagulated using coagulating forceps. After the lesion was
      removed, further visible blood vessels were coagulated. The hot biopsy forcep was used to
      apply a forced coagulation current (80 W, Effect 2, VIO300D; Erbe, Germany). However,
      coagulating forceps with a soft coagulation current (60 W, Effect 6, VIO300D; Erbe, Germany)
      were used to cut muscle fibers adjacent to the tumor or hemostasis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. the tumor size had increased on the follow up gastroscopy,

          2. the EUS showed a well demarcated GI SET, or

          3. they requested an endoscopic excision because the tumor was causing them anxiety.
