      The aim of this study is to assess and compare a mindfulness low-intensity (4 weeks)
      psychological intervention for the treatment of depression in Primary Care between different
      groups: a mindfulness intervention applied face to face in group format, a control group that
      will receive treatment as usual (TAU) consisting of medical treatment and the same
      mindfulness intervention applied by Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). The
      principal hypothesis is that face to face intervention will be more effective than TAU

      The aim of this study is to assess and compare a mindfulness low-intensity (4 weeks)
      psychological intervention for the treatment of depression in Primary Care between different
      groups: 1) a face-to-face mindfulness intervention in group format (10-12 people/group), 2) a
      control group which will received primary care TAU (usual medical treatment) and 3) the same
      mindfulness intervention applied by Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs)
      (Internet-based program). All participants in the two psychological intervention groups will
      also receive usual medical treatment managed by their general practitioner. Each group will
      be composed of 40 participants with a total sample of 120. The principal hypothesis is that
      face to face intervention will be more effective than TAU. Secondary hypothesis, are: 1) The
      online computerized program will be more effective than TAU; 2) The differences between
      face-to-face and online format will be analyzed. Finally, a qualitative study will be
      conducted in order to analyze the feasibility, acceptance, barriers and causes of drop-outs
      and success, expectations, experiences and attitudes that could be obstacles or facilitators
      in the interventions, both in patients and in health professionals. This study will allow us
      to understand the experiences of depressed patients with these interventions and their
      differences.
