  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies a new type of ultrasound technique, MicroPure, in detecting
      breast microcalcifications in patients undergoing biopsy for a breast abnormality. Ultrasound
      sends sound waves into the body, and the sound waves reflected back are interpreted by the
      machine into a grayscale image. MicroPure uses a filter that adjusts the brightness and gives
      color to the ultrasound images, which may allow doctors to better identify
      microcalcifications. Microcalcifications are tiny deposits of calcium in the breast that
      cannot be felt but can be detected by imaging. A group of microcalcifications may indicate
      that cancer is present.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate MicroPure relative to grayscale ultrasound imaging for the identification of
      microcalcifications with mammography as the reference standard.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate MicroPure compared to grayscale ultrasound imaging and mammography for the
      characterization of breast abnormalities associated with microcalcifications using biopsy
      results as the reference standard (sensitivity and specificity will be calculated).

      II. Evaluate MicroPure relative to specimen x-ray imaging for the identification of breast
      microcalcifications with pathology as the reference standard.

      III. Estimate the improvements in patient care that may be achievable if MicroPure guided
      core needle biopsy procedures can replace some surgical excisions for the evaluation of
      breast abnormalities.

    <description>The number of microcalcifications seen on MicroPure ultrasound will be recorded and compared to x-ray imaging of the area undergoing the biopsy procedure (as the reference standard). The difference in agreement between the two ultrasound modes (relative to mammography) will be assessed using McNemar's test for correlated proportions, where p-values less than 0.05 are considered significant. A dichotomous parameters indicating agreement with mammography with respect to the exact number of microcalcifications (as yes or no) will be calculated and compared.</description>
