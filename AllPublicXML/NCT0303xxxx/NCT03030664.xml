  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double blind study in two parallel groups
      testing the efficacy of daily oral supplementation with the probiotic L.reuteri DSM17938
      compared to placebo in increasing the number of spontaneous bowel movements in infants and
      children with functional constipation.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Functional constipation in infants up to 4 years of age is defined according to Rome III
      criteria (Hyman 2006). The diagnose must include 1 month of at least two of the following
      criteria: two or fewer defecations per week; at least 1 episode per week of incontinence
      after the acquisition of toilet skills; history of excessive stool retention; history of
      painful or hard bowel movements; presence of a large faecal mass in the rectum; history of
      large-diameter stools that may obstruct the toilet.

      Accompanying symptoms may include irritability, decreased appetite and/or early satiety. The
      accompanying symptoms disappear immediately following passage of a large stool.

      There is a growing interest for the use of probiotics in functional constipation as research
      suggests that probiotics could provide beneficial support in the traditional treatment
      arsenal although the mechanisms of actions are not completely understood.

      Wu et al have demonstrated that Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 may have a region-specific
      intestinal effect on gut motility and therefore could be beneficial in treatment of
      constipation

      Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 has shown significant favourable effects in adults (Ojetti
      2014) and young children as described above (Coccorullo 2010, Olgac 2013). These studies
      require confirmation however. The present clinical study has been designed to strengthen the
      current available data that L. reuteri DSM 17938 has beneficial effects in infants and young
      children with functional constipation.

      We hypothesize that daily oral supplementation with the probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri DSM
      17938 will effectively increase the number of spontaneous bowel movements in infants/children
      diagnosed with functional constipation according to modified Rome III.
