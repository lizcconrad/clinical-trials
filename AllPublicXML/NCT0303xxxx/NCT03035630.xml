      This is an open label, randomized phase II trial. Eligible subjects will be randomized in a
      1:1 ratio and stratified for known prognostics variables to one of two first-line medication
      treatment arms. Once disease progression has been documented, and following a required
      inter-line washout period, subjects will receive either second-line medication treatment or
      discontinue treatment, per discretion of treating investigator.

      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center trial. Eligible subjects will be randomized and stratified to
      one of two arms:

      FIRST-LINE INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT ARM A:

        -  Avelumab 10mg/kg intravenously (IV) on Day 1 (D1) and Day 15 (D15) of every 28 day cycle
           until documented disease progression per Immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria In
           Solid Tumors (irRECIST) 1.1

      SECOND-LINE INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT ARM A:

        -  Following completion of an inter-line washout period of a minimum of 2 weeks up to a
           maximum of 60 days (or at the discretion of treating investigator) subjects will
           receive:

             -  Sunitinib 50 mg by mouth (po) once daily from D1 to D14 of every 21 day cycle until
                documented disease progression per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors
                (RECIST) 1.1 OR

             -  Discontinue treatment

      FIRST-LINE INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT ARM B:

        -  Sunitinib 50 mg po once daily from D1 to D14 of every 21 day cycle until documented
           disease progression per RECIST 1.1

      SECOND-LINE INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT ARM B:

        -  Following completion of an inter-line washout period of a minimum of 2 weeks up to a
           maximum of 60 days (or at the discretion of treating investigator) subjects will
           receive:

             -  Avelumab 10mg/kg IV on D1 and D15 every 28 day cycle until documented disease
                progression per irRECIST 1.1 OR

             -  Discontinue treatment

      NOTE:

      Subjects who do not experience disease progression at end of first-line treatment and are
      removed from first-line treatment due to toxicities or personal decision, may also either
      receive second-line therapy or be monitored during the inter-line period until progression
      (which may be longer than 60 days) per discretion of treating investigator.

      Radiological disease evaluation assessments will be completed every 12 weeks.

      To demonstrate adequate organ function, all screening labs must be obtained within 14 days
      prior to registration:

      Hematological:

        -  Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 K/mm3

        -  Hemoglobin (Hgb) ≥ 9 g/dL

        -  Platelets ≥ 100 K/ mm3

      Renal:

        -  Calculated creatinine clearance by Cockcroft-Gault formula ≥ 40 ml/min

          -  Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 14
             days prior to registration. NOTE: Females are considered of child bearing potential

             heterosexual activity or to use 2 forms of effective methods of contraception from the
             time of informed consent until 60 days after treatment discontinuation. The two
             contraception methods can be comprised of two barrier methods, or a barrier method
             plus a hormonal method.

          -  As determined by the enrolling physician or protocol designee, ability of the subject
             to understand and comply with study procedures for the entire length of the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects meeting any of the criteria below may not participate in the study:

             surveillance.

          -  Active central nervous system (CNS) metastases (previously treated CNS metastasis are
