  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy and safety of an experimental drug,
      OMP-305B83, when given in combination with paclitaxel. OMP-305B83 is a humanized monoclonal
      antibody and was developed to target cancer stem cells. Based on preclinical studies, it is
      believed that OMP-305B83 may block the growth of cancer stem cells and may also impair the
      productive growth of new blood vessels, which tumors need to grow and spread.

      This is an open-label, Phase 1b dose escalation and expansion study of OMP-305B83 plus
      paclitaxel designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of OMP-305B83 in
      combination with paclitaxel in patients with platinum resistant ovarian, primary peritoneal
      or fallopian tube cancer. This study consists of a screening period, a treatment period and a
      post-treatment follow up period in which patients will be followed for survival for
      approximately 12 months. Patients will be enrolled in two stages: a dose-escalation stage and
      an expansion phase.

      Approximately 30 patients will be enrolled in this study at approximately 5 study centers in
      the United States (U.S)..
