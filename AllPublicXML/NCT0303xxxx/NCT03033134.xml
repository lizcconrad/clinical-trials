          5. The subject is eligible to come off warfarin therapy if the LAA is sealed (i.e. the
             subject has no other conditions that would require warfarin therapy).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject has a prior stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) or transient ischemic attack
             within the 90 days prior to consent

             myocardial infarction within 90 days prior to consent with or without intervention

          3. The subject had or is planning to have any cardiac (e.g. cardioversion, coronary
             angiogram, percutaneous coronary intervention, cardiac ablation, etc.) or non-cardiac
             invasive or surgical procedure (e.g. cataract surgery, endoscopy, etc.) within 30 days
             prior or 45 days after the BSJ003W implant

          4. The subject has a history of atrial septal repair or has an atrial septal
             defect/persistent foramen ovale device

          5. The subject has an implanted mechanical valve prosthesis in any position

          6. The subject currently New York Heart Association class IV congestive heart failure

          7. The subject is contraindicated to aspirin

          8. The subject is contraindicated or seriously allergic to thienopyridine

          9. The subject is of childbearing potential and is, or plans to become pregnant during
             the time of the study

         10. The subject is not able and willing to return for required follow-up visits and
             examinations

         11. Subjects who are currently enrolled in another investigational study (of which primary
             endpoint follow-up have not been completed yet).

         12. The subject has other reason not to be eligible for this study per investigators'
