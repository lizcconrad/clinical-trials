  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CAR-T therapy was therefore proposed and has been recently used for cancer treatment. It has
      been hailed for its promising remission rates after early stage clinical trials for acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia. However, CAR-T therapy is seldom used for autoimmune diseases.
      Researchers only use it for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS, an autoimmune disease of
      the central nervous system). SLE is a kind of autoimmune diseases which involving multiple
      systems, organs and with the present of a variety of autoantibodies. In the conventional
      treatment options, SLE could be treated with chemotherapy drugs or hormone drugs. But
      chemotherapy and hormone drugs could barely cured SLE. And now, chimeric antigen receptor
      modified T cell infusion maybe an effective treatment to solve these problems. The
      investigators use a 2nd CAR- T with the optimized hinge and transmembrane domain to treat
      patients with SLE. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of this 2nd
      CAR-T cells in the treatment of SLE.

      This study is being conducted to assess anti-CD19-CAR-T cells safety and efficacy in treating
      patients with systemic lupus erythematosus（SLE）.The investigators constructed a 2nd CAR,
      using CD19 as target, using 4-1BB as co-stimulator, and optimized the spatial conformation by
      a suitable hinge and transmembrane domain sequences. The infusion dose is (1-10)E6 CAR
      positive T cells/kg, and the specific cells numbers depends on the situation of individual
      CAR-T cells preparation.
