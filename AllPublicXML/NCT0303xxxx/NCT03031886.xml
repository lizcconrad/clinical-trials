      Purpose: This study is carried out to determine the effect of GI on 24 hour blood glucose
      profiles and energy regulation in Asians when fed a normal diet modulated with sweeteners.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The GI is a method of classifying foods based on the food's ability to raise the blood
      glucose level. Low GI foods are recommended as they have a lower impact on blood glucose
      concentrations. The research sets out to determine the effect of GI on 24 hour blood glucose
      profiles and energy regulation in Asians. Healthy, normal-weight and overweight, Chinese
      males will be recruited. There will be two sessions (consisting of three days for each
      session) where they will consume either a high or low glycaemic index dinner at home and a
      high or low GI breakfast, lunch and snack on the next day (in the whole body calorimeter).
      There will be at least five days in between the two sessions. Their glycaemic response will
      be measured using a Continuous Glucose Monitoring System (CGMS) throughout the period, while
      substrate oxidation will be measured over 10 hours in the calorimeter (from breakfast, lunch
      and snack). This study specifically attempts to see whether the inclusion of a low GI
      sweetener in a mixed meal sequence can impact blood glucose levels and energy regulation in
      Asians. The study is important in that it will enable us to compute the rate of fat oxidation
      and how it is influenced when subjects are fed a mixed meals modulated to be high GI
      (increased glucose excursions) or low GI (moderated glucose) over 24 hours in healthy Asians.
      Obesity and diabetes rates are increasing exponentially in Asian populations and Singapore is
      no exception. Devising ways and means to staunch the escalation is therefore a priority. The
      findings of the research will contribute towards the long-term objectives of developing
      dietary guidelines for weight and glycaemic control. The study data will also be important
      for the provision of practical food-based advocacy for better weight and glycaemic control in
      Asians.
