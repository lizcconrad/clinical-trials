      This is a single-arm, open-label, one center, dose escalation clinical study, to determine
      the safety and efficacy of infusion of autologous T cells engineered to express immune
      checkpoint antibody and chimeric antigen receptor targeting mesothelin in adult patients with
      mesothelin positive, recurrent or refractory malignant tumors.
