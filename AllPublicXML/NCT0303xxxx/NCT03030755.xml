      The goal of this research is to develop measurement tools and simulation technology for
      characterizing and predicting individual responses to corneal treatments and for advancing
      understanding of corneal ectasia risk factors. Patients who either 1) have keratoconus and
      are being evaluated for corneal crosslinking or 2) have refractive error and are being
      evaluated for refractive surgery procedures such as LASIK will have their eyes imaged to
      assess their mechanical properties and will have computational simulations performed to
      predict the response to treatment. One aim of the study is to test the hypothesis that
      computational models can predict the cornea's shape changes within clinically acceptable
      limits of error.

      The mechanical condition of the cornea is an important but elusive property of the eye to
      characterize. Weakness in the cornea is thought to be one of the primary causes of corneal
      ectasia, a major cause of visual impairment worldwide. Corneal weakness is also important to
      identify in refractive surgery candidates since such surgeries often involve tissue removal
      that could lead to corneal instability in certain predisposed patients.

      In this study, subjects will undergo imaging with an optical coherence tomography (OCT)-based
      system to characterize corneal biomechanical properties. In addition, computational
      representations of the eye will be built from images and interventions will be simulated and
      compared to actual treatment outcomes. No investigational procedures or study-specific
      interventions other than imaging are involved.
