  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This investigation will be a clinical trial to study the performance of a newly developed
      high strength ceramic material for crowns. The ceramic has been approved by the FDA for
      patient treatment. A computer technique will be used to fabricate the crowns in a single
      appointment without the need for a temporary crown or second appointment. Two adhesive resin
      cement techniques will be used to hold the crown to the tooth and they will be evaluated for
      creating sensitivity to the tooth. The purpose of the study is to measure how well the high
      strength crowns function over an extended period of time.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be composed of two groups of 50 crowns placed in adult patients that have been
      identified as requiring at least one crown on a posterior tooth. A maximum of two crowns per
      patient will be completed. All the crowns will be made from the same high strength ceramic
      material (Celtra Duo/Dentsply Sirona). The two groups of crowns will be made using two
      different processes to create the surface texture and finish for the crown. One group of
      Celtra Duo crowns (Group 1) will be glaze-fired in a porcelain oven and the second group
      (Group 2) will be hand-polished. All the crowns will be cemented using two adhesive
      techniques. All of the oven-fired, glazed crowns will be cemented using the self-etching,
      self-adhesive resin cement technique (Calibra Universal Cement/Dentsply). All of the hand
      polished crowns will be cemented using an adhesive bonding technique using Prime &amp; Bond Elect
      (Dentsply) with a dual cured resin cement (Calibra Ceram/Dentsply). The crowns are planned to
      be evaluated at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, and if funding permits, 4 years, and 5
      years. At each appointment an examination of the crown will be completed as well as clinical
      photographs, an intraoral digital scan, and impression of the crown.

    <measure>Crown loss of retention</measure>
    <time_frame>from delivery of the crown up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Loss of retention is measured as detachment of the crown from the tooth without fracture of the crown requiring recementation of the crown.</description>

    <measure>Tooth sensitivity</measure>
    <time_frame>from delivery of the crown up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Patient described sensitivity on a scale of 1 to 4, where 1 means absence of sensitivity (pain) and four means severe discomfort noted routinely with cold or pressure stimulation.</description>

    <measure>Margin staining</measure>
    <time_frame>from delivery of the crown up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Margin staining is categorized based on modified US Public Health Service criteria using a four point scale where 1 is no staining and 4 is penetrating stain involving more than 50% of the margin.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  must have at least one carious lesion or defective restoration or fractured tooth in a
             molar or premolar

          -  reason for restoration should extend more than one-half the intercuspal width of the
             tooth requiring a full crown restoration

          -  Teeth to be vital and asymptomatic prior to treatment

          -  No more than two restorations will be placed per patient. If a patient presents with
             more than two acceptable teeth for the study, molar teeth will be included prior to
             premolar teeth.

        Exclusion Criteria:
