  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Altered loading is a causative factor for the development of knee osteoarthritis following
      anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR), and real-time biofeedback may be an
      effective intervention to manipulate altered mechanical loading about the knee. The purpose
      of this study is to 1) determine if ACLR participants are able to acquire and retain various
      loading patterns using real-time biofeedback, 2) determine the effect of altered loading on
      lower extremity biomechanics during walking gait, and 3) determine the effect of altered
      loading on biochemical markers of collagen turnover and inflammation during walking gait.

      Participants will attend 4 testing sessions. Lower extremity biomechanical outcomes and blood
      samples will be taken before and following the participant walking at a self-selected speed
      for 20 minutes. During the 20 minutes of treadmill walking real-time biofeedback will be
      displayed in an attempt to alter mechanical loading. Participants will complete a control,
      overloading, under-loading, average loading testing session. Order of loading condition will
      be randomized.

    <description>Participants will walk on a force-instrumented treadmill for 20 minutes and will be provided visual biofeedback consisting of bilateral vertical ground reaction force. A target will be placed at 10% greater than the participant's baseline vertical ground reaction force. Participants will be asked to alter their walking gait in an attempt to reach the target line with each step.</description>

    <description>A custom written MatLab script will sample bilateral peak vertical ground reaction forces and display the magnitude in real time on a screen placed in front of the participant. A target line will be placed in the middle of the screen which corresponds to one of the three loading conditions. Participants will be instructed to alter their movement in an attempt to match each limb's vertical ground reaction force to the target line.</description>
