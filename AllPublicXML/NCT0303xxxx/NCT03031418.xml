  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is investigate a new and validated urine test which
      predicts the likelihood of high grade prostate cancer on an initial prostate biopsy The
      current protocol has two objectives; one is to further assess and evaluate the performance of
      the urine test in men already scheduled for initial prostate needle biopsy (cohort (group) 1)
      and two, to evaluate how the results of the urine test influences the decision process for
      determining whether to perform a prostate biopsy (cohort (group) 2).

      Primary Objective(s)

        -  Confirm performance of the ExoDx Prostate (IntelliScore) (EPI) utilizing a designated
           collection vessel for men presenting for their initial prostate biopsy with an elevated
           Prostate-specific antigen (2-10 ng/mL).

        -  Evaluate impact of the confirmed ExoDx Prostate (IntelliScore) on the decision to
           perform an initial prostate biopsy for men presenting with an elevated Prostate-specific
           antigen (2-10 ng/mL).

      Secondary and Exploratory Objectives

        -  Assess physician satisfaction with the ExoIntelliScore Prostate report including test
           result presentation, graphics and interpretation.

        -  Assess patient satisfaction for ease of understanding test results and role on decision
           process to have a biopsy.

        -  Determine the medical economic impact of the ExoIntelliScore Prostate in the prostate
           biopsy decision process.

        -  Correlation of the ExoIntelliScore Prostate score with the actual biopsy result.

    <description>Enroll up to 500 patients to evaluate how the results of the urine test influences the decision process for determining whether to perform a prostate biopsy. The treating physician will collect a urine sample for testing and 2 weeks later discuss whether to perform a prostate biopsy with the subject knowing the results of the urine test and comparing them to the overall consensus report from Cohort 1 as well as other clinical factors the treating physician would otherwise use to determine whether they should have a prostate biopsy.</description>

    <description>ExoDx Prostate (IntelliScore) is a non-invasive, urinary 3-gene expression validated test in which the results of the assay are adjunctive to the ordering physician's clinical judgment and work-up of the patient in the determination of whether a prostate needle biopsy is necessary. The ExoDx Prostate (IntelliScore) was clinically validated to discriminate patients with higher grade prostate cancer from those with more indolent lower grade cancer and benign disease.</description>
