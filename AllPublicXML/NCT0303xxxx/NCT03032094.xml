  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test if the thickness of the graft taken from the roof of the
      mouth, has a significant effect on the amount of attached tissue and the amount of root
      coverage that are attained when treating a single tooth with gingival recession.

      The goal of the study is to determine if the thickness of a tissue graft taken from the roof
      of the mouth, used to cover the exposed root of a tooth, affects the overall outcome of the
      root coverage, the health of the resulting tissue, as well as postoperative pain as reported
      by the patient. Connective tissue grafts will be harvested in different thicknesses, and
      results of the procedures will be compared. Qualified subjects will undergo a root coverage
      procedure, after random assignment to one of the groups. Regular recall visits to monitor
      healing at intervals of 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, and 3 months will be scheduled. Subjects
      will be asked to fill out patient response forms regarding pain and other symptoms at these
      visits. Photographs will be taken.
