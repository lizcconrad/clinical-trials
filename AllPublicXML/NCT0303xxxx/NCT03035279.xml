  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 1 study of SC-006 given as a single agent and in
      combination with ABBV-181 in participants with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC), and consists
      of Part A (single agent SC-006 dose regimen finding), followed by Part B (single agent SC-006
      dose expansion), and Part C (SC-006 and ABBV-181 combination escalation and expansion). Part
      A (dose regimen finding) will involve dose escalation and possible dose interval modification
      to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Part B dose and schedule. Part
      B (dose expansion) will enroll additional participants who will be treated with a study drug
      dose at or below the MTD determined in Part A. Part C is dose escalation of SC-006 and fixed
      dose of ABBV-181 in combination. Recommended dose cohort of SC-006 with ABBV-181 will be
      expanded.
