  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sporadic duodenal adenomas are rare. As they are highly pre neoplastic, they should be
      removed and endoscopic mucosectomy is recommended during digestive endoscopy. However, this
      technique, albeit less dangerous than surgery, is associated with complications such as
      haemorrhages, perforations, and more relapse than that can be observed for colorectal
      adenomas. As no prospective data have been published this French multicenter study aim to
      analyze results of this technique under standardized and secured procedure.

      All investigators are expert in therapeutic endoscopy in tertiary centers and are member of a
      group of clinical researcher involved in that field (&quot; GRAPHE &quot; (Groupe de Recherche et
      d'Action des Praticiens Hospitaliers en Endoscopie interventionnelle). Results are highly
      expected among the international society of gastroenterologists who need to confirm the
      efficacy of endoscopy and define optimal conditions for performing adenomas resection in this
      location Primary End Point is the two years recurrence rate. Secondary End Points are
      frequency and type of complication after standardized endoscopic mucosectomy of duodenal
      adenomas, frequency and type of complications after a second endoscopic mucosectomy and
      patient's characteristics Patients with sporadic duodenal adenomas larger than 5 mm requiring
      endoscopic mucosectomy will be included. Non-inclusion criteria concern patients with
      previous endoscopic resection, lesion involving the major papilla, sub mucosal lesions,
      familial adenomatous polyposis and use of antiplatelet agent during the five last days.

      Hundred and twenty patients will be included and followed 2 years after mucosectomy.
