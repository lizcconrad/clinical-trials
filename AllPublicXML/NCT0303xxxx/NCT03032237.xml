  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Undernutrition risk among community-dwelling older adults in developed countries
      is shown to be around 24%. Increasing protein intake is a strategy that is feasible as well
      as efficacious to reduce undernutrition in community-dwelling older adults. A promising
      strategy to increase protein intake among older adults, is to offer dietary solutions with
      normal foods that fit their current daily eating patterns. For this reason, home-delivered
      protein-rich readymade meals and protein-rich dairy products will be studied in this
      research.

      Objective: The primary objective is to study the effectiveness of commercially available
      protein-rich readymade meals and protein-rich dairy products in increasing protein intake of
      older adults who use a meal-delivery service to a level of 1.2 g/kg bodyweight/d. Secondary
      objectives include: studying effects of these meals and dairy products on total daily energy
      intake. Further, studying the acceptance of and compliance to the meals and dairy products.

      Study design: The study will be performed as a single-blind randomized, controlled, four-week
      trial in a real-life setting: in community-dwelling older adults' own homes.

      Study population: The target group of this study are community-dwelling older adults who use
      a meal-delivery service.

      Intervention: Both groups will receive readymade meals for each day during 4 weeks. They will
      also receive dairy products to freely consume during the intervention period. The
      intervention groups receives protein-rich meals and protein-rich dairy products, the control
      receives standard meals and food products.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: Difference in daily protein intake between intervention and
      control group. Secondary parameters: energy intake and acceptance (liking).
