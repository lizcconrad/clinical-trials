  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-randomized, multi-centre, open label, uncontrolled, multiple dose, phase IIa study.

      A total of 18 patients diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) scheduled for
      chemotherapy and expected to be neutropenic (&lt;500 Absolute neutrophil count (ANC)/µl) for &gt;10
      days will be treated. F901318 will be given in conjunction with fluconazole or posaconzaole
      in order to assess safe treatment regimens for both combinations.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      'F901318 has potent in vitro efficacy against Aspergillus spp. including azole-resistant
      strains and consistent efficacy in in vivo mouse models of infection. F901318 is active by
      both oral and intravenous routes of administration in preclinical efficacy studies.

      Non-clinical studies and phase I clinical trials show that F901318 has a good overall safety
      profile and limited potential for drug-drug interactions. F901318 exhibits a highly promising
      profile which can potentially address the critical treatment requirements for invasive
      Aspergillus infections in a changing clinical environment in which new classes of antifungals
      are needed.

      This phase IIa study aims to confirm PK and safety information of F901318 from phase I and
      bridge them to a neutropenic AML patient population, which represents the main population for
      future efficacy trials. Coadministration of fluconazole or posaconazole will allow
      recognizing potential factors of suboptimal F901318 exposure without the risk of fatal
      disseminating infection.'

              22. Patient has participated or intends to participate in any other clinical study
                  that involves the administration of an investigational medication at the time of
                  presentation, during the course of the study, or during the 30 days prior to
                  study start. New combinations of labelled substances for chemotherapy are
                  allowed.
