  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Text2Breathe (T2B) is a randomized controlled trial aimed at improving communication between
      parents and their children's' primary care providers about asthma. The overarching goal of
      this study is to reduce disparities among a population with high rates of pediatric asthma
      morbidity. The investigators are testing the efficacy of a short message service
      (SMS)-enhanced health communication (HC) intervention (&quot;Text2Breathe&quot;) designed to equip
      urban, low-income parents with tools for communicating effectively with their children's
      primary care provider (PCP).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Potentially eligible participants are approached and screened in person during an admission
      of their child to the emergency department for asthma care. Those participants randomized to
      the intervention will receive additional education on effective communication with their
      child's primary care provider (PCP). These participants will also receive educational text
      messages for three months after their initial visit. Text messages will include education on
      effectively communicating with their child's provider and general asthma information. Both
      the control group and intervention group will receive text message reminders to schedule
      regular follow up visits with their PCP and get an annual flu shot. Both groups will be
      contacted for follow up phone interviews at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months.

    <measure>Asthma Self-Management Questionnaire standardized score</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Asthma Self-Management Questionnaire, recommended by experts convened for the Asthma Outcomes workshop, includes 16 multiple-choice questions regarding knowledge of preventive strategies and controller medication use. Standardized scores (0-100) are generated, with higher scores indicating more knowledge of self-management. Cronbach's alpha was 0.71. Wording of questions has been revised (e.g., &quot;you&quot; = &quot;your child&quot;) to be appropriate for parents of children with asthma.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Parental expectations for child's asthma treatment average score</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>In accordance with other research of pediatric asthma interventions, to assess parents' beliefs about possible asthma quality of life for their child we will administer an 8-item measure of parental expectations for asthma treatment. Parents respond to statements about their expectations (e.g., &quot;I believe that my child can be symptom free most of the time.&quot;) using a 5-point Likert scale (1=strongly disagree to 5=strongly agree). Total scores are calculated by averaging across responses, and higher scores reflect more optimistic asthma outcome expectations (Cronbach's alpha = 0.70).</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Parental self-efficacy for communicating with healthcare providers self-competence scale summary score</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Medical Competence Communication Scale (MCCS) measures patient's perceptions of their own communication during their most recent medical visits. The patient version of the measure is used to assess information giving, seeking and verifying, as well as socio-emotional communication. The MCCS, patient version, consists of 23 items rated on a 5-point Likert scale (1= unimportant to 5= important) with a higher score indicating greater perception of communication competence. Cronbach's alpha ranges from 0.76-0.92 on the various subscales. Only the 16 self-competence items will be administered in this study. Wording of questions will be modified to state &quot;my child's medical problem&quot; rather than &quot;my medical problem.&quot;</description>

    <measure>Parental asthma management self-efficacy scale summary score</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Parent Asthma Management Self-Efficacy Scale (PAMSES) is a valid and reliable instrument designed to measure parent self-efficacy in preventing and managing children's asthma attacks. The PAMSES consists of 13 items rated on a 5-point Likert scale (1=not at all sure to 5=completely sure) with a total possible score range of 13 to 65; higher scores indicate greater self-efficacy. Cronbach's alpha in a sample of primarily White mothers was 0.87.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to the control group will receive their usual asthma care from their provider. Additionally, participants in the control group will receive reminder texts to schedule with their child's PCP and to get an annual flu shot. Participants will be surveyed over the phone for 20-30 minutes 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after enrollment.</description>

    <description>The &quot;study&quot; group spends about 10-20 minutes learning about ways to have better communication with their child's primary care provider about his/her asthma. Additionally this group is enrolled in the Text2Breathe messaging program which sends asthma related educational text messages 2 times a week for 3 months. Participants randomized to the study group will also receive reminder texts to schedule with their child's PCP and to get an annual flu shot. Participants will be surveyed over the phone for 20-30 minutes 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after enrollment.</description>
