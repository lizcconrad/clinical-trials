  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intraoperative stress responses (vasoconstriction and changes in heart rate) and
      postoperative pain can be monitored using photoplethysmography (PPG). PPG measures changes in
      tissue volume noninvasively. Therefore it can measure acute changes in arterial diameter
      (vasoconstriction). PPG signal has two components, AC and DC. Effects of noxious
      stimuli-induced stress responses (vasoconstriction) have not been studied on the DC component
      of PPG. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a known noxious stimulus
      (endotracheal intubation) on both the AC and DC components of PPG.
