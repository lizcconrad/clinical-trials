  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a disease in which the myelin surrounding the nerve cells is
      damaged which affects functioning. MS usually is treated with medications designed to reduce
      the occurrence of future MS events. Evidence suggests that an important part of the disease
      process is damage to the myelin and brain caused by too much oxygen (sometimes called
      oxidative stress) or too much inflammation (or swelling).

      The overall goal of this study will be to determine whether NAC will help to support cerebral
      function in patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). This PET-MRI study will utilize FDG PET to
      measure cerebral metabolism, along with MRI analysis, to measure metabolism and structural
      effects of NAC in patients with MS.

      The study consists of two arms. The first arm of this study will receive intravenous and oral
      NAC, a strong antioxidant that increases brain glutathione. NAC, is the N-acetyl derivative
      of the naturally occurring amino acid, L-cysteine. It is a common over-the-counter supplement
      that is also available as an injectable pharmaceutical that protects the liver in cases of
      acetaminophen overdose. Laboratory studies have displayed some benefits to use of NAC. It has
      the potential to reduce markers of oxidative damage, protect against cell death, and to
      increase glutathione in blood, which might be useful in preventing oxidative damage in MS
      patients. The second arm will be a waitlist control receiving standard MS care. It should be
      noted that both arms will receive standard of care treatment for MS while enrolled in the
      study.
