    <textblock>
      This is a placebo-controlled clinical trial of VRC01 administration and analytic treatment
      interruption (ATI) in adults who began antiretroviral therapy (ART) during early acute HIV
      infection (Fiebig stage I to III). Eligible volunteers will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to
      either VRC01 or placebo, with randomization stratified by Fiebig stage. Volunteers who are
      receiving ART with a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) will undergo 4
      weeks of protease inhibitor (PI) substitution for their NNRTI prior to randomization. ATI
      will begin the day of the first dose of either VRC01 or placebo. Participants will be
      monitored closely for HIV viremia and other pre-defined criteria for ART resumption.
      Administration of the study agent (VRC01) every three weeks will be discontinued after 24
      weeks or if ART is resumed, whichever occurs first. Volunteers who remain virally suppressed
      without laboratory or clinical indication for ART resumption at 24 weeks will continue
      intensive monitoring for ART resumption criteria for an additional 24 weeks, during which
      time no VRC01 or placebo will be administered.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study agent, VRC-HIVMAB060-00-antibody (AB), was manufactured for the VRC by the Vaccine
      Pilot Plant operated by Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc, formerly SAIC-Frederick, Inc,
      Frederick, MD. Specific manufacturing information is included on the product vial labels and
      Certificates of Analysis and can be found in the Investigator's Brochure (IB). Quality
      Assurance (QA) lot release testing by the manufacturer and ongoing stability programs verify
      conformance to product specifications prior to use in clinical trials.

      VRC-HIVMAB060-00-AB (VRC01) is a broadly neutralizing human monoclonal antibody (mAb)
      targeted against the HIV-1 CD4 binding site. It was developed by the VRC/NIAID/NIH. VRC01 is
      of the IgG1 subtype and is highly somatically mutated from its germ-line precursor. The heavy
      chain CDR3 region is 14 amino acids long, which is an average length relative to natural
      antibodies, and the glycosylation pattern is derived from its production in a Chinese Hamster
      Ovary (CHO) mammalian cell line.

      This is a placebo-controlled clinical trial of VRC01 administration and ATI in adults who
      began ART during early acute HIV infection (Fiebig stage I to III). Eligible volunteers will
      be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to either VRC01 or placebo. Participants will undergo
      randomization stratified by Fiebig stage. Volunteers who are receiving ART with an NNRTI will
      undergo 4 weeks of PI substitution prior to randomization. ATI will begin the day of the
      first dose of either VRC01 or placebo. Participants will be monitored closely for HIV viremia
      and other pre-defined criteria for ART resumption. Administration of the study agent (VRC01)
      every 3 weeks will be discontinued after 24 weeks or at the time ART resumed, whichever
      occurs first. Volunteers who remain virally suppressed without laboratory or clinical
      indication for ART resumption at 24 weeks will continue intensive monitoring for ART
      resumption criteria for an additional 24 weeks, during which time no VRC01 or placebo will be
      administered. Clinical study visits will take place at the Thai Red Cross AIDS Research
      Centre, and the optional procedures may occur at the King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital.

      This study will recruit 24 adults aged 20-50 years who were diagnosed during acute HIV
      infection (Fiebig stage I to III) and initiated on ART in Bangkok, Thailand. Participants
      will be recruited from protocol RV 254 (SEARCH 010, WRAIR 1494). This ongoing parent study
      cohort enrolls participants with documented acute HIV infection at the Thai Red Cross AIDS
      Research Center in Bangkok, Thailand. All participants in RV 254 are offered ART at the time
      of enrollment through a separately funded protocol.

      Study agent:

      VRC01 will be administered at a dose of 40 mg/kg intravenously every three weeks to
      participants assigned to the intervention arm of the trial for a total duration of 24 weeks
      or until ART resumption criteria are met, whichever comes first.

      Placebo:

      Normal saline (Sodium Chloride for Injection USP, 0.9%) will be administered intravenously
      every three weeks to participants assigned to the placebo arm of the trial for a total
      duration of 24 weeks or until ART resumption criteria are met, whichever comes first.

      ANALYTIC TREATMENT INTERRUPTION (ATI) Analytic treatment interruption will begin on the day
      of administration of the first dose of either VRC01 or placebo. During the ATI, participants
      will be monitored closely for clinical and laboratory indications to resume ART. These
      criteria are designed to protect the subjects from clinical, immunological, or virological
      adverse effects during the ATI.
