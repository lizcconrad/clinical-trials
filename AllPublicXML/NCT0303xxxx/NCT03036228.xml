      The primary objective of this study is to determine safety and tolerability of Karonudib for
      the treatment of cancer.

      Secondary objectives are to determine a recommended RP2D and schedule for further development
      of Karonudib, to determine the pharmacokinetics of Karonudib, to look for evidence of
      treatment efficacy. Overall survival will also be recorded.

          2. Age at least 18 years (there is no upper age limit but patients must be judged to have
             a &quot;biologic&quot; age of 75 years or less).

          3. Histological or cytological confirmation of cancer (imaging/AFP are sufficient for
             patients with HCC according to international standards).

          4. The patient has received standard of care treatments and has progressive disease with
             only experimental therapies as further treatment options.

          5. Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks (as per investigators clinical assessment).

          6. ECOG PFS 0 or 1.

          7. Patients must have measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1 criteria.

          8. Adequate bone marrow, hepatic and renal function defined as:

               1. Haemoglobin ≥ 100 g/L (blood transfusion not less than 21 days prior to

          9. QTc interval &gt;450 ms at baseline.

         10. Use of fentanyl (must be stopped at least 1 week prior to initiation of Karonudib).

         11. Use of anti-oxidants vitamins and acetylcysteine (must be stopped within 48 hours of
