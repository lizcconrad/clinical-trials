      The effect of teledermatology on length of hospital admission, length of stay, 30 day
      readmission rate, and antibiotic use in patients presenting with cellulitis vs
      pseudocellulitis in an academic emergency department setting.

      The Investigator hope to determine if the implementation of teledermatology in the emergency
      department (ED) at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center is beneficial in
      diagnosing cases of cellulitis and pseudocellulitis conditions. Prior studies have indicated
      that misdiagnosis may occur in up to 28% of patients in the ED with these conditions.
      Additionally, dermatological consults have been shown to change diagnosis or management of
      these conditions in more than 60% of the patients examined. Without the use of
      teledermatology, however, a dermatological consult would be prohibitively expensive and take
      time to obtain. The investigator proposes that by utilizing teledermatology in emergency
      rooms, the investigator can make faster, yet just as accurate, dermatological diagnoses in
      patients presenting with cellulitis-like symptoms. Subsequently, by reducing the number of
      misdiagnoses, unnecessary use of antibiotics and hospitalizations will also decrease,
      lowering health care costs and simultaneously providing patients with faster treatment of the
      actual dermatologic condition.
