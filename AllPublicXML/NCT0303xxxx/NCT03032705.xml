    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare esthetic, functional and biological properties of two
      restoration materials used to fill cavities. One material is called &quot;Filtek™ Supreme&quot; which
      is a traditional tooth colored resin composite that is placed in the cavity in layers and
      hardened with UV light. The second material is called &quot;SonicFill™ 2,&quot; which is a bulk fill
      composite that uses an ultrasonic hand piece to change the material from a solid into a
      liquid in order to place it into the cavity. This material can be placed in the cavity in 1
      layer, and is hardened using UV light. Both materials have been FDA approved as
      non-significant risk devices for filling cavities.

      In each subject, one tooth with a cavity will be randomly selected to receive one filling
      material, and a second tooth with a cavity will be randomly selected to receive the second
      material. The fillings will be observed over a two year period to determine clinical
      acceptability.

      This study is a randomized, split-mouth, controlled, examiner-blinded clinical evaluation of
      Class II restorations using a new bulk-fill composite (SonicFill™ 2) and comparing it to
      Filtek™ Supreme resin composite placed in the traditional incremental technique.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical performance of a
      sonic-activated, bulk fill composite, SonicFill™ 2, by comparing it to Filtek™ Supreme in the
      following categories:

      Esthetic Properties

        -  Surface luster

        -  Staining - surface

        -  Staining - margin

        -  Color match and translucency

        -  Esthetic anatomical form

      Functional Properties

        -  Fracture of material and retention

        -  Marginal adaptation

        -  Aproximal anatomical form - contact point

        -  Radiographic examination (when applicable)

        -  Patient's view

      Biological Properties

        -  Postoperative (hyper-)sensitivity and tooth vitality

        -  Recurrence of caries, erosion, abfraction

        -  Tooth integrity (enamel cracks, tooth fractures)

        -  Adjacent mucosa

      The hypothesis to be tested is that the sonic-activated, bulk fill composite, SonicFill™ 2,
      will have comparable results to the traditional incremental technique composite, Filtek™
      Supreme, in overall clinical acceptability and in all compared categories
