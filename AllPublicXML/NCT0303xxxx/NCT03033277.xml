  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a high incidence of women suffering from Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (POI). One of
      the most common treatments for POI is hormone replacement therapy (HRT), but HRT doesn't work
      well, and it has been shown to increase the risk of blood clots in the veins, ovarian cancer,
      and breast cancer. The ability of MSCs to differentiate into oocyte-like cells has been
      previously documented. Herein the purpose of this work is to evaluate the therapeutic
      potential of cell therapy in women suffering from POI.
