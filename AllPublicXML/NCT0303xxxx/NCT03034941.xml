    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of short-term weight reduction achieved with
      12-week intervention with metformin alone or in combination with liraglutide on oocyte
      maturity and embryo quality in infertile obese PCOS population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common cause of anovulatory infertility, in
      particular when PCOS is linked to obesity. Obese PCOS has poor IVF outcomes associated with
      impaired oocyte and embryo parameters and morphology. The purpose of this pilot prospective
      study was to investigate the effect of the antiobesity medical therapy (combination of
      metformin and liraglutide (COMBI)) on short time weight loss in the specific infertile obese
      PCOS population. Additionally, we analyzed eventual impact of the short term weight loss 5%
      or more before IVF on oocyte maturity and embryo quality in infertile obese PCOS population.
