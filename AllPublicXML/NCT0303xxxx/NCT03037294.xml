      Rationale: Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee is a common cause of pain and disability,
      especially in people over the age of 65. In the current health care system both conservative
      (e.g. intra-articular injections with corticosteroids) and surgical (total knee replacement,
      TKR) treatment are applied. Although frequently used, certain effects of these treatments on
      protein metabolism remain unclear. It is well known that maintenance of different tissues is
      determined by a dynamic balance between protein synthesis and breakdown rates, with temporary
      changes in either protein synthesis or breakdown allowing net protein accretion or loss.
      However, intra-articular injections with corticosteroids as a conservative treatment are
      thought to have several negative consequences thereby potentially affecting protein
      metabolism of different musculoskeletal tissues. In addition, though protein supplementation
      has shown to be an effective nutritional strategy in stimulating muscle protein synthesis, it
      remains unclear to what extent other musculoskeletal tissues are able to respond to dietary
      protein supplementation. Therefore, the current study assesses the impact of intra-articular
      corticosteroid injections and preoperative protein supplementation on protein synthesis in
      different musculoskeletal tissues of the knee.

      Objective: To investigate the effect of preoperative protein supplementation and
      corticosteroid injections on Hoffa's fat pad, synovium, tendon, bone, muscle, ligament,
      menisci, and cartilage protein synthesis of the OA knee.

      Study design: Randomized, parallel (three groups) study design. Each of the two intervention
      groups will be compared to the control group separately.

      Study population: 36 adults (45-75 y) with OA of the knee undergoing TKR. Intervention:
      Intra-articular injection of betamethasone (2ml; 4mg/ml) and bupivacaine (8ml; 5mg/ml) or
      daily 40 g of pre-sleep protein two weeks before TKR, or no intervention.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: Primary study parameters include protein synthesis rates and
      enrichments of Hoffa's fat pad, synovium, tendon, bone, muscle, ligament, menisci, and
      cartilage. Secondary parameters include whole-body protein synthesis, breakdown, oxidation,
      and net balance.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness: The risks involved in participating in this study are minimal. There are no
      potential effects known for the ingestion of protein. The corticosteroid injection is
      standard care in conservative treatment of osteoarthritis. Risks are small and limited to the
      knee itself, such as cartilage degeneration or joint destruction. Muscle biopsies and tissue
      collection will be performed during the surgical procedure.
