  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is good evidence that randomizing C. difficile NAAT(+), toxin(-) patients to
      non-treatment represents an ethically tolerable risk-benefit, even in cancer patients and
      hematopoetic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients. Actually, detection of free toxin in the
      stool was the standard of care for the diagnosis of C. difficile infection (CDI) from 1983
      through 2010. Since then, NAAT became the standard diagnostic test for over 60% of US
      hospitals (National Healthcare Safety Network, unpublished data). However, there is growing
      evidence that symptomatic patients who are NAAT(+), toxin(-) have outcomes similar to
      patients who are NAAT(-), toxin(-); some of these outcomes include 30-day mortality, ICU
      admission, and hospital readmission triggered by C. difficile. Furthermore, the United
      Kingdom has successfully used a similar two step diagnostic algorithm with a confirmatory
      toxin EIA since 2012.

      The adverse health consequences resulting from antibiotic overtreatment of NAAT(+), toxin(-)
      patients may be particularly important in transplant recipients. The usual treatment
      prescribed for CDI at the Froedtert Memorial Lutheran Hospital is oral vancomycin. While this
      drug has excellent activity against C. difficile and commonly suppresses its growth to
      non-detection, it does not eradicate carriage and its use results in marked and prolonged
      disruption of the lower intestinal microbiota. Meanwhile, the degree of lower intestinal
      microbiota disruption at the time of HSCT engraftment has been demonstrated to be an
      independent predictor (controlling for other markers of underlying disease) of overall and
      transplant-related 3-year mortality.14 In addition, recent findings suggest that bone marrow
      suppressive effects of antibiotics, in this case potentially unnecessary oral vancomycin
      (which is not appreciably absorbed), may be solely mediated via microbiota disruption. All
      these data supports the notion that antibiotic treatment of NAAT(+), toxin(-) C. difficile
      patients might have significant negative repercussions without a clear clinical benefit.
