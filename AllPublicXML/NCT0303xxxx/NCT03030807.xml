  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigation serves the identification of pulmonary hypertension (PH) among patients
      with hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP). The exact prevalence of PH in HP is unknown. Data
      from South America indicate that the prevalence of pre-capillary PH amongst patients with HP
      is higher than 20%. There are no reliable data from Europe so far. According to the
      investigators previous analysis, more than 400 HP patients have participated in pulmonary
      rehabilitation at least once in the past 10 years at Klinikum Bad Gleichenberg
      (Rehabilitation Center for Agricultural Workers in Austria). This collective of patients is
      to be invited to participate in the study.

      A diagnostic algorithm will be applied in the clinical trial, in the case of clinical
      suspicion the diagnosis of PH will be confirmed by right heart catheterization. Besides the
      determination of the prevalence of PH in patients with HP the investigators aim to assess the
      reliability of non-invasive methods (e.g. Echocardiography, ECG...) to predict PH.
