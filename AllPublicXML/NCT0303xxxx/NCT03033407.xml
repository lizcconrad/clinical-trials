      The aim of this study is to investigate whether adding tailored mobile coaching system to
      present community primary care for diabetes management would result in better glycemic
      control and other diabetes-related outcomes in adult patients with type 2 diabetes, compared
      with maintaining usual diabetes management only.

    <textblock>
      The incidence and prevalence of type 2 diabetes is increasing rapidly worldwide. Considering
      the fact that complications of diabetes result in greater expenditure and reduced
      productivity is a socioeconomic concern, adequate glycemic control is important not only as
      individual health problem but also as challenge to healthcare systems worldwide. To support
      patients' behavior change efforts, including healthy lifestyle choices, disease
      self-management, and prevention of diabetes complication, multifaceted professional
      interventions are needed. Ubiquitous healthcare based on information and communication
      technology is one of these approaches.

      The aim of this study is to investigate whether adding tailored mobile coaching system to
      present community primary care for diabetes management would result in better glycemic
      control and other diabetes-related outcomes in adult patients with type 2 diabetes, compared

    <description>Intervention was adding 'Tailored mobile coaching messages' onto conventional diabetes management. This study was divided into two phases. In six-month phase 1 study, the participants in I-M group received tailored mobile coaching. And during the second half six-month phase 2 study, they could receive only regular information messages without individualized coaching.</description>

    <description>Intervention was adding tailored mobile coaching to current usual diabetes care. The participants received regular mobile messages via Switch app according to entered data, such as self-monitoring of blood glucose, blood pressure, exercise, dietary record, medication record, and body weight. Contents of messages were alert for the unused, weather, behavioral recommendation, education about diabetes, and individualized advices.</description>
