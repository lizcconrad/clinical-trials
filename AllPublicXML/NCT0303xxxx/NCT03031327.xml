    <textblock>
      A 2 week randomized (1:1:1), controlled, double-masked, parallel group, pre-market study.

      Patients with ocular discomfort following refractive surgery procedure (within 6 months from
      enrollment into the investigation) will be evaluated at baseline (Day 1), at Week 2 (day 15±2
      days) and at Week 3 follow-up visit (day 22±2, or early exit).

      Thirty (30) patients (10 per arm) randomized 1:1:1 to Lubricin 20 µg/ml eye drops solution or
      Lubricin 50 µg/ml eye drops solution or sodium hyaluronate (HA) 0.18% eye drops solution will
      be enrolled.

      As the primary objective of this study is to evaluate the tolerability and safety of Lubricin
      (20 and 50 μg/mL) eye drops solution administered over 2 weeks in patients with ocular
      discomfort following ocular refractive surgery, sample size was calculated based on clinical
      feasibility and no formal sample size calculation has been performed.

          2. Patients undergone ocular refractive surgery within 6 months from Day 1 Visit.

          3. Patients with ocular discomfort defined as SANDE score ≥ 30 at baseline.

          4. Average VAS score (dryness, foreign body sensation, burning/stinging, itching, pain,
             stick feeling, blurred vision and photophobia) ≥ 25 mm;

          5. Best corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA) score ≥ 0.1 decimal units in both eyes
             at the time of study enrolment.

          6. Only patients who satisfy all Informed Consent requirements may be included in the
             study. The patient and/or his/her legal representative must read, sign and date the

             approved by the Ethics Committee for the current study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with a severe Dry Eye condition (severity level 4 according to the Report of
             the International Dry Eye Workshop -DEWS, 2007)

          2. Best corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA) score of &lt; 0.1 decimal units in either
             eye at the time of study enrolment

          3. Evidence of an active ocular infection in either eye

          4. History or presence of ocular surface disorders other than ocular discomfort in either
             eye

          5. Use of any ocular topical medication other than the study medications for the
             treatment of ocular diseases including artificial tears during the study period

          6. Use of topical cyclosporine, topical corticosteroids or any other topical medication
             for the treatment of dry eye in either eye within 30 days of study enrolment

          7. History of any ocular surgery (excluding laser or refractive surgical procedures) in
             either eye within 30 days before study enrolment. Ocular surgery will not be allowed
             during the study treatment period and elective ocular surgery procedures should not be
             planned during the duration of the follow-up period

          8. Known hypersensitivity to one of the components of the study or procedural medications

          9. Participation in another clinical study at the same time as the present study or
             within 90 days of screening/baseline visit

         10. History of drug, medication or alcohol abuse or addiction.

         11. Females of childbearing potential (those who are not surgically sterilized or
             post-menopausal for at least 1 year) are excluded from participation in the study if

               1. are currently pregnant or,

               2. have a positive result on the urine pregnancy test at the Screening/Baseline
                  Visit or,

               3. intend to become pregnant during the study treatment period or,

               4. are breast-feeding or,

               5. not willing to use highly effective birth control measures, such as: Hormonal
                  contraceptives - oral, implanted, transdermal, or injected and/or mechanical
                  barrier methods - spermicide in conjunction with a barrier such as a condom or
                  diaphragm or IUD (intrauterine device ) during the entire course of and 30 days
                  after the study treatment periods.
