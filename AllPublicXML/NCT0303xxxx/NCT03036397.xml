      Background:

      Arginine vasopressin (AVP) is a hormone made in the body. It can make negative feelings
      stronger. The way AVP is regulated may be abnormal in people who have mood and anxiety
      disorders. SRX246 is a new drug that can block a receptor for AVP on brain cells. Researchers
      want to study how this drug affects the way people respond to threat and anxiety.

      Objectives:

      To see if the new drug SRX246 affects how people respond to the threat of an unpleasant
      shock.

      Eligibility:

      Healthy adults ages 21-50

      Design:

      Participants will be screened in another protocol.

      Participants will have 4 visits over 4 weeks.

      At visit 1, participants will have small electrodes taped to their arm to give shocks.
      Electrodes on the arm, chest, and face will measure sweat, heart rate, and blinking.
      Participants will hear loud noises and get test shocks for about 15 minutes.

      At the other 3 visits, participants will have some or all of these tests:

        -  Blood and urine tests

        -  Heart tests

        -  Suicide screen

      At each visit, participants will answer questions about their mood and anxiety. They will
      identify emotions in pictures. They will have shock testing for 40 minutes: they will hear
      loud sounds through headphones and get shocks.

      Participants will take the study pill 2 times a day for a week after visit 1 and a week after
      visit 3. One week it will be SRX246. The other week it will be a placebo.

      Participants may be contacted daily to remind them to take the medicine.

      Participants will have either a follow-up visit or follow-up phone call.

      Objective: The objective of this proposal is to determine the effects of SRX246, a candidate
      anxiolytic and investigational new drug, on fear and anxiety based on fear-potentiated
      startle in humans. Additionally, the effects of the compound on emotion recognition will be
      explored. The compound is a first-in-class, highly selective, orally available, CNS
      penetrating vasopressin (V1a) receptor antagonist developed by Azevan Pharmaceuticals Inc.
      The anti-fear and anti-anxiety activity twice daily dosing for 10-14 doses over 5-7 days of
      SRX246 will be evaluated in healthy male and female subjects using a behavioral paradigm of
      phasic (fear) and sustained (anxiety) aversive states derived from experimental models in
      humans and pre-clinical studies in rodents. Subjects will also undergo a computerized
      behavioral task assessing neurocognitive processing of emotions.

      Study population: The study population will consist of up to 47 healthy male and female
      volunteers between the ages of 21-50 with diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds.

      Design: The study will use a double-blind, cross-over design in which each subject will
      receive placebo and 180 mg every morning/120 mg every evening (total 300mg every day) of
      SRX246 for a total of 10-14 doses over 5-7 days before testing (given in counter-balanced
      order). We will examine the effect of the drug on the potentiation of startle using a
      well-established paradigm that involves anticipation of no-shock, predictable shock, and
      unpredictable shock. Drug effects on emotion recognition will also be explored.

      Outcome measures: The main outcome measures for the startle potentiation task are the
      magnitude of the startle reflex and retrospective anxiety during each condition; secondary
      measures are skin conductance and subjective anxiety. Latency and accuracy of emotion
      recognition will be measured in the Emotional Expression Multimorph Task.
