  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study includes the additional use of radiation therapy in combination immunotherapy in
      order to determine whether the radiation may improve the response of non-small cell lung
      cancer to immunotherapy and to monitor any side effects.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preclinical data suggest that radiation therapy may be uniquely suited to combine with immune
      checkpoint inhibitors, since radiation can disrupt a tumor's physical barriers to T-cell
      infiltration and augment antigen presentation, thus serving as an &quot;in situ personalized
      vaccine&quot; to activate the immune system and potentially enhance the systemic response.

      The rationale for this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of combined immune
      checkpoint inhibitors and radiation therapy in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer
      patients.

    <description>Immune checkpoint inhibitors that are FDA approved for use in patients with metastatic NSCLC will be acceptable for use concurrently with radiotherapy in this trial. The choice of agents will be at the treating medical oncologist's discretion, and include:
Nivolumab 240mg or 3 mg/kg once every 2 weeks (14 day cycle)
Pembrolizumab 200mg or 2 mg/kg once every 3 weeks (21 day cycle)
Atezolizumab 1200 mg once every 3 weeks (21 day cycle)
These agents should be continued per standard of care until either disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</description>

          -  Stage IV metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer

          -  Measurable disease of at least 1.5 cm in greatest dimension at least 2 non-irradiated
             sites (except for lymph nodes, in which the short-axis dimension must be at least

          -  Participant must be planned to receive (or actively receiving) standard of care
             checkpoint inhibitor immune therapy. For those patients actively receiving checkpoint
             inhibitor immune therapy the duration of immune therapy at the time of enrollment must
             be 4 months or less.
