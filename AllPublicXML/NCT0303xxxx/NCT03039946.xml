    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare hemodynamic variables and outcome in patients undergoing
      laparoscopic and/or robotic elective abdominal surgery. Patients will receive either an
      automated closed-loop goal-directed fluid therapy (GDFT) guided by non-invasive flow
      monitoring or a restrictive fluid therapy of 4ml/kg/h.

    <textblock>
      Perioperative fluid management is a topic of much debate that has intensified over recent
      years. Studies have shown improved postoperative outcomes with restricted fluid
      administration in the perioperative period for moderate risk abdominal surgery. They
      concluded that in patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery, intraoperative restrictive
      fluid management was associated with a reduction in postoperative morbidity and shortened
      hospital stay. Current standard practice is a crystalloid based fluid therapy guided by
      static hemodynamic parameters such as heart rate, blood pressure, and diuresis. However,
      several studies have criticized this cookbook approach and recommend tailoring management to
      specific physiologic dynamic endpoints such as stroke volume variation and cardiac output
      using a flow monitoring device. Our team has demonstrated that the use of a closed-loop
      system is feasible and allows precise titration of fluid administration in abdominal and
      vascular surgery using either a minimally or a non-invasive monitoring system.

      Goal:

      This study compares hemodynamic variables and outcome in patients who will receive either
      automated closed-loop fluid therapy guided by non-invasive flow monitoring or restrictive
      fluid therapy of 4ml/kg/h. Both groups consist of the same population undergoing laparoscopic
      and/or robotic surgery.

      Hypothesis:

      A closed-loop assisted intraoperative GDFT when compared to restrictive fluid therapy will
      provide better hemodynamic variables.
