    <description>Eribulin will be administered intravenously (IV) on days 1 and 8 of each cycle at a dose of 1.1 mg/m2 over a 2-5 minute time period; on cycle day 1. Carboplatin will be administered intravenously at a dose of AUC 5 on day 1 of each cycle, over 30 min, immediately following eribulin infusion, per institutional guidelines. Veliparib will be given at 120 mg bid (two times a day), on days 2-12 for the first cycle of the safety run-in period and thereafter at 240 mg bid.</description>
