      Study is a dose escalation study. Fifteen patients will be enrolled in 2 treatment cohorts.
      Five participants (cohort A) will be treated with 200IU Multikine daily, 5 days/week for 2
      weeks, off 2 weeks, then again 5 days/week for 2 weeks. If no serious adverse events are
      noted in cohort A patients, ten participants will be treated in cohort B. Cohort B
      participants will be treated the same as cohort A participants except that dose will be
      increased to 400IU Multikine per day.

      Study is a dose escalation study to determine the safety of Leukocyte Interleukin, Injection
      in treating men and women with perianal warts who are HIV/HPV co-infected. Fifteen patients
      will be enrolled in 2 treatment cohorts. Five participants (cohort A) will be treated with
      200IU Multikine daily, 5 days/week for 2 weeks, off 2 weeks, then treated again 5 days/week
      for 2 weeks. If no serious adverse events are noted in cohort A patients, ten (10)
      participants will be treated in cohort B. Cohort B participants will be treated in the same
      manner as cohort A participants except that the dose will be increased to 400IU Multikine per
