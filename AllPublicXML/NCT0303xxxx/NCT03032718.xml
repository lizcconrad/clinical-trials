  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a highly prevalent and clinically
      meaningful side effect of cancer treatment. It is induced by neurotoxic chemotherapeutic
      agents, causing severe sensory and/or motor deficits such as pain, altered sensation, reduced
      or absent reflexes, muscle weakness, reduced balance control, insecure gait, and higher risk
      of falling. It is associated with significant disability and poor recovery, not only reducing
      patients' autonomy and quality of life but also limiting medical cancer therapy, which
      subsequently may affect the clinical outcome and compromise survival. To date, CIPN cannot be
      prevented and approved and effective treatment options are lacking.

      Promising results regarding CIPN have recently been achieved with exercise. Own preliminary
      work revealed that patients profit from sensorimotor training (SMT), experiencing significant
      relief from CIPN induced symptoms. In a pilot study we therefore also evaluated whole body
      vibration training, a further neuromuscular stimulating exercise intervention. Results
      suggest that whole body vibration (WBV) is not only feasible and safe for neuropathic cancer
      patients but can attenuate motor and sensory deficits.

      We therefore propose a two-armed, multicenter, randomized controlled trial (RCT with a
      follow-up period), including 44 patients with neurologically confirmed CIPN, in order to
      evaluate the effects of WBV on the relevant symptoms of CIPN. Primary endpoint is the patient
      reported reduction of CIPN-related symptoms (FACT-GOG-Ntx). Secondary endpoints will include
      compound muscle action potentials, distal motor latency, conduction velocity, and F-waves
      from the tibial and peroneal nerve as well as antidromic sensory nerve conduction studies of
      the sural nerve, feasibility, non-invasive electromyographic (EMG) activity of mm. tibialis
      anterior, soleus, gastrocnemius medialis, rectus femoris, vastus medialis and biceps femoris,
      peripheral deep sensitivity, proprioception, balance control as well as pain, quality of life
      and the level of physical activity. Patients will be assessed before and after a 12 week
      intervention and again after 12 weeks of follow-up. Interim tests will be performed 6 weeks
      into the intervention as well as every 3 weeks during the follow-up.

      We hypothesize that individually tailored whole body vibration training will reduce relevant
      symptoms of CIPN. Our results could contribute to improve supportive care in oncology,
      thereby enhancing patients' quality of life and coincidentally enabling the optimal medical
      therapy.

    <description>It will be used to document and assess the severity of the subjective peripheral neuropathy (PNP) symptoms. This questionnaire has been validated and is widely applied in clinical practise.

EMG recordings will be performed using bipolar Ag/AgCl surface electrodes placed over the mm. soleus, gastrocnemius medialis, tibialis anterior, rectus femoris, vastus medialis and biceps femoris of the right leg. A reference electrode will be placed on the patella. To keep interelectrode resistance below 2 kOhm, the skin areas for the electrodes will have to be shaved, degreased and slightly abraded.

    <description>Patients in the intervention group will receive a defined exercise program twice a week in addition to their usual treatment. Training sessions start immediately after randomization and will be supervised by trained sport students. They will take place twice a week, for twelve weeks in specific training rooms designed to meet the needs of oncological patients in the respective centers. The vibration exercises will take place on a side-alternating vibration platform (GalileoTM, Pforzheim, Germany) ®) according to the previously determined optimal (highest neuromuscular response) setting for each individual. Each session will last for about 15 to 30 minutes, leaving sufficient time for regeneration. Training will consist of four vibration exercises, chosen from a standardized pool of exercises with increasing difficulty in order to allow for individual, optimal progression. All sessions will be documented by the supervisor.</description>
