  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the major cause for permanent disability in adults. It is still unclear, which
      physiotherapeutic approaches are most effective. The Bobath-concept is one of the most widely
      used approaches in stroke rehabilitation within the western world, although several studies
      have failed to demonstrate superiority and showed partially even inferiority compared to
      other physiotherapy approaches. The Vojta therapy is based on a completely different approach
      - the reflex locomotion. However to date no study has been performed for stroke. We designed
      a randomized clinical trial (RCT) to compare Vojta and conventional physiotherapy in patients
      with acute ischemic (AIS) or hemorrhagic stroke (ICH). This RCT will be the first trial to
      investigate improvement of postural control due to Vojta therapy in early rehabilitation of
      stroke patients, which is a very new approach in stroke-rehabilitation.

    <measure>Improvement of postural control measured with the trunc control test (TCT) on day 9 after admission to the hospital</measure>

    <description>The Trunc Control Test (TCT) is a valid test to asses motor impairment after stroke. A range of 0 to 100 points can be achieved. Patients are tested before the first treatment on day 2, after 5 days and after the last intervention on day 9 (+/-1) after admission to hospital.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1-9 after hospital admission (+/- 1)</time_frame>
    <description>The neglect is assessed with part 5 and 6 of the Catherine Bergego Scale. Patients are tested before and after the first treatment on day 2, before and after treatment after 5 days and before and after the last intervention on day 9 (+/-1) after admission to hospital.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1-9 after hospital admission (+/- 1)</time_frame>
    <description>The arm motor function is assessed with part 1 to 4 of the MESUPES. Patients are tested before and after the first treatment on day 2, before and after treatment after 5 days and before and after the last intervention on day 9 (+/-1) after admission to hospital.</description>

    <measure>Improvement of the neglect (measured with the Catherine Bergego Scale) before and after every single intervention.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1-9.</time_frame>
    <description>Patients are assessed for the neglect 3 times: on day 2, day 5 and day 9 (plus/minus 1 day) after admission to hospital before and after treatment. We want to compare if there is an improvement of the neglect directly after treatment.</description>
