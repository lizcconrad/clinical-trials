    <textblock>
      This case-control study was conducted on 90 patients who were equally divided into two
      groups. Group 1 included 45 patients with HCV-related chronic liver disease without clinical
      or radiological evidence of HCC (control group), and Group 2 included 45 patients diagnosed
      to have HCC by Triphasic abdominal CT (patient group). Serum AFP and GP73 were measured using
      ELISA technique

        Group I: Included 45 patients with liver cirrhosis due to HCV infection. Liver cirrhosis
        was diagnosed clinically, laboratory, and radiologically. Chronic HCV infection was
        diagnosed by positive HCV antibody and positive quantitative HCV PCR.

        Group II: Included 45 patients with Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) on top of HCV cirrhosis
        diagnosed by two imaging modalities, abdominal ultrasound and the characteristic arterial
        enhancement and venous washout in Tri-phasic CT abdomen.
