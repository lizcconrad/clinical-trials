  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      From the point of view of nursing to know exactly the different risk factors for the onset of
      pressure ulcers is very important as it allows to accurately orient preventive care
      interventions.

      All the variable that could influence the development of pressure ulcer in patients
      undergoing knee replacement surgery are identified and collected: age, sex, body max index,
      risk to develop Pressure Ulcer (braden score), treatment to prevent pressure ulcers (typology
      of the devices used, such as air mattresses with alternating or static pressure, heel drains,
      frequency of mobilization carried out by both the patient care), management of eventual
      incontinence (use of diapers, urinary catheter), type of anesthesia, type of analgesia,
      length of stay, the ASA physical status classification system (ASA score), comorbidity,
      cancer, use of devices for controlling the position of the operated limb (foam valve), the
      number of physical therapy sessions actually carried out.
