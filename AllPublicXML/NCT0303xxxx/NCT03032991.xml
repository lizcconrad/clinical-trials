      The prospective multicenter study GD-Brain provides a better knowledge on the basis of
      neurological impairment in children born to mothers with gestational diabetes (GDM). GDM
      modifies placental structure and affect materno-fetal nutrient transfer. Docosahexaenoic acid
      (DHA) play an important role on neurodevelopment, and it is reduced in venous cord blood of
      newborns born to GDM. In previous studies, we have already demonstrated impaired DHA fetal
      levels not only using label fatty acids with stable isotopes administrated to pregnant women,
      but also in observational studies in GDM as the prevention of obesity study (PREOBE study) in
      Granada and other similar study in Murcia. The impaired cord DHA levels were associated to
      disturbed neurodevelopment in these children during the first year of life. However, it is
      uncertain the mechanisms underlying this impaired materno-fetal DHA transfer and implications
      for later life.

      The recent publication in Nature Journal of a selective transmembrane carrier for DHA in
      brain named &quot;major facilitator superfamily domain 2a&quot; (MFSD2a) open new expectations. We
      detected disturbed MFSD2a levels in placentas from GDM which could be due to structural
      problems in this organ; inflammation, oxidation and metabolic changes related to diabetes
      might affect MFSD2a activity. Moreover, it is difficult to know whether disturbed MFSD2a
      levels in placenta may also indicate altered levels of this carrier in the brain from
      children born to GDM mothers, which could contribute to neurodevelopment impairment in these
      subjects. Recent studies also indicate that obesity alters the biosynthesis of eicosanoids
      derived from DHA, with a decrease of protectins and resolvin of D-series, which have powerful
      anti-inflammatory properties.

      The main aim of this study is to analyse potential differences on neurodevelopment, and brain
      structure and functioning, in children 8 years old born to GDM respect to those born to
      healthy normoweight mothers, as well as to identify early biomarkers consistently related to
      neurodevelopment from early stages of life.

      We will contact to participants from the PREOBE study and Murcia's cohorts study to get
      involved a total of 174 children at 8 years of age. The results from neurodevelopment
      evaluation by neuropsychological testing, neurological functions rhythms and neuroimaging
      (fMRI and DTI) at 8 years old will be associated to clinical and metabolic data recorded
      during pregnancy.

      As secondary aim, we would discern whether the decrease on DHA levels in offspring of GDM at
      birth is associated to disturbed neurodevelopment at 8 years old.

      The impact of maternal diabetes on placental MFSD2a and children's resolvin and protectins
      derived from DHA will be measured in urine samples at 8 years old.

      Gut microbiota composition and function will be also studied to detect its role in the
      potential disturbances regarding the production of anti-inflammatory mediators.

      A part from the clinical study, we will perform an intervention trial using animal models.
      Gestational rats with diabetes and control rats will be treated with antioxidants and
      adipoRon in order to delay neuro-degeneration in these animals because of the diabetes, as
      well as their influence on MFSD2a levels in placenta and brain. All these studies may provide
      to the industry of valuable information to improve nutritional supplements during gestation
      or infancy to avoid potential delay of cognitive functions in offspring of diabetic mothers.
