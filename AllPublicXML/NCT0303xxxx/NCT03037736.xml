      This is a randomized controlled trial of postoperative bevacizumab or 5-fluorouracil
      subconjunctival injections vs placebo for the recurrence of pterygia after excision using
      conjunctival autograft.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be randomized at enrollment to one of three arms: 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU)
      5mg/0.1mL, bevacizumab 2.5mg/0.1mL, or placebo. The placebo will be sterile,
      preservative-free injectable 0.9% normal saline. All patients will undergo pterygium excision
      surgery in the minor procedure room using a standardized surgical technique with conjunctival
      autograft. All patients will have a standardized postoperative drop protocol of
      neomycin/polymyxin/dexamethasone ointment four times daily for 2 weeks and fluorometholone
      drops 4 times daily for 2 weeks, three times daily for 2 weeks, twice daily for 2 weeks, once
      daily for 2 weeks then stopping.

      At the 1-month and 2-month postoperative visits, patients will receive a subconjunctival
      injection based on their randomization assignment (5-FU, bevacizumab or placebo) in the area
      of the excised pterygium at least 1 mm posterior to the limbus. The total injected volume
      will be 0.1mL for all adjuvants.

      The primary outcome will pterygium recurrence at 3 months, defined as evidence of at least 1
      mm of fibrovascular growth onto the cornea. After the 3 month visit, patients who are
      determined to have a recurrence will be unmasked, and can received monthly 5-FU or
      bevacizumab injections at the discretion of the treating physician. Each of these visits will
      be treated as a study visit, and will be documented.

      All patients will have study visits at the 6 and 12 month mark. If at any point any patient
      develops evidence of progression of recurrence, they may undergo further monthly 5-FU or
      bevacizumab injections at the discretion of the treating physician.
