  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this proposed project is to 1) increase co-management between sickle cell
      specialists and primary care providers (PCP's); 2) increase the use of hydroxyurea (HU) which
      prevents Vaso-Occlusive Episode (VOE), EDs and subsequent hospitalizations, and death; 3)
      identify and link patients not receiving primary or SCD specialty care to care, and 4) shift
      healthcare use from EDs and hospitalizations to primary and specialty co-management. Many
      persons with SCD experience a poor quality of life, serious medical complications and
      frequent painful events that require treatment from SCD specialty care, primary care and
      emergency department (ED) providers. There are two dominating models of care in the United
      States; neither are ideal. Many people with SCD have all of their healthcare needs addressed
      by sickle cell specialists who do not typically provide primary care and are often
      geographically distant from the patients' home. Other sickle cell patients receive all of
      their care in EDs. Both models are inadequate and result in an alarmingly high number of ED
      visits for many patients. Current care models are neither cost efficient nor promoting
      optimal patient outcomes. To improve outcomes, the investigators will implement a new model
      of care for SCD using nurse care managers, web based-interactive algorithms, and test if
      additional patient provided coaching can improve outcomes.

      To inform the model, the investigators will conduct an initial in-depth multi-level
      assessment of the barriers to care and implementation of the NHLBI &quot;Evidence-Based Management
      of Sickle Cell Disease&quot;. With barriers and facilitators identified at the patient, provider,
      healthcare organization and community levels, the investigators will develop another study
      evaluation interventions that may improve the barriers.
