  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the effect of upregulating prefrontal cortex activity on risk-taking,
      and antisocial and aggressive behavior in violent offenders. In the double-blind, randomized
      controlled trial, using a within-subject crossover design, each participant will undergo
      anodal transcranial direct current stimulation of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
      and sham stimulation. After each stimulation session, neural activity and behavioral
      responses to tasks assessing risk-taking and aggressive behavior will be recorded. The effect
      of tDCS on violent offenders will also be assessed in comparison to age and gender-matched
      healthy controls.

    <description>Participants in the active stimulation group will undergo anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). tDCS will be delivered by a battery-driven, constant-current stimulator connected to two saline-soaked surface sponge electrodes. An anodal electrode (25cm2) will be placed over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and one cathodal electrode (100cm2) will be placed over the left supraorbital area at least 5cm from the anode. Scalp electrodes will be positioned according to the 10-20 EEG international system. A current of 2mA will be applied for 20 minutes and the current will be ramped up and down over 20 seconds at the beginning and end of the stimulation period.</description>

    <description>The sham tDCS condition will involve the same placement of the electrodes, current intensity, and ramp-up/down time as the active tDCS condition, but stimulation will only last for 30 seconds.</description>
