  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Part A will investigate the safety, tolerability, PK and PD of PF-06835919 administered for
      14 days in a multiple ascending dose design. Part B will assess the effect of PF-06835919
      co-administration at low and high doses on the PK of atorvastatin in a single cohort.
