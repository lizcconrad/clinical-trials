    <description>CLARITHROMYCIN: daily orally administration in cycles of 28 days; 500mg film-coated tablets LENALIDOMIDE: every cycle of treatment lasts 28 days; daily orally administration is of 21 consecutive days with a week of rest. 20mg capsule hard.

    <description>Each treatment course will consist of:
Oral Lenalidomide (Revlimid) once daily for 21 days at a dose 20 mg; in case of drug-related adverse events the dose can be reduced to 15 and 10 mg/day; Oral Clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily for 28 days. Courses will be repeated every 28 days. After the first 3 courses patients with stable disease or better response will be given another three courses. Patients with complete remission or disease progression after 6 courses will be taken off study, while patients with partial response or stable disease will receive 3 further courses of treatment. Again, patients with complete response or disease progression will stop therapy, while patients with partial response/stable disease will receive 3 further courses up to a maximum of 12 courses in total.</description>
