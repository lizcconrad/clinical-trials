  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Danirixin (DNX) is a selective CXC chemokine receptor (CXCR2) antagonist being developed as a
      potential anti-inflammatory agent for the treatment of COPD. This is a Phase 2, randomized,
      double-blind (Sponsor Open) study. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the
      clinical activity and safety of danirixin compared with placebo in participants with COPD.
      Following baseline assessments collected over a 7 day period participants will be randomized
      (1:1:1:1:1:1) to receive one of five dose strengths of danirixin (5 milligram [mg], 10 mg, 25
      mg, 35 mg and 50 mg) or placebo. Study treatment will be administered orally twice daily for
      24 weeks. Participants will continue with their standard of care inhaled medications (i.e.
      long acting bronchodilators with or without inhaled corticosteroids) while receiving study
      treatment. Follow up will continue up to 28 days post last dose. Approximately 700
      participants will be screened with a target of 540 participants completing 24 weeks of
      treatment and key study assessments.

             defined as those who are currently smoking cigarettes (i.e. have smoked at least one
             cigarette daily or most days for the month prior to Visit 1). Former smokers are

             sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, pulmonary fibrosis, severe bronchiectasis or lung cancer.

          -  Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency as the underlying cause of COPD

          -  Pulse oximetry &lt;88% at rest at screening. Participants should be tested while
             breathing room air. However, participants living at high altitudes (above 5000 feet or
             1500 meters above sea level) who are receiving supplemental oxygen can be included
             provided they are receiving the equivalent of &lt;4 liter per minute (L/min) and
             screening pulse oximetry is measured while on their usual oxygen settings.

          -  Less than 14 days have elapsed from the completion of a course of antibiotics or oral
             corticosteroids for a recent COPD exacerbation.

          -  A peripheral blood neutrophil count &lt;1.5 x 10^9/L.

          -  Diagnosis of pneumonia (chest X-ray or CT confirmed) within the 3 months prior to
             screening.

          -  Chest x-ray (posterior-anterior with lateral) or CT scan reveals evidence of a
             clinically significant abnormality not believed to be due to the presence of COPD
             (historic results up to 1 year prior to screening may be used). For sites in Germany:
             If a chest x-ray (or CT scan) within 1 year prior to screening is not available,
             approval to conduct a diagnostic chest x-ray will need to be obtained from the Federal
             Office of Radiation Protection (BfS).

          -  History or current evidence of other clinically significant medical condition that is
             uncontrolled on permitted therapies. Significant is defined as any disease that, in
             the opinion of the Investigator, would put the safety of the participant at risk
             through study participation, or that would affect the safety analysis or other
             analysis if the disease/condition worsened during the study.

          -  Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities
             (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones).

          -  Abnormal and clinically significant 12-lead ECG finding. The investigator will
             determine the clinical significance of each abnormal ECG finding in relation to the
             participant's medical history and exclude participants who would be at undue risk by
             participating in the study. An abnormal and clinically significant finding that would
             preclude a participant from entering the study is defined as a 12-lead tracing that is
             interpreted as, but not limited to, any of the following: atrial fibrillation with
             rapid ventricular rate &gt;120 beats per minute (bpm); sustained or non-sustained
             ventricular tachycardia; second degree heart block Mobitz type II and third degree
             heart block (unless pacemaker or defibrillator has been implanted); Corrected QT
             Interval using Fridericia formula (QTcF) &gt;=500 millisecond (msec) in participants with
