  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Gastric cancers are cancers of the stomach. Hereditary ones are passed from parent to child.
      Researchers want to gather data about hereditary gastric cancers. They want to learn about
      changes these cause in the body and about the genes involved.

      Objective:

      -To gather data about hereditary gastric cancer.

      Eligibility:

        -  People at least 2 years old with personal or family history with a hereditary gastric
           cancer.

        -  People at least 2 years old with gene changes that lead to such cancer or a lesion that
           may be hereditary.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened in a separate protocol.

        -  Participants will have:

             -  Physical exam

             -  Medical history

             -  Blood tests

             -  Scans

             -  Photos of skin lesions and other findings

             -  Gynecology consultation for women

             -  Cheek swab (some participants)

        -  For some participants, their relatives will be asked to join the study.

        -  Some participants will be asked to allow the study to get stored tissue samples for
           relatives who have died.

        -  Some samples will be sent to outside labs. All personal data will be protected. Samples
           will be destroyed when the study ends.

        -  Participants will get the results of genetic testing.

        -  Participants who cannot come to the NIH clinic may just give a cheek swab and have
           genetic testing done.

        -  Some participants will be contacted for more testing.

      Background:

        -  An estimated 1-3% of gastric cancer cases occur within a familial background as part of
           an inherited cancer syndrome

        -  Hereditary Diffuse Gastric Cancer (HDGC) is the most frequent form of familial gastric
           cancer and has been linked to a germline mutation in the CDH1 gene

        -  Gastric Adenocarcinoma and Proximal Polyposis of the Stomach (GAPPS) is a more recently
           described autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by fundic gland polyposis with
           antral sparing

        -  Other syndromes that predispose to gastric cancer include Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Lynch
           syndrome, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis syndrome and others

      Objectives:

      - Characterize the natural and clinical histories of hereditary gastric cancer syndromes

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals, and family members, who fulfill clinical criteria for a hereditary gastric
      cancer syndrome irrespective of previous genetic testing or treatment

      Design:

        -  These rare families will be recruited to genetically confirm diagnosis and study the
           natural history of hereditary gastric cancers

        -  Genetic testing will be offered to gain appreciation of the effect of mutations on the
           relative activity of various germline and somatic mutations.

        -  We will determine if there is a relationship between mutation and disease phenotype.

        -INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. An individual, or their family members, with any of the following:

               -  Fulfills clinical criteria for Hereditary Diffuse Gastric Cancer (HGDC) syndrome
                  or Gastric Adenocarcinoma and Proximal Polyposis of the Stomach (GAPPS) syndrome

                  known cancer syndrome or an associated family history of gastric cancer

               -  Harbors a pathogenic germline mutation known to predispose to gastric cancer

               -  First-degree relatives, regardless of family history or personal history of
                  cancer, with a documented deleterious germline mutation (including but not

               -  Diagnosis or suspicion of a premalignant or malignant stomach lesion of suspected
                  hereditary etiology

          2. Age &gt; 18 years; patients under 18 years of age and greater than or equal to the age of

             willingness to sign a written informed consent document.
