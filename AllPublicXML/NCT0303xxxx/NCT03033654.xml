  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to investigate how much two consecutive applications of sunscreen
      before sun exposure can increase the quantities of sunscreen applied and decrease the skin
      area left without sunscreen compared to a single application. Volunteers wearing swimwear
      applied sunscreen in a laboratory environment twice and had pictures taken in black light
      before and after. As sunscreens absorb black light the darkness of the skin increased with
      increasing amounts of sunscreen applied. The investigators conducted a standard curve
      establishing a link between picture darkness and applied sunscreen quantity. Participants
      were asked to apply sunscreen the way they would normally do but two consecutive times. No
      other advice was given. The level of protection was determined by picture analysis as
      measurements of darkness of selected skin sites as well as the percentages of skin area left
      without sunscreen in different body regions and in total.
