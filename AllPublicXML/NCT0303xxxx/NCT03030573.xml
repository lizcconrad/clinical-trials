      The investigators developed a new surgical technique in order to reconstruct the bile duct

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Classically, the bile duct defect after bile duct injury or resection is achieved by
      bilioenteric reconstruction. However bilioenteric anastomosis is associated with long term
      complications including intrahepatic bile ducts infection, specific complications related to
      the Roux en Y jejunal loop and eliminate the endoscopic access to intrahepatic bile ducts.
      The investigators had recently developed a new surgical technique to reconstruct the veins
      with the parietal peritoneum with excellent results. Accordingly the investigators decided to
      develop a new surgical technique in order to reconstruct the bile duct defects with the
      vascularized round ligament.
