  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the quality of CT images acquired with very low-dose radiation and
      processed with commercially available software vs. PixelShine processed images. It would
      potentially allow imaging facilities to acquire CT scans using lower doses of radiation
      without sacrificing clarity of CT images. Acquiring high quality CT images with low-dose
      radiation has the potential to enhance patient safety and has significant implications in
      imaging practices.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients receiving CT scans as part of their standard treatment will be asked to consent to
      an additional 5 minutes of imaging using very low-dose radiation prior to the
      conventional-dose CT scan. The prospective review will be performed in two cohorts: Chest CT
      scans and abdominal CT scans.

      Anonymized images will be processed by conventional CT software and compared to the same
      images processed with machine-learning-based PixelShine. A board-certified radiologist will
      assess the noise and visual quality of the imaging data.

      Study patients will receive approximately 10% more dose than a standard CT scan by
      participating in the study. There are no known short-term safety issues associated with this
      study. The study-related very low dose radiation is at a level far below that used for
      conventional x-ray imaging. The study has been approved by the Radiation Safety Committee as
      part of the review process.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must be 18 years of age or older

          -  Patients must be able and willing to consent to participate in this project

          -  Patients will be scheduled for a standard of care CT scan

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  This study does not investigate either a specific disease or a specific patient
             populationâ€”it only examines and compares images obtained at low radiation exposure
             post-processed with Algomedica's PixelShine software with conventionally processed
             images

          -  All other patients will be excluded
