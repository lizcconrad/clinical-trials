  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many healthy lifestyle interventions have been developed to help people change their activity
      and diet, lose weight and thus reduce their risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and
      cardiovascular disorders (CVD). However, these interventions often fail to engage their
      target audience, which undermines their effectiveness in changing behaviour and health
      outcomes.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of a self-directed, website-based
      intervention to promote physical activity and healthy dietary behaviours. The intervention
      frames health information from a novel perspective, which our previous work has indicated can
      help to promote interest in the health information and improve attitudes, self-efficacy and
      motivation towards physical activity and healthy dietary behaviours.

      The intervention comprises a website of information resources and personal recording areas to
      set goals and monitor activity and diet, weekly emails and pedometers. In this trial we aim
      to see whether the intervention has any impact on people's physical activity and diet, as
      well as their risk of developing CVD and T2DM. The intervention will be compared with a
      control condition in which participants will be shown standard resources available on NHS
      websites. Overweight/obese (BMI 25 - 39.5) males and females aged 35-74 years will be
      recruited from the community. The active intervention will last 6 weeks (during this period
      participants will receive weekly emails from the research team) and there will be a 6-week
      follow-up phase (in which participants will still have access to the website but contact from
      the research team). Activity, diet, disease risk markers and psychological antecedents of
      behaviour will be assessed at baseline, post-intervention (6-weeks) and post follow-up (12-
      weeks).

    <description>Mean daily physical activity level (PAL) will be assessed using accelerometers (BodyMedia, worn on the upper arm), worn for a continuous 7-day period, being removed during this time only for water-based activities such as showering or swimming. The accelerometers gather minute by minute total energy expenditure (TEE) data, which will be used to calculate PAL (PAL = TEE/BMR, where BMR = basal metabolic rate, to be calculated using the Schofield equation).</description>

    <description>Participants allocated to this group will be given a one-off set-up session in which a researcher will show them the intervention website, create a user profile for them and provide guidance on how to use the site to gain health information, set personal behavioural goals and record and monitor their behaviour in relation to their goals. The researcher will also provide the participant with a pedometer and instruct them how to use this and where they can record their daily steps on the website. For 6 weeks, participants will be asked to use the website and be sent weekly email reminders to do so and log their goal progress. After 6 weeks, no further emails will be sent but participants will still be able to access the website and use the pedometer if they wish.</description>

Like those participants in the intervention group, they will be assessed again after 6 and 12 weeks. Participants in the control arm will be offered the intervention (access to the study website and a pedometer) after 12 weeks.</description>
