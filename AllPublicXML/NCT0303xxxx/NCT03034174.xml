    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to describe the pharmacokinetics of tigecycline in critically
      ill patients receiving continuous venovenous haemodialysis (CVVHD) and to evaluate the
      frequency of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic target attainment with high dosing strategy (200
      mg loading dose and 100 mg/12h).

      This is a prospective observational study performed on critically ill patients. Inclusion
      criteria are: severe sepsis on admission requiring broad-spectrum antibiotics. Both medical
      and surgical patients will be included. Any type of infections will be included (pulmonary,
      abdominal, urinary tract, etc.) Antibiotics regimen includes: tigecycline (200 mg every 12
      hours intravenously), meropenem (2 grams every 8 hours intravenously).

      Blood samples (3 mL) will be collected 2, 4, 8 and 12 hours after each dose of tigecycline
      for 3 consecutive days. The standard arterial canula will be used to obtain samples.

      In each case CVVHD will be started and continued for at least 3 days' period. 30 minutes
      after a collection each sample will be centrifuged for 10 minutes at 3,000 rpms.
      Subsequently, supernatant will be collected and frozen.

      Serum tigecycline concentration will be measured with high performance liquid chromatography.

      Each patient's hemodynamics parameters will be recorded with the use of transpulmonary
      thermodilution technique (PICCO). Other therapies i.e.: ventilatory support, sedation, an
      antifungal agent will be given as required.
