  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is defined as an obstruction of the portal vein. The prevalence
      of PVT is 10-25% and incidence is about 16% in cirrhotic patients. PVT leads to increased
      intrahepatic resistance, decreased portal velocities, splanchnic vasodilatation, and stagnant
      flow.

      Portal vein recanalization (PVR) with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is
      aimed at restoring main portal vein (PV) flow in chronic PVT. In this study, we will review
      the safety and outcomes of this approach.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a fairly common complication of liver cirrhosis. Importantly,
      occlusive PVT might influence the prognosis of patients with cirrhosis. Transjugular
      intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) has been reported to be an effective treatment of PVT
      in cirrhosis, with the advantage of avoiding the risk of bleeding linked to anticoagulation.
      In this study, we will evaluate the outcome of TIPS for PVT in patients with and without
      cirrhosis and determinate survival.
