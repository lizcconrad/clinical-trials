  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All participants in the selected communities will be tested for HBsAg by using serum samples.
      Among those who are positive for HBsAg, further clinical work-ups including AFP test and
      ultrasonography for liver exam will be performed. High risk group will be selected according
      to the definition. HCC diagnosis will be determined according to imaging and/or biopsy
      result. Repeated check-ups will be performed in 6-months among HBsAg positive group and
      3-years among HBsAg negative group.

      All subjects in the control arm (control communities) will be followed by record linkage to
      Cancer Register and Population Register.

      Sample selection

        -  Select communities of 70,000 to 120,000 populations in Zhongshan City as the
           investigators' fields.

        -  Divide them into screening group and control group according to the areas of
           administration

      Participants recruitment

      - Subjects voluntarily attend this screening study

      Informed consent - Informed consent forms will be collected at the recruitment.

      Questionnaires

      - Face-to-face interviews are conducted by well-trained investigators

      Serological tests

        -  Each blood samples will be tested for the surface antigen of the hepatitis B virus
           (HBsAg).

        -  Among those who are positive for HBsAg, further clinical work-ups including
           Alpha-Fetoprotein(AFP) test and ultrasonography for liver exam will be performed and
           high risk group will be selected according to the definition.

        -  HCC diagnosis will be determined according to imaging and/or biopsy result.

        -  The rest of the blood samples will be stored at the biobank of Zhongshan People's
           Hospital.

      Follow up

        -  The cohort will follow up according to the screening protocol. Briefly, Repeated
           check-ups will be performed in 6-months among HBsAg positive group and 3-years among
           HBsAg negative group.

        -  All subjects in the control arm (control communities) will be followed by record linkage
           to Cancer Register and Population Register.
