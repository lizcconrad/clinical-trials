  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) impacts negatively on the quality of life of
      patients. Several studies have shown that acute exacerbations (AEs) decrease health-related
      quality of life, pulmonary function and survival of COPD patients.

      The objective of the present study is to examine the effects of a physical therapy program on
      perceived health status in COPD patients hospitalized due to an acute exacerbation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality
      worldwide. It is a progressive disease, characterized by lung function impairment with airway
      obstruction.

      Patients with COPD suffer exacerbations; the frequency of these exacerbations increases with
      the severity of the disease. It has been previously shown that the level of health related
      quality of life of COPD subjects deteriorates considerably with increasing severity of
      disease and that the deterioration is linearly related to a decrease in FEV1 % predicted
      normal values.

      Since COPD is a chronic condition, a major goal of care is to improve health related quality
      of life. However, there is little information on the effect of a physiotherapy program during
      exacerbation on perceived health status.

    <description>The EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) will be used to evaluate quality of life, EQ-5D is a generic questionnaire and consists of two parts, the EQ-5D Visual analogue scale (VAS) and the EQ-5D index. The EQ-5D VAS consists on a vertical rating scale from 0 to 100 (0 = death/worst possible health state and 100 = best possible health state). The EQ-5D index is a five-item questionnaire (mobility, self-care, usual activity, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression). Each item has three levels: no problem, some problem and severe problem. For the EQ-5D index, 0.03 has been regarded as the MID</description>

    <measure>Respiratory function</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 9 days.</time_frame>
    <description>Spirometry is regarded as the gold standard measure of respiratory function. The indicators of forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) will be tested. Spirometry will be performed according to American Thoracic Society (ATS) criteria.</description>

    <measure>Dyspnea</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 9 days.</time_frame>
    <description>Dyspnea perception will be assessed with Borg modified scale. Patients will classify their breathlessness between 0 to 10.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety and depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 9 days.</time_frame>
    <description>The hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) will be used to evaluate psychological status. HADS is a 14-items self-report questionnaire designed to detect psychological morbidity in medically ill patients. It contains depression and anxiety subscales, each with scores ranging from 0 to 21.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Dependency level</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Dependency levels will be evaluated with the Barthel Index (BI). It is an instrument used to measure the capacity of the person for the execution of ten basic activities in daily life, obtaining a quantitative estimation of the subject´s level of dependency. Total possible scores range from 0 - 100, with lower scores indicating increased disability.</description>

    <measure>Comorbidities</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Charlson Comorbidity Index will be used to assess the comorbidities of the patients, it is a simple and valid method of estimating risk of death from comorbid disease. It contains 19 categories of comorbidity and predicts the ten-year mortality for a patient who may have a range of co-morbid conditions. Each condition is assigned with a score of 1,2,3 or 6 depending on the risk of dying associated with this condition.</description>
