  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to compare the pharmacokinetic (PK) of recombinant
      coagulation factor VIII Fc fusion protein (rFVIIIFc) manufactured at the current scale of
      2000 L (2K) to the PK of rFVIIIFc manufactured at the 15,000 L (15K) scale in previously
      treated participants with severe hemophilia A. The secondary objectives are: to characterize
      the PK of rFVIIIFc manufactured at the 15K scale at the 15K baseline and after 13 weeks of
      treatment; to characterize the PK of rFVIIIFc manufactured at the 15K scale at 1000 IU/vial
      and 6000 IU/vial strengths; and to evaluate the safety of rFVIIIFc manufactured at the 15K
      scale.

      PK assessments are in 3 phases: Pharmacokinetic Assessment 1(PK1): PK assessments following
      single injection of rFVIIIFc manufactured at the 2K scale. Pharmacokinetic Assessment 2
      (PK2): PK assessments are made following a single injection of rFVIIIFc manufactured at the
      15K scale where participants are randomized to the 1000 IU vial or 6000 IU/vial strengths.
      Pharmacokinetic Assessment 3 (PK3): PK assessments are made following 13 weeks of rFVIIIFc
      treatment manufactured at the 15K scale where participants are randomized to the 1000 IU vial
      or 6000 IU/vial strengths. After study completion, in countries where rFVIIIFc is not
      commercially available, eligible participants will be offered enrollment into a long-term
      safety and efficacy extension study (8HA01EXT [NCT01454739]).

             for documented exposure days.

          -  No history of a positive inhibitor test or clinical signs of decreased response to
             FVIII administrations. Family history of inhibitors will not exclude the subject.

          -  No measurable inhibitor activity using the Nijmegen-modified Bethesda assay (&gt;=0.6
             Bethesda Unit per milliliter [BU/mL] is considered positive) at Screening.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current enrollment in any interventional clinical study in which an investigational
             drug or approved therapy for investigational use is administered within 30 days prior
             to the Baseline Visit OR prior participation in any of the following Biogen studies:
             998HA101 (NCT01027377), 997HA301 (NCT01181128), 8HA02PED (NCT01458106), 997HA307
             (NCT02083965), and 8HA01EXT (NCT01454739).

          -  Previous participation in this study.

          -  Any concurrent clinically significant major disease that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator or Biogen, makes the subject unsuitable for participation in the study.

          -  Other coagulation disorder(s) in addition to hemophilia A.

          -  History of hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis associated with FVIII or intravenous (IV)

Following PK2 assessments, participants received prophylactic treatment with any of 5 available 15K vial strengths during the treatment phase. After 13 weeks of treatment with15K rFVIIIFc, participants will be re-evaluated at Pharmacokinetic assessment 3 (PK3) at the same vial strength as in PK2. A minimum of 120 hours of washout was observed prior to the PK2 assessment. Following the PK3 assessment, participants will resume to treatment in the Treatment Period until they complete a total of at least 26 weeks of treatment.</description>

            <description>Participants who received 2K rFVIIIFc 1000 IU/vial (50 IU/kg) for PK1 were randomized to receive rFVIIIFc (6000 IU/vial strength), 50 IU/kg, manufactured in 15K (15000 liter bioreactor scale) for PK2. Following PK2 assessments, participants received prophylactic treatment with any of 5 available 15K vial strengths during the treatment phase. After 13 weeks of treatment with 15K rFVIIIFc, participants were re-evaluated at PK3 at the same vial strength as in PK2. A minimum of 120 hours of washout was observed prior to the PK2 assessment. Following the PK3 assessment, participants were resumed to treatment in the Treatment Period until they complete a total of at least 26 weeks of treatment.</description>

        <title>Volume of Distribution at Steady State (Vss) of rFVIIIFc as Measured by One-stage aPTT Clotting Assay for PK2 at Different Vial Strengths (1000 and 6000 IU/Vial)</title>
        <description>Vss is defined as the theoretical volume in which the total amount of drug would need to be uniformly distributed to produce the desired blood concentration of a drug. Steady state volume of distribution (Vss) is the apparent volume of distribution at steady-state which is estimated by (D/AUC[0-infinity])*(AUMC[0-infinity])/AUC[0-infinity]) where D is the dose of study drug, AUMC(0-infinity) is the area under the first moment curve extrapolated to infinity and AUC(0-infinity) is the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinite time.</description>

            <description>Participants who received 2K rFVIIIFc 1000 IU/vial (50 IU/kg) for PK1 were randomized to receive rFVIIIFc (6000 IU/vial strength), 50 IU/kg, manufactured in 15K (15000 liter bioreactor scale) for PK2. Following PK2 assessments, participants received prophylactic treatment with any of 5 available 15K vial strengths during the treatment phase. After 13 weeks of treatment with 15K rFVIIIFc, participants were re-evaluated at PK3 at the same vial strength as in PK2. A minimum of 120 hours of washout was observed prior to the PK2 assessment. Following the PK3 assessment, participants were resumed to treatment in the Treatment Period until they complete a total of at least 26 weeks of treatment.</description>

          <description>Vss is defined as the theoretical volume in which the total amount of drug would need to be uniformly distributed to produce the desired blood concentration of a drug. Steady state volume of distribution (Vss) is the apparent volume of distribution at steady-state which is estimated by (D/AUC[0-infinity])*(AUMC[0-infinity])/AUC[0-infinity]) where D is the dose of study drug, AUMC(0-infinity) is the area under the first moment curve extrapolated to infinity and AUC(0-infinity) is the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinite time.</description>

After 13 weeks of treatment with 15K rFVIIIFc, participants were re-evaluated at PK3 at the same vial strength as in PK2. A minimum of 120 hours of washout was observed prior to the PK2 assessment. Following the PK3 assessment, participants were resumed to treatment in the Treatment Period until they complete a total of at least 26 weeks of treatment.</description>

            <description>Participants who received 2K rFVIIIFc 1000 IU/vial (50 IU/kg) for PK1 were randomized to receive rFVIIIFc (1000 or 6000 IU/vial strength), 50 IU/kg, manufactured in 15K (15000 liter bioreactor scale) for PK2. Following PK2 assessments, participants received prophylactic treatment with any of 5 available 15K vial strengths during the treatment phase. After 13 weeks of treatment with 15K rFVIIIFc, participants were re-evaluated at PK3 at the same vial strength as in PK2. A minimum of 120 hours of washout was observed prior to the PK2 assessment. Following the PK3 assessment, participants were resumed to treatment in the Treatment Period until they complete a total of at least 26 weeks of treatment.</description>

        <title>Volume of Distribution at Steady State (Vss) of rFVIIIFc as Measured the Two-stage Chromogenic Assay for PK2 and PK3</title>
        <description>Vss is defined as the theoretical volume in which the total amount of drug would need to be uniformly distributed to produce the desired blood concentration of a drug. Steady state volume of distribution (Vss) is the apparent volume of distribution at steady-state which is estimated by (D/AUC[0-infinity])*(AUMC[0-infinity])/AUC[0-infinity]) where D is the dose of study drug, AUMC(0-infinity) is the area under the first moment curve extrapolated to infinity and AUC(0-infinity) is the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinite time.

          <title>Volume of Distribution at Steady State (Vss) of rFVIIIFc as Measured the Two-stage Chromogenic Assay for PK2 and PK3</title>
          <description>Vss is defined as the theoretical volume in which the total amount of drug would need to be uniformly distributed to produce the desired blood concentration of a drug. Steady state volume of distribution (Vss) is the apparent volume of distribution at steady-state which is estimated by (D/AUC[0-infinity])*(AUMC[0-infinity])/AUC[0-infinity]) where D is the dose of study drug, AUMC(0-infinity) is the area under the first moment curve extrapolated to infinity and AUC(0-infinity) is the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinite time. Results were summarized overall for 15K rFVIIIFc 1000 IU/Vial and 6000 IU/Vial for PK2 and PK3.</description>

Following PK2 assessments, participants received prophylactic treatment with any of 5 available 15K vial strengths during the treatment phase. After 13 weeks of treatment with 15K rFVIIIFc, participants were re-evaluated at PK3 at the same vial strength as in PK2. A minimum of 120 hours of washout was observed prior to the PK2 assessment. Following the PK3 assessment, participants were resumed to treatment in the Treatment Period until they complete a total of at least 26 weeks of treatment.</description>

At PK1, participants were randomized to receive rFVIIIFc (1000 or 6000 IU/vial strength), 50 IU/kg, manufactured in 15K (15000 liter bioreactor scale) for PK2. Following PK2 assessments, participants received prophylactic treatment with any of 5 available 15K vial strengths during the treatment phase. After 13 weeks of treatment with 15K rFVIIIFc, participants were re-evaluated at PK3 at the same vial strength as in PK2. A minimum of 120 hours of washout was observed prior to the PK2 assessment. Following the PK3 assessment, participants were resumed to treatment in the Treatment Period until they complete a total of at least 26 weeks of treatment.</description>

          <title>Development of Inhibitors as Measured by the Nijmegen-modified Bethesda Assay</title>
          <description>An inhibitor test result greater than or equal to (&gt;=)0.6 Bethesda units [BU]/mL, confirmed on 2 separate samples drawn 2 to 4 weeks apart, was considered positive. The test was performed by the central laboratory using the Nijmegen-modified Bethesda Assay. An exact 95% confidence interval (CI) for the percentage of participants with a confirmed inhibitor was calculated using the Clopper-Pearson method for a binomial proportion. Percentage of participants with confirmed inhibitor development was summarized overall.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) at 15K Manufacturing Scale</title>
        <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.

        <description>An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: results in death or in the view of the Investigator, places the participant at immediate risk of death (a life-threatening event); requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; or results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect. All major surgeries will be reported as SAEs.
