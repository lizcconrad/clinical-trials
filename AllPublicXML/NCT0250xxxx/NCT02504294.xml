      A phase 3b study for subjects receiving Epogen to compare a dosing algorithm between Hospira
      Epoetin and Standard of Care Epogen.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary Objective: To evaluate switching from Epogen to Epoetin Hospira for maintenance of
      hemoglobin levels in anemic chronic kidney disease (CKD) subjects on hemodialysis using a
      specified algorithm for the dosing of erythropoietin stimulating agents (ESA).

      Secondary Objective: To evaluate switching from Epogen to Epoetin Hospira on the dosing of
      ESA in anemic CKD subjects on hemodialysis using a specified algorithm for the dosing of ESA.

      Exploratory Objectives: To generate hypotheses regarding maintenance of hemoglobin levels,
      dosing of ESA, intravenous (IV) iron dosing requirements, transferrin saturation (TSAT)
      levels and ferritin levels associated with the switch from Epogen to Epoetin Hospira in
      anemic CKD subjects on hemodialysis using specified algorithms for the dosing of ESA and for
      the dosing of IV iron, that are standard of care.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Subjects eligible to be entered into the study will meet all of the following criteria:

          1. Adult female or male subjects; age ≥ 18 years.

          2. End stage renal disease subjects treated in-center with the modality of hemodialysis
             for ≥ 120 days.

          3. Diagnosed with anemia.

          4. Administered routine Epogen therapy for at least 16 weeks by an IV route for treatment
             of anemia using an Epogen version of an FMCNA dosing algorithm for ESA, and did not
