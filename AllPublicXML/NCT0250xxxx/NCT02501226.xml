  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background. Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is highly prevalent and was associated with
      greater morbidity, mortality (including suicide), and healthcare costs. By 2030, MDD will
      become the leading cause of disability in high-income countries. Notably, among patients with
      a previous experience of a major depressive episode, it was indeed estimated that up to 85%
      of those patients will suffer from relapse. Two main factors were associated with a
      significantly higher risk of relapse: poor medication adherence and low self-efficacy in
      disease management. Interestingly, these issues could become the targets of psychoeducational
      programs for chronic diseases. Inded psychoeducational program for depression are recommended
      in international guidelines, but have not yet been proposed in France.

      Methods/Design: The investigators propose to evaluate the first French psychoeducational
      program for depression named &quot;ENVIE&quot; in a multicenter randomized controlled trial. Its aim is
      to educate patients on the latest knowledge on depression and effective treatments through
      didactic and interactive sessions. Patients will experiment the latest innovating
      psychological skills (from acceptance and commitment therapy) to cope with depressive
      symptoms and maintain motivation in behavioral activation. In total, 332 unipolar non-chronic
      (&lt; 2 years) outpatients with moderate to severe depression, without psychotic features, will
      be randomly allocated to the add-on ENVIE program (N=166) or to a waiting list (N=166). The
      follow-up will last 15 months and include 5 assessment visits (enrollment, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15
      months).

      Discussion. If the proposed trial shows the effectiveness of the intervention, but also an
      increased remission rate in depressed outpatients at 15-months post-inclusion, in addition to
      improved treatment adherence in patients, it will further promotes arguments in favor of a
      wide dissemination of psychoeducational programs for depression.

      The investigators propose to study the rate of remission at 15-month follow-up and time to
      achieve remission of index episode in a multicentric randomized controlled trial using ENVIE
      program and treatment as usual versus treatment as usual only. The investigators will include
      depressed subjects suffering from non a first depressive episode as well as recurrent
      episode.The eligible patients will be randomized into two groups (computer-generated
      randomisation in a 1 :1 ratio, blocked in groups of 4, stratified on the number of episodes :
      1 , 2 , 3 and more). Only outpatients consulting in the investigation centres will be
      recruited. Sociodemographic data, psychiatric diagnoses using Mini-International
      Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) and Screening Interview for Axis II Disorder (SCID-II)
      for borderline personality disorder, pharmacological treatment will be also recorded.Patients
      will be assessed by clinicians blind to treatment allocation, at inclusion (before
      intervention) and at 3 months (end of the intervention), 6, 9 and 15 months after the
      inclusion.
