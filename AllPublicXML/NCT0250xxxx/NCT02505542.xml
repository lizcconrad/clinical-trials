    <textblock>
      Patients receive study drug for one year (Part A). If, after the initial run-in phase, a
      sustained remission is reached they will be randomly split into one of three dose groups for
      another year (Part B). The maintenance of the sustained remission will be analyzed.

    <measure>Percentage of subjects in Part B who do not experience a flare</measure>

    <description>A flare occurs when a subject has an Ankylosing spondylitis disease activity score (ASDAS) ≥ 2.1 at 2 consecutive visits or ASDAS &gt; 3.5 at any visit during Part B. A subject qualifies for Part B only if in sustained remission after 48 weeks of open-label Certolizumab Pegol (CZP) treatment. Sustained remission is achieved when a subject has an ASDAS &lt; 1.3 at Week 32 or Week 36 (if ASDAS &lt; 1.3 at Week 32, it must be &lt; 2.1 at Week 36 [or vice versa]) and at Week 48.</description>

    <description>The BASDAI is a validated self-reported instrument, which consists of six 10 unit horizontal Numeric Rating Scales to measure the disease activity of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) from the subject's perspective. It measures the severity of fatigue, spinal and peripheral joint pain and swelling, enthesitis, and morning stiffness (both severity and duration) over the last week.

According to the linear definition of the BASMI a score of 0 to 10 is calculated for each item based on the measurement. The mean of the sum of the 5 scores provides the BASMI score. The higher the BASMI score the more severe the patient's limitation of movement due to their axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA).</description>

    <description>The SPARCC scoring method for lesions found on the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is based on an abnormal increased signal on the Short-Tau-Inversion Recovery (STIR) sequence, representing bone marrow edema. Total Sacroiliac (SI) joint SPARCC score can range from 0 to 72 with higher scores indicating higher joint inflammation.</description>
