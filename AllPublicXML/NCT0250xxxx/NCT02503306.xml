      Primary Objective:

      o To assess the change in percent of sexual attempts in which subjects are able to maintain
      an erection of sufficient duration to have successful intercourse between the run-in period
      and treatment period:

        -  The change in percent of sexual attempts in which subjects are able to insert the penis
           into the partner's vagina.

        -  The change in score on the erectile function (EF) domain of the International Index of
           Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaire.

      Secondary Objective:

      o To evaluate the safety and tolerability of avanafil in patients with erectile dysfunction
      (ED).

          -  Evidence of any clinically significant medical, psychiatric, social, or other
             condition by history, physical examination, or laboratory studies that, in the opinion
             of the Investigator, would contraindicate the administration of study medication,
             affect compliance, interfere with study evaluations, limit study participation,
             contraindicate sexual activity, or confound the interpretation of study results.
