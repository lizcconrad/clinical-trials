  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to test the feasibility and effectiveness of web-based
      social-cognitive training exercises in treating social-emotional deficits in patients with
      stroke or frontotemporal dementia (FTD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although deficits in empathy and social interaction are relatively common in certain forms of
      FTD and stroke, there are currently no proven treatments for these symptoms. Spouses and
      caregivers often cite these symptoms as a major concern, and these deficits can have a
      negative impact on the quality of life that patients experience. The purpose of this study is
      to evaluate whether or not web-based social training exercises can improve social-cognitive
      impairments in patients with FTD or right hemisphere stroke. These training exercises have
      been shown to improve social skills and empathy in other disorders. This study will be the
      first to examine if these exercises can be effective and feasible for treating social
      deficits in stroke and FTD.

      The study will be based out of the Johns Hopkins Hospital where patients will be assessed
      three times in total. Patients will be assessed upon enrollment in the study and after each
      of the two treatment conditions. The training itself will be completed at home on a provided
      laptop, with monitoring and support by the study team. This study uses a crossover design,
      which means that all patients will receive the training treatment and a control treatment
      during their participation in the study. The approximate timeline for the study is 9 weeks
      total.

    <description>Brain HQ is a web application that will be used to provide patients with a training intervention that addresses deficits in social-emotional functions. These include areas such as identifying facial expression, understanding tone of voice, and predicting how people may react in certain situations. The training will take about 30 hours over the course of 4-6 weeks and is done at home.</description>
