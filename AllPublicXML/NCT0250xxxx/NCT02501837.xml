  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) has been identified as a key modulator of human social
      behavior and it has been recently shown that OXT also contributes to pair-bonding in men.
      However, it is still elusive whether OXT has similar effects in women. In the present study,
      the investigators examine the effect of intranasal OXT on behavioral ratings of and neural
      responses to the male partner in female participants. In a second experiment, the modulatory
      effect of OXT on emotion regulation is investigated.
