  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to identify, in human tumour samples, biomarker
      changes associated to short exposure to AZD2281 as potential predictors of activity in
      Endometrial Carcinoma (EC).

      This is an exploratory study with a biological primary endpoint. Clinical efficacy or safety
      are not a primary objective of the study.

      The main objective of the present proposal study is to assess the biological consequences of
      PARP inhibition in type I primary EC, in patients who receive therapy with AZD2281 during the
      period of time between diagnosis and surgery.

      This is a phase 0 trial or &quot;Exploratory Investigational New Drug&quot; study, a type of trial that
      involves limited number of patient under drug therapy and has no therapeutic or diagnostic
      intent because the drug exposure has a limited duration and the dosage is lower than 100% of
      the dose required to yield a pharmacologic effect.

      The purpose of the phase 0 studies is to assist in the go versus no-go decision-making
      process of a drug's fate earlier in the development process, using relevant human models
      instead of relying on sometimes inconsistent animal data, thus helping to confirm endpoints
      such as mechanism of action, pharmacology, bioavailability and pharmacodynamics.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically-confirmed type I primary endometrial carcinoma (EC).
             Diagnosis biopsy must contain 3-12 mg of tumour cellularity/stroma (Tumour: 5-20 mm)
             and this will be checked in the central laboratory for this trial. If tumour
             cellularity/stroma is inadequate, one re-biopsy with adequate tumour
             cellularity/stroma will be mandatory before study entry.

          -  WHO performance status ≤ 2.

          -  Adequate bone marrow function as shown by: ANC ≥ 1.5 x 109/L, Platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L,
             Hb &gt;10g/dL.

          -  Adequate liver function as shown by:

        serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN INR &lt; 1.3 (or &lt; 3 on anticoagulants) ALT and AST ≤ 2.5x ULN

          -  Adequate renal function: serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x mg/dL.

          -  Fasting serum cholesterol ≤300 mg/dL or ≤7.75 mmol/L and fasting triglycerides ≤ 2.5 x
             ULN.

             of start of study drug, patients who have not recovered from the side effects of any
             major surgery (defined as requiring general anesthesia) or patients that may require
             major surgery during the course of the study.

          -  Prior treatment with any investigational drug within the preceding 4 weeks.

             contraceptives are acceptable as a sole method of contraception. (Women of
             childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 7
             days prior to administration of AZD2281).
