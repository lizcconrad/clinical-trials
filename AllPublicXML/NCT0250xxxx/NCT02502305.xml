  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim of the study is to find out if the live online course is effective with regard to health
      promotion. Older adults receive support to initiate a health behavior (i.e., to enhance
      physical activity or to improve food habits).

      Motivation, confidence and self-management strategies are optimized to make sure participants
      are able to integrate the physical activity or healthy diet into their daily life.

      Aim of the study is to support older adults to define a personal health behavior (to enhance
      physical activity, to improve food habits), to check and optimize this intention regarding
      self-efficacy and volitional competencies, such as action and coping planning, disability
      management to adopt and maintain their behavior successfully.

      Research questions:

        -  What is the pathway from health information/intention to behavioural change
           (motivational and volitional processes)?

        -  Which are the crucial social-cognitive variables in educating/coaching adults with low
           health literacy in daily self-management?

        -  Which other resources (e.g. social support) should be targeted in interventions to
           empower people in health behaviour change and maintenance?
