  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are conducting a randomized clinical trial (RCT) comparing the 10-week peer-led Photovoice
      program to services as usual (SAU) at a large publicly funded community mental health agency
      in Massachusetts. The control SAU condition will be enhanced with a 60-minute peer-led group
      educational session about understanding and coping with prejudice and discrimination. The
      10-session, peer-led Photovoice program, designed to empower individuals with serious mental
      illness (SMI) to confront public prejudice and discrimination and reduce personal stigma
      (self-stigma and perceived stigma), was developed and pilot tested at our Center, with
      primary contributions from staff with a lived experience of mental illness. Development of
      the Photovoice program was guided by an adaptation of the stress-coping model, informed by
      recent research and conceptualizations of the effects of stigma on people with SMI. The
      stress-coping model explicates the mechanisms by which public stigma about mental illness can
      lead to personal stigma, which in turn has a negative impact on the person's mental health
      and psychosocial functioning. This model also identifies critical factors that contribute to
      personal stigma or protect against it, as well as more vs. less adaptive coping responses,
      that are the primary focus of the Photovoice program.

      We are conducting a RCT comparing the 10-week peer-led Photovoice program to services as
      usual (SAU) enhanced with a 60-minute peer-led group discussion session. The RCT will be at a
      large publicly funded community mental health agency in Massachusetts. A total of 192
      participants or 96 participants per group will be recruited over a period of 36 months across
      the three clubhouses of the agency where the intervention will take place. We plan to have
      randomization cohorts of 16 individuals per delivery of the Photovoice program at each of the
      three clubhouses. Given the projected sample size of 192 participants, we will have 12
      randomization cohorts - 4 at each clubhouse implemented at 6-month intervals. Participants
      will be randomized to either the Photovoice program (plus usual services) or the enhanced
      SAU. Participants will be assessed by a blinded rater at baseline, post-treatment, 3-month
      and 6-month follow-ups on a range of primary and secondary outcomes related to personal
      stigma, coping, and functioning. Primary analyses will test the hypotheses that the
      Photovoice program will lead to significantly greater reductions in self-stigma and perceived
      stigma, greater improvements in proactive coping with psychiatric prejudice and
      discrimination, and greater improvements in community functioning and integration than the
      enhanced SAU. Secondary analyses will evaluate whether the Photovoice program leads to
      greater gains than SAU in psychological adjustment, including wellbeing, personal growth and
      recovery. Individuals randomized to the enhanced SAU will be able to join the 10-week
      Photovoice program once they complete their 6-month follow up for the study.

In the Photovoice sessions, participants will be given a workbook titled Combating Prejudice and Discrimination through Photovoice Empowerment. Peer leaders will facilitate discussions based on topics in the workbook. Participants will be given cameras and guidance on taking pictures and writing narratives descriptions about the pictures, specifically the ways in which the pictures relate to experiences of prejudice and discrimination.</description>

    <description>The control SAU condition will be enhanced with a 60-minute peer-led manualized educational group session (Leaders' Guidelines and Handout for Participants are attached). It will provide participants with information about the nature of stigma and the laws in the U.S. that protect people with disabilities from discrimination. Participants will be engaged in a discussion about their use of different strategies for proactive coping with psychiatric stigma. This session will be co-led by the same peers who will be delivering the Photovoice program to the experimental group at relevant wave and study sites. Participants randomized to the enhanced Services as Usual control condition will be invited to join a Photovoice group once they complete the final 6-month follow-up assessment.</description>
