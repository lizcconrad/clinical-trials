  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, hospital-based observational study. The aim of the study
      is to evaluate the prevalence of chronic kidney disease in patients with stable coronar heart
      disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the study is to evaluate the prevalence of chronic kidney disease(CKD) in
      patients with stable coronary heart disease. The secondary aims include: 1. To evaluate the
      awareness of CKD in patients with stable coronary heart disease. 2. To find out risk factors
      that is associated with CKD in these patients. 3. To evaluate the association between CKD and
      cardiovascular events during one-year's follow-up. Based on sample size estimation, the plan
      is to recruit 10000 patients from 100 centers. Patients who participate the study will finish
      one-year's follow up (0 day, 6 months and 12 months after recruitment). During the baseline
      visit, patients' demographic characters will be collected, and laboratory tests will be
      performed for urinalysis, renal function, hepatic function, etc. During the 6 months' follow
      up, MACE(Major adverse cardiovascular events) will be recorded through phone or face to face
      interview between investigators and patients. MACE include all-cause mortality,
      cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, documented re-hospitalization for
      unstable angina pectoris, and coronary revascularization (including percutaneous coronary
      intervention and CABG). During the 12 month's follow up, MACE will be recorded, and
      laboratory tests will be performed again.

    <description>After recruitment, urinalysis, urine albumin/creatinine ratio(ACR), and serum creatitine will be tested. Chronic kidney disease is defined as ≥1 of the following abnormalities: 1)estimated GFR&lt;60ml/min per1.73m2. The eGFR is estimated using the CKD-EPI equation ; 2) Presence of proteinuria. Proteinuria is defined as urine ACR &gt;30mg/g, or urinalysis showing positive proteinuria.</description>

    <description>The participants will be divided into two groups based on whether CKD is present. Means and proportions will be used to describe the baseline characteristics(e.g. gender, age, history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and laboratory results, etc.) . T tests and chi-square tests will be used to test differences between CKD group and non-CKD group, to explore factors that are associated with the presence of CKD. Independent associations between presence of CKD and individual characteristics will be assessed using multivariable logistic models.</description>

    <description>The rate of occurrence of MACE after one-year's follow-up will be described in the CKD group and non-CKD group. Univariate and multivariate cox proportional hazard model will be used to analyze whether the presence of CKD is an independent risk factor for the occurrence of MACE one year after.</description>
