  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have neglected two important aspects for the China National Space
      Administration. First, while biomechanical models are very sensitive to the characteristics
      of the subjects, data have been collected on subjects with biomechanical characteristics very
      different from those of &quot;typical&quot; Chinese astronauts. Second, pure video analysis techniques
      and kinematic data lack the necessary acceleration information important to understanding the
      forces exerted during movement and control of human motion. While some studies used force and
      moment sensors to aid in robot torque control and human joint work estimation, investigators
      are unaware of any studies performed in a microgravity environment that have combined the
      kinetic force and moment information with acceleration measurements to enable more reliable
      motion tracking without the need for acceleration estimation.

      This is why MICR0-G sensors and accompanying kinematic video system have been developed in
      order to provide for detailed analyses of the astronaut movement control strategy (joint
      forces and torques, kinetic and acceleration measurements). Knowledge of the joint torques
      permits us to calculate the joint and musculoskeletal dynamics required to execute the
      microgravity motions, as well to provide insight into the altered movement strategies in
      reduced gravity as compared to 1-G locomotion.
