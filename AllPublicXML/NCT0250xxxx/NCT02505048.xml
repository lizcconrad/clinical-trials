      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of a PARP inhibitor, rucaparib, in
      progressing breast cancer patients and who are carrying a BCRAness profile defined by genomic
      signature or BRCA 1 or 2 somatic mutation, without known BRCA 1 or 2 germline mutation.

    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open-label, multicentric, phase II trial, with a Simon two-stage
      design, assessing the efficacy of a PARP inhibitor, rucaparib, in 41 progressing breast
      cancer patients with at least one line of chemotherapy at the metastatic setting., and who
      are carrying a BRCAness profile defined by Clovis genomic signature or a BRCA1 or 2 somatic
      mutation, without known BRCA1 or 2 germline mutation.
