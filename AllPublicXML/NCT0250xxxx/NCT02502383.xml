    <textblock>
      Using a previously created weight management program for adolescents, the intervention will
      be implemented through school-based health centers (SBHC) and will be delivered by SBHC
      providers trained in Motivational Interviewing. Students at intervention school sites will be
      compared to students at control school sites. All students will have baseline, 1 year, and 2
      year follow-up to assess if students in the intervention school sites will have improved risk
      factor profile for metabolic syndrome, improved nutrition and increased physical activity
      when compared with students at control school sites.

    <description>Adolescents enrolled in ACTION PAC will meet with SBHC providers. SBHC providers will use Motivational Interviewing to motivate students to adopt strategies for improving nutrition and increasing physical activity. All participants will receive annual BMI results discussion with providers. Overweight/Obese adolescents will meet with providers for 16 sessions over 2 years.</description>
