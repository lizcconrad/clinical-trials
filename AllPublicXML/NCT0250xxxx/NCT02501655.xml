      BACKGROUND: Mesh nebulizers (MN) have lower residual volume and increased inhaled dose
      compared to jet nebulizers (JN) per in vitro and animal models. The aim of this study was to
      compare radioaerosol deposition using MN and JN in healthy subjects, using 2-D planar
      scintigraphy. METHODS: A randomized trial in 6 normal subjects (4 female, 2 male) inhaled
      99mTc-DTPA with an activity of 1 mCi with the normal saline to a total dose of 4 mL with JN
      (Misty Max, Air Life, Yorba Linda, USA) oxygen flow of 8 L / min and 1.5 mL with MN (Aeroneb
      Solo with Ultra adapter; Aerogen Galway, Ireland). Scintigraphy was used to determine
      distribution of deposition and mass balance between compartments.

    <description>Immediately after inhalation, participants sat in a chair with the back positioned in front to the gamma camera (STARCAM 3200 GE, California, USA) to obtain radioactivity counts from the posterior thorax during a period of 300 seconds on a matrix of 256 X 256. After, participants were positioned sitting in front to the gama camera to obtain images from face. Then, the same procedure was performed to analysis deposition in the nebulizer, circuits, inspiratory filter, expiratory filter and face mask. Counts representing stomach were obtained from posterior thorax and corrections for decay of technetium were used to during extrapulmonary measurements</description>
