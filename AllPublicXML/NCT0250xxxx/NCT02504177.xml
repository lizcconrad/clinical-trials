      This study is to evaluated the interruption schedule of NOAC in patients who undergo atrial
      fibrillation ablation. The investigators will compare the bleeding complications were
      classified as major and minor bleeding, thromboembolic, vascular complications, Re-admission
      and increased in the length of hospital stay during the 30-day post-radiofrequency catheter
      ablation(RFCA) period among patients who interrupt NOAc 24hours before ablation and patients
      who stop NOAC in the morning of the procedure.
