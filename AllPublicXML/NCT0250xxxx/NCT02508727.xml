    <textblock>
      Cardiac exploration almost systematically requires the acquisition and / or calculating
      function indices. The ejection fraction (LVEF) is probably based index most widely used in
      all cardiac exploration methods. This relatively universal overall index has very many
      qualities. LVEF is widely used in clinical practice through the exploration and monitoring of
      all heart disease.

      Current progress in the management of various cardiomyopathies pass through the detection of
      early attacks. This testing often takes place upstream changes in LVEF that remains long
      normal or normalized. Sensitive indicators capable of detecting early abnormalities of
      regional functions are essential in addition to conventional echocardiography. Various
      studies have shown the contribution of these new markers in early detection of abnormalities
      of the cardiac function. The most widely used indicator in these studies because of its high
      sensitivity to analyze the movements of the heart is the tissue Doppler. Tissue Doppler
      however has limitations in particular its dependence on the incident angle, which makes it
      impossible to correct analysis of non-aligned in the axis of the ultrasonic beam components.

      A new way of exploring the regional function of the heart, speckle tracking, can analyze
      heart deformations along the principal axes of the heart. The advantage of this technique has
      been shown in various pathological situations. Currently, this technique is mostly used in
      longitudinal and transverse view 2D imposing multiple planes cuts. 3D potential of this
      technique is not currently known, acquisition of 3D technology is recent (2004) and dedicated
      software is confidential dissemination and unvalidated.

      The validated technique, 3D reference analysis of myocardial deformation is tagged MRI. In
      the 90s, studies have demonstrated the feasibility of this technique, the ability to access
      all of the myocardial deformation in space and to define normal values. The cost of the
      procedure, duration, limited accessibility and post-processing very time consuming limited
      the scope of the clinical benefits of this modality.

      Echocardiography has major advantages over MRI, particularly its high availability, low cost
      and flexibility of use. The ability to access with MRI as the 3D deformation of the heart is
      a new opportunity that it is essential to validate.

      The main purpose of the study is to compare the strain values obtained 3D ultrasound to those
      obtained by MRI tagged in a control group and a group of subjects with an anterior infarction
      sequela.
