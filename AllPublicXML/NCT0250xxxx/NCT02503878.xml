      Masimo Sedline brain function monitors are sensors (stickers) placed on a the forehead to
      monitor levels of &quot;sedation&quot; based on a bilateral 4-channel electroencephalogram (EEG). The
      purpose of this study is to observe the effectiveness of the Sedline monitor to detect the
      unilateral hemispheric EEG changes seen in Wada testing

        Participants will be 10 adult patients over 18 years old scheduled for Wada Testing at
        MUSC. One of the study team members will inform patients scheduled to undergo surgery about
        the opportunity to participate in the study prior to surgery. Patients will review and sign
        a written informed consent with a research study team member.
