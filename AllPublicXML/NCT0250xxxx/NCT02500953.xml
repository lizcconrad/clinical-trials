      The objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single and
      multiple oral dose of ASP3325 and to evaluate the effect of administration timing on the
      pharmacodynamics of ASP3325 orally administered three times a day.

      &lt;Part 1: Single ascending dose&gt; Primary objective

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single oral dose of ASP3325 in non-elderly,
           healthy adult Japanese male and female, and Caucasian male subjects

      Secondary objectives

        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics

        -  To evaluate gender differences in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics

        -  To evaluate ethnic differences in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics between
           Japanese and Caucasians

      &lt;Part 2: Multiple ascending dose&gt; Primary objective

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple oral doses of ASP3325 in
           non-elderly, healthy adult Japanese male and female subjects

      Secondary objectives

        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics

        -  To evaluate gender differences in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics

      &lt;Part 3: Evaluation of the effect of administration timing&gt; Primary objective

        -  To evaluate the effect of administration timing on the pharmacodynamics of ASP3325
           orally administered three times a day at different administration timings of 30 minutes
           before a meal, during a meal, 30 minutes after a meal, and 2 hours after a meal in
           non-elderly, healthy adult Japanese male subjects in a crossover design

      Secondary objective

        -  To evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics

             donate more than or equal to 400 mL of whole blood or blood components.

          -  Received medications, vitamins including vitamin D, or supplements including calcium,
             iron, magnesium, or niacin (nicotinic acid or nicotinamide), or is scheduled to
             receive medications, within 7 days before hospitalization (Day âˆ’2 [Part 1] or Day âˆ’3
             [Part 2 and Part 3]).

          -  A deviation from the normal range of blood pressure, pulse rate, body temperature, or
             standard 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) at screening or Day âˆ’1.

          -  Any deviation of the following criteria for laboratory tests at screening or Day âˆ’1.
             The normal ranges specified at the study site or the test/assay organization will be
             used as the normal ranges in this clinical study.

               -  Hematology:

                    1. A deviation of +20% from the upper limit or âˆ’20% lower limit of the normal
                       range. However, if the WBC is within the normal range, each differential
                       count of leukocytes will be ignored.

               -  Biochemistry:

                    1. A deviation from the normal range for AST, ALT, Cre, blood glucose, and
                       serum electrolytes (Na, K, Cl, Mg, Ca, and P).

                    2. A deviation of +20% from the upper limit or âˆ’20% lower limit of the normal
                       range for other parameters than the above. However, the lower limit of the
                       normal range will not be established for parameters for which a deviation
                       from the lower limit is not considered clinically significant (AST, ALT,
                       Î³-GTP, T-Bil, D-Bil, I-Bil, ALP, LDH, CK, T-Cho, TG, TBA, BUN, Cre, and UA).
                       TBA and iPTH will only be confirmed by laboratory tests at screening.

               -  Urinalysis:

                    1. A deviation from the normal range of each test parameter (female subjects in
                       Part 2 who are menstruating at screening may be eligible even if urinary
                       blood is positive).

               -  Urinary drug abuse test:

                  1. A positive result for benzodiazepines, cocaine-based narcotics, analeptic
                  drugs, cannabis, barbituric acid derivatives, morphine-based narcotics,
                  phencyclidines, or tricyclic antidepressants.

               -  Immunological test (at screening only):

                  1. A positive result for HBs antigen, HBc antibody, HAV antibody (IgM), HCV
                  antibody, HIV antigen/antibody, or syphilis.

               -  Pregnancy test:

                    1. Female subjects who tested positive for pregnancy.

          -  Failure to meet any criteria for 12-lead ECG for QT assessment at screening (Part 1
             and Part 2 only).

          -  Women who are or may be pregnant, lactating mothers, or women who wish to become
             pregnant during the study period.

          -  Concurrent or history of drug allergies.

          -  Upper gastrointestinal disease (e.g. nausea, vomiting, and stomachache) within 7 days
             before hospitalization (Day âˆ’2 [Part 1] or Day âˆ’3 [Part 2 and Part 3]).

          -  Concurrent or previous hepatic disease (e.g. viral hepatitis and drug-induced liver
             injury).

          -  Concurrent or previous heart disease (e.g. congestive heart failure, ischemic heart
             disease, and arrhythmia requiring treatment).

          -  Concurrent respiratory disease (e.g. bronchial asthma and chronic bronchitis) or
             previous serious respiratory disease (except for a history of childhood asthma).

          -  Concurrent gastrointestinal disease (e.g. peptic ulcer and gastroesophageal reflux
             esophagitis) or previous serious gastrointestinal disease (except for a history of
             appendicitis).

          -  Previous operation of gut excision (except for a history of appendectomy).

          -  Concurrent or previous renal disease (e.g. acute renal failure, glomerulonephritis,
             and interstitial nephritis; except for a history of calculus).

          -  Concurrent or previous endocrine disease (e.g. hyperthyroid, hypothyroid, abnormality
             of growth hormone).

          -  Concurrent or previous cerebrovascular disorder (e.g. cerebral infarction).

          -  Concurrent or previous malignant tumor.

               -  Alcohol: â‰¥45 g/day [a large bottle of beer contains 25 g of alcohol, and 1 gou of
                  Japanese sake contains 22 g of alcohol]

               -  Smoking: â‰¥20 cigarettes/day

          -  Irregular defecation pattern (less frequent than once a day) (Part 2 and Part 3 only).
