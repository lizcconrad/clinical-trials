    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the overall safety of adoptive immunotherapy when
      given after chemotherapy for AML/MDS. Adoptive immunotherapy means using an infusion of cells
      from a donor to help fight cancer. The donor cells will be either from the umbilical cord
      blood (UCB) of a newborn baby or they will be cells collected from a relative
      (haplo-identical cells).

      The 2 cohorts that were discussed - adoptive immunotherapy with either UCB or haplo-identical
      stem cells - will be analyzed separately.

      Preliminary data from other centers has suggested that adoptive immunotherapy with cells from
      a relative is an effective approach that may improve remission rates and survival in AML and
      MDS, because they exert anti-cancer effects of their own (so called graft vs leukemia
      effects) and possibly because they hasten recovery of cell counts from chemotherapy. The
      Investigators are interested in confirming these data, but also in testing umbilical cord
      blood cells for the same purpose. Preliminary data indicate that umbilical cord blood cells
      may have more powerful graft vs leukemia effects and cause fewer side-effects.

      This is a phase 2 trial to evaluate the safety of adoptive immunotherapy with Non-Inherited
      Maternal Antigen (NIMA) compatible, Inherited Paternal Antigen (IPA) targeted CBU or with
      haplo-identical stem cells after conventional induction therapy for very high risk Acute
      Myeloid Leukemia (AML) or Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS).

      The study has 2 cohorts - patients in cohort 1 will receive CBU cells as adoptive
      immunotherapy. Patients in cohort 2 will receive haplo-identical cells. Both cohorts will be
      evaluated separately and no formal statistical comparison between cohorts will be performed.

      There will be approximately 20 patients in each cohort, and a 95% confidence interval for the
      proportion of patients experiencing grade III-IV GVHD complications or unexplained prolonged
      myelosuppression complications in each cohort can be constructed to be within +/- 13.1% of
      the observed complication proportions. This calculation assumes an expected prevalence of
      each of these complication proportions of no greater than 10%.

      After 10 patients are enrolled in each group, the incidence of the above-defined
      life-threatening complications will be assessed. If more than one patient out of 10 enrolled
      patients (i.e., greater than 10%) in a cohort experiences either of these complications, the
      cohort will be stopped for safety.

      All potential recipients will have complete HLA typing and determination of HLA antibodies.
      An appropriate umbilical cord blood unit (CBU) will be identified or in the absence of an
      appropriate CBU, a haplo-identical donor will be identified.

      Treatment will be as per the treating physician's choice..

      The umbilical cord graft or haplo-graft will be administered between 24 - 72 hours after the
      completion of the chemotherapy regimen.

      The Graft Selection Algorithm is as follows:

        1. CBU Unit 5/6 Matched - 1 NIMA match with patient

        2. CBU Unit 5/6 Matched - Shared IPA target(s) with patient

        3. Haplo-identical relative

        4. CBU Unit 4/6 Matched - 1-2 NIMA matches with patient

        5. CBU Unit 4/6 Matched - Shared IPA target(s) with patient

      Within 42 days of transplant, the recipient's pre-treatment evaluation includes: medical
      history and physical examinations, Eastern Cooperative Group Oncology Group (ECOG) score,
      complete blood count (CBC), HLA antibodies, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) antibody testing.

      Patients will continue with the therapy specified in this protocol until one of the following
      occurs:

        -  Achievement of protocol endpoint complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete platelet
           recovery (CRp) after induction and cellular therapy;

        -  Failure to achieve CR or CRp; or,

        -  Extraordinary Medical Circumstances: If, at any time the constraints of this protocol
           are detrimental to the patient's health and/or the patient no longer wishes to continue
           protocol therapy, remove the patient from protocol treatment. In this event.

      After removal from protocol therapy, patients will continue to be followed for survival and
      disease status. Samples for correlative studies will continue to be collected every two
      months until one year after cell infusion.

    <description>Treatment: The CBU unit must supply a minimum of 0.5 x107/kg and a maximum of 2.5x107/kg nucleated cell dose pre-cryopreservation. The unit must match at a minimum of 4 of 6 at HLA-A, -B antigens, -DRB1 alleles with the recipient. Mismatches (0-2) can be at any loci -. Although molecular level typing will be available for the patient and the CBU unit, a match is defined at intermediate resolution for HLA-A and -B and at high resolution for -DRB1. The CBU donor will also have undergone HLA typing of the mother, thus allowing determination of the CBU-IPA and NIMA. CBU grafts used in this study will be investigational units that meet all criteria for clinical use. Better matching units will be preferred over less matching units as long as the CBU dose exceeds 0.5 x107 nucleated blood cells/kg</description>
