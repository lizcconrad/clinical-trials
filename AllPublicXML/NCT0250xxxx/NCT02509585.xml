      Prospective, open-label, within-patient, multi-center study of Lymphoseek in the detection of
      lymph nodes in subjects with known cancer of the cervix. All subjects will receive a single
      dose of 50 µg Lymphoseek radiolabeled with 2 mCi (74 MBq) Tc 99m.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has provided written informed consent with HIPAA authorization

          -  Has cervical cancer and is a candidate for surgical intervention, with lymph node
             dissection being a part of the surgical plan.

          -  Is at least 18 years of age at the time of consent

          -  Has an ECOG performance status of Grade 0 to 2

          -  Has the following International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO)
             IA2-IIA1staging. Subjects with a single enlarged/suspicious node on PET/CT will still
             be considered eligible as consistent with FIGO guidelines.

          -  If of childbearing potential, the subject has a negative pregnancy test within 48
             hours before administration of Lymphoseek, has been surgically sterilized, or has been
             postmenopausal for at least 1 year

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has had preoperative chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiation therapy
             within the 30 days prior to Lymphoseek administration

          -  Has had previous surgery or radiation to node basins that would be involved in the ILM
             procedure

          -  Has a known allergy to dextran

          -  Is breast-feeding or pregnant

          -  Before the administration of Lymphoseek, has received any radiopharmaceutical within 7
             radioactive half-lives of that radiopharmaceutical

          -  Is scheduled for surgery and/or another invasive procedure other than the primary
             surgical intervention within the 3 days after Lymphoseek administration

          -  Has received an investigational product within the 30 days prior to Lymphoseek
             administration
