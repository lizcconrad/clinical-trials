      To determine if treatment with cisplatin and volume-directed radiation followed by
      carboplatin and paclitaxel for 4 cycles (experimental arm) reduces the rate of recurrence
      (increases recurrence-free survival) when compared to sandwich therapy (control arm).

      To determine if treatment with cisplatin and volume-directed radiation followed by
      carboplatin and paclitaxel for 4 cycles (experimental arm) reduces the rate of death
      (increases survival) when compared to sandwich therapy (control arm).

      To compare the regimens with respect to tolerability and acute and late adverse effects of
      therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients with Surgical Stage III or IVA endometrial carcinoma per FIGO 2009
             staging criteria, including clear cell and serous papillary and undifferentiated
             carcinomas.

          -  Surgical Stage III disease includes those patients with positive adnexa, parametrial
             involvement, tumor invading the serosa, positive pelvic and/or para-aortic nodes, or
             vaginal involvement.

          -  Surgical Stage IVA includes patients with bladder or bowel mucosal involvement, but no
             spread outside the pelvis.

          -  Patients with FIGO 2009 surgical Stage I or II endometrial clear cell or serous
             carcinoma and with positive peritoneal cytology.

          -  Surgery must have included a hysterectomy and bilateral salpingooophorectomy. Pelvic
             lymph node sampling and para-aortic lymph node sampling are optional.

          -  Patients with a GOG Performance Status of 0, 1, or 2.

          -  Patients with adequate organ function, reflected by the following parameters:

        WBC ≥ 3000/mcl Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1500/mcl Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mcl
        SGOT, SGPT, and alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN) Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X
        ULN Creatinine ≤ institutional ULN

          -  Patients must be 18 years of age or older.

          -  Entry into the study is limited to no more than 8 weeks from the date of surgery.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with carcinosarcoma.

          -  Patients with recurrent endometrial cancer.

          -  Patients with residual tumor after surgery (any single site) exceeding 1 cm in maximum
             dimension.

          -  Patients who have had pelvic or abdominal radiation therapy.

          -  Patients with positive pelvic washings as the only extra-uterine disease are NOT
             eligible if the histology is other than clear cell or papillary serous carcinoma.

          -  Patients with a history of other invasive malignancies, with the exception of
             non-melanoma skin cancer, are excluded if there is any evidence of active malignancy
             within the last five years. Patients are also excluded if their previous cancer
             treatment contraindicates this protocol therapy.

          -  Patients with a history of serious co-morbid illness or uncontrolled illnesses that
             would preclude protocol therapy.

          -  Patients with an estimated survival of less than three months.

          -  Patients with FIGO 2009 Stage IVB endometrial cancer.

          -  Patients with parenchymal liver metastases.

          -  Patients who have received prior chemotherapy for endometrial cancer.

          -  Patients with a history of myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or uncontrolled
             arrhythmia within 3 months from enrollment.
