      The study seeks to provide long-term follow-up and/or to offer continued maintenance
      thalidomide (THALOMID) therapy to those patients enrolled in 20030165. Patients will be
      followed until withdrawal of consent, or death.

      The study is designed to provide long-term follow-up and/or to offer continued maintenance
      thalidomide (THALOMID®) therapy to those patients enrolled in 20030165.

        -  Group A: Patients who achieved complete response (CR) in 20030165 and continue to
           receive maintenance Thalidomide.

        -  Group B: Patients who achieved complete response (CR) in 20030165, but are not receiving
           maintenance Thalidomide.

        -  Group C: All other patients enrolled in 20030165 who expired or experienced disease
           progression.

      Thalidomide (THALOMID®) will be administered as per standard of care guidelines to Group A;
      in compliance with Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS™) program requirements.

      Patients in Group A, B and C will be followed until withdrawal of consent, or death. All
      other patients in Group C who expired on 20030165 will also be included in all analyses.
