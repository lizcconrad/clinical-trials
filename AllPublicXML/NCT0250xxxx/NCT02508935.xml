          3. Moderate or severe acute pain (as determined from the Numerical Pain Rating scale
             [NPRS]; must have a level of 4 or more) after surgical procedure requiring
             hospitalization.

          4. If, of child-bearing/reproductive potential, must abstain from unprotected sexual

          4. Screening pulse oximetry reading of &lt;95% while awake.

          5. Has presence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or indications of hepatitis A, B or
             C.

          6. Lab values greater than 2 times the upper limit of normal.

          8. Known or suspected alcoholism, marijuana or illicit drug abuse or misuse within 2

             dose of XARTEMIS XR.

         19. Any other medical condition, abnormal vital sign (blood pressure, pulse rate,
             respiratory rate), body temperature, pulse oximetry; or any physical examination or
             ECG finding at screening which would preclude safe participation in a clinical study.

         20. Received any investigational product or device within 30 days before screening, or is
             scheduled to receive an investigational device or another investigational drug during
