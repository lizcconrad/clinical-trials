      The case of patients with amputation of forearm on one side and arm on the other is
      particularly interesting to study because in this situation of handicap greater than a double
      amputation in forearm. We should bring a functional benefit to the patient with the
      transplant of forearm and this situation allows to have the best possible control to compare
      the result of the transplant of arm to that of forearm because it is realized at the same
      patient.

      Amputation of both arms deprives patients of an elbow what establishes a major factor of
      limitation of autonomy and makes patients totally dependent for the realization of the
      essential gestures of the current life requiring the prehension (dress, dressing, food,
      hygiene of the elimination). The various equipments are not always adaptable and usable.
      Psychologically, an amputation in arm is unanimously considered as an infringement very badly
      accepted of the physical integrity and establishes a major handicap factor of family,
      professional and social exclusion.

      The results of this study should allow a better appreciation of indications and modalities of
      care of biamputed patients with at least one lesion level above the elbow.

      This clinical research will determine the potential place of a reconstructive surgery as
      allograft in biamputed patients on the basis of functional results and assessment of
      disorders of the body schema perception.

    <description>Functional results assessed by a multidimensional evaluation:
A general clinical assessment
An analytical assessment:
Articular : Total Active Motion (TAM) as a percentage of Total Passive Motion (TPM)
Muscle: manual muscle strength testing and quantitative by Jamar dynamometers
A sensory and proprioceptive balance: sensitivity on mapping of WINN-PARRY, with assessment of sensitivity of protection and discriminative touch mobile and static touch, Moving Two Points Distance, Static Two Points Distance (Weber test).
A functional balance based on: DASH test, Carroll test, balance of 400 points, tests of independence and Hand Transplantation Score System (HTSS)

    <time_frame>Before intervention, then 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after the transplant.</time_frame>
    <description>The degree of reorganization of the primary motor cortex will be measured by the assessment of re-innervation and the integration of the graft to the body schema by cerebral functional MRI with psychological tests.</description>

    <measure>Acute rejection rate in post-transplant period</measure>
    <time_frame>To be measured at 6 months, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years after transplant</time_frame>
    <description>To be appreciated by inflammatory signs (erythema) at the clinical examination. The diagnosis of acute rejection will be confirmed on the basis of histological results.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Chronic rejection rate in post-transplant period</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout the five years of follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>To be approached by various exams:
MRI
CT scan of segments transplanted
Micro-Doppler looking for intimal hypertrophy
An endovascular echography of vessels above the fold of the elbow
Capillaroscopy
Arteriography will be carried out at 5 years to better appreciate achieving vascular grafts
Histological study of the skin and deep tissues.</description>

    <measure>Walking analysis in posturography</measure>
    <time_frame>To be carried out before the transplant, then at 6 months, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years after transplant</time_frame>
    <description>The walking analysis is a non-invasive examination which consist in recording the movements by a roptoelectronic device. This system captures the three-dimensional position of retro-reflective markers placed on the body. Once analyzed, this information allows getting data quantified on movements.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women

          -  Bilateral amputation of upper limb regardless of the nature of the injury (crush,
             tearing, cutting, infectious such as purpura fulminans...) except for tumor diseases

          -  Lesion level:

               -  The non-transplant patients-free immunosuppressive therapy: bilateral amputation
                  of upper limb with at least one lesion level above the elbow. Higher amputation
                  level is fixed to the upper 1/4 of the arm to allow for a recovery of active
                  flexion of the elbow against gravity.

               -  For organ transplant patients (other than hand or upper extremity: ex liver,
                  kidney) and already under bi - or tri-therapy immunosuppressive : bilateral
                  amputation of upper limb with at least one lesion level above the elbow. The top
                  level of amputation may be above the upper 1/4 of the arm especially if body
                  image disorders dominate the complaint of the patient.

          -  Period since amputation of at least 6 months

          -  Failure of all currently available (including the prosthetic) support modalities
