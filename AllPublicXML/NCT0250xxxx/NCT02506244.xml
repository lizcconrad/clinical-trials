  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether it is possible to identify a high-risk
      cohort suitable for screening for asymptomatic atrial fibrillation using claims data, and
      then engage those individuals in a mobile health technology-enabled home monitoring program
      in order to document previously undiagnosed atrial fibrillation, and provide clinical
      evidence of an outcomes benefit associated with this early detection.

  <detailed_description>

      The purpose of this study is to propose to study two different methods of intermittent rhythm
      monitoring in a cohort of individuals without prior history of atrial fibrillation, but
      determined to be at increased risk based on clinical risk factors, and compare the rate of
      atrial fibrillation detection through monitoring relative to routine care.

Note: Approximately 250 consenting participants will also be invited to participate in a sub-study to wear an additional monitoring device (Amiigo wristband) continuously over the 4 month monitoring period.</description>
