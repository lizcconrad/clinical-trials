      Part 1: to assess the safety and tolerability of pyrotinib and to define the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) of pyrotinib in patients with Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2
      (HER2)-positive advanced solid tumors (metastatic breast cancer, gastric cancer, or other
      solid tumors that have no targeted agent as standard of care).

      Part 2: to estimate the overall response rate (ORR) for patients with HER2-positive
      metastatic breast cancer (mBC) and HER2 mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated at
      the RP2D (or MTD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, dose escalation study of repeated doses of pyrotinib in patients with
      HER2-positive advanced solid tumors, including breast cancer, non small cell lung cancer.

      Part 1 of the trial is dose escalation and is designed to enroll 3 to 6 patients in each dose
      group. Adverse events (AEs) will be assessed and monitored throughout the study.
      Dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) will be assessed from the first dose of study drug through day
      28 in the first cycle of treatment.

      Part 2 of the trial will consist of two independent arms: arm A for HER2 positive mBC and arm
      B for NSCLC with documented HER2 mutation will be investigated to further evaluate safety and
      the preliminary effectiveness and clinical benefits of pyrotinib as a single agent.

          -  is female and pregnant (or found to be pregnant at screening) or breastfeeding;

          -  evidence of significant medical illness or an abnormal laboratory finding, which
             according to the Investigator's judgment, will substantially increase the risk of
             participation in and completion of the study. Including, but not limited to, serious
             ongoing infection (ie, requiring intravenous antibiotic or antiviral agent),
             uncontrolled major seizure disorder, or significant pulmonary disorder (e.g.
