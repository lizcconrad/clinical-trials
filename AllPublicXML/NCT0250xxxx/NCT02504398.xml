    <textblock>
      Vaccine injections are a significant source of pain for infants. Altering the injection speed
      when administering vaccines may be an effective intervention and is feasible (cost neutral).
      At present, there are no data regarding impact of injection speed on vaccine injection pain
      in infants. The aim of this study is to address this knowledge gap and to compare the impact
      of slow and fast vaccine injection speeds on pain during routine infant vaccinations.

    <textblock>
      To date, there has been no evidence-based guidance regarding the rate at which vaccines
      should be injected to minimize pain. This has led to a disparity in practice. Some
      vaccinators favour a slow rate of injection (around 8-10 sec/mL) while others prefer a more
      rapid rate of injection (around 2-4 sec/mL).The slow injection method leads to a longer
      needle dwelling time with the increased possibility of the needle moving around and causing
      pain by damaging muscle tissue. Rapid injection, on the other hand, may lead to a sudden
      distension of muscle tissue, which itself could be painful. Allowing the muscle sufficient
      time to distend in order to accommodate the vaccine might minimize pain. This study will
      address the identified knowledge gap by comparing pain in infants undergoing routine
      vaccinations with a fast vs. slow injection speed.
