  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has been designed as a randomized, double-blind trial to provide definitive
      evidence on the effects of ticagrelor and prasugrel on myocardial salvage in patients with
      anterior ST Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) undergoing primary Percutaneous
      Coronary Intervention (PCI). This study will also measure the effects of ticagrelor vs.
      prasugrel on secondary endpoints listed above. This study design aims to test the hypothesis
      that ticagrelor will reduce myocardial infarct size as a proportion of the ischemic area at
      risk when compared to prasugrel.

      Subjects and research staff (including the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) readers and
      interventional cardiologists) will not know what active treatment study drug the subjects are
      receiving.

      Study Arm 1: Ticagrelor (180 mg loading dose, followed by 90 mg twice a day) PO plus matching
      placebo

      Study Arm 2: Prasugrel (60 mg loading dose followed by 5 or 10 mg once per day based on
      weight) PO plus matching placebo

      Additional study drug: Aspirin (81mg per day)

      Participation in this study will be about 90 days and includes 4 study visits (other than
      your hospital stay) and 3 telephone calls.

        -  Informed Consent Form signed

        -  Medical history

        -  Vital signs (eg, blood pressure, heart rate, respiration rate, temperature)

        -  Review for Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) (only AEs possibly

        -  Investigational Product Dispensing

      Day 14, Day 44, Day 74 (+/- 2 days):

      Phone calls will be performed to ensure drug compliance, review concomitant medications and
      review any events. On Day 74, study staff will confirm whether or not the subject has seen
      their regular cardiologist. Subject will be instructed to bring this information with them at
      the Day 90 visit so that their cardiologist can be told what arm they participated in for
      continuation of care and medication therapy.

      Day 90 or Termination/End of Study (+/- 2 days) :

        -  Vital signs (eg, sitting blood pressure, heart rate, respiration rate, temperature)

        -  Review for Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events (only AEs possibly related to study
           procedures and SAEs are collected)

        -  Cardiac MRI

        -  LVEF, LVEDV, LVESV calculations

        -  Serum creatinine, CBC

        -  Documentation of concomitant medications and investigational product compliance

        -  If available and subject consents, subject's cardiologist will be informed what arm of
           the study they participated in for continuation of care and medication therapy.
