  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of genetic variants of OATP 1B3 or MRP 2
      on the systemic disposition of endogenously formed CCK-8 and to determine the influence of a
      single-dose of the transporter inhibitor rifampin (600 mg) on the systemic disposition of
      endogenously formed CCK-8. Endogenous CCK-8 secretion will be induced by a single-dose
      standardized liquid mixed meal.

             laxatives, metoclopramide, loperamide, antacids, H2-receptor antagonists, proton pump
             inhibitors, anticholinergics)

          -  any other medication within 2 weeks prior to the first administration of the study
             medication or less than 10-time the half-live of the respective drug

          -  intake of grapefruit containing food or beverages and poppy seeds containing products
