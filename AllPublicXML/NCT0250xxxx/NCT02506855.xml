    <textblock>
      This study attempts to learn about the effectiveness of a modification to the Transversus
      Abdominis Plane (TAP) block that works by anaesthetizing the sensory afferents of the
      abdominal wall postoperatively using ultrasound guidance. The investigators want to see if
      regional blocks placed by the surgeon intraoperatively to assure regional anesthetic spread
      in the appropriate plane could reduce error and improve postoperative recovery.

      This study is a prospective, randomized blinded study that investigates the efficacy of a
      transversus abdominis plane block under direct view. In this pilot study involving
      gynecologic patients undergoing open (abdominal wall incision either vertically or
      horizontally) hysterectomy or other related gynecologic surgery, the investigators will use
      ropivacaine versus saline for the placebo control group, which in both groups involves
      injection of agent directly into the appropriate fascial layers prior to abdominal wall
      closure. Efficacy is to be assessed via measurement of pain scores, nausea and vomiting, and
      opioid consumption in both participant groups. The number of dermatomes which are blocked in
      both participant groups during the first 24 hours following surgery will be recorded.

    <description>Study participants will undergo intraoperative transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block with the syringe of medication supplied by the pharmacy using a syringe with attached spinal needle between the transversus abdominis and internal oblique. The spinal needle will be threaded horizontally and as far laterally at the superior aspect of the vertical axis of the incision as possible within this space and anesthetic will be injected after an initial pull back on the syringe to ensure there is no arterial exposure as per the following schedule:
Weight &lt;70kg: Ropivacaine 75mg - 150 mg on each side (20mL ropivacaine 3.75mg/ml each side)
Weight greater than or equal to 70kg: Ropivacaine 100mg - 200mg on each side (20mL ropivacaine 5mg/ml each side</description>
