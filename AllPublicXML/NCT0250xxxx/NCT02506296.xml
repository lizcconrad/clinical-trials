  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with type 2 diabetes have very variable endogenous insulin secretion. While some
      patients have relatively preserved endogenous insulin with marked insulin resistance others
      may develop the very severe insulin deficiency seen in type 1 diabetes. The impact of this
      variation on hypoglycaemia risk and treatment response in type 2 diabetes is unclear. This
      project aims to determine the impact of residual endogenous insulin secretion on glucose
      variability, hypoglycaemia risk and treatment response in insulin-treated participants with a
      clinical diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. The investigators will recruit participants from
      existing cohorts known to have severe insulin deficiency despite classical clinical
      characteristics of type 2 diabetes. The investigators will recruit other participants with
      insulin-treated type 2 diabetes and retained endogenous insulin secretion matched for
      glycemia and gender. The investigators will assess glucose variability (using continuous
      glucose monitoring system (CGMS)) and treatment response to a single dose of the glucose
      lowering therapy vildagliptin and compare responses between groups. This study will allow us
      to assess the potential utility of measuring endogenous insulin secretion in insulin-treated
      type 2 diabetes as a marker of hypoglycaemia risk and in determining likely response to oral
      therapy.

      In insulin-treated type 2 diabetes the relationship between endogenous insulin levels and
      both glucose variability and hypoglycaemia risk is unclear. An association between endogenous
      insulin levels and hypoglycaemia risk was reported in the United Kingdom Hypoglycaemia Study,
      and those with low endogenous insulin levels have increased post-meal glucose rise (a measure
      of glucose variability and therefore hypoglycaemia risk). However, in another large
      cross-sectional study there was no correlation between endogenous insulin levels and
      questionnaire-assessed hypoglycaemia risk.

      C-peptide as a potential biomarker for predicting treatment response to combination therapies
      in those with type 2 diabetes

      Other glucose-lowering therapies may be combined with insulin in those with type 2 diabetes,
      as combined therapy in this condition may achieve better blood glucose control than insulin
      alone. In contrast non-insulin therapy is usually ineffective in type 1 diabetes, likely due
      to differences in endogenous insulin secretion. Among the commonly used glucose-lowering
      treatments which are licensed for combined therapy with insulin in type 2 diabetes are the
      dipeptide peptidase 4 (DPPIV) inhibitors. They have multiple mechanisms of action that
      include potentiation of beta cell insulin secretion and suppression of glucagon. The relative
      importance of these mechanisms to treatment response is unclear.

      Recent work by the investigators group has identified that preserved endogenous insulin
      secretion is important for the glucose-lowering effect of a related class of glucose lowering
      therapies called GLP-1 receptor agonists, with little response seen in those with severe
      endogenous insulin deficiency. The investigators hypothesise that potentiation of endogenous
      insulin secretion may be the major mechanism of glucose lowering by DPPIV inhibitors and
      therefore those who have type 2 diabetes, but very low residual insulin secretion, will have
      little change in glucose with these medications. The pharmacodynamics of these agents (&gt;90%
      inhibition of the target enzyme occurring within 45 minutes (for vildagliptin) and marked
      glucose lowering effect seen within an hour would allow us to explore this idea by assessing
      the impact of residual beta cell function on the glucose-lowering effect of a one-off dose of
      a DPP IV-inhibitor .

      Hypotheses: The investigators hypothesize that patients who have the clinical characteristics
      of type 2 diabetes but have severe loss of endogenous insulin secretion will have markedly
      increased glycaemic variability (and therefore hypoglycaemia risk), and decreased response to
      non-insulin glucose lowering treatment in comparison to patients with similar clinical
      characteristics but preserved endogenous insulin.

      Aim:

      To determine whether individual residual beta cell function influences glucose variability,
      hypoglycaemia, and response to DPP-IV therapy in patients with insulin-treated type 2
      diabetes

      Research questions:

      In participants with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes:

        1. Does individual residual endogenous insulin secretion influence glucose variability and
           hypoglycaemia risk?

        2. Does individual residual endogenous insulin secretion influence glycaemic response to
           DPPIV inhibitor therapy?

      Study design (Overview):

      The investigators will recruit participants who have a clinical diagnosis of type 2 diabetes,
      are currently treated with insulin therapy and are known to have preserved or very low
      endogenous insulin secretion. Participants with and without severe endogenous insulin
      deficiency will be matched for clinical characteristics. Glucose variability, hypoglycaemic
      risk, and response to a single dose of a standard glucose lowering treatment will be assessed
      and compared between the groups. This will require 3 research visits over a 2 week period
      (one non-fasting, two fasting).

      For the response to treatment aspect of the study, glucose response to a mixed meal will be
      assessed with and without a one-off dose of the DPPIV inhibitor vildagliptin, with these
      tests performed in random order.

      Participants and recruitment: The investigators will recruit 54 participants. Potential
      participants will be identified from existing research cohorts or routine clinical practice
      where endogenous insulin status (C-peptide in blood or urine) has been previously assessed.
      Where patients are identified from existing cohorts who have given consent for future
      contact, a letter from that database administrator will be sent providing generic information
      on the study. Contact details of those interested in further information will be passed to
      the research team to continue the recruitment process. Where potential participants are
      identified in clinical practice they will be given generic information about the study by
      their clinician and if interested, and with their permission, their contact details will be
      passed to a member of the research team for further contact. The research team will be
      responsible for the recruitment process.

      Participants identified as having severe insulin deficiency (n=27) will be matched (for
      gender, HbA1c) with participants who have retained insulin secretion (n=27).

      Visit one (baseline, research facility or participant's home) Participants will attend
      non-fasting. Following written informed consent, a blood sample (approximately 30mls in
      total) will be taken for baseline measurements (to include C-peptide, glucose, HbA1c,
      creatinine, liver function) and saved serum and plasma. A urine sample will be collected and
      stored and a pregnancy test offered to pre-menopausal women. Baseline data will include:
      height, weight, age, duration of diabetes, age of diagnosis and ethnicity, and confirmation
      of treatment regimen. A standard hypoglycaemia questionnaire (the Modified Clarke/Edinburgh
      Hypoglycaemia questionnaire, incorporating the Gold question) will be completed by the
      participant. The participant's ability to self-monitor blood glucose will be confirmed (with
      further education provided if necessary). Participants will be instructed on the use of the
      CGM system, and requirements for self-monitoring of blood glucose. Whilst wearing the
      continuous glucose monitors participants will be requested to test their own blood glucose
      levels 4 times spread over the course of each day (for subsequent calibration purposes) and
      record this on a data collection sheet provided. They will also be asked to record details of
      meals, exercise or symptoms over the duration of monitoring. The automatic device will be set
      up for 4-6 days continuous glucose monitoring.

      Visit two (4-6 days after visit 1, research facility) Participants will be asked to attend
      for a morning visit having omitted their morning insulin and not consumed anything (except
      water) from midnight the night before. If they feel unwell, or need to treat low blood
      glucose the visit will be postponed. A small cannula will be inserted to enable multiple
      blood samples to be taken with the minimum of discomfort. A fasting blood test (approximately
      15mls) will be performed for glucose, c-peptide, glucagon and saved serum/plasma.
      Participants will be asked to take their normal morning insulin with a 10% reduction
      immediately prior to consuming 250mls of a meal replacement drink (Fortisip) with or without
      a DPPIV inhibitor (Vildagliptin 50mg) tablet. Blood for glucose, c-peptide, glucagon and
      saved serum/plasma will be taken at 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 minutes after they have
      completed the drink (volume of blood at each time point approximately 15 mls). A urine sample
      will be collected and saved at 180 minutes, and then the CGM device will be disconnected and
      removed. Participant's bedside blood glucose will be measured, and a light lunch provided
      together with advice from study clinicians regarding insulin adjustments if required.

      Visit three (4-14 days after visit 2, research facility) This will be as visit 2 with
      participants given the alternative treatment (DPPIV inhibitor or no treatment). Participants
      will be asked to keep glucose-lowering therapy identical between visits 2 and 3, to attend
      the research department at a similar time of day as visit 2 and to take evening insulin prior
      to visit 3 at the same time and dose as prior to visit 2.

      Randomisation All participants will be required to undertake a mixed meal test with/without
      the standard DPPIV inhibitor. The order of the mixed meal tests at visits 2 and 3 will be
      decided using a randomisation table (StatsDirect), overseen by the CRF statistician. The
      randomisation is included in order to minimize any theoretical order bias effects (e.g.
      glucose levels improving through the study, or participant drop-out affecting the third visit
      more).

      Participants and clinical research staff will not be blinded to this, however the
      statistician will be blinded to the group randomisation allocation for the purposes of
      analysis Concomitant Therapies

      All diabetes related medication will continue unaltered. Participants will be asked not to
      change diabetes treatment for the duration of the study. The study team will manage diabetes
      medication for the duration of the participant's involvement in the study. The General
      Practitioner (GP) or secondary care diabetes team will manage other aspects of diabetes care
      in line with standard clinical practice.

      Data Collection and Recording All participants will be assigned a unique study identifier
      (ID). All data collected will be recorded and stored under this ID number. Data will be
      initially recorded onto a study specific data collection form (DCF). Data will then be
      recorded onto a study specific database. Hard copies will be stored in the study specific
      site file. As part of the ECRF data quality procedures, data collected and recorded will be
      screened and reviewed for discrepancies and missing data prior to analysis.

      Permission will be obtained to access medical notes should this be required for diabetes data
      relevant to taking part in the project.

      Confidentiality:

      All participant data will be held in a link-anonymised format, with personal identifiable
      data only accessible to personnel with training in data protection who require this
      information to perform their duties. Participants' research and sample data will be
      identified by unique study ID numbers and all data will be held on password-protected
      computers. Only the Chief Investigator (CI) or designated research team member will have
      access to personal identifiable data.

      Data Storage and Archiving:

      All consent and paper data collection forms will be scanned onto discs and stored in locked
      filing cabinets within the controlled access ECRF for the duration of the project. Paper
      copies will be shredded. Where permission has been obtained, samples and data will be
      transferred for safe keeping to the Exeter Tissue Bank (ETB) Where no such permission has
      been obtained at the end of the project the study documentation will be archived and stored
      following the standard R&amp;D archiving procedures and biological samples will be destroyed
      following standard clinical guidelines for sample destruction.

      Sample analysis and storage:

      All saved serum and plasma samples will be stored under the study ID, with the file linking
      the study code to personal identifiable information held securely by the clinical research
      facility data manager and accessible only to personnel with training in data protection who
      require this information to perform their duties.

      Analysis will be undertaken by the biochemistry laboratory of the Royal Devon and Exeter
      Hospital. HbA1c, lipid, renal and liver profile will be sent for immediate processing and
      results copied to participants clinicians (with participants consent). Other analysis will be
      performed batched samples at the end of the study, with samples stored at -80oc prior to
      analysis. Blood samples for DNA extraction will be processed and stored by the Royal Devon &amp;
      Exeter National Health Service Foundation Trust Molecular Genetics Laboratory.

      Consent will be sought to transfer samples remaining at the end of the study to the ethically
      approved Peninsula Research Bank (PRB) for safe storage for future use.

      Power Calculation and statistical analysis The investigators will recruit 54 participants (27
      each group). This will give us 80% power to detect an 0.8 Standard Deviation (SD) change in
      mean average glucose excursions (MAGE) (1.44 moll/L [35]), and an 18% absolute difference in
      glucose reduction with vildagliptin at the 5% level of significance between those with and
      without substantial endogenous insulin secretion.

      The CRF statistician will be blinded to the group randomisation allocation for the purposes
      of analysis. The investigators will compare MAGE, time spent in hypoglycaemia (hours/day),
      and Clarke scores in those with and without severe insulin deficiency using unpaired T-tests.
      The investigators will compare response to DPPIV inhibitor (incremental area under the curve
      glucose with mixed meal test with vildagliptin - incremental area under the curve glucose
      test without vildagliptin) between groups using unpaired T tests. The investigators will
      assess whether each outcome variable is normally distributed prior to analysis and log
      transform or use equivalent non-parametric analysis where necessary.

      Study Management:

      The study will be managed by the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) Exeter Clinical
      Research Facility. All contact with volunteers and sample collection will be facilitated
      within the R D&amp;E NHS Foundation Trust setting.

      Timescale:

      It is anticipated the project objectives will be met over a period of 2 years

      Budget Summary and Costing

      All costs will be met by existing research funding as outlined below:

        -  Service support costs will be will be funded by the NIHR Exeter Clinical Research
           Facility core funding.

        -  All other research costs will be funded by Professor Andrew Hattersley's Wellcome Trust
           Senior Investigator Award

      Project development and user involvement The study team will have access to the user
      representative group of the NIHR Exeter Clinical Research Facility (ECRF). In keeping with
      the National Health Service (NHS) Patient Carer and Public Involvement (PCPI) strategy the
      ECRF invites user representatives to contribute to the development of various projects within
      its portfolio. These individuals have agreed to maintain contact and regular meetings have
      been established at which researchers discuss the development of current projects within the
      ECRF.

      Adverse Event Recording and Reporting This is a low risk study and it is not anticipated that
      participants involved in this project will be subject to adverse effects. The CI will be
      informed of any adverse effects within 24 hours and they will be reported following local NHS
      R&amp;D SOPs with a copy of any adverse event form stored in the project site file.

      Participant Feedback:

      Should any biochemistry result potentially impact on clinical care, the results will be
      initially discussed by the CI and the clinical members of the research team and a decision
      will be made to contact that individual participant's General Practitioner or healthcare
      team. A statement to this effect is included in the consent form.

      Dissemination/implementation of research Results will be written up and submitted for
      publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Abstracts will be submitted to national and
      international conferences. Results will be presented to clinical colleagues at regular
      in-house meetings. Written information in the form of a letter outlining the key findings of
      the study will be sent to all participants.

      Potential impact and benefit of the proposed research:

      In the short term the investigators hope to gain an improved understanding of the impact of
      residual beta cell function on hypoglycemic risk and treatment response in patients with type
      2 diabetes. In the longer term the availability of a predictive biomarker for treatment
      response and hypoglycaemia risk would enable improved management of patients with
      insulin-treated diabetes.

      End of Study The study will finish when data and sample collection has been completed on all
      participants, and analysis of data has been undertaken.
