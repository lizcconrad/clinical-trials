  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Compelling epidemiological evidence indicates that alterations of mitochondrial DNA,
      including mutations and abnormal content of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), are associated with
      the initiation and development of cardiovascular disease. This study was undertaken to
      investigate whether mtDNA copy number in peripheral blood cells could be used as a risk
      predictor for coronary heart disease.

    <time_frame>From date of percutaneous coronary intervention until the date of discharging from hospital, assessed up to 5 days</time_frame>
    <description>The ratio of mitochondrial DNA copy number to hemoglobin copy number was calculated for each sample from standard curves. After that, the ratio for each sample was normalized to a calibrator DNA in order to standardize between different runs, and then defined as the measurement of relative mtDNA copy number.Relative copy number of Mitochondrial DNA were measured in CHD patients in comparison to control group.</description>

      Mitochondria are responsible for multiple cellular functions including regulation of energy
      production, modulation of oxidation-reduction status, generation of reactive oxygen species
      and apoptosis. Each mitochondrion possesses multiple copies of a mitochondrial genome
      comprised of independently replicating double stranded DNA (mtDNA).
