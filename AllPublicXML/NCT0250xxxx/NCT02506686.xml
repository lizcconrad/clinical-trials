      A prospective, open-label study investigated the pharmacokinetic profile of meropenem in
      patients with post-neurosurgical central nervous system (CNS) infection, especially its BBB
      penetration into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

      Meropenem is important for management of post-neurosurgical meningitis, but the data about
      its penetration across blood-brain barrier (BBB) are inadequate. This prospective, open-label
      study investigated the pharmacokinetic profile of meropenem in patients with
      post-neurosurgical central nervous system (CNS) infection, especially its BBB penetration
      into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). A total of 82 patients with post-neurosurgical CNS infection
      were included to receive meropenem intravenously according to regimen of 2g q8h, 1g q8h or 1g
      q6h. After infusion of 4 doses, blood and CSF samples were collected simultaneously at
      predefined timepoints. High-performance liquid chromatography ultraviolet method was used to
      determine the concentration of meropenem.
