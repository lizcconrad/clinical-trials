      Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study to evaluate the efficacy and

      There will be 180 male subjects in this study. The study is composed of a Screening Period of
      up to 30 days during which inclusion / exclusion criteria will be reviewed, screening
      laboratory results will be obtained and medication washouts will be done as required.
      Subjects will complete the sexual function questionnaire and depression scale. A one day
      Baseline Period (Day 0), during which baseline assessments of acne lesion counts, physical
      examination and Investigator's Global Assessment Scale will be done. The Baseline Period will
      be followed by a 12-week randomized double-blind Treatment Period, in which subjects will be
      randomized into Finasteride 23.5 mg group, 33.5 mg group, or placebo group. During the
      Treatment Period, subjects will visit the study site Day 14, Day 28, and Day 56 for acne
      lesion counts and review of diaries, concomitant medications and adverse events. On Day 84
      subjects will return to clinic for acne lesion counts and review of diaries, concomitant
      medications, adverse events and remaining study drug will be counted and collected. A
      physical exam and vital signs, Investigator Global Assessment, Subject Assessment of
      Efficacy, depression scale and sexual function questionnaire will be completed before the
      subject is discharged from the study.
