    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of PTNi therapy versus PTN
      therapy without instillation in the treatment of infected surgical wounds. Investigators mean
      to verify differences of effectiveness between the different types of instilled substances,
      normal saline versus Amukine Med 0.5%.

    <description>Topical negative pressure therapy with instillation of saline solution (6 times daily).
During the instillation of saline solution, aspiration is stopped for 10-15 minutes and subsequently the device is programmed to exert a sub atmospheric pressure in aspiration of at least 50 mmHg up to a maximum of 200 mmHg.
The change of dressing is carried out on the first day after the application of the device, and thereafter, as needed (approximately every 3 or 4 days).</description>
