  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who have a large enough defect in their knee cartilage will sometimes undergo
      surgery to transplant donor cartilage tissue into their defect in an attempt to repair the
      knee. The donor cartilage tissue must be fully tested for disease and contamination before it
      can be placed into a patient. This time, along with the time needed to coordinate the surgery
      and transport the tissue to the hospital, can be substantial. Cartilage tissue does not last
      for long outside a body and the fresher the tissue is, the more likely it is that the patient
      receiving the transplant will heal better.

      The MOPS was developed to preserve the cartilage tissue better than the currently standard
      preservation system is able to. Patients that are enrolled into this study will receive
      cartilage tissue that has been stored in the MOPS instead of the currently standard
      preservation system. Their surgical procedure will not change and be performed as per usual.
      The patient will then be followed for a period of two years in which their progress will be
      assessed using surveys and the healing and integration of the transplanted tissue will be
      assessed using diagnostic imaging and blood and urine samples.

    <textblock>
      Patients that are enrolled in this study will receive an osteochondral allograft from tissue
      that has been stored in the MOPS instead of the currently standard preservation system
      (culture media at 4 degrees Celsius). This will be the only difference in the surgical
      procedure between enrolled patients and non-study patients. Enrolled patients will undergo
      their grafting procedure as they normally would if they were not enrolled in this study. They
      will also receive the same care as non-study patients.

      Enrolled patients will, however, be asked to fill out surveys about their health, activity
      level, level of pain, and general quality of life (IKDC, Tegner, PROMIS surveys) at a
      pre-operative visit and at post-operative visits at 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and 24
      months after surgery. They will also be asked to provide blood and urine samples at a
      pre-operative visit, the day of surgery, and at post-operative visits at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6
      months, 12 months, and 24 month after their surgery. Also, there will be a non-standard of
      care MRI taken at 12 months after surgery. Finally, any diagnostic imaging that is done as
      part of the standard of care will also be reviewed by the investigators. No additional
      diagnostic imaging will take place outside of the non-standard of care MRI at 12 months after
      surgery; this imaging review will simply be taking advantage of diagnostic imaging that would
      be available even for a non-study patient.

      The surveys assess the progress of patient function and general well-being. The blood and
      urine samples, as well as the MRI will assess the healing and integration of the
      osteochondral allograft.

    <description>The group will be receiving a cartilage transplant as standard of care. The only difference between the patients participating in this study and non-study participants will be that the cartilage transplant that study participants receive will be preserved in the MOPS instead of the standard media.
The preservation process will be performed by the Musculoskeletal Transplant Foundation. Once the cartilage is received by the Missouri Orthopaedic Institute, it and the study participant will be treated as though they are preserved in the standard media and a non-study participant, respectively.</description>
