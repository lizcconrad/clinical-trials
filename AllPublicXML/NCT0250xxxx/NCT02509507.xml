  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1b/2, multicenter, open-label trial to evaluate the safety of talimogene
      laherparepvec injected intrahepatically into liver tumors with known progression alone and in
      combination with systemic IV administration of pembrolizumab, in subjects with non-HCC liver
      metastases from BC, CRC, GEC, melanoma, NSCLC, RCC, and subjects with HCC. The study consists
      of 2 parts and 2 groups, and Part 2 includes 2 stages. The objective of Part 1 is to evaluate
      the safety of intrahepatic injection of talimogene laherparepvec into liver tumors alone and
      in combination with systemically administered pembrolizumab for the non-HCC (Group A) and HCC
      (Group B) cohorts separately. Part 2 consists of 2-stage design to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of talimogene laherparepvec in combination with systemic pembrolizumab. Efficacy and
      safety will be evaluated in each of the six non-HCC tumor types from Group A separately.
      Similarly, the efficacy and safety of the combination treatment will be determined for Group
      B HCC subjects.

    <description>Talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) administered by intralesional injection into liver tumors, with US/CT guidance. Part 1: initial dose of T-VEC is 10^6 PFU/mL up to 4mL in Cohorts 1 &amp; 2, up to 8mL in Cohorts 3 &amp; 4 of the Group A &amp; Group B. The 1st cycle of T-VEC will be 21 (+3) days (from the 1st dose at 10^6 PFU/mL to the 2nd dose at 10^7 or 10^8 PFU/mL). Subsequent cycles of T-VEC will be 21 (±3) days. Max. volume of T-VEC administered at any dose is 4mL (Cohorts 1, 2, 5, and 6) or 8mL (Cohorts 3 &amp; 4) for any individual lesion or for all lesions combined. Part 2: concentration of T-VEC (10^7 or 10^8 PFU/mL) to be administered will be determined on completion of combination treatment, in Part 1. T-VEC will be used at a max. volume of 4 mL (or up to 8mL if determined safe in monotherapy on opening Part 2). If 8ml safety is not established on opening Part 2, only newly enrolled subjects in Part 2 will receive up to a max. of 8mL if safety of administering 8mL in Part 1 is established</description>
