  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After obtaining a consent, bed side cardiac ultrasonography will be performed for cases
      undergoing transesophageal echocardiography to evaluate the correlation between left atrium
      volume and left atrial appendage flow velocity which can predict the thrombosis risk.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Informed consent will be obtained prior to any research related procedures Prior to
      performing the transesophageal echocardiography, 4 and a 2-chamber transthoracic images will
      be obtained to perform standard left atrial volumetric assessment as well as speckle tracking
      interrogation. Both these procedures will be performed offline. The transesophageal
      echocardiography will be performed using available equipment with a 5- to 7-megaHertz
      multiplane transducer and according to standard of care. All images will be acquired per
      American Society of Echocardiography guidelines and will be recorded for further analysis.
      The left atrial appendage will be best visualized in the 60, 90 and 110 degree imaging planes
      and left atrial appendage contraction velocity will be recorded by placing a pulsed wave
      Doppler sample volume inside the proximal third of the left atrial appendage at each angle.
      In addition, images will be recorded using a 3-beat cycle capture to later perform offline
      velocity vector imaging analysis for left atrial appendage speckle tracking analysis. The
      transthoracic echocardiography will be performed just before the transesophageal
      echocardiography examination using a 2- to 4-megaHertz transducer and according to standard
      practice guidelines. The following echocardiographic variables will be prospectively measured
      and calculated: left ventricle ejection fraction using Simpson method, left atrial volume
      will be measured using biplane method and left atrium volume index is calculated based on
      body surface area. Tissue Doppler images of mitral valve annulus will be measured and Pulsed
      wave Doppler of mitral inflow velocity.

      Study does not include follow up. Study duration is up to 24 months
