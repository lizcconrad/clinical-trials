  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of a clinic-based intervention designed to
      reduce illness uncertainty for parents of children who have been recently diagnosed with
      cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed trial will test the efficacy of the parent-focused clinic-based Parent
      Uncertainty Management Intervention (PUMI) to improve the outcomes of children newly
      diagnosed with cancer and their parents. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive
      equivalent doses of either the PUMI or an Education/Support (ESO) group. Theoretically driven
      by Mishel's model of illness uncertainty, the PUMI will teach parents about uncertainty
      prevention and management through the use of medically-specific communication, information
      management, and problem-solving skills via in-clinic sessions and an online portal. Parents
      and children will complete measures online at baseline, 1-week, and 3-, 6-, and 12-month
      follow-ups.

    <description>Sessions in this condition aim to provide education on cancer etiology, medical treatments, side effects, potential short- and long-term effects of treatment and resources that are often helpful to parents of children with cancer. Information presented will be based upon, &quot;Young People with Cancer: A Handbook for Parents&quot;, a parent resource developed by the National Cancer Institute. Parents will also be provided with relevant educational brochures from COG. Each session will also include a structured set of questions that will facilitate discussion. All ESO interventionists will be trained in non-directive approaches including reflective listening. Content provided in the ESO sessions will offer valuable information to parents without providing the specific skills of the IMPACT.</description>
