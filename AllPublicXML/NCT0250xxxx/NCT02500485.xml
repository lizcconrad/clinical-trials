      This is an open-label (volunteers will know the names of treatments they are assigned)
      single-center study of SHR3824 and SP2086 in healthy adult volunteers. SHR3824(a
      Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2 inhibitor) is currently under development to lower blood sugar
      levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) ,and SP2086(a Dipeptidyl peptidase IV
      inhibitor) is also currently under development to lower blood sugar levels in patients with
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).SP2086 will be administered orally (by mouth) as 100mg on
      Days 1, 2, 3, 4, 15, 16, 17 and 18, SHR3824 will be administered orally (by mouth) as 20mg on
      Days 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18. Both SHR3824 and SP2086 tablets will be taken with 8
      ounces (240 mL) of water.
