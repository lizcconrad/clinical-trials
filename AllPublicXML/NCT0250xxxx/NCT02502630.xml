    <textblock>
      (MWA) is the most recent development in the field of local ablative therapies. The aim of
      this study was to evaluate CT-guided percutaneous microwave (MW) ablation safety and efficacy
      in pulmonary metastases from colorectal cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      From June 2010 to June 2015, 48 unresectable lesions in 32 patients with pulmonary metastases
      from colorectal cancer were selected for CT-guided microwave ablation. Patients were
      scheduled for a 1 and 3 month CT follow-up to evaluate lesion diameter.We retrospectively
      evaluated CT-guided percutaneous microwave (MW) ablation safety and efficacy in pulmonary
      metastases from colorectal cancer.
