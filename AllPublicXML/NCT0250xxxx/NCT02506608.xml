  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phantom limb pain (PLP) is a frequent consequence of amputation, and it is notoriously
      difficult to treat. Amputation usually follows traumatic injuries or surgery following
      vascular diseases, diabetes, osteomyelitis or tumours in cases where the loss of the limb is
      required for the survival of the patient. The loss of a limb or other body parts is usually
      followed by the sensation that the lost body part is still present and can be felt. These
      phenomena are called, respectively, phantom awareness and phantom sensation. In 50-80% of
      amputees neuropathic pain develops in the lost limb also referred to as phantom limb pain
      (PLP). PLP can be related to a certain position or movement of the phantom limb, and might be
      elicited or worsened by a range of physical factors (e.g. changes in the weather or pressure
      on the residual limb) and psychological factors (e.g. emotional stress). It is well known
      that most treatments available for PLP today, such as pharmacological, surgical, anaesthetic,
      psychological and other, are ineffective. Today it is believed that phantom limb pain may be
      related to changes in the cortex of the brain. There is evidence that these changes may be
      modulated - or even reversed - by providing sensory input to the stump or amputation zone.
      For example, cortical reorganization and alleviation of phantom limb pain has been observed
      in amputees following intense use of a hand prosthesis. However, there is no consistent
      knowledge on which type of peripheral sensory feedback may be effective in affecting the
      cortical plasticity or on how to best apply the sensory feedback. The aim of the proposed
      research is to create natural, meaningful sensations through providing sensory feedback (i.e.
      surface or neural electrical stimulation) and the effectiveness to alleviate phantom limb
      pain and restore the cortical neuroplastic changes.

    <description>A system composed by the integration of the following non-CE marked medical devices specifically designed for the study will be used in amputees:
STIMEP (multichannel electrical stimulator for the peripheral nervous system; AXONIC)
TIME 4H Intraneural Electrodes (ALBERT-LUDWIGS-UNIVERSITAET FREIBURG)
Sensorized hand Prosthetics for amputees IH2 Prosthetic Azurra Prensilia (Prensilia Ltd.)
Prosthetics sensorized hand for amputees DLR / HIT Hand II (Wessling Robotics)
ODROID software integration within the afferent and efferent bi-directional control of the robotic hand</description>

    <intervention_name>Operation of sensorized hand prosthesis</intervention_name>
    <description>Four TIME-4H electrodes will be implanted in the median and ulnar of the amputees. The electrodes will be connected with the STIMEP electrical multichannel stimulator. The stimulator will be connected with one of the sensorized prostheses. Afferent and efferent signals will be elaborated and integrated by the ODROID software.
The amputees will be able to control the prostheses movement and receive a sensory feedback from the prosthesis sensors.
The use of the prosthesis during different tasks will be considered the intervention.</description>

          -  The subject should otherwise be healthy and able to carry out the experiment

          -  If pain medication is used it will be acceptable that the person continues to use the
             medication
