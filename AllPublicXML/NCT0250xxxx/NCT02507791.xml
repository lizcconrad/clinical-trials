  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is evaluating the feasibility and efficacy of using Fitbit Charge HR devices to
      remotely track the physical activity of obese pediatric patients who are concurrently
      enrolled in a comprehensive weight loss intervention program. Patients will receive Fitbit
      devices and will be called weekly to review their average daily steps and heart rates.
      Patients will receive the Fitbit either at the beginning of classes or upon completion of
      classes. Patients will then be followed remotely and called weekly for 12 additional weeks
      after completing classes. The two groups will be compared to examine for differences.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be randomly assigned into one of two groups. In the first group, patients will
      undergo an already established multidisciplinary weight loss intervention program and will
      also wear Fitbit Charge HR devices. Their data will be regularly uploaded to their Fitbit
      Dashboard, and this information will be reviewed by the study team.

    <description>Patients will receive Fitbit in the first phase of the study. In addition to attending weekly weight management classes, patients will wear Fitbit Charge HR devices to track heart rate, &quot;active minutes,&quot; steps taken, calories burned, and sleep patterns. Patients will receive weekly phone calls to review this data, and further recommendations will be given to encourage additional physical activity as clinically indicated based on time spent being physically active. The goal will be for individuals to reach 10,000 steps per day, though if subjects are significantly under that goal, realistic goal-setting (recommended increases of physical activity of 10% at a time). Patients will continue this intervention for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks, they will return for reassessment. This coincides with the completion of the weight loss program. Subjects will then be followed remotely for another 12 weeks and phone call interventions will continue before returning for a final study visit.</description>

    <description>These subjects will follow a similar pattern except they will not receive Fitbit Charge HR devices until the second phase of the study (specifically after completion of the 12 week weight loss program). In the first phase, these subjects will receive weekly phone calls to offer them the same attention as the experimental group, but instead of reviewing Fitbit data, these subjects will subjectively report their physical activity in minutes and by qualifying their physical activity as light, moderate, or vigorous. These individuals, after 12 weeks, will return for reassessment. At that time, these individuals will receive Fitbits and receive weekly telephone calls for an additional 12 weeks before returning for a final study visit.</description>
