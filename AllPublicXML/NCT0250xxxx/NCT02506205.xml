  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A handful of studies have examined the effects of the Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT)
      LOUD on hypokinetic dysarthria in English speakers with Parkinson's disease (PD). Although
      LSVT LOUD has been found to be effective on improving these speaker's vocal intensity and
      increasing their speech intelligibility as well as speech function with Phase I evidence, no
      study has investigated whether Mandarin-speaking individuals with dysarthria secondary to PD
      would benefit from LSVT LOUD. In the proposed study, speech data of Mandarin-speaking
      individuals with hypokinetic dysarthria before and after speech therapy will be audio
      recorded and analyzed in order to examine the effects of LSVT LOUD on the speech function in
      this population. The same speech data will be played to Mandarin listeners in order to
      investigate the speech intelligibility of this population. It is hypothesized that
      Mandarin-speaking individuals with hypokinetic dysarthria secondary to PD will demonstrate
      reduced vocal intensity, reduced speech intelligibility and impaired speech function before
      they receive LSVT LOUD. They will improve these speech characteristics following speech
      therapy and will present with short-term maintenance effects.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Speech intelligibility</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediate</time_frame>
    <description>Speech intelligibility will be assessed by native Mandarin listeners' orthographic transcription accuracy and ratings based on a nine-point Likert scale (from 1 - very difficult to understand to 9 - very easy to understand).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Speech function</measure>
    <time_frame>Immdediate</time_frame>
    <description>Speech function will be assessed using acoustic methods. E.g., vowel formant frequencies correlated with vowel articulation will be extracted and analyzed using Praat software.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life measured by PDQ-39</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediate</time_frame>
    <description>This area of assessment will be measured by Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) (Jenkinson, Fitzpatrick, Peto, Greenhall, &amp; Hyman, 1997). This battery provides information on areas that affect participants' well-being and the degree affected.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Depression level measured by BDI-II</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediate</time_frame>
    <description>Some patients with PD develop depression that affects their daily life. Therefore, it is necessary to assess their depression level with Beck Depression Inventory-II (Beck, Steer, &amp; Brown, 1996)</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive status measured by MMSE</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediate</time_frame>
    <description>It is necessary to assess their cognitive status with Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE) (Folstein, Foistein, &amp; McHugh, 1975) and the score will be used as the inclusion or exclusion criteria.</description>

    <description>LSVT LOUD was developed based on concepts of neuroplasticity, motor learning, skill acquisition and motor speech. LSVT LOUD trains laryngeal and respiratory functions through loud and effortful phonatory tasks (Ramig, Sapir, Countryman, Pawlas, O'Brien, Hoehn, &amp; Thomson, 2001). It targets vocal intensity via stimulation of effortful speech productions with multiple repetitions and through encouraging self-calibrations of loud voice by patients. LSVT LOUD cues patients to speak loud (e.g., Fox et al., 2002; Ramig et al., 2001; Sapir et al., 2007). Having a single cue may increase treatment effects, as it reduces cognitive load in adults with PD because some of them develop cognitive deficits when PD progresses (Fox et al., 2002). Treatment is intensive, consisting of 4 individual sessions a week for 4 weeks, with 16 sessions in one month.</description>
