  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this clinical trial is to determine if treatment with an
      anti-inflammatory drug (delayed-release prednisone) improves the health-related quality of
      life (HRQOL) of veterans with Gulf War Illness (GWI). The primary outcome measure is a change
      from baseline of HRQOL with respect to physical functioning and symptoms. Secondary outcomes
      measures include changes from baseline levels of GWI-associated biomarkers of inflammation in
      peripheral blood, GWI-associated symptoms (chronic pain, fatigue, and cognitive impairment),
      and HRQOL with respect to mental functioning.

    <textblock>
      During Desert Shield and Desert Storm (Aug 2, 1990 to July 31,1991) 696,841 United States
      Military personnel were deployed to the Kuwaiti Theater of Operations. Today approximately
      one-third of those veterans are suffering from GWI, an unexplained chronic multi-symptom
      illness. Evidence of chronic inflammation in veterans with GWI has emerged from previous
      observational studies. The goal of this trial is to determine if reducing the GWI-associated
      chronic inflammation is an effective treatment for GWI. This is a randomized, two group,
      placebo controlled, double blind clinical trial. The treatment group will receive a low dose
      (2x5mg) once a day of delayed-release prednisone (Rayos) for 8 weeks. The placebo group will
      receive matching placebo (2x5mg) once a day for 8 weeks. The primary outcome measure for this
      clinical trial is a change from baseline of HRQOL with respect to physical functioning and
      symptoms. The secondary outcome measures include changes from baseline of peripheral blood
      levels of GWI-associated biomarkers of inflammation, changes from baseline of GWI-associated
      symptoms (chronic pain, fatigue, and cognitive impairment), and a change from baseline of
      HRQOL with respect to mental functioning.
