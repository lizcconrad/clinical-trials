      Objectives: This study aims to assess the effectiveness, safety, and feasibility of intensive
      acupuncture treatments combined with standard antiemetic medication as compared with P6
      acupoint stimulation combined with standard antiemetic medication or with standard antiemetic
      medication alone, to prevent postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in patients undergoing
      laparoscopic colorectal surgery.

      Background: PONV is one of the prevalent discomforts in the early phase of recovery after
      surgery. Evidence suggests that the stimulation of the P6 acupuncture point can reduce the
      occurrence of PONV. What remains unclear is whether a higher dose of acupuncture produces
      more benefits compared with P6 stimulation alone or whether acupuncture combined with
      standard antiemetic medication yields better outcomes. This study aims to assess the
      effectiveness and safety of different acupuncture regimen for the prevention of PONV:
      high-dose acupuncture treatments combined with standard antiemetic medication, P6
      acupuncture-point stimulation combined with standard antiemetic medication, or medication
      alone.

    <description>Intravenous infusion of (oxycodone 20mg, ketorolac 120mg, ramosetron 0.3mg) as standard antiemetic medication will be provided. A dose of continuous infusion will be reduced by 0.1 ml/hr when a patient complaints of nausea.
When vomiting occurs, a dose of continuous infusion will be reduced by 0.2 ml/hr and a bolus infusion of ramosetron 0.3 mg will be provided. A bolus infusion of ramosetron 0.3 mg will be also given if a patient feels greater than or equal to six points of nausea as measured on a 0 to 10 numeric rating scale (NRS) (nausea-severity scale) or by the patient's request, regardless of the severity of the nausea.</description>
