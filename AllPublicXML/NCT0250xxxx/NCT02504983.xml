    <textblock>
      Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) + sorafenib therapy has been demonstrated to
      exert a beneficial effective on time-to-tumor-progression (TTP) in patients with unresectable
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in some studies. However, the beneficial effect varies among
      studies conducted in different areas of the world. The objectives of this study are (1) to
      understand whether GALNT14 TT genotype patients respond better than do GALNT14 non-TT
      genotype patients when treated by TACE; and (2) to understand whether GALNT14 non-TT genotype
      patients can benefit from TACE plus sorafenib (Nexavar) combination therapy. Patients
      enrolled will be stratified by GALNT14 genotyping. The GALNT14 &quot;non-TT&quot; patients were then
      randomized into two subgroups to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of TACE plus
      sorafenib therapy.

      The primary endpoint of this study is the efficacy of TACE with or without sorafenib
      combination therapy evaluated by complete remission (CR).

      The secondary endpoints are:

        1. Time to partial or complete response (PR + CR).

        2. Time-to-tumor-progression (TTP) and the progression free survival (PFS).

        3. Overall survival (OS).

        4. Safety and tolerability of TACE plus sorafenib therapy.

      The strategy of TACE + sorafenib is now being intensively investigated. It is a safe approach
      with significant beneficial effect on TTP in some studies, but the beneficial effect on OS
      remains uncertain. In the present study, we hypothesized that the GALNT14 genotype might play
      a role in this issue. Our pilot study indicated that GALNT14 &quot;TT&quot; genotype was associated
      with a favorable complete response rate in patients treated by TACE alone. This genotype was
      present in ~ 25% of Chinese population coming from Taiwan, Colorado (US), or Beijing (China),
      and in ~ 7% of Italian population. But it was present in ~ 50% of Japanese population. The
      lower percentage of a TACE - favorable genotype in Chinese and Italian population could
      explain the different results between Japanese and Chinese/Italian clinical trials. It is
      possible that in a population with higher percentage of TACE - favorable genotype (GALNT14
      &quot;TT&quot;), the beneficial effect of sorafenib adjuvant treatment might not be detected. In this
      study, we proposed to examine the TACE + sorafenib effect in patients with GALNT14 &quot;non-TT&quot;
      genotype, a TACE - unfavorable genotype.

When no viable tumor is seen on CT, TACE is to be discontinued. patients will receive sorafenib 400 mg/d between each TACE. Patient will start receiving Sorafenib on Day 4 (up to Day 7) after 1st TACE (Day 1) and will interrupt after evening dose 4 days before each next TACE and re-start Sorafenib on Day 4 (up to Day 7) after each TACE cycle.Additional sorafenib treatment is optional and will be judged by investigator in the subject's best medical interest.</description>
