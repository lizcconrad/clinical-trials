  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the safety and effectiveness of intranasal (IN) glulisine in patients
      with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and probable Alzheimer's disease. Half of
      participants will receive IN glulisine, while the other half will receive IN placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Disruption of central nervous system (CNS) insulin signaling has been increasingly associated
      with Alzheimer's Disease pathogenesis, and consequently this disease has been referred to as
      a type III diabetes of the brain. Clinical trials of intranasal insulin in AD have
      demonstrated therapeutic effects of intranasal (IN) insulin in memory-impaired adults in
      terms of memory recall without significantly altering serum insulin or glucose levels. In
      this study, the investigators are investigating the chronic effects of the rapid acting
      insulin, glulisine, administered intranasally (IN) 20 IU two times daily in adults with
      amnestic-mild cognitive impairment (a-MCI) and mild Alzheimer's disease (AD). The
      investigation will enroll n=90 subjects and follow them over a 6 month period.

      This study has the following objectives:

        1. Primary:

           a. To measure the chronic effects of IN insulin glulisine on cognition and function in
           subjects with aMCI and probable mild AD over a 6 month period.

        2. Secondary:

             1. To measure the effect of IN insulin glulisine on mood in subjects with aMCI and
                mild AD over a 6 month period.

             2. To measure the safety and efficacy of IN glulisine in aMCI and mild AD subjects
                with non-insulin dependent diabetes over a 6 month period.

        3. Exploratory:

             1. To measure the effect of IN delivery of insulin glulisine on parieto-temporal and
                posterior cingulate/precuneus glucose metabolism in subjects with aMCI and mild AD
                over a 6 month period.

             2. To measure the chronic effect of IN delivery of insulin glulisine on AD-specific
                cerebrospinal (CSF) biomarkers (Abeta42, tau, and phospho-tau) in subjects with
                aMCI and mild AD over a 6 month period.

    <measure>Change in cognition as measured by the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive 13 (ADAS-Cog 13)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The ADAS-Cog was developed as an outcome measure for global cognition in clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease. The ADAS-Cog assesses multiple cognitive domains including memory, language, praxis, and orientation. The modified ADAS-Cog 13-item scale includes all original ADAS-Cog items with the addition of a number cancellation task and a delayed free recall task, for a total of 85 points (0: no cognitive impairment; 85: severe impairment).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in functional performance as measured by the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The CDR is a 5-point scale used to characterize six domains of cognitive and functional performance applicable to Alzheimer disease and related dementias: Memory, Orientation, Judgment &amp; Problem Solving, Community Affairs, Home &amp; Hobbies, and Personal Care. Scores on the CDR range from 0 (no impairment) to 3 (severe impairment). The total CDR ratings for each of the six cognitive/functional domains can be added to create a CDR sum of boxes (SOB).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in functional performance as measured by the Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The FAQ measures instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), such as preparing balanced meals and managing personal finances. The FAQ is a sum of scores ranging from 0 (normal) to 30 (complete dependence on others).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects are read a random list of numbers at a rate of one per second and immediately asked to repeat them in a forward sequence or a backward sequence. Digit strings gradually expand and become lengthier until the subject makes consistent errors, at which point the test is discontinued.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in mental flexibility as measured by the Trail Making Test, Parts A and B</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Part A requires subjects to connect a series of numbered dots in order as quickly as possible. Part B requires subjects to connect numbered and lettered dots as quickly as possible by alternating back and forth between the two without making mistakes. Scores include both time to completion and various error types.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in executive functioning as measured by the Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in executive functioning as measured by the Animal Naming test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects are asked to name all of the animals he/she can think of in 60 seconds. Scores are the number of animals named. A score below 14 can be an indication of impaired executive function and/or language abilities.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in memory functions as measured by the Weschler Memory Scale Logical Memory (WMS-LM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Logical memory represents one of 7 memory subtests that are included within the WMS-IV. Subjects are read two thematically independent stories and later asked to recall each story immediately and later, thirty minutes after the reading. Patients struggling with recall of story contents are provided cues to assist with recognition.</description>
