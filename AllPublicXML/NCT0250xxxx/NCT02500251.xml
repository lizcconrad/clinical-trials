             or a positive T or B cell flow cytometry crossmatch.

          3. Patient that is on the kidney transplant waiting list awaiting a deceased donor
             transplant and has an iAb of &gt; 8,000 MFI or has a current or peak calculated panel
             reactive antibody (cPRA) &gt;20%.

          4. Voluntary written informed consent before performance of any study-related procedure
             not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn
             by the subject at any time without prejudice to future medical care.

          5. Female subject is either post-menopausal for one year prior to screening or surgically
             sterilized. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must not become pregnant and so
             must be sexually inactive by abstinence (starting 2 weeks prior to the 1st belimumab
             and/or bortezomib dose) or use contraceptive methods with a failure rate of &lt; 1%
             (starting 1 month prior to the 1st belimumab and/or bortezomib dose) for the duration
             of the study through 16 weeks after the last belimumab and/or bortezomib dose. WOCBP
             must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test at screening and &lt; 7 days prior to
             the first belimumab and/or bortezomib dose.

          6. Male subjects, even if surgically sterilized (i.e., status post vasectomy) must agree
             to 1 of the following: practice effective barrier contraception during the entire
             study treatment period and through a minimum of 16 weeks after the last dose of
             belimumab and/or bortezomib, or completely abstain from heterosexual intercourse.

          7. Review of pre-transplant medical clearance by the patient's transplant nephrologist to
             assure the patient is medically acceptable for study entry.

             participate in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Know hypersensitivity to bortezomib, boron or mannitol, rituximab, belimumab or any of
             its components.

          2. Have a history of an anaphylactic reaction to parenteral administration of contrast
             agents, human or murine proteins or monoclonal antibodies.

          3. Subjects judged by the investigator to be at significant risk of failing to comply
             with the requirements of the protocol or unable to cooperate or communicate with the
             investigator.

          4. Abnormal ECG with clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias or other conduction
             abnormality that in the opinion of the investigator warrants exclusion of the subject
             from the trial.

          5. Myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to enrollment or has New York Heart
             Association (NYHA) Class III or IV heart failure (Appendix A), uncontrolled angina,
             severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias, or electrocardiographic evidence of acute
             ischemia or active conduction system abnormalities. Prior to study entry, any
             abnormality on ECG performed within 30 days of consent has to be documented by the
             investigator or the patient's transplant nephrologist as not medically relevant.

          6. Patient has Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy by CTCAE criteria within 14 days before
             enrollment.

          7. Patients with an absolute neutrophil count &lt; 1,000/mm3 or platelet count &lt; 75,000/mm3
             within 30 days of consent.

          8. Patient has received intravenous cyclophosphamide within 180 days prior to belimumab,
             any biologic investigational agent within 365 days prior to belimumab, or any
             non-biologic investigational agent within 30 days (or 5 half-lives, whichever is
             greater) prior to belimumab.

         10. Received blood transfusions within 30 days prior to trial entry.

         11. Have any intercurrent significant medical (other than renal disease) or psychiatric
             illness that the investigator considers would make the candidate unsuitable for the

             consent.

         19. Have a history of a primary immunodeficiency.

         20. Have a significant IgG deficiency (IgG level &lt; 400 mg/dl) or have an IgA deficiency
             (IgA level &lt; 10 mg/dL).

         21. Have current drug or alcohol abuse or dependence, or a history of drug or alcohol
             abuse or dependence within 364 days prior to Day 0.
