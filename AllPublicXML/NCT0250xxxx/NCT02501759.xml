    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies transrectal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided biopsy
      to see how well it works in identifying cancer in patients with suspected prostate cancer who
      are scheduled to undergo standard biopsy. Transrectal MRI-guided biopsy uses a thin needle
      inserted through the rectum into the prostate and takes a sample of tissue, guided by MRI.
      MRI uses magnets to take pictures of the prostate and may be able to identify cancer.
      Transrectal MRI-guided biopsy may be more accurate and cause patients less pain than standard
      ultrasound-guided biopsy. It is not yet known whether transrectal MRI-guided biopsy is more
      effective than ultrasound-guided biopsy in identifying prostate cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To improve the treatment of patients with prostate cancer utilizing diagnostic
      multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MRI-guided prostate biopsy combined
      with molecular and clinical data to help determine the extent of prostate cancer and risk of
      disease progression.

      II. To determine the relative accuracy of transrectal MRI-guided versus ultrasound-guided
      biopsy for the diagnosis of prostate cancer in patients with an appropriate dominant target
      lesion at multiparametric MRI, using pooled cancer diagnoses by either MRI-guided or
      ultrasound-guided biopsy as the reference standard.

      III. To determine the proportion of positive transrectal MRI-guided biopsies that demonstrate
      a higher Gleason score than contemporaneous transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy.

      IV. To determine the management impact of transrectal MRI-targeted biopsy results as compared
      to transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided systematic biopsy results.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive gadodiamide intravenously (IV) and undergo a diagnostic multiparametric
      endorectal MRI. Patients with lesions visible on the diagnostic multiparametric endorectal
      MRI undergo transrectal MRI-guided biopsy within 2 weeks of diagnostic multiparametric
      endorectal MRI. Patients then undergo TRUS-guided biopsy per standard clinical care
      approximately 2 weeks after transrectal MRI-guided biopsy.

    <description>The proportion of MRI-guided biopsies that demonstrate a higher Gleason score than contemporaneous TRUS guided biopsy for all patients diagnosed of prostate cancer based on the reference standard will be estimated. McNemar's test will be used to assess whether the MRI-guided biopsies are more likely to yield a higher Gleason score compared with TRUS guided biopsy. Simple logistic regression model will be used to assess the association between the higher Gleason score and patient characteristics and/or clinical information for patients diagnosed of prostate cancer.</description>

    <description>The presence of cancer on either biopsy or absence of cancer on both will be used as the reference standard. For comparison of the two methods, the 2X2 matched sample tables will be presented, and the difference in sensitivity estimated. The relative accuracy of MRI- versus TRUS-guided biopsy will be compared using McNemar's test. To explore potential associations between the accuracy of each method with patient characteristics and/or clinical information, a binary endpoint will be created to reflect agreement between each method and the reference standard.</description>
