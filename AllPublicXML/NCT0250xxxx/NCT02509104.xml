  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the bioavailability of a FDC capsule
      formulation of dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride (0.5 milligram [mg]/0.2 mg) relative
      to coadministration of one dutasteride 0.5 mg capsule and one tamsulosin HCl 0.2 mg tablet in
      healthy male subjects in fed and fasted states. This is an open-label, randomized, single
      dose, two-way crossover study enrolling healthy male subjects, split into fasted (Cohort 1)
      and fed (Cohort 2) conditions. In both cohorts, one FDC capsule formulation of dutasteride
      0.5 mg/tamsulosin HCl 0.2 mg will be administered in one treatment period and the
      coadministration of dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride in a different treatment period.
      Each subject enrolled will be allowed to participate in only one cohort (i.e, will receive
      treatment under fasted or fed conditions) and will participate in both treatment periods. The
      two treatment periods will be separated by a minimum washout period of 28 days. The total
      duration in the study for each subject will be approximately 2.5 months from screening to the
      final follow-up visit.

             consultation with the Medical Monitor if required agree and document that the finding

             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or Medical
             Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  Presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), positive hepatitis C antibody test
             result at screening or within 3 months prior to first dose of study treatment.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 50 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).
