  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective phase 2, single-arm, mono-center pilot study. It has been designed to
      investigate whether giving the combination therapy consisting of minimal islet
      transplantation (1500 EIQ/Kg body weight), Thymoglobulin® (ATG), Rapamune® (rapamycin) and
      Neulasta® (pegfilgastrim) to patients with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) at onset is safe and
      secondarily, if it will preserve insulin production. It will involve 6 patients with
      new-onset T1D. Each patient will be involved in the study for a screening period and a
      post-islet transplantation study period of 52±2 weeks, to include 1 treatment cycles of 12
      weeks, assessment during treatment and 5 follow-up visits scheduled at weeks 2±1 (14 days),
      4±1 (month 1), 12±2 (month 3), 26±2 (month 6) and 52±2 (month 12).

    <description>The investigational treatment will be islet transplant in the presence of induction with ATG/G-CSF and rapamycin treatment for one month. One thousand and five hundred (1,500) equivalent islet for Kg of body weight, isolated from a single brain-dead donor, will be infused into the patient's liver. ATG will be administered IV (central vein) at a total dose of 6 mg/kg up to day 6 post-transplant. Pegylated G-CSF (6 mg/dose) will be administered SC every 2 weeks for 6 doses (12 weeks) beginning after the last ATG infusion. Rapamycin will be administered orally at a starting dose of 0.2 mg/kg once a day, then targeted to blood trough level of 8-10 ng/mL and suspended one month after transplant.</description>
