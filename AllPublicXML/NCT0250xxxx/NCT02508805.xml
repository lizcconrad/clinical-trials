  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety of Neuromultivit (solution for
      injections) in treatment of vertebrogenic radiculopathy L5, S1 in comparison with standard
      therapy. The patients are randomised into two groups: standard therapy group and standard
      therapy plus Neuromultivit group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Group 1 (50 patients) receive Neuromultivit (2 ml per day, i.m.) for 7 days, then
      -Neuromultivit (2 ml per day, i.m.) every other day for 10 days and standard therapy for 20
      days.

      Group 2 (50 patients) receive only standard therapy for 20 days.

      Standard therapy involves:

        -  Voltaren (100 mg prolonged-released film-coated tablets once daily) for 20 days

        -  Sirdalud (2 mg tablets three times a day) for 20 days

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Pain Intensity at Rest and with Activity in Visual Analogu–µ Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Self reported pain intensity over the last 24 hours. The amount of pain is marked on a horizontal line at a certain point which reflects pain perception best: no pain (0-4 mm), mild pain(5-44 mm), moderate pain (45-74 mm), and severe pain (75-100 mm).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Pain Quality and Intensity in McGill Pain Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Self reported quality and intensity of pain, described by selecting 7 words, which reflect pain perception best, from 20 groups: three words from groups 1-10, two words from groups 11-15, a single word from group 16, one word from groups 17-20.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Low Back Pain Intensity in Aberdeen Back Pain Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Self reported effect of pain on body functions and daily activities. The scores of responses to 19 questions (6 multiple choice questions and 13 single choice questions) are summed, yielding a total between 0 and 100 with higher values representing greater disability.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Low Back Pain Intensity in Quebec Back Pain Disability Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Self reported pain related functional limitations to 20 activities. The degree of difficulty in performing these daily activities is scored from 0-5 (0 = no effort, 5 = not able to), yielding a total between 0 and 100 with higher values representing greater disability.</description>
