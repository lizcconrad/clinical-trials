      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of pelvic autonomic nerve monitoring and mapping during
      robot assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy for preservation of erectile function.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Using NIM-Eclipse monitoring instrument (Medtronic), we will check action potential of
      cavernous nerve, bulbocavernosus reflex and pudendal nerve somatosensory evoked potential in
      real time during robot assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy for preservation of
      erectile function. In this feasibility and protocol setting phase I/II study, we will
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of pelvic autonomic nerve monitoring and mapping using
      NIM-Eclipse monitoring instrument.
