  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ultrasound-guided supraclavicular brachial plexus block (US-SCBPB) has been a generalized
      regional anesthesia in upper extremity surgery. It is performed just above the clavicle, in
      which the neural cluster formed by the trunks or divisions of the brachial plexus is situated
      superolateral to the subclavian artery (SA).

      In many approaches, corner pocket approach [deposit local anesthetic (LA) at the intersection
      of the SA, neural cluster, and the first rib] and cluster approach (direct deposit LA into
      the neural cluster after penetration of the sheath of brachial plexus) has been well known
      methods. And single or multiple injection techniques has been used with the above approaches.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In clinical practices, the investigators observed that the neural cluster was shown
      differently every person on the ultrasound image. Some neural cluster is shown as a typical
      round cluster of grapes lateral to the SA, in which, any approaches of US-SCBPB can be
      possible and good success rates are anticipated. But in many cases, neural cluster was shown
      in part lateral or superolateral to the SA like slightly-hated SA on the ultrasound image,
      and it passes posterior to the SA when the probe follows the path of the neural cluster along
      the SA. In that case, corner pocket approach is hard to apply due to the position of the
      neural cluster far away from the first rib, cluster approach increases chance of lopsided
      spreading of the LA, and multiple injection is also hard to apply due to narrow-shaped neural
      cluster. Therefore, we hypothesized that double injection in different plane (we call this
      new approach as a 2 plane-2 injection approach) would achieve an effect of a
      &quot;tridimensionally administered LA&quot;, which is presented like shortening the onset time or
      increasing rate of all four nerves block compared with the existing cluster approach (the
      investigators call this as an 1 plane- 1 injection approach in this study).

    <description>subcutaneous injection is done widely. A nerve stimulating needle (Stimuplex insulated needle; D Plus B. Braun, Melsungen, Germany) attached to a nerve stimulator (Stimuplex HNS12; B. Braun, Melsungen, Germany) is advanced via an ultrasound in-plane approach. After the needle is penetrated the nerve sheath with a direction of downward, the nerve stimulator is then turned on. If hand muscle twitching is observed even at 0.3 mA, LA 15 mL (lidocaine mixed with epinephrine) is injected. After that, the stimulating needle is re-advanced at the behind site of the initial puncture site. And the needle is penetrated the nerve sheath with a direction of upward, and then the same process is performed and LA 15 mL is injected.</description>

    <description>After subcutaneous injection of 1 mL of 2% lidocaine, a nerve stimulating needle (Stimuplex insulated needle; D Plus B. Braun, Melsungen, Germany) attached to a nerve stimulator (Stimuplex HNS12; B. Braun, Melsungen, Germany) is advanced via an ultrasound in-plane approach from lateral to medial direction. After the needle is penetrated the nerve sheath, the nerve stimulator is then turned on, and the stimulation current starts at 0.5mA. If hand muscle twitching is observed even at 0.3 mA, local anesthetics 30 mL (lidocaine mixed with epinephrine) is injected.</description>
