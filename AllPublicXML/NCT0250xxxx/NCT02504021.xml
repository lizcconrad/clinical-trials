    <textblock>
      A randomized clinical trial for patients with end stage renal disease in which a family
      consultation condition is compared against a treatment as usual control condition on the
      hospital readmissions after 1 month as the primary outcome variable.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients hospitalized at Henry For Hospital who have end stage renal disease will complete
      baseline questionnaires and be randomized into the experimental or control condition.
      Patients randomized into the experimental condition will have a single family consultation
      session before the patient is discharged. A trained, master's level therapist will conduct
      the family consultation, which will use education, motivational interviewing, and other
      techniques to help the family engage and support the patient's health needs. Patients in both
      the experimental and control conditions will complete follow up questionnaires 1 month after
      discharge. Investigators will conduct chart reviews of outcome data, including readmissions,
      at 1, 3, and 6 months post-discharge.

    <description>The family consultation will be one, 1-hour session conducted by trained, master's level therapists. The goals of the meetings are: a) Review patient and family understanding of events that caused the hospital admission; b) increase family awareness of the level of cognitive impairment that the patient is experiencing; c) discuss ways the family can get involved and help the patient with their medication and dialysis adherence; d) use motivational interviewing techniques as needed. This will be provided in addition to the usual care that inpatients receive in this unit.</description>
