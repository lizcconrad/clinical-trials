  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition of patients on admission to hospitals are estimated to be as high as 60%,
      although the prevalence varies between countries. The impact of malnutrition on patient
      recovery and discharge is severe, with extensive cost implications. This study aims to assess
      the prevalence of at risk for malnutrition among adult patients admitted to hospital across 3
      countries on the African continent.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of malnutrition on admission to hospital varies between 15-60%. Knowing the
      extent of the problem and identifying at-risk patients should be a priority task since
      malnutrition is associated with increased hospital-related complications; longer length of
      stay, increased costs related to treatment and higher mortality. Post discharge, malnourished
      patients have also been linked to more frequent re-admissions, higher morbidity and
      mortality. Various screening tools are available, including the Nutrition Risk Screening-2002
      recommended by European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism as the preferred
      screening tool for malnutrition in hospitals in Europe. ASPEN recommends a more comprehensive
      evaluation and diagnosis procedure. In South Africa, and the rest of Africa, nutritional
      screening is not routinely done and the investigators do not have any reliable national
      statistics indicating the extent of the problem. The aim of this study is to determine the
      prevalence of malnutrition on admission to hospital and to identify the impact thereof on
      relevant outcomes. Two different internationally recognised tools will be used and validated
      for the African context. In this multi-country, multi-centre descriptive cross-sectional
      study 3 hospitals in South Africa, 1 in Ghana and 2 in Kenya will be included. Adult patients
      (n=400 per hospital) will be screened on admission and at discharge and relevant outcomes
      (in-hospital and 3-month post-discharge) will be charted. A 50% sub-sample will be used to
      validate the 2 instruments.

    <description>Baseline (Admission) data will be gathered during to the first 48 hours after hospital admission.

    <measure>Association between risk for malnutrition and in-hospital and post-discharge nutritional / medical indicators</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; day 28 and Day 90</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline (Admission) data will be gathered during to the first 48 hours after hospital admission. Discharge data (Day 28) is collected on day of actual discharge or on day 28 of hospitalization if patient is staying in hospital longer than that. Post discharge data will be gathered 3 months after hospital discharge i.e. day 90 (again within a 48 hour period). Nutritional indications refer to weight changes (gain or loss) and changes in appetite (improved, no change or decreased). Medical indicators refer to nr of new complications requiring medical treatment, mortality or re-hospital admission.A NRS-2002 score greater than 3 indicates risk for malnutrition.</description>

    <description>Baseline (Admission) data will be gathered during to the first 48 hours after hospital admission. Discharge data (Day 28) is collected on day of actual discharge or on day 28 of hospitalization if patient is staying in hospital longer than that. A good validity will be indicated by a sensitivity and specificity of more than 80%.</description>
