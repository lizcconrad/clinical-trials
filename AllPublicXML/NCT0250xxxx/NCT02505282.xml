    <textblock>
      Postural hypotension is common in older people, leading to falls, decline in function, and
      dependence. Available treatments have limited efficacy and tolerability; novel approaches to
      treatment are therefore needed. Decreased vascular health, stiffening of the arteries and
      consequent decreased vascular reactivity are thought to contribute to postural hypotension
      and are therefore therapeutic targets.

      Recent trial evidence has suggested that vitamin K may exert beneficial effects on vascular
      health particularly in respect to inhibiting calcification. Calcification increases vascular
      stiffness, decreases compliance and thus decreases the ability of blood vessels to
      autoregulate blood pressure and flow - which could contribute to postural drops in blood
      pressure. Worsened vascular health could also impact adversely on baroceptor function, which
      is needed for blood pressure autoregulation and which is disrupted in patients with
      orthostatic hypotension.

      Vitamin K intake is below recommended daily intake in 60% of adults in the UK. In animals,
      vitamin K supplementation may be able to reverse calcification of arteries, and in humans
      Vitamin K has been shown to arrest decline in carotid artery elasticity compared to placebo.
      High levels of circulating vitamin K were also associated with lower levels of CRP in the
      Framingham cohort, suggesting a possible role in the suppression of chronic inflammation that
      is known to accompany vascular disease. The recent ECKO study suggested that vitamin K may
      reduce falls and fractures; an intriguing question that follows on from this is whether this
      could be due to beneficial effects on vascular health and postural hypotension, leading to
      less dizziness and reduced falls.

      This cross-sectional comparative study aims to find whether there is a difference in the
      vitamin K status of patients with postural hypotension compared to those without postural
      hypotension and whether differences in vitamin K status are associated with other markers of
      vascular function in patients with and without postural hypotension. This could potentially
      lead to new treatments for the condition for which there is currently little of proven
      benefit.
