  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how female hemophilia A carriers respond to a
      medication called DDAVP (Desmopressin).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      DDAVP (Desmopressin) is commonly used in the treatment of persons with bleeding disorders
      such as hemophilia, von Willebrand disease, or qualitative platelet disorders to help them
      clot better. The investigator wants to assess the increase in the subjects' clotting factors
      in response to intravenous DDAVP (Desmopressin) and the levels of these internal clotting
      factors will be measured at different times after the medication is given. The investigator
      will compare the response to DDAVP (Desmopressin) in adult hemophilia A carriers to women
      with a diagnosis of qualitative platelet dysfunction.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of subjects that achieve and sustain &gt;50% increase in Factor VIII antigen levels</measure>
    <time_frame>240 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>After administration of intravenous Desmopressin (DDAVP) at 0.3mcg/kg, the percentage of subjects that achieve and sustain Factor VIII antigen (FVIII:C) levels &gt;50% at 240 minutes as compared to baseline will be recorded. The levels of Factor VIII antigen (FVIII:C) will be measured using a one-stage assay. The laboratory response between carriers and the control group will be compared and the percentage of subjects that have greater than a 2-fold response from baseline and sustainment of Factor VIII antigen (FVIII:C) &gt;50% at 240 minutes will be recorded. A lower percent of hemophilia A carriers who maintain levels of Factor VIII antigen (FVIII:C) &gt;50% at 240 minutes indicates that the laboratory response and sustainment of Factor VIII antigen (FVIII:C) in response to Desmopressin (DDAVP) in adult hemophilia A carriers is reduced as compared to the control group.</description>
