  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a highly heterogeneous and lethal pathological process
      with limited therapeutic options, which is the most common and severe of the idiopathic
      interstitial pneumonias (IIPs). During the past 20 years, the incidence of IPF increased
      significantly. Most of IPF patients show a median survival time of 2-3 years after diagnosis.
      Five-year survival rate is 30%-50%. It's difficult to diagnose in the early stage of IPF.
      Once the patients go to hospital, it's already in the late stage. Now there is no effective
      therapy except lung transplant for IPF in clinical application.

      Acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (AE-IPF) is a fatal condition with high
      mortality (over 80%). Its etiology and pathogenesis remain unknown. There is a lack of
      effective treatment for it. Based on the investigators' long-term clinical observation, most
      cases of AE-IPF initially got &quot;common cold&quot; and had coryza, more cough, nasal
      obstruction，rhinorrhea, sore throat, some patients had fever, headache, and etc. Some of
      these patients' condition developed very rapidly and then became very severe similar to the
      situation of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Why these AE-IPF patients were so
      hypersensitive to &quot;cold&quot;? What were the immunologic and pathological mechanisms of their lung
      lesions after patients exposed to &quot;common cold&quot;? How to effectively offer interventional
      treatment for AE-IPF? All the above questions are yet to be explained clearly.

      In the investigators' previous retrospective study, the investigators found that there were
      some obviously imbalanced immune responses in IPF patients, including increased cluster of
      differentiation 4 (CD4) T cell population, immunoglobulin and complements. The investigators
      also found highly expressed inflammatory cytokines (IL-17, MIG and IL-9) and high detection
      rates of pathogens in AE-IPF patients, especially serum immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody of
      some respiratory virus. These findings provide a strong suggestion that there are some
      imbalance of immunologic function in IPF and there are relationship between AE-IPF and
      infection, especially &quot;Cold&quot; virus infection might be a key trigger for AE-IPF.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      IPF has become the focus of study in the area of pulmonary fibrosis, accounting for over 25%
      of all interstitial lung diseases (ILD) 1 and over 60% of all idiopathic interstitial
      pneumonia (IIP). The past 20 years have observed the remarkable tendency of increase of IPF
      incidence, accompanied by only 2-3 years of medium survival after diagnosis and 30-50% of
      5-year survival2. Due to limited diagnosis method at early stage of the disease, the patients
      are most likely diagnosed only when they reach middle or late stage. Other issue is lack of
      effective treatment, except for lung transplantation. Most of the deaths are caused by acute
      exacerbation, which is defined by clinicians as acute exacerbation of IPF (AE-IPF) and
      characterized by the rapid deterioration during relatively stable period of IPF (Stable-IPF).
      Exacerbation may occur at all stages of IPF development (see the below figure) and is
      accompanied by hazardous and quick development, high mortality and very poor prognosis.

      The incidence and mortality of AE-IPF varies in different studies. Kubo etc. reported that
      acute exacerbation occurs within 3 years in around 57% of IPF patients, with the mortality of
      53%. Study by Kim etc. show that the mortality of AE-IPF reaches 78%. Study by Song
      etc.demonstrated that the incidence of acute exacerbation of IPF is 35.4%, with over 50% of
      in-hospital morality, 56% of 1-year mortality and 18.4% of 3-year mortality. Other studies
      showed that 1-year post-exacerbation mortality is nearly 100%. Data based on the 178
      in-hospital IPF patients in the investigators' department during the latest 4 years showed
      that 58% (102/178) of those patients experienced acute exacerbation at certain stage of
      disease, with 70 deaths occurred. Among those deaths, 56 cases (83%) were caused by acute
      exacerbation. It is clear that the high incidence and mortality of AE-IPF is the most
      essential factors impacting the survival and quality of life of IPF patients, therefore lead
      to the poor prognosis of IPF.

      Hypothesis and key scientific questions Based on analysis above, the investigators propose
      the following hypothesis: certain level of immunological imbalance exists in those relatively
      stable IPF patients, making them susceptible to infection by various pathogens. Once
      infected, especially by viruses (e.g. common cold related viruses), AE-IPF can be quickly
      triggered, leading to ARDS-like reaction. To validate this hypothesis, four key scientific
      questions need to be answered by studies with scrupulous design: 1) what are the
      characteristic changes of immunological function in IPF/AE-IPF patients so as to make the
      patients more susceptible to common cold viruses? 2) What kind of pathogens, especially those
      common cold viruses, are the key triggering factors during the development of AE-IPF? 3) What
      kind of inflammatory cascade reaction occurs in AE-IPF leading to ARDS-like prompt
      development of pulmonary inflammation? Key research direction and scientific rationale In
      order to address the key scientific questions above, the investigators will conduct
      comprehensive studies based on detailed screen and analysis of large amount of clinical
      cases, integrated research methods in such areas as immunology, molecular, cytology and
      animal model, as well as high throughput data collection and big data analysis: 1) Extensive
      screening and identification of those pathogens closely related with AE-IPF; 2) Comprehensive
      analysis of the change of immunology function, focusing on the pathological-physiological
      alteration in virus induced immunologic imbalance in IPF, as well as the characteristic
      changes in relevant cytological signal transduction, so as to identify important AE-IPF
      bio-markers and explain the pathological molecular mechanism and network of ARDS-like
      inflammatory cascade reaction, which will be significant efforts in terms of prevention of
      AE-IPF, reduction of mortality, improvement of quality of life, delaying of disease
      progression and increase of survival.

      Similar clinical deterioration like AE-IPF will also occur in almost all the other types of
      pulmonary fibrosis, especially connective tissue disease-ILD (CTD-ILD), nonspecific
      interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), drug induced ILD, fibrotic allergic pneumonia and cryptogenic
      organizing pneumonia (COP) etc. Therefore, this program will also provide insight into the
      basic research and clinical management of acute exacerbation of other interstitial lung
      diseases, which is one common problem extensively exists in the area of interstitial lung
      disease and the key factor in terms of improving patients' quality of life and survival.
