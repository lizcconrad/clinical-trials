  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to see if tetrabenazine, which is commonly used to
      treat Huntington's Disease (HD), reduces the problems of impulsivity that are common in
      patients with HD. Investigators will also see how the medicine affects aspects of thinking
      and mood.

      This study is an open-label assessment of behavioral symptoms including depression,
      impulsivity, and suicidal ideations in patients prior to, and after, taking a stable dose of
      TBZ for Huntington's disease. All subjects will be evaluated with tests of depression (Beck
      Depression Scale), impulsivity (QUIP, BIS-11, and computerized impulsivity scales), and
      suicidal ideation (Columbia Suicide Scale) as a safety measure before they actually start
      taking TBZ. Since there is a significant lack of awareness of emotional and cognitive
      symptoms (anosagnosia) in patients with HD, collateral sources will be asked to fill out
      similar questionnaires based on their knowledge and observation of the patient. Patients and
      collaterals will be asked to return to the clinic for an identical evaluation plus adverse
      events, after they have been on a stable dose of TBZ for 4 weeks, which would be 8 Â± 1 week
      after initiating TBZ. Patients will be titrated over 3-5 weeks to best dose as determined by
      the investigator, up to a maximum of 75 mg/day. As patients are titrating, there will be
      several telephone contacts conducted. The initial dose will be 12.5 mg BID. Best dose will be
      largely determined by adverse events and subjective efficacy. Determination of best dose will
      include two scheduled phone calls and others as needed. Other medications will remain stable
      between visits.
