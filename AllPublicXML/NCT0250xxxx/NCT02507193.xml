      The primary objective of this study will be to evaluate the functional outcome of patients
      who present with a distal fibula fracture who were treated with either intermedullary nail
      (IMN) fixation or plate fixation.

      The primary objective of this study will be to evaluate the functional outcome of patients
      who present with a distal fibula fracture who were treated with either intermedullary nail
      (IMN) fixation or plate fixation. This objective will be accomplished using the
      Olerud-Molander score, a commonly accepted functional outcome score used to evaluate patients
      post-operatively who have undergone foot and ankle procedures. It is a survey that evaluates
      patient reported outcomes including pain, stiffness, swelling, stair climbing, running,
      jumping, squatting, use of supports, and work/activities of daily living (ADL) level. It does
      not involve physician-measured outcomes. The best possible score is a total of 100. Patients
      will be given a form to complete throughout follow-up and be utilized for data analysis.
      Functional outcome will be analyzed with regards to type of fracture, gender, cause of
      fracture, and affected side to determine if these factors are responsible for any difference.

    <description>This surgical intervention is performed using an intermedullary nail. Under general anesthesia, an incision is made at the site of the break or injury, and the fracture is carefully reduced. The nail in inserted through the medullary canal after proper imaging for accurate placement. The incision is closed with staples or stitches. Acumed fibula nail will be used.</description>
