  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to test the hypothesis that Speed of Information Processing
      (SIP) deficits in acquired brain injury (ABI) can be remediated. The majority of individuals
      with acquired brain injuries have speed of information processing deficits as part of the
      cognitive sequelae of the brain injury. Empirical research is expected to demonstrate the
      efficacy of computerized cognitive Speed of Information Processing (SIP) training in
      individuals with ABI.

      Study participants will be asked to attend two study visits over the course of approximately
      13 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the experimental or control group.

      The specific aims of the current research protocol are as follows: Aim 1: To test the
      hypothesis that SIP training of individuals with ABI will improve processing speed. This
      study is expected to demonstrate that individuals with ABI that receive SIP training will
      improve on neurocognitive measures of processing speed. Aim 2: To test the generalizability
      of SIP training of individuals with TBI to other cognitive domains beyond information
      processing speed. This study is expected to demonstrate increases in working memory,
      attention and executive functioning in the group that receives the cognitive training. Aim 3:
      To test the hypothesis that SIP training of individuals with TBI will improve mood. This
      study is expected to demonstrate that self-reported levels of depression will improve in the
      group that receives cognitive training. Aim 4: To examine if changes in the neural integrity
      of white matter pathways of the brain occur in individuals that undergo the SIP training.

      All participants will undergo a set of baseline cognitive exams/tests, which will take
      approximately two hours. Participants will be randomly placed in either the experimental
      group or the control group. The experimental group will undergo approximately 40 hours of
      training on the Brain Fitness Program over an eight week period. The control group will be
      contacted once a week for eight weeks about their cognitively stimulating activities (i.e.
      reading, working on the computer, and puzzles). At approximately the thirteenth week
      participants from both groups will undergo post-baseline cognitive exams/tests. This
      evaluation will take approximately two hours. In addition there is an optional neuroimaging
      study which participants may elect to participate in. Participants who agree to take part in
      the neuroimaging portion of the study will undergo a baseline MRI scan. At approximately 13
      weeks later participants will undergo a post-baseline MRI scan. Both scans will take
      approximately one hour.

    <description>1) The Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT), which is designed to assess complex mental manipulation by adding the two most recent numbers that are presented auditorily. 2) The Symbol Digit Coding subtest of the CNS-Vital Signs neurocognitive battery, which requires the examinee to type and respond as quickly as possible the appropriate number that matches the special symbol. 3) The Stroop subtest of the CNS-Vital Signs neurocognitive battery: The Stroop Test has three parts to it. A) Read the word that is a name of a color as quickly as possible within 90 seconds. B) Name the color of ink that four X's as quickly as possible within 90 seconds. C) Name the color of the ink that the word is written in. The word is a color of ink that is incongruent to the color of the print. The participant is required to name as many inks as possible within 90 seconds.</description>
