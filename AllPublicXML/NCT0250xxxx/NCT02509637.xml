  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bronchiectasis is characterized pathologically by the abnormal and permanent dilation of
      bronchi caused mainly by the perpetuation of inflammation and impaired clearance of
      secretions. Physical therapy is essential in the treatment of these patients, using its
      various techniques and devices. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impedance of the
      respiratory system, by impulse oscillometry, after breathing exercises with chest compression
      or flutter in patients with bronchiectasis, considering that there are no results in the
      literature on the effect of these techniques in the small airways of these patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bronchiectasis patients and healthy subjects will be evaluated before and after a 30 minutes
      session of control, breathing exercises with flutter valve, that is a device that produces
      oscillation and positive pressure during the expiratory phase, or chest compression, that is
      a manual manoeuvre in the right and left sides of the lower chest, all of them in a sitting
      position. The main outcome will be obtained by impulse oscillometry, that is a method to
      access large and small airways, to evaluate the resistance (R), reactance (X), reactance area
      (AX) and resonant frequency (Fres) of respiratory system for the whole breath and for
      inspiratory and expiratory phase. Additionally, will be analysed the dyspnea using the
      Medical Research Council scale; acceptability and tolerability scale; pulse oxymetry;
      difficulty of expectoration score; and volume, adhesivity and purulence of sputum.

    <measure>Difficulty sputum</measure>
    <time_frame>In the primary evaluation, and after seven and fourteen days.</time_frame>
    <description>Patients inform the ease or difficulty in expectoration in accordance with a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 = no difficulty and 5 = extremely difficult. (Burioka, 1998). The scale will be applied at baseline and always after the intervention to assess whether there is difference in the difficulty of sputum between sessions.</description>

    <description>30 minutes after the treatment session or control, patients will complete scales 1-7, 1: extremely and 7: none) on usefulness, ease to understand the instructions, easy to perform the exercises, degree of fatigue and discomfort (adapted EATON, 2007).</description>

    <measure>Dyspnea scale:</measure>
    <time_frame>In the primary evaluation, and after seven and fourteen days.</time_frame>
    <description>Dyspnea will be evaluated across the range Medical Research Council (MRC) for use in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in Brazil. The MRC scale comprises only five items, and the patient chooses the item corresponding to as dyspnea limits their activities of daily living. The patient reports its subjective degree of dyspnea choosing a value ranging from 1 to 5, with 1 (only suffers from shortness of breath during intense exercise), 2 (suffers from shortness of breath when walking briskly or climbing a slight slope) 3 (walks slower than people of the same age because of breathlessness or has to stop for breath even when walking slowly), 4 (stops for breath after walking less than 100 m or after a few minutes) and 5 (feel so short of breath that does not go over the house, or feel short of breath when getting dressed) (KOLEVIS et al., 2008).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adhesiveness of expectorated secretion:</measure>
    <time_frame>In the primary evaluation, and after seven and fourteen days.</time_frame>
    <description>Immediately after the separation of secretion with saliva, mucus will be evaluated for its adhesion award a note according to visual scale described by Lopez-Vidriero et al., 1973. Test samples giving the adhesive index between 1 (fully adhered) and 2 (small movement under gravity) will be classified as adhesive and between 3 (slow moving mass) and 4 (easy handling) will be classified as non-adhesive.</description>

    <description>After initial evaluation, the subjects will perform breathing exercises with quiet inspiration and prolonged expiration on the device for thirty minutes, with breaks of one minute every four minutes. Immediately after the exercise will be performed new assessment against Impulse Oscillometry. Then patients will be kept for 30 minutes at rest and at the end will be applied the acceptability and tolerance scale and a third evaluation with Impulse Oscillometry.

    <intervention_name>Flutter</intervention_name>
    <description>Flutter is a small device, simple, like a plastic pipe with a mouthpiece at one end and a perforated cover on the other, containing a steel ball resting in a plastic cone inside. When the patient exhales through the flutter expiratory flow causes movement of the ball, creating an oscillatory positive pressure.</description>

    <description>Manual chest compression is based on the application of forces resulting from the action of respiratory muscles or physiotherapist manual action in order to increase the alveolar pressure creating a pressure gradient to promote change in pulmonary flow and volume.It consists of vigorous compression of the chest at the beginning of expiration or during expiration.</description>

    <description>For this measure will be used IOS Jaeger (Jaeger, Wurzburg, Germany). to minimize the effect of the bad positioning of the tongue will use a mouth &quot;free-flow&quot;, which contains a depressant for keeping the tongue in the mouth soil, stabilizing it and reducing oral resistance. Volunteers will support hands firmly on the cheeks to reduce the effect of oscillation thereof. The measures will be carried out with the volunteer sitting, using nasal, relaxed and your head in neutral clip, breathing normally through the mouthpiece to his lips tightly sealed to prevent air leaks.</description>
