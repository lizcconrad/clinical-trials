    <textblock>
      Prognostic factors in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) are currently mainly based on
      clinical factors (disease extension, perianal involvement, need for surgery, use of
      immunomodulators…). All of immunological markers (or serological) of IBD have a diagnostic
      role in indeterminate colitis (ulcerative colitis vs crohn's disease) but they never have
      been considered as predictors of IBD course in adults. Among the most used, anti-neutrophil
      cytoplasm antibodies (ANCA) and Anti-Saccaromyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) allow the
      distinction between ulcerative colitis (ANCA+/ASCA-) and Crohn's disease (ANCA-/ASCA+), and
      their combined use has a sensitivity and a specificity of about 85%. However, 10 other
      antibodies have been identified and recently evaluated individually in IBD and especially in
      pediatric Crohn's disease: anti-ompC, anti-I2, anti-flagellins, anti-glycan
      (anti-laminaribioside carbohydrate antibodies (ALCA), anti-mannobioside carbohydrate
      antibodies (AMCA), anti-chitobioside carbohydrate antibody (ACCA), anti-chitin and
      anti-laminarin), anti-goblet cells and anti-C.albicans specific mannans antibodies. These
      complementary tests improve the reliability of the diagnosis. In a previous cross-sectional
      work on a cohort of 195 IBD patients, the investigator showed a prognostic role of some of
      anti-glycan Abs and especially a correlation with a pejorative form of the disease both in
      Crohn's disease than in Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and a prediction of corticodependency in IBD.

      There is few data on the stability of these antibodies, most of the studies are
      cross-sectional. There are conflicting results among scarce longitudinal data. One study
      reported a negativation of anti-glycan antibodies in some cases but not of ASCA or ANCA.

      On the cohort of 195 patients included in the first study, the investigator would like to
      assess at 3 years the immunological profiles of these patients and thus to compare them. In
      case of modification of the serological status for some antibodies, the search for associated
      factors (clinical, biological or therapeutic) will be performed. In case of sero-negativation
      of anti-glycan antibodies, this could be linked with a decrease or a normalization of the
      increased intestinal permeability in IBD. Indeed, in this subgroup of patients, we will test
      this hypothesis by analyzing intestinal permeability in anti-glycan positive group on the 2
      samples and in the group with a sero-negativation on the second sample.

    <description>Immunological status is defined by anti-glycan antibodies (ACCA, ALCA, AMCA, anti-chitin and anti-laminarin), ASCA and ANCA.
Antibody will be positive if level is found higher than the threshold defined by the laboratory (technical threshold).
An antibody will be defined as stable if its status remains positive during 3 years(above the detection limit given by the reference laboratory) or negative during 3 years (below the detection limit given by the reference laboratory). Conversely, the lack of stability during 3 years will be defined as the transition from a positive to a negative status or inversely.</description>

    <description>Comparison of clinical remission between patients with a change in their immunological status and patients with stable status.
A patient is in clinical remission if:
Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) score is lower than 150 for Crohn's disease
Lichtiger score is &lt; 4 for Ulcerative Colitis</description>

    <description>Comparison of mucosal healing between patients with a change in their immunological status and patients with stable status.
A patient will be considered in mucosal healing if:
C-reactive Protein (CRP) &lt; 5mg/L and fecal calprotectin &lt;250 µg/g
Fecal calprotectin &lt;150 µg/g in Ulcerative colitis</description>

    <description>Comparison of intestinal permeability between patients with a change in their immunological status and patients with stable status.
4. Normalization of intestinal permeability will be defined if lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or anti-LPS Antibodies (IgG) level measured by LAL or ELISA is significantly reduced between the two samples. As there is no pre-defined threshold for LPS and anti-LPS Antibodies level in normalization of intestinal permeability, we will calculate a delta (level before - level at 3 years) for each patient and each parameter. We will analyze the average delta with the stability or not of immunological status.</description>
