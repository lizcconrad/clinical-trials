  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to adjust the amount of docetaxel participants receive based on
      the level of docetaxel measured in their blood. This method of dose adjustment is called
      pharmacokinetic (PK)-adjusted docetaxel. The researchers believe that adjusting the dose of
      docetaxel using this method will lessen the side effects associated with docetaxel in cancer
      treatment.

All participants will receive TC for cycle 1 with subsequent cycles repeated every 3 weeks for a total of 4 cycles. All initial dosing will be based on actual body weight and height. Participants will receive up to 4 doses of chemotherapy. Following their 4th dose of chemotherapy, or the last dose of chemotherapy in which blood level monitoring was performed, participants will be assessed for side effects from the chemotherapy and complete their final written 53 question survey about their quality of life.</description>
