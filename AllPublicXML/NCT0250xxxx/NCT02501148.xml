        Adults; either gender; requiring percutaneous intervention of an asymptomatic (&gt; 70%) or
        symptomatic (&gt;50%) internal carotid artery stenosis.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Documented stenotic atherosclerotic lesion located at carotid bifurcation and / or
             proximal internal carotid artery (ICA)

          -  Subject is either (A) symptomatic within 6 months of procedure, with an ipsilateral
             carotid stenosis ≥ 50% by angiography, or (B) asymptomatic with carotid stenosis ≥ 70%
             by angiography

          -  Target lesion can be covered by a single stent of no more than 40 mm in length

          -  Target lesion reference vessel diameter (RVD) is 4.0 mm - 7.0mm

          -  Sufficient landing zone required for successful deployment of integrated embolic
             protection filter

          -  Willing to comply with all follow-up required study visits

          -  Provision of written informed consent before index procedure

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Life expectancy of less than one year

          -  An evolving, acute or recent stroke within 14 days of study evaluation

          -  Acute myocardial infarction within 72 hours before procedure

          -  Known sensitivity to contrast media that cannot be adequately controlled with
             pre-medication

          -  Subject has a total occlusion of target carotid artery

          -  Subject has a previously place stent in ipsilateral carotid artery

          -  Severe circumferential lesion calcification that may restrict full deployment of
             carotid stent

          -  Presence of filling defect or thrombus in target vessel

          -  Presence of &quot;string sign&quot; of target vessel

          -  Carotid (intracranial) stenosis located distal to target lesion

          -  Greater than 50% stenosis of common carotid artery proximal to target lesion.

          -  Known mobile plaque in aortic arch
