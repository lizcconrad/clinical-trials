    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the analgesic efficacy and safety of intravenous 20 mg
      Hyoscine-N-Butylbromide versus placebo for the treatment of abdominal colic associated with
      acute gastroenteritis in the emergency department.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute gastroenteritis is a frequent cause of emergency department (ED) presentation.
      Mainstays of ED treatment are rehydration and antiemetics when needed. Since crampy abdominal
      pain accompanies (diarrhea) acute gastroenteritis in 67-90% of patients, emergency physicians
      may have to deal with spasmodic colics in these patients.

      Hyoscine-N-butylbromide (HNB), is an anticholinergic agent which has been in use as an
      antispasmodic agent for sixty years all over the world. It has been studied and revealed
      various efficacy for several conditions (e.g; biliary colic, renal colic, endoscopic
      interventions, radiologic interventions, during labor, nonspecific abdominal pain and
      irritable bowel syndrome).

      HNB is commonly used for symptomatic relief of abdominal cramps associated with acute
      gastroenteritis in the EDs, whereas the literature lacks evidence regarding its efficacy and
      safety for this condition.

      The aim of this study is to assess the analgesic efficacy and safety of intravenous 20 mg
      hyoscine-n-butylbromide versus placebo in patients with abdominal colic associated with acute
      gastroenteritis in the emergency department.
