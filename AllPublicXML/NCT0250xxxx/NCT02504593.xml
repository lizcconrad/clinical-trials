    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to implement a new mobile interface that automatically reads and
      troubleshoots malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT) cassettes. This device, called a Deki
      reader (DR), will allow the investigators to establish an extensive quality assurance program
      of malaria diagnosis performed by trained community health volunteers (CHVs). The study will
      lease 10 DRs and rotate them amongst 200 CHVs performing community-based malaria diagnosis
      through rapid diagnostic testing. The study setting is Bungoma East subcounty and Kiminini
      subcounty in Kenya. The overall goal is to measure and improve the quality of malaria
      diagnosis by CHVs using malaria RDTs. The investigators aim for every CHW to exceed 90%
      sensitivity and specificity and zero operator errors within six months. There are no
      appreciable risks to the CHV associated with evaluation by the DR device. The investigators'
      analysis will focus on descriptive statistics of RDT use and accuracy amongst all
      participating CHVs.

    <description>The investigators propose to implement a new mobile interface that automatically reads and troubleshoots malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT) cassettes. This device, called a Deki reader (DR), will allow the investigators to establish an extensive quality assurance program of malaria diagnosis performed by trained community health volunteers (CHVs). To ensure high-quality diagnosis by CHVs, the study team will deploy 10 Fionet DRs and rotate them amongst 200 CHVs who have been trained to do RDTs. In the first phase, each CHV will use the device for 10 successive clients presenting themselves for malaria diagnosis to the CHV, and then the device will be rotated to another CHV.</description>
