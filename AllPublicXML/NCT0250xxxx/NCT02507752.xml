    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving an Improvement of at Least 0.22 Units in Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) is a 20-question instrument that assesses the degree of difficulty a person has in accomplishing tasks in 8 functional areas (dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reaching, gripping and activities of daily living). Responses in each functional area are scored from 0 to 3 (0=no difficulty and 3=inability to perform a task in that area). HAQ-DI total scores expressed as overall mean score with range 0-3: 0-0.25=normal functioning; 0.25-0.5=mild functional limitation; 0.5-1=moderate functional limitation; more than 1=significant functional limitation. The proportion of participants achieving a clinically important reduction of &gt;= 0.22 point in HAQ (disease-specific questionnaire) at Week 24 was evaluated. HAQ was assessed using the set of observed cases (OC) at each assessment time. An improvement of 0.22 units in HAQ-DI was considered to be a clinically significant improvement.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in the Short-Form (SF-36) Health Survey Physical Component Score and Mental Component Score at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>SF- 36 investigates the standard of quality of life through a general health assessment and not specific to a particular disease, age or treatment group. It is a 36-item questionnaire measuring 8 domains (physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role emotional, and mental health). Each domain score ranges from 0 (worst) to 100 (best), with higher scores reflecting better health-related functional status. Two summary scale scores were computed based on weighted combinations of the 8 domain scores: the Physical Component Summary and the Mental Component Summary. SF-36 was assessed using the set of observed cases (OC) at each assessment time.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Infusion Reactions, Infectious Events and / or Other Adverse Events in the 24 Weeks After the Start of Treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An infusion reaction is defined as an adverse event that occurs during infusion or within 24 hours after infusion of Rituximab. All infectious events, whether considered related or not to Rituximab, were collected for the safety analysis of the study. An adverse event is any untoward medical event that occurs in a participant administered an investigational product, and it does not necessarily indicate only events with clear causal relationship with the relevant investigational product.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Swollen Joint Count (SJC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>A swollen joint count is the most specific clinical method to quantify abnormalities in participants with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It reflects the amount of inflamed synovial tissue.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Tender Joint Count (TJC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>A tender joint count is the most specific clinical method to quantify abnormalities in participants with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is associated more with the level of pain.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Score 28 Joints (DAS28) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>DAS28 is calculated from the number of swollen joints and tender joints using the 28-joints count, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (millimeters per hour [mm/hr]) and Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity (participant-rated arthritis activity assessment) with transformed scores ranging 0 (minimum score) to 10 (maximum score); higher scores indicated greater affectation due to disease activity. A DAS28 score of less than or equal to (=&lt;) 3.2 = low disease activity, a DAS28 score of &gt;3.2 to 5.1 = moderate to high disease activity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Patient Global Assessment (100 mm VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Physician's Global Assessment of disease activity was assessed using a 0 to 100 mm horizontal visual analogue scale (VAS). The left-hand extreme of the line equals 0 mm, and is described as &quot;no disease activity&quot; (symptom-free and no arthritis symptoms) and the right-hand extreme equals 100 mm, as &quot;maximum disease activity&quot; (maximum arthritis disease activity).Change from Baseline = scores at observation minus score at Baseline. An increase in score from Baseline represented disease progression and/or joint worsening, no change represented halting of disease progression, and a decrease represented improvement.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving an Improvement of at Least 0.22 Units in Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) at Week 24</title>
        <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) is a 20-question instrument that assesses the degree of difficulty a person has in accomplishing tasks in 8 functional areas (dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reaching, gripping and activities of daily living). Responses in each functional area are scored from 0 to 3 (0=no difficulty and 3=inability to perform a task in that area). HAQ-DI total scores expressed as overall mean score with range 0-3: 0-0.25=normal functioning; 0.25-0.5=mild functional limitation; 0.5-1=moderate functional limitation; more than 1=significant functional limitation. The proportion of participants achieving a clinically important reduction of &gt;= 0.22 point in HAQ (disease-specific questionnaire) at Week 24 was evaluated. HAQ was assessed using the set of observed cases (OC) at each assessment time. An improvement of 0.22 units in HAQ-DI was considered to be a clinically significant improvement.</description>

        <description>SF- 36 investigates the standard of quality of life through a general health assessment and not specific to a particular disease, age or treatment group. It is a 36-item questionnaire measuring 8 domains (physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role emotional, and mental health). Each domain score ranges from 0 (worst) to 100 (best), with higher scores reflecting better health-related functional status. Two summary scale scores were computed based on weighted combinations of the 8 domain scores: the Physical Component Summary and the Mental Component Summary. SF-36 was assessed using the set of observed cases (OC) at each assessment time.</description>

        <description>An infusion reaction is defined as an adverse event that occurs during infusion or within 24 hours after infusion of Rituximab. All infectious events, whether considered related or not to Rituximab, were collected for the safety analysis of the study. An adverse event is any untoward medical event that occurs in a participant administered an investigational product, and it does not necessarily indicate only events with clear causal relationship with the relevant investigational product.</description>

The left-hand extreme of the line equals 0 mm, and is described as “no disease activity” (symptom-free and no arthritis symptoms) and the right-hand extreme equals 100 mm, as “maximum disease activity” (maximum arthritis disease activity).Change from Baseline = scores at observation minus score at Baseline. An increase in score from Baseline represented disease progression and/or joint worsening, no change represented halting of disease progression, and a decrease represented improvement.</description>

        <title>Change in HAQ Score From Screening to Weeks 12 and 24</title>
        <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) is a 20-question instrument that assesses the degree of difficulty a person has in accomplishing tasks in 8 functional areas (dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reaching, gripping and activities of daily living). Responses in each functional area are scored from 0 to 3 (0=no difficulty and 3=inability to perform a task in that area). HAQ-DI total scores expressed as overall mean score with range 0-3: 0-0.25=normal functioning; 0.25-0.5=mild functional limitation; 0.5-1=moderate functional limitation; more than 1=significant functional limitation. The number of participants achieving a clinically important reduction of &gt;= 0.22 point in HAQ (disease-specific questionnaire) at Week 24 was evaluated. HAQ was assessed using the set of observed cases (OC) at each assessment time. An improvement of 0.22 units in HAQ-DI was considered to be a clinically significant improvement.</description>

        <description>SF- 36 investigates the standard of quality of life through a general health assessment and not specific to a particular disease, age or treatment group. It is a 36-item questionnaire measuring 8 domains (physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role emotional, and mental health). Each domain score ranges from 0 (worst) to 100 (best), with higher scores reflecting better health-related functional status. Two summary scale scores were computed based on weighted combinations of the 8 domain scores: the Physical Component Summary and the Mental Component Summary. SF-36 was assessed using the set of observed cases (OC) at each assessment time.</description>

          <title>Change in SF-36 Domain Scores From Screening to Week (Wk) 12 and 24</title>
          <description>SF- 36 investigates the standard of quality of life through a general health assessment and not specific to a particular disease, age or treatment group. It is a 36-item questionnaire measuring 8 domains (physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role emotional, and mental health). Each domain score ranges from 0 (worst) to 100 (best), with higher scores reflecting better health-related functional status. Two summary scale scores were computed based on weighted combinations of the 8 domain scores: the Physical Component Summary and the Mental Component Summary. SF-36 was assessed using the set of observed cases (OC) at each assessment time.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving a Clinically Important Reduction of &gt;= 0.22 Point in HAQ Score at Week 12.</title>
        <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) is a 20-question instrument that assesses the degree of difficulty a person has in accomplishing tasks in 8 functional areas (dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reaching, gripping and activities of daily living). Responses in each functional area are scored from 0 to 3 (0=no difficulty and 3=inability to perform a task in that area). HAQ-DI total scores expressed as overall mean score with range 0-3: 0-0.25=normal functioning; 0.25-0.5=mild functional limitation; 0.5-1=moderate functional limitation; more than 1=significant functional limitation. The proportion of participants achieving a clinically important reduction of &gt;= 0.22 point in HAQ (disease-specific questionnaire) at Week 24 was evaluated. HAQ was assessed using the set of observed cases (OC) at each assessment time. An improvement of 0.22 units in HAQ-DI was considered to be a clinically significant improvement.</description>

        <description>SF- 36 investigates the standard of quality of life through a general health assessment and not specific to a particular disease, age or treatment group. It is a 36-item questionnaire measuring 8 domains (physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role emotional, and mental health). Each domain score ranges from 0 (worst) to 100 (best), with higher scores reflecting better health-related functional status. Two summary scale scores were computed based on weighted combinations of the 8 domain scores: the Physical Component Summary and the Mental Component Summary. SF-36 was assessed using the set of observed cases (OC) at each assessment time.</description>
