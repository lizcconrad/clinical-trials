  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non small cell lung cancer is the first cause of cancer related death in France and is
      becoming an increasing health problem in developing countries.

      Recently for patient with no progression disease after first line chemotherapy, new therapies
      were validated in maintenance (bevacizumab) or switch maintenance treatment (erlotinib,
      pemetrexed) with improved survival.

      Until now, determination of efficiency of treatment is only based on morphological response
      (RECIST) and remains inappropriate to such cytostatic drugs for which there is no anatomical
      lesion modification.

      Nuclear Medicine and especially 18-FDG Positron Emission Tomography (PET) offers a
      biologically relevant tool for assessment of tumour response therapies.

      The assumption of the study is that FDG PET would allow to earlier detect a lack of response,
      thereafter, to modify an ineffective treatment. Indeed, nowadays the treatment is maintained
      up to evidence of progression disease.

      However, despite the increasing use of FDG PET for predicting therapeutic response, there are
      no validated criteria for judging response of maintenance therapy in non-small cell lung
      cancer.

      It seems necessary to determine standardized criteria response, earlier during the course of
      maintenance therapy in patient with non small cell lung cancer.

      The final aim is to optimize survival by an adapted metabolic imaging guided therapy.

      The purpose of the study is to optimize survival by an adapted metabolic imaging therapy in
      patients with advances non-small cell lung cancer.

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the role of SUV and metabolic volume
      measured by FDG PETScan in the early prediction of treatment response.

      80 patients will be included in 2 years. They will be follow up for one year for monitoring
      the progression free survival.
