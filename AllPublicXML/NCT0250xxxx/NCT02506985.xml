      The trial is an open-label, randomized, trial examining novel biomarkers of thrombosis in
      patients managed with rivaroxaban vs. standard care following treatment of pulmonary embolism
      (PE) with catheter-guided alteplase. Patients &gt;18 years old who present with PE and are
      managed with catheter-guided alteplase will be screened for study inclusion. Patient's
      meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria will undergo informed consent. Immediately following
      completion of alteplase infusion, patients will be randomized to receipt of rivaroxaban 15 mg
      oral bid for 21 days followed by 20mg oral daily or continuation on unfractioned heparin or
      low-molecular weight heparin with initiation of warfarin adjusted to INR of 2-3. Blood
      samples will be taken within 2 hours of CDT completion prior to receipt of study treatment
      (study day 1), at 8h-12h, 24h, 48h, 5d (or prior to hospital discharge), and at 30 day
      follow-up. Clinical endpoints, including bleeding, evidence of thrombosis progression, and
      death will be tracked during index hospitalization and at follow-up 30 days post-discharge.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Catheter-guided alteplase has a growing role in the management of acute pulmonary embolism
      (PE). Following a 12-24 hour alteplase infusion (for bilateral or unilateral PE,
      respectively) patients are routinely managed with therapeutic unfractionated heparin (UFH) as
      a bridge to chronic warfarin therapy. It is our desire to study the effects of rivaroxaban
      vs. standard care following catheter-guided alteplase thrombolytic therapy (CDT) in patients
      with acute pulmonary embolism. Use of rivaroxaban may offer several important advantages
      compared to standard therapy in this setting. Among these is the potential for rivaroxaban to
      improve novel biomarkers of thrombosis including inhibition neutrophil extracellular traps
      (NETs), tissue factor-positive microparticles, and markers of inflammation. Neutrophil
      release of extracellular DNA may provide a scaffold upon which venous thrombosis propagates.
      NETs are associated with thrombus organization. Their dissolution may facilitate
      thrombolysis. Circulating DNA, a surrogate marker for NETs, is elevated 2-3 fold in patients
      with venous thromboembolism (VTE) and correlates strongly with plasma myeloperoxidase (MPO),
      an inflammatory marker of neutrophil and monocyte activation. The investigators have
      previously demonstrated that heparin can trigger MPO release from leukocytes. Thus, it is
      resonable to speculate that anti-Xa therapy may reduce inflammation, MPO, and NET levels in
      circulation. Further, the investigators have observed that catheter-directed thrombolysis may
      increase length of stay (time frame = 8 hours to 30 days following administration of study
      drugs) and the investigators would also propose treatment with rivaroxaban may balance this
      by eliminating a &quot;bridging&quot; period.
