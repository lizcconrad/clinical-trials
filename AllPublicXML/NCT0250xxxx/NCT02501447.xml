  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stress is known to trigger acute pain crisis of sickle cell disease (SCD). SCD is an
      inherited blood disorder that afflicts about 100,000 people in the United States, and is
      among the most common lethal genetic diseases in the United States. Though worldwide in
      distribution, in the US it is most commonly found in African Americans. Its best known
      complication is severe, recurrent relentless pain, often known as pain crisis. Non-drug
      treatment for SCD pain such as cognitive coping interventions have been shown to be effective
      for reducing SCD pain intensity, but they are complicated, multifaceted, and time-consuming.
      A simple and cost-effective alternative such as guided imagery (GI) could reduce the effect
      of stress on SCD pain. GI is an intervention where patients listen to and view audio-visual
      recordings while being directed to visualize themselves being immersed in that scene or
      scenario. There are no published studies on the use of GI as a simple stress coping
      intervention or tracking stress in a systematic manner as a trigger for SCD pain.

    <description>PAINReportIt® Composite pain index (CPI): A a multidimensional representation of pain calculated by averaging the individual proportional scores for each of the four pain dimensions: (1) number of pain sites; (2) pain intensity; (3) total pain rating index (from the McGill Pain Questionnaire [MPQ], pain quality); and (4) pain pattern score. the scores for the CPI range from 0 to 100. We estimated intervention effects using linear regression with bootstrapping.</description>

    <description>The guided relaxation (GR) intervention included a single 12-min GR video clip we administered to subjects at the baseline visit to determine the immediate effects of GR on stress and pain. The GR intervention also included six video clips, which ranged from 2 to 20 minutes in length to determine the short-term (2-week) effects of GR on stress and pain.</description>

    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>For the attention control group, subjects engaged in a 12-min computer-based discussion about their sickle cell disease (SCD) experience. The audio-taped questions and onscreen directions were programmed for self-administration. Subjects' responses were captured via the microphone so that Data Collectors were not involved in this discussion process, and it was equivalent to the guided relation activity.</description>
