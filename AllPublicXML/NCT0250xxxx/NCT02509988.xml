  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to assess whether a nutritional drink taken before conception and continuing
      through pregnancy, assists in the maintenance of healthy glucose metabolism in the mother and
      promotes offspring health.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is known that maternal insulin resistance and high blood glucose levels in early pregnancy
      alter the functioning of the placenta in ways that persistently affect the supply of
      nutrients and fat in the unborn baby. There is an increasing focus on the need to optimise
      preconception nutrition but as yet, limited preconception interventions that are recognized
      as promoting health for the mother and her child.

      The Investigators will recruit up to 1800 women, aged 18-38 years, who are planning a
      pregnancy in the United Kingdom, Singapore and New Zealand. The participants will be randomly
      allocated to receive the standard nutritional drink or the study nutritional drink. Women who
      conceive between one and twelve months after starting the nutritional drink will be followed
      through pregnancy and studied with their babies for the first year after delivery. Various
      testing will be carried out at relevant time points. Mothers will undergo blood, urine, hair
      and cheek swab sampling, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans along with body
      measurements and health and lifestyle questionnaires. Infants will undergo hair, cheek swab,
      urine and stool sampling along with body measurements, measurements of body composition and a
      DXA scan.

      The data collected will allow identification of the contributions of nutritional and
      lifestyle factors, social and economic status, ethnicity, genetics and metabolomics and gut
      microbes to maintaining healthy glucose metabolism in pregnancy and promoting healthy growth,
      body composition and wellbeing in the children.
