  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kennedy disease is an inherited neuromuscular disorder that is characterized by progressive
      muscle wasting and weakness. It typically starts with muscle spasms and tremors in the arms,
      followed by muscle weakness and atrophy of muscles in the arms and legs. The facial and
      bulbar muscles are also involved. However, the muscle involvement pattern has not been
      investigated systemically in Kennedy disease.

      The primary aim of the study is to investigate the muscle involvement in patients with
      Kennedy disease using MRI. Secondary aims are to examine disease severity and to test MRI as
      a potential outcome measure for future clinical trials in Kennedy disease.

      Approximately 40 patients with Kennedy disease and 20 gender and age matched healthy
      voluntary controls will be recruited. The study consists of one visit per subject lasting 4-5
      hours.
