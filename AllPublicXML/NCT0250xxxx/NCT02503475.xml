    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Stanford Center for Back Pain is to investigate and characterize the
      mechanisms of four treatments for chronic low back pain. These interventions (research
      treatment) include real-time fMRI neurofeedback, mindfulness based stress reduction,
      cognitive behavioral therapy, and acupuncture treatment. The investigators plan to
      characterize both mechanisms of treatment effects and efficacy.

      The Stanford Center for Back Pain establishes a collaborative, multidisciplinary research
      program to investigate CAM interventions for the treatment of chronic low back pain (CLBP).
      The investigators' overall goal is to characterize the shared and distinct mechanisms of four
      CAM interventions and translate the investigators' findings to tailored and effective
      treatments for CLBP. CLBP is a highly prevalent and difficult-to-treat condition for which
      many patients seek CAM therapies. Basic science has revealed that abnormalities in central
      pain modulatory and emotion regulatory systems play a crucial role in CLBP. What is not clear
      is how CAM therapies alter the functioning of the brain systems involved in chronic pain. The
      Stanford Center for Back Pain aims to fill this gap by conducting 3 projects, each aiming at
      elucidating mechanisms underlying different CAM therapies for CLBP.

      Project 1 will focus on a promising novel alternative therapy for CLBP real-time fMRI
      neurofeedback which trains patients to control specific neural processes that lead to
      improvements in pain. Project 2 will characterize the pain modulatory and emotion regulatory
      effects of mindfulness based stress reduction and cognitive behavioral therapy for CLBP.
      Project 3 will characterize psychophysical and neuroimaging based neural mechanisms
      underlying verum and placebo acupuncture.

      The Stanford Center for Back Pain will provide optimal collaboration and synergy within a
      multidisciplinary framework to identify mechanisms of CAM therapies for CLBP so that they can
      eventually translate them into enhance clinical care of CLBP.

    <description>Real-Time fMRI: AR, CR, Sham, and Free Strategy groups will be compared to determine the following:
(1) whether a cognitive strategy improves rtfMRI neurofeedback to modulate brain activity and pain; (2) which strategy is most effective at individual and group levels at modulating brain activity and pain; and (3) whether the investigators can predict individual ability to modulate brain activity or pain using a particular strategy and applying mixed effects modeling of treatment efficacy using baseline measurements.</description>
