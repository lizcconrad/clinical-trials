    <textblock>
      The introduction of drug-eluting stents (DES) in the treatment of coronary artery disease has
      led to a significant reduction in morbidity. However, the first generation of these devices
      had no positive impact on the mortality after PCI (compared to bare metal stents), which was
      greatly attributed to a somewhat increased incidence of late and very late stent thrombosis.
      Concerns about the role of durable polymers as a potential trigger of inflammation and
      finally adverse events also led to the development of DES with bioresorbable coatings, which
      leave after degradation of the coating only a bare metal stent in the vessel wall that does
      not induce an inflammatory response. While such bioresorbable polymer DES are increasingly
      used in clinical practice, data from head-to-head comparisons between bioresorbable polymer
      DES with a contemporary highly flexible new generation permanent polymer coated DES.

      rationale: The introduction of drug-eluting stents (DES) in the treatment of coronary artery
      disease has led to a significant reduction in morbidity. However, the first generation of
      these devices had no positive impact on the mortality after PCI (compared to bare metal
      stents), which was greatly attributed to a somewhat increased incidence of late and very late
      stent thrombosis. Concerns about the role of durable polymers as a potential trigger of
      inflammation and finally adverse events also led to the development of DES with bioresorbable
      coatings, which leave after degradation of the coating only a bare metal stent in the vessel
      wall that does not induce an inflammatory response. While such bioresorbable polymer DES are
      increasingly used in clinical practice, data from head-to-head comparisons between
      bioresorbable polymer DES with a contemporary highly flexible new generation permanent
      polymer coated DES.

      Aim:

      The aim of the study is to compare the outcome of the bioresorbable polymer coated stent
      (ORSIRO) and a new generation permanent polymer coated stent (RESOLUTE ONYX) in an all-comers
      patient population and non-inferiority setting.

      Study design:

      The study is a prospective, randomized, single-blinded, multicentre trial with 1:1
      randomization for drug-eluting stent type, stratified for gender and the presence of diabetes
      mellitus.

      Study population:

      Patients who require percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for the treatment of coronary
      stenoses with an indication for DES use, according to current guidelines and/or the operators
      clinical judgement. All clinical syndromes will be included. A total of 2,470 patients will
      be included.

      Intervention:

      One group will receive the ORSIRO stent, the other group will receive the RESOLUTE ONYX
      stent. All other intervention and procedural characteristics are similar.

      Primary study outcome:

      Incidence of target vessel failure (TVF) at 1 year follow-up (according to ARC definitions).
      Components of the primary endpoint in hierarchical order: - Cardiac death: all deaths are
      considered cardiac, unless an unequivocal non-cardiac cause can be established. - Target
      vessel related myocardial infarction (MI) that is Q-wave or non-Q-wave, that can be related
      to the target vessel or cannot be related to another vessel. - Clinically driven repeated
      target vessel revascularization by means of PCI or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

    <description>The ORSIRO hybrid coating DES (Biotronik, Switzerland) is a device which includes a modern, highly flexible, thin-strut stent platform, eluting sirolimus from a thin biodegradable BIO-lute coating grom PLLA (poly(L-lactic acid)) which is located mainly on the abluminal side.</description>

    <description>The RESOLUTE ONYX is a permanent polymer DES that uses a novel highly flexible metallic stent backbone with increased radiographic visibility eluting the drug zotarolimus from the BioLinx durable polymer coating. The stent platform uses corewire technology that allows the stent to have a denser core metal surrounded by outer layer of cobalt-chromium.</description>
