    <textblock>
      Overactive bladder (OAB) is a common, chronic condition, characterized by urinary &quot;urgency,
      with or without urge incontinence, usually with frequency and nocturia.&quot; Treatment adherence
      is a major barrier to management of OAB and drug continuation is poor. Many factors may play
      a role in non-adherence to medication management of OAB including drug cost, side effects,
      and a lack of understanding of the disease and treatment process.Studies show that recall of
      disease information and treatment is often suboptimal. Literature shows that providing
      written materials is an efficacious way to aid in recall. Based on known poor adherence to
      OAB medication treatment and the clear role patient education methods have on patient
      information recall, the investigators believe that improvement of participant education
      through use of a OAB care plan will improve participant understanding and treatment
      adherence.

      Through this randomized trial, the investigators plan to evaluate whether implementation of a
      OAB Care Plan improves understanding of disease and treatment options, treatment success, and
      satisfaction.

      This is a prospective, randomized, controlled study of OAB counseling in new patients
      presenting to the Urogynecology offices of Hartford Hospital. All new patients with a
      diagnosis of OAB will be offered participation. All consenting participants will be
      randomized 1:1 to one of two groups: 1) Standard Care group or 2) Care Plan group. In the
      Standard Care group, participants will be counseled as the physician routinely counsels
      patients about OAB, in the Care Plan group, participants will be counseled a printed
      &quot;Overactive Bladder Plan of Care&quot; information sheet. At the end of the visit, the participant
      will complete a Baseline Survey. The Baseline Survey includes basic demographic information,
      a physician satisfaction survey, and a OAB knowledge survey. The participant will return for
      follow up as directed by the physician.

      At the follow up visit, participants in both groups will complete a Followup Survey. The
      Followup Survey will be completed before the participant sees the physician. The Followup
      Survey assesses OAB knowledge.

      Eight months after the baseline visit, each participant's chart will be reviewed for final
      data collection. If a participant progresses to a treatment method where she is satisfied and
      would like to remain, this will be documented.
