  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be the first assessment of the efficacy of MEDI7510 for the prevention of
      respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease. It will also provide estimates of vaccine efficacy
      and of endpoint incidence in the placebo arm. It will also assess the safety and
      immunogenicity of concurrent dosing of MEDI7510 and IIV to expand on the observations made in
      the Phase 1b study of MEDI7510. It will also expand the safety database of participants dosed
      with MEDI7510. The study will also assess the immune response to MEDI7510 in Season 1 and
      Season 2.

    <textblock>
      A Phase 2b, double-blind, randomized, and controlled study to evaluate the efficacy of
      MEDI7510 in approximately 1,900 adult participants, globally, 60 years or older. Participants
      will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single intramuscular dose of each of 2 study
      vaccines in contralateral arms: MEDI7510 + IIV or placebo + IIV in Season 1.

      Participants who receive MEDI7510 in the Northern Hemisphere will be re-randomized and
      blinded in Season 2 to receive either MEDI7510 + IIV or placebo + IIV in a 1:1 ratio.
      Clinical efficacy will not be assessed in Season 2; however the safety of revaccination will
      be assessed in Season 2.

Treatment-emergent were events between administration of study drug and approximately 1 year follow up that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. An adverse event of special interest was one of scientific and medical interest specific to understanding of study drug and may have required close monitoring and rapid communication by investigator to the sponsor. A NOCD was a newly diagnosed medical condition that is of a chronic, ongoing nature. It was observed after receiving study drug and was assessed by investigator as medically significant. The Season 1 was approximately 1 year.</description>

          <description>Anti-F IgG antibodies concentration was determined by a multiplex IgG assay developed on the Meso Scale discovery platform. It was calculated as: anti-log2 [mean (log2 yi)], where &quot;yi&quot; is the post dose antibody concentration or T-cell count fold change from baseline for each participant. The Season 1 was approximately 1 year.</description>

        <description>An serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent were events between administration of study drug and approximately 1 year follow up that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. An adverse event of special interest was one of scientific and medical interest specific to understanding of study drug and may have required close monitoring and rapid communication by investigator to the sponsor. A NOCD was a newly diagnosed medical condition that is of a chronic, ongoing nature. It was observed after receiving study drug and was assessed by investigator as medically significant.
