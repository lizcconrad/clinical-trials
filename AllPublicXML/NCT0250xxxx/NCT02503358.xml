  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase I trial is studying the side effects and the best dose of selumetinib
      when given together with paclitaxel as a second line therapy in treating patients with stage
      IIIB-IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Selumetinib may stop or slow the growth of tumor
      cells by blocking a protein called mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) that is needed for
      cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by
      stopping them from spreading. Giving selumetinib together with paclitaxel may kill more tumor
      cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of three pre-planned arms of continuous,
      intermittent, and pulsatile selumetinib with paclitaxel as second-line treatment in patients
      with stage IIIB or IV NSCLC.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the preliminary clinical response of continuous, intermittent, and pulsatile
      selumetinib with paclitaxel as second-line treatment in patients with stage IIIB or IV NSCLC.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of selumetinib in this patient population.

      II. To determine progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients
      treated with selumetinib/paclitaxel.

      III. To assess correlations between cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (cfDNA) molecular
      features from blood and molecular features and pathways from the biopsy samples, and use this
      as a surrogate measure of tumor response and duration of response as evaluated in the primary
      and secondary objectives.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-finding study of selumetinib. The goal is to find out what dose and
      dosing schedule is the most effective in this population. Patients are randomized to 1 of 3
      treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive selumetinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21 and paclitaxel
      intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8.

      ARM II: Patients receive selumetinib PO BID on days 1-5, 8-12, and 15-19 and paclitaxel as in
      Arm I.

      ARM III: Patients receive selumetinib PO BID on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17 and paclitaxel as
      in Arm I.

      In all three arms, treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients experiencing clinical benefit from study
      treatment may continue treatment based on the principal investigator (PI) approval on a
      patient-by-patient basis.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 8 weeks for
      12 months, and then every 3 months thereafter.

             nevirapine) either CYP2C8 or CYP3A4. Based on the in vitro data and SimCYP
             simulations, selumetinib is considered unlikely to perpetrate clinically significant
             drug-drug interaction via inhibition or induction of CYP enzymes

             erythromycin, fluoxetine, gemfibrozil, cimetidine, ritonavir, saquinavir, indinavir
             and nelfinavir) OR induce (e.g. rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, efavirenz and
             nevirapine) either CYP2C8 or CYP3A4.

          -  Female patients who are pregnant or breast-feeding (confirmation that the patient is
             not pregnant must be by a negative pregnancy test result obtained during screening;

             to, ongoing or active infection, active bleeding diatheses or renal transplant,
