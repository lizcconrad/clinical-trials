      The aim of this study is to assess the potential benefit of the addition of immunotherapy
      with VGX-3100 and INO-9012 (i.e. INO-3112) to concomitant CRT or, to concomitant CRT and
      continued as adjuvant in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer.

      Safety run-in: To test the safety of CRT combined with immunotherapy with INO-3112. This
      safety run-in phase will include the first 3 patients treated in each of the two INO-3112
      combination arms who are exposed to at least two immunotherapy doses and evaluate whether the
      combination does not pose undue immediate risks to the patients further enrolled in the
      trial.

      Phase II:To demonstrate sufficient activity in the experimental combination arms to warrant a
      further phase III conclusive trial based on progression free survival (PFS) at 18 months
      assessed by RECIST by the local investigator. The efficacy will be assessed within each
      experimental arm while the standard arm will serve as a reference arm to check the
      reliability of the results.

    <description>In order to ensure adequate safety of the combination treatment, a safety run-in will be performed. This safety run-in phase will include the first 3 patients treated in each of the experimental arms (arms A &amp; B) exposed to at least two immunotherapy doses. The acute safety of the combination of INO-3112 with concomitant CRT will be evaluated similar to a phase I &quot;3+3&quot; safety design. The safety evaluation will be done by the Data Safety Monitoring Board who will invoke an IDMC evaluation of the whole study if undue safety signals are observed.
Acute toxicity is defined as a grade 3 or more related AEs occurring between the first dose of vaccine administration and up to 14 days after the second dose of immunotherapy. Adverse events are graded according to the NCI CTCAE v4.0. Use of narcotics will be reviewed on case-to-case basis by a medical review team to assess its relevance towards the safety evaluation</description>

Those patients with pelvis positive and/or para-aortic positive lymph nodes should be treated with an elective dose to the para-aortic area of 45 Gy in fractions of 1.6-1.8 Gy in 25-28 fractions.
Pelvic and para-aortic nodes known to contain gross/macroscopically visible disease and heavily involved parametria or tumor areas that may lie beyond the high-dose range of brachytherapy should be treated with additional small volume boost of EBRT to a total dose of 60-65 Gy using a combination of either sequential and/or concomitant boost. Fractions of 1.8-2 Gy can be used in the sequential boost.</description>
