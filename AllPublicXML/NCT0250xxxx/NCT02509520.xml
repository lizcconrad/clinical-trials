  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elderly patients who experience a prolonged ICU stay are at high risk for developing post
      intensive care unit syndrome (PICS), a serious medical condition manifested by loss of muscle
      mass, weakness, malnutrition and neurocognitive decline. PICS often leads to chronic
      disability, prolonged mechanical ventilation and the need for costly extended stays in long
      term care facilities (LTCs). The investigators' preliminary study shows attempts at
      rehabilitating patients who have already developed PICS are minimally effective, resulting in
      only modest improvements in functionality. This project will determine the effects of
      mobility-based physical rehabilitation (MPR) combined with neuromuscular electric stimulation
      (NMES) and high protein supplementation (HPRO) early in a patients ICU stay on preventing
      PICS related musculoskeletal and functional deficits, and improving clinical outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Older, critically ill patients who survive their ICU stay frequently develop post-ICU
      syndrome (PICS) - a condition manifested by sarcopenia, weakness, malnutrition and
      neurocognitive decline - which occurs as a result of a critical illness, prolonged bed rest,
      catabolism, and polypharmacy. PICS frequently leads to chronic disability, prolonged
      mechanical ventilation (MV), functional deficits, and the need for extended rehabilitation in
      long term care facilities (LTCs). As the majority of patients admitted to ICUs are ≥ 65 years
      old, many of these patients are at high risk for PICS. Since the care of ICU patients is
      primarily focused on the medical management of the acute critical illness, there are limited
      resources and strategies available to prevent PICS. Evidence suggests mobility-based physical
      rehabilitation (MPR) combined with resistive training with neuromuscular electric stimulation
      (NMES) and high protein diets (HPRO) containing essential amino acids can mitigate the loss
      of muscle mass and function during bed rest in the elderly. The investigators hypothesize
      that preventive therapy involving the addition of both NMES and HPRO to MPR early and
      throughout the ICU and hospital stay can mitigate PICS-associated sarcopenia, malnutrition,
      and immobility to confer valuable health benefits toward recovery. To test this, the
      investigators will use a 2x2 factorial design in which older, MV ICU patients will all
      receive comprehensive ICU care and MPR, then be randomized to one of 4 groups: 1) MPR+NMES,
      2) MPR+HPRO, 3) all 3 together, or 4) MPR alone (control), to determine independent and
      combined effects of the interventions.

      The Specific Aims are to 1) determine the effects of adding NMES and HPRO interventions to
      MPR on muscle mass, strength, and mobility function in older, critically ill MV patients
      while still in the ICU, and 2) determine the effects of adding NMES and HPRO interventions to
      MPR on the clinical outcomes of time to weaning from MV, ICU/hospital length of stay and
      discharge disposition of these patients.

      This proposal capitalizes on the interdisciplinary collaboration among Pulmonary/Critical
      Care Intensivists, Physical Therapists, Geriatricians, Clinical Nutritionists, Statisticians
      and Nutrition and Metabolism clinical researchers examining the efficacy of the proposed
      comprehensive rehabilitation approach. The investigators' primary goal is to attenuate the
      severity of sarcopenia and functional decline in this older, critically ill population at
      risk for severe disability. Additionally, by focusing on maintaining skeletal muscle mass,
      function, and strength, the investigators hope to improve clinical outcomes. The
      investigators posit this combined therapy will mitigate PICS-associated disability and speed
      the recovery from critical illness in older, MV ICU patients. This project has high overall
      impact as the intervention is easily administered by hospital staff and may greatly reduce
      the physiological and functional declines while hastening recovery during acute ICU
      hospitalization in older adults.

    <description>The MPR provides functional strength and cardiopulmonary endurance training, which will consist of closed kinetic chain exercises to promote function movements. Intensity will be based on patient's hemodynamic responses and subjective reporting using Modified Borg Dyspnea Scale. Intensity, duration, or type of activity will be modified each session to achieve a physiologic response of moderate intensity. The HPRO intervention is based on caloric needs, calculated using validated equations to maintain positive nitrogen balance. Protein will be supplemented as isolated amino acids twice/day to deliver ~15g of essential amino acids (~5g Leucine) per serving, with a goal of 1.6 g/kg/day protein. This dose has been used in bed rest studies of adults to prevent muscle loss.</description>

    <description>The MPR exercise intervention will be combined with the NMES intervention which includes daily treatment with NMES. The NMES protocol requires that large (7.6 x 12.7 cm) self-adhesive surface electrodes be placed on quadriceps muscles specifically on the vastus lateralis, vastus medialis and rectus femoris and the gastrocnemius of both legs. This protocol is developed based upon previous NMES protocols used to acutely stimulate muscle protein synthesis rates in older type 2 diabetic patients preserve and restore muscle mass in intensive care patients and increase strength in older adults recovering from total knee replacement. Treatments will be twice daily.</description>
