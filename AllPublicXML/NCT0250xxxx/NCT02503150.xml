  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is to compare the efficacy and safety of modified FOLFOX6 [mFOLFOX6, a specific
      chemotherapy regimen of Oxaliplatin ,5-Fluorouracil and Leucovorin] chemotherapy plus Antigen
      Pulsed Dendritic Cells (APDCï¼Œa kind of autologous tumor lysates pulsed human dendritic cells
      vaccine) with modified chemotherapy alone in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) patients will be randomly assigned (3:1) to receive either
      modified FOLFOX6 [mFOLFOX6] chemotherapy combined with Antigen Pulsed Dendritic Cells (Arm
      APDC + Chemotherapy), or chemotherapy alone (Arm Chemotherapy). Each patient recruited in the
      study will receive maximum 12 cycles of (14 days/cycle) mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy. Patients in
      Arm APDC + Chemotherapy will receive APDC vaccination in addition to chemotherapy in the
      cycle 1-3 and 7-9, and in cycle 4-6 and 10-12 receive only chemotherapy. APDC + Chemotherapy
      or Chemotherapy will be stopped in case of disease progression, intolerable toxicities, or
      patient withdrawal with the consent. After 12 cycles, patients in Arm APDC + Chemotherapy
      will receive 5-Fluorouracil treatment plus every 3 months APDC therapy and patients in Arm
      Chemotherapy will receive only 5-Fluorouracil treatment. PFS, ORR and OS will be assessed,
      and toxicity and immunologic effects will be monitored.
