      To determine the persistence of protective antibody levels for subjects who seroconverted
      after vaccination with NmVac4-A/C/Y/W-135-DT™

      Participants in trial # JN-NM-002, who seroconverted for serogroups A and C will be contacted
      and asked to provide a blood sample at 12-24 months after vaccination with
      NmVac4-A/C/Y/W-135-DT.

      Serum Bactericidal Assays will be performed to evaluated duration of protective antibody
      titer for NmVac4-A/C/Y/W-135-DT for all four serogroups. To determine if subjects who
      seroconverted with lower titers retain protective levels of antibody (titer ≥:8) at 12-24
      months after vaccination.

      The purpose of this study is to collect serum samples to evaluate duration of protection for
      NmVac4-A/C/Y/W-135-DT, based on titers determined by Serum Bactericidal Assay with human
      complement (hSBA). This assay is used to evaluate immunogenicity of meningococcal vaccines,
      as a surrogate for efficacy. A titer ≥ 1:8 is considered protective.

      Objectives are to evaluate duration of protective antibody titer for NmVac4-A/C/Y/W-135-DT
      for all four serogroups, and determine if subjects with lower titers, but ≥:8 retain
      protective levels of antibody at 12-24 months.

      Participants in trial # JN-NM-002, who seroconverted for serogroups A and C will be contacted
      and asked to provide a blood sample at 12-24 months after vaccination with
      NmVac4-A/C/Y/W-135-DT™.

      months after vaccination.
