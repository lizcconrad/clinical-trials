    <description>Technical skill as measured by the Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skill (OSATS) global rating scale. Participants are scored on 4 domains from 0-5 (respect for tissue, precision of operative technique, economy of movements, confidence of movements). The maximum possible score is 20.</description>

    <description>After completing the initial assessment, faculty randomized to the conventional training group received a link to a web-based instructional video. In addition, they were given a laparoscopic box trainer, laparoscopic instruments and sutures that they could use to practice with at their leisure.</description>

    <description>Faculty randomized to the peer-coaching group received Â½ hour of peer-coaching after completing the initial assessment on the simulator. Each faculty member sutured on the box trainer while being observed by his or her peer-coach. All study participants had the same peer-coach.After the coaching session, study participants received a link to the web-based video as well as the box trainer and supplies to independently practice laparoscopic suturing. Similar to individuals in the control group, no specific guidance regarding the amount of independent practice was given.</description>
