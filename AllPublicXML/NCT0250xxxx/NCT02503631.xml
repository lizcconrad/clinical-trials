      The primary objective of this study is to obtain de-identified, clinically characterized,
      stool and plasma specimens for use in assessing new markers for the detection of neoplasms of
      the digestive tract.

      This is a multi-site, prospective sample collection study. Subjects will be men and women,
      40-90 years of age, inclusive, each with a colonoscopic biopsy-based diagnosis of CRC and/or
      a pre-malignant colorectal lesion with large enough residual lesion to require subsequent
      surgical excision or complex colonoscopic polypectomy.

      One stool sample from approximately 300 subjects will be collected in this study. A blood
      sample will also be collected from subjects.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is male or female, 40-90 years of age, inclusive.

          -  Subject has a diagnosis of CRC, at any stage, confirmed with a tissue biopsy or
             colorectal polyp/adenoma/mass that is equal or larger than 1 cm in pre-enrollment
             colonoscopy with residual lesion in the colon of sufficient size to require additional
             surgical excision or complex colonoscopic polypectomy.

          -  Subject understands the study procedures and is able to provided informed consent to
             participate in the study and authorization for release of relevant protected health
             information to the study Investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has actively bleeding hemorrhoids (blood on toilet paper or bright red blood
             clots in the toilet bowel during bowel movement).

          -  Individual has a condition the Investigator believes would interfere with his or her
             ability to provide informed consent, comply with the study protocol, which might
             confound the interpretation of the study results or put the person at undue risk.
