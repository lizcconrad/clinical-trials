  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In adults, it is common to perform a number of superficial and non invasive surgeries under
      local anesthesia in order to limit the use of general anesthesia.

      Hypnosis is a nonpharmacological therapies that can be used during surgery to improve the
      patient comfort and experience. The benefit of this practice has been widely demonstrated in
      adults, decreasing perioperative anxiety, postoperative pain scores as well as nausea and
      vomiting.

      In pediatric surgery, hypnosis is an effective technique for the management of preoperative
      anxiety. It is used by many teams in their daily practice, particularly during anesthetic
      induction.

      For 2 years, the team of pediatric anesthesia and surgery of the Montpellier University
      Hospital also offers for selected short and superficial non-invasive surgeries, an
      intraoperative management under hypnosis in association with ocal anesthesia as an
      alternative to general anesthesia. If this clinical practice of hypnosis is fully accepted
      and recognized in our intraoperative surgical unit, to date, no studies have evaluated the
      benefits of this technique compared to general anesthesia.

      The objective of the study is to compare the impact of these techniques (hypnosis vs. general
      anesthesia) on postoperative experiences of children (rehabilitation time, anxiety, pain,
      nausea and vomiting, negative behavioral disorders).
