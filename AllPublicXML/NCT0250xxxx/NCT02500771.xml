  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a project to be funded by a Fast-Track Small Business Innovative Research to build
      and test the feasibility of a new software prototype called V-Motive which will facilitate
      the combination of two proven autism behavioral interventions: Applied Behavior Analysis
      therapy (ABA) and Video Modeling (VM). The investigators will conduct a Phase I feasibility
      analysis and Phase II pilot study of the V-Motive Prototype by observing a community therapy
      providers' use of the prototype in a therapy setting. Investigators will observe the users
      and record the success or failure of the performance of key functions of the software.
      Investigators will also administer surveys. The study will answer research questions about
      V-Motive's ability to perform its intended function: allowing interventionists to feasibly
      leverage video modeling within ABA therapy with a minimal amount of overhead and labor.

      Investigators will conduct a within-subject pilot study of 6 tutors and 6 children to answer
      research questions about V-Motive's ability to perform its intended function. The goal is to
      evaluate the feasibility, usability, and the potential of V-Motive to deliver comprehensive,
      individualized video modeling that is integrated with a child's program. Investigators will
      also use descriptive statistics to provide preliminary insight into the potential impact of
      the system on a child's performance in their ABA therapy. However, these data are NOT
      intended to show cause or to show effectiveness. The study will answer the following
      questions: 1) 3) Can V-Motive be feasibly used during ABA therapy to positively impact a
      child's performance within 4 weeks? 2) How laborious is it to construct a fully-indexed video
      repository from therapy footage using V-Motive? 3) How accurate is the system in suggesting
      and cueing up appropriate video for playback on demand?

    <description>The following pilot feasibility measures will be captured for each tutor/child pair: 1) Usage: the total number of times the tutor chooses to use VM (an indicator that the tutor found it useful); 2) Overall Trial Success Rate: the percent of trials that were successful (e.g. recorded as a &quot;pass&quot;) in programs with and without VM; 3) Mastery: the trials to criteria and the total number of targets mastered with and without VM; 4) Behavior Impact: the number of tantrums and other tracked behaviors occurring with and without VM (tracked by tutor using Abacus behavior tracker).</description>

    <measure>Accuracy of V-Motive software in suggesting and cueing up appropriate video for playback on demand</measure>
    <time_frame>4-week trial starting in 2020</time_frame>
    <description>The system will automatically capture the number of times a tutor adjusts the video for playback, number of times a video is rewound or fast-forwarded to obtain the appropriate start time, and the amount of time spent seeking before the video is cued up for playback to the child. For precision determination, actual start times will be obtained by manually reviewing the video of selected trials, and user seek times will be automatically tracked by the system.</description>

    <description>The following intervention will be administered:
ABA therapy enhanced with V-Motive software
Tutors treating children with Applied Behavioral Analysis therapy will use the V-Motive software to enhance therapy sessions. Children will receive therapy as usual, but half of their current behavioral programs (skills/goals) will have been selected for enhanced prompting through video modeling.</description>
