    <textblock>
      The study will be a pragmatic, single blind, randomised, controlled feasibility study,
      comparing 6 months of web-based physiotherapy plus usual care with usual care alone in pwMS.
      The study will recruit 90 pwMS from three UK Centres (30 from each centre); NHS Ayrshire and
      Arran, NHS Lothian, and Plymouth Hospitals NHS Trust.

      The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of a randomised controlled trial examining
      the effectiveness of a six-month web-based physiotherapy programme and usual care compared to
      usual care alone, in people moderately affected by MS and to gather essential information for
      the planning of a definitive trial, which would evaluate both clinical and cost effectiveness
      of the intervention.

      Following baseline assessments, both groups will be given an appointment with the
      physiotherapist to agree shared goals and to devise an individualised exercise programme
      based upon their needs and treatment goals. Participants will then be randomised to one of
      two groups.

      Participants randomised to the intervention group will receive their individualised exercise
      programme delivered via the web-based physio website. Participants will be asked to complete
      their exercise programme at least twice weekly. They will receive weekly standardised phone
      calls from the physiotherapist for the first two weeks of the programme. Every two weeks
      thereafter for the remainder of the 6 month intervention period the physiotherapist will
      review the exercise diary of each participant and remotely alter the participant's exercise
      programme as appropriate, by changing any combination of exercises, level of difficulty or
      number of repetitions. The number and type of exercises within the programme and duration to
      complete the exercise programme will be documented. Participants will be informed of any
      changes by standardised email.

      Participants randomised to the control group will receive a print out exercise sheet of their
      individualised exercise programme. Participants will be asked to complete their exercise
      programme at least twice weekly. Compliance will be captured using a home exercise diary.
      Participants will also receive a weekly phone call from the physiotherapist for the first two
      weeks to check on progress.

    <description>Participants receive an online individualised exercise programme to complete over the internet twice per week. Exercises can be a combination of aerobic, strengthening and balance exercises. Participants receive a weekly phone call from a physiotherapist for the first two weeks to check on progress. After this, every 2 weeks online exercise diaries are remotely monitored by a physiotherapist and exercise programmes progressed as appropriate.</description>
