    <textblock>
      MicroPort Orthopedics (MPO) is conducting this post market clinical follow-up (PMCF) study to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of its total hip arthroplasty (THA) and resurfacing
      components marketed in the European Union (EU). These types of studies are required by
      regulatory authorities for all THA and resurfacing devices that do not have medium to
      long-term clinical evidence available at the time of gaining approval to market in the EU.
      This study has been designed in accordance with the medial device directives (MEDDEV) 2.12/2
      rev 2.
