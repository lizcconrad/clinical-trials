    <description>After being informed about the study and potential risks, all patients giving written informed consent undergo screening tests to determine eligibility for study enrollment. On Day 1, patients who meet the eligibility criteria will start taking CNT-01 500mg orally three times daily for 14 days. On Day 15, patients will take CNT-01 500 mg only once after blood drawing.</description>
