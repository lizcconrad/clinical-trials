  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post burn flexion contractures are common in pediatric age group. Release of contracture and
      coverage with full thickness skin graft (FTSG) is a widely used procedure for this problem.
      This procedure is routinely done under tourniquet control because bloodless operative field
      is essential to visualize important neurovascular structures in hand.

      Use of tumescent technique without a tourniquet is gaining acceptance because it avoids
      complications associated with tourniquet use, maintains a blood less surgical field and
      decreases operative time. Furthermore use of tumescent anesthesia often results in better
      surgical outcomes.

      Although the benefits of tumescent technique used in wide awake hand surgery are well
      documented, epinephrine at a concentration of 1:1 000,00 has also been used as a replacement
      for pneumatic tourniquet for release of hand contracture in infants and adults under general
      anesthesia. Thus epinephrine 1:1,000,00 in saline solution can be a potential replacement for
      a tourniquet in hand surgeries done under general anesthesia.

      for a tourniquet in hand surgeries done under general anesthesia.

      To the investigators' knowledge no study has so far been done to compare the outcome of
      release of post burn flexion contractures under tumescent technique with general anesthesia
      or under tourniquet control with general anesthesia.

    <measure>Operative time to secure graft</measure>
    <time_frame>Time of surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Operative time to secure graft will be measured by calculating the time taken to secure per square centimeter of graft.
Time (T) in minutes to secure per cm2 of graft = Total operative time / size of graft secured in cm2 measured by transparent graft paper In tourniquet group total operative time will be measured as total time taken from start of applying tourniquet including time taken for exsanguinations to the time till completion of dressing.
In tumescent group total operative time will be measured as total time taken from start of injecting the tumescent solution including waiting time for tumescent solution to produce maximum vasoconstriction (25 minutes) to the time till completion of dressing</description>
