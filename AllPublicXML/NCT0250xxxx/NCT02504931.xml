  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to conduct a clinical trial to evaluate sertraline treatment
      efficacy in a large sample of military veterans with a dual diagnosis of PTSD and Alcohol Use
      Disorder who are receiving Cognitive and Behavioral Therapy as part of the VA-system's new
      dual diagnosis program. The study is designed as an efficacy trial of sertraline used as an
      adjunct to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) in the treatment of PTSD/Alcohol dual
      diagnosis. There are two outcomes of interest, namely PTSD symptom improvement and also
      decreased alcohol consumption. The investigators are interested to know whether or not
      sertraline is superior to placebo in improving the symptoms of either one or both of these
      two disorders. Even though sertraline is a treatment of choice for PTSD, the investigators
      expect that the comorbid condition of alcohol dependence will complicate the treatment of
      PTSD and that the clustered subgroups will show differential treatment response with
      sertraline. The primary objective of the present study is to identify subgroups of alcohol
      dependent persons with PTSD who will either benefit or not benefit from treatment with
      SSRI's. The proposed study will enroll veterans with PTSD and dually-diagnosed alcohol
      dependence in a 12-week treatment providing sertraline vs. placebo medication as an adjunct
      to manualized CBT and will specifically test the hypothesis that subtypes of alcohol
      dependence can be used to predict which patients respond well and which subgroup responds
      poorly to SSRI treatment.

      Experimental Design. The study design is a parallel group, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      stratified, randomized medication treatment trial of male and female veterans who experienced
      &quot;in-theater&quot; trauma and have both a PTSD and Alcohol Use dual diagnosis. All subjects will
      receive 12 weeks of manualized cognitive &amp; behavioral therapy as a standard of care.
      Additionally, subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive double-blind treatment with
      Sertraline vs. Placebo as an adjunctive treatment. The manualized therapy provides standard
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) addressing alcohol use and prolonged exposure (PE)
      behavioral therapy targeting PTSD. Sertraline is a common treatment for PTSD and psychiatric
      disturbance but is hypothesized to have differential efficacy in different subtypes of
      alcohol drinking patients. A stratified randomization scheme will balance placebo and
      sertraline assignment to two groups, and a post-hoc clustering approach will be used to
      determine which subgroups of dual diagnosis patients may benefit from sertraline vs. placebo
      treatment.

      Veterans with PTSD who regularly drink more than 5 standard drinks of alcohol in a day (note
      one 12oz beer = one standard drink) may be eligible for the study if they meet criteria.

    <measure>PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) Symptom Score From PCL (Patient Monitoring Checklist)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The PCL is a self-report measure that can be completed by patients in a waiting room prior to a session or by participants as part of a research study.
The survey has 20 questions scored as:
0=Not at all
A little bit
Moderately
Quite a bit
Extremely
Interpretation of the PCL should be made by a clinician. The total symptom severity score is obtained by summing the scores for each of the 20 items to give a total of 1-80 points. The lower the score, the less severe the symptoms of PTSD, the higher the score, the more severe the symptoms.</description>

    <description>Subjects will receive a fixed dose of 150 mg sertraline per day. Sertraline dose will be gradually increased by giving sertraline subjects capsules filled with 50 mg for the first three days and then capsules filled with 100 mg for 4 days before beginning the 150 mg per day in the second week. After completing the study Visit 12, subjects will be given an additional two week supply of medicine to gradually taper down so as to minimize any withdrawal discomfort.
Subjects in the Sertraline arm also will receive COPE therapy (Concurrent Treatment with Prolonged Exposure)which involves 12 sessions of manualized cognitive and behavioral therapy including exposure therapy for PTSD.</description>

            <description>Subjects will receive a fixed dose of 150 mg sertraline per day. Sertraline dose will be gradually increased by giving sertraline subjects capsules filled with 50 mg for the first three days and then capsules filled with 100 mg for 4 days before beginning the 150 mg per day in the second week. After completing the study Visit 12, subjects will be given an additional two week supply of medicine to gradually taper down so as to minimize any withdrawal discomfort.
Subjects in the Sertraline arm also will receive COPE therapy (Concurrent Treatment with Prolonged Exposure)which involves 12 sessions of manualized cognitive and behavioral therapy including exposure therapy for PTSD.
Sertraline: A Randomized Controlled Trial Design will randomize subjects to one of two arms. Sertraline is the active medication treatment arm.</description>

        <title>PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) Symptom Score From PCL (Patient Monitoring Checklist)</title>
        <description>The PCL is a self-report measure that can be completed by patients in a waiting room prior to a session or by participants as part of a research study.
The survey has 20 questions scored as:
0=Not at all
A little bit
Moderately
Quite a bit
Extremely
Interpretation of the PCL should be made by a clinician. The total symptom severity score is obtained by summing the scores for each of the 20 items to give a total of 1-80 points. The lower the score, the less severe the symptoms of PTSD, the higher the score, the more severe the symptoms.</description>
