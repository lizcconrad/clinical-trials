      &quot;Effect of intraoperative nerve monitoring on voice quality during thyroid surgery&quot;

      Thyroidectomy is a quite often surgical procedure applied by both head and neck surgeons and
      endocrine surgeons.Recent advances in surgical and technological area achieve a remarkable
      decrease in the complication rates. In case of these advances, patients still have fear
      related with their voice. In this study, investigators aimed to investigate voice changes
      during thyroid surgery and effect of intraoperative nerve monitoring to the voice quality.

    <textblock>
      In order to minimize the complication rates and voice disturbances during thyroidectomy,
      intraoperative nerve monitoring(IONM) is a widely used intervention. In this study
      investigators will compare conventional surgery with IONM used surgery. Randomly chosen half
      of the patients will be operated with IONM. Vagus, recurrent and superior laryngeal nerves
      will be monitored during surgery and measured for nerve integrity . Rest of the patients will
      be operated with standard conventional method. All participants will be analyzed with a
      computer program for their voice quality preoperatively and postoperatively at 14th day of
      surgery.
