  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-children phase 1 trial using indoximod, an inhibitor of the immune
      &quot;checkpoint&quot; pathway indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), in combination with
      temozolomide-based therapy to treat pediatric brain tumors. Using a preclinical glioblastoma
      model, it was recently shown that adding IDO-blocking drugs to temozolomide plus radiation
      significantly enhanced survival by driving a vigorous, tumordirected inflammatory response.
      This data provided the rationale for the companion adult phase 1 trial using indoximod
      (IND#120813) plus temozolomide to treat adults with glioblastoma, which is currently open
      (NCT02052648). The goal of this pediatric study is to bring IDO-based immunotherapy into the
      clinic for children with brain tumors. This study will provide a foundation for future
      pediatric trials testing indoximod combined with radiation and temozolomide in the up-front
      setting for patients with newly diagnosed central nervous system tumors.

             completion of the study.

          -  Sexually active male patients must agree to use barrier contraception (condoms) or
             abstinence prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Use of

             completion of the study.

          -  Patients and/or their parents or legal guardians must sign a written informed consent

          -  Prior invasive malignancy, other than the primary central nervous system tumor, unless

             years

          -  Patients with baseline QTc interval of more than 470 msec at study entry, and patients
             with congenital long QTc syndrome.

          -  Active systemic infection requiring treatment, including any HIV infection or
             toxoplasmosis

          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study
             drug administration, or may interfere with the interpretation of study results, or in
             the judgment of the investigator would make the patient inappropriate for entry into
             this study

          -  Baseline QTc interval of more than 470 or congenital long QT syndrome

          -  Active autoimmune disease
