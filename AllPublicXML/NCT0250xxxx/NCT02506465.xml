      Medi-Tate i-Temporary Implantable Nitinol Device (iTIND) is intended to treat subjects with
      symptomatic BPH.

      A total of 150 subjects with symptomatic BPH will be enrolled into this study, according to
      eligibility criteria.

      Study duration is 12 months and includes 7 visits: screening, screening follow up,
      implantation, retrieval, 6 weeks follow up, 3 months follow up and 12 months follow up.

      iTIND Device will be implanted for 5-7 days. Sham will be a routine Foley catheter procedure.
