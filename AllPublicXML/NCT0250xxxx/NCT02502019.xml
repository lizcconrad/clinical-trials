  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this pilot clinical investigation is to assess the reliability of
      the Surface Bleeding Severity Scale (SBSS) in a clinical setting. Secondary objectives of
      this clinical investigation are to collect initial data on the safety and efficacy of
      HEMOBLAST™ Bellows in abdominal and orthopedic lower extremity surgeries.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HEMOBLAST™ Bellows is intended for use in surgical procedures as an adjunct to hemostasis
      when control of bleeding by conventional procedures is ineffective or impractical.

      This is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm pilot clinical investigation. There will be 36
      subjects enrolled across 4 investigational sites.

      The subjects will be followed at hospital charge and 6 weeks postoperatively.

      The primary endpoint of this clinical investigation is the mean paired Kappa statistic for
      the assignment of SBSS scores by 2 Investigators.

      Secondary endpoints of this clinical investigation consist of:

        -  Proportion of subjects achieving hemostasis within 6 minutes of HEMOBLAST™ Bellows
           application;

        -  Proportion of subjects achieving hemostasis within 10 minutes of HEMOBLAST™ Bellows
           application;

        -  Proportion of subjects achieving hemostasis within 3 minutes of HEMOBLAST™ Bellows
           application; and

        -  Incidence of adverse events through final follow-up.

                  ineffective or impractical; and

               -  Subject has a TBS with an SBSS score of 1, 2, or 3.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  • Subject is undergoing a laparoscopic, thoracoscopic, or robotic surgical procedure;
