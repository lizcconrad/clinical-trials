      This interventional study will evaluate the retinal vascular dynamics associated with
      Intravitreal Aflibercept Injection (IAI) therapy in eyes with diabetic macular edema (DME) or
      macular edema secondary to retinal vein occlusion (RVO). Ultra-widefield fluorescein
      angiography and OCT angiography will be performed at multiple timepoints to assess the
      changes in retinal vascular leakage, ischemia, and vascular abnormalities throughout the
      study duration and compare these alterations to baseline.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic macular edema (DME) and macular edema secondary to retinal venous occlusive diseases
      are the most common cause of vision loss from a retinal vascular disease. Recently VEGF
      inhibitors (bevacizumab, aflibercept, and ranibizumab) have been described as new first-line
      therapies for these conditions. Aflibercept is the most recently approved VEGF inhibitor for
      the management of these conditions. Clinical trials have shown that treatment with
      aflibercept improves visual acuity and reduces macular edema in a large percentage of
      patients.

      This study will examine the changes that occur with intravitreal aflibercept to perfusion and
      leakage in treatment naive eyes over the course of 1 year.

             contraceptives or other prescription pharmaceutical contraceptives for 2 or more
             menstrual cycles prior to screening; intrauterine device [IUD]; bilateral tubal
             ligation; vasectomy; condom plus contraceptive sponge, foam, or jelly, or diaphragm
             plus contraceptive sponge, foam, or jelly)

               -  Postmenopausal women must be amenorrheic for at least 12 months in order not to
                  be considered of child bearing potential. Pregnancy testing and contraception are
                  not required for women with documented hysterectomy or tubal ligation.
