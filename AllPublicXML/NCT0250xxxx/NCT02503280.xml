  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Before initiating the full randomized study, a Pilot Safety Phase will be performed. In this
      phase the composition of cells administered via the Biosense Webster MyoStar NOGA Injection
      Catheter System will be tested. The randomized portion of the study will be conducted after a
      full review of the safety data from the pilot Phase by the Data safety monitoring board.

      Following the Pilot Phase of five (5) Fifty (50) patients scheduled to undergo cardiac
      catheterization and meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria will be evaluated at baseline.

      Patients will be randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to one of three Treatment Strategies.

               3. Have a diagnosis of chronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction secondary to
                  myocardial infarction (MI) as defined by the following: Screening MRI must show
                  an area of akinesis, dyskinesis, or severe hypokinesis associated with evidence
                  of myocardial scarring based on delayed hyperenhancement following gadolinium
                  infusion.

               4. Been treated with appropriate maximal medical therapy for heart failure or
                  post-infarction left ventricular dysfunction. For beta-blockade, the patient must
                  have been on a stable dose of a clinically appropriate beta-blocker for 3 months.
                  For angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition, the patient must have been on a
                  stable dose of a clinically appropriate agent for 1 month.

               5. Be a candidate for cardiac catheterization.

               6. Have an ejection fraction ≤ 50% by gated blood pool scan, two-dimensional
                  echocardiogram, cardiac MRI, or left ventriculogram within the prior six months
                  and not in the setting of a recent ischemic event.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  In order to participate in this study, a patient MUST NOT:

               2. Have a known, serious radiographic contrast allergy.

               3. Have a mechanical aortic valve or heart constrictive device.

               4. Have a documented presence of aortic stenosis (aortic stenosis graded as ≥ +2
                  equivalent to an orifice area of 1.5cm2 or less).

               5. Have a documented presence of moderate to severe aortic insufficiency
                  (echocardiographic assessment of aortic insufficiency graded as ≥+2).

                  months in advance of treatment within this study. In addition, patients who
                  develop a need for revascularization following enrollment will be submitted for

               7. Evidence of a life-threatening arrhythmia (nonsustained ventricular tachycardia ≥
                  20 consecutive beats or complete heart block) or QTc interval &gt; 550 ms on
                  screening ECG.

                  Patients on Coumadin will be withdrawn 5 days before the procedure and confirmed
                  to have an INR &lt; 1.3. Patients who cannot be withdrawn from Coumadin will be
                  excluded from enrollment

              13. Have known allergies to penicillin or streptomycin.
