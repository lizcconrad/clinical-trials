      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of infliximab in induction regimen by
      assessing the mean decrease in Disease Activity Index for intestinal Behcet's disease (DAIBD)
      score of 20 or more in participants with active intestinal Behcet's disease who are
      refractory to conventional therapies.

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all participants know the identity of the intervention), single arm,
      multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research
      study) study of Infliximab in participant with Moderate-to-Severe Refractory Intestinal
      Behcet's Disease. The study consists of 3 Phases: Screening Phase (4 weeks), induction Phase
      for 8 weeks, and maintenance Phase for 24 weeks extending from Week 0 (baseline), and a
      safety Follow up visit (Week 36 or approximately 6 weeks after the last administration of
      study drug). The duration of participation in the study for each participant is approximately
      40 weeks. The mean decrease in Disease Activity Index for intestinal Behcet's disease (DAIBD)
      score of 20 or more will be evaluated primarily. Participants' safety will be monitored
      throughout the study.

    <measure>The Mean Decrease in Disease Activity Index for Intestinal Behcet's Disease (DAIBD) Score of 20 or More From Baseline at Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The DAIBD will be assessed by collecting information on 8 different intestinal BD-related variables. These 8 variables are: fever, abdominal mass, abdominal tenderness, intestinal complications, extraintestinal manifestations, general well-being, abdominal pain, and total number of liquid stools. The last 3 variables are scored over 7 days by the participant on a diary card. Abdominal pain will be measured using the 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS) to standardize the evaluation of pain and the result of 11-point NRS will be divided into 4 grades (none, mild, moderate, severe) to fill out the DAIBD. where, None indicate 0; Mild indicate 1-3; Moderate indicate 4-6; Severe indicate 7-10.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant had diagnosed of definite or probable intestinal Behcet's Disease (BD)
             prior to Screening

          -  Participant must have active intestinal BD, defined as; a) A baseline Disease Activity
             Index for intestinal Behcet's disease (DAIBD) score of greater than or equal to (&gt;=)
             40; b) Endoscopy with evidence of active intestinal BD (defined as ulcerations in the
             ileum and/or colon). The endoscopy must have occurred within 3 months prior to
             baseline

          -  Must either be currently receiving treatment with, or have a history of having failed
             to respond to, or tolerate, at least 1 of the following therapies as assessed by
             treating physician: oral corticosteroids, 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), azathioprine (AZA),
             or methotrexate (MTX). a) Have no response to oral corticosteroids within the
             preceding 18 months; b) Have no response to 6-MP, AZA or MTX within the preceding 5
             years

          -  Prior to the baseline, the following conditions must be met: a) If receiving 6-MP,
             AZA, or MTX must have been receiving it for at least 12 weeks, and the dose must be
             stable for at least 4 weeks; b) If 6-MP, AZA, or MTX have been recently discontinued,
             they must have been stopped for at least 4 weeks; c) If receiving oral
             5-aminosalicylate (5-ASA) compounds or oral corticosteroids, the dose must have been
             stable for at least 2 weeks; d) If oral 5-ASA compounds or oral corticosteroids have
             been recently discontinued, they must have been stopped for at least 2 weeks; e) If
             receiving cyclosporine, the dose must have been stable for at least 6 weeks; f) If
             cyclosporine have been recently discontinued, they must have been stopped for at least
             6 weeks

          -  Participant must be medically stable on the basis of physical examination, medical
             history, vital signs and 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at Screening. If
             there are abnormalities, they must be consistent with the underlying illness in the
             study population, or the participant may be included only if the investigator judge
             the abnormalities from normal to be not clinically significant or to be appropriate.
             This determination must be recorded in the participant's source documents by the
             investigator

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant has complications of intestinal BD such as symptomatic strictures or
             stenoses, short gut syndrome, central nervous system or vascular manifestation, or any
             other manifestation that might be anticipated to require surgery, could preclude the
             use of the DAIBD to assess response to therapy, or would possibly confound the ability
             to assess the effect of treatment with infliximab

          -  Participant currently has or is suspected to have an abscess. Recent cutaneous and
             perianal abscesses are not exclusionary if drained and adequately treated at least 3
             weeks prior to baseline, or 8 weeks prior to baseline for intra-abdominal abscesses,
             provided that there is no anticipated need for any further surgery. Participants with
             active fistulas may be included if there is no anticipation of a need for surgery and
             there are currently no abscesses identified

          -  Participant has had any kind of bowel resection within 6 months or any other
             intra-abdominal surgery within 3 months prior to baseline

          -  Participant has a draining (ie, functioning) stoma or ostomy

          -  Participant has received any of the following prescribed medications or therapies
             within the specified period: a) Intravenous (IV) corticosteroids within 3 weeks prior
             to baseline; b) Other oral immunomodulatory agents (eg, 6-thioguanine (6-TG),

             half-lives of agent prior to baseline, whichever is longer; d) Other immunomodulatory
             biologic agents within 12 weeks or within 5 half-lives of agent prior to baseline,
             whichever is longer; e) Treatment with apheresis (eg, Adacolumn apheresis) or total
             parenteral nutrition (TPN) as a treatment for intestinal BD within 3 weeks prior to
