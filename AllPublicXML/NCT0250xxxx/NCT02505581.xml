      Routine antibiotics for the intravenous and oral prophylaxis of colorectal surgery will be
      used.

      Experimental group: Patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery that involves, colonic
      resection.

      The antibiotic prophylaxis in this group will be composed of:

      An oral antibiotic pattern of ciprofloxacin (750mg / 12h, 2 doses) and metronidazole (250mg /
      8h, 3 doses) the day before surgery.

      Control group: Patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery that involves, colonic
      resection.

      The antibiotic prophylaxis in this group will be composed of:

      An intravenous antibiotic pattern of cefuroxime 1g and metronidazole 1,5gr during anesthetic
      induction.

      In both groups a second intravenous dose of cefuroxime (750mg) will be administered if the
      intraoperative time elongates more than three hours or there is an intraoperative bleeding
      over 1000cc.

      There won´t be a placebo treatment. Subject compliance will be evaluated according to the
      usual practice in surgical care field
