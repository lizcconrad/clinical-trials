  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of repeated doses of oral delafloxacin on
      the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of a single oral dose of midazolam.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effect of repeated doses of oral delafloxacin on the PK profile
      of a single oral dose of midazolam. The study will also evaluate the pharmacokinetics,
      safety, and tolerability of repeated oral doses of delafloxacin in healthy male and female
      subjects and to obtain a steady state PK profile for oral delafloxacin.
