      The purpose of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was to determine
      whether jerusalem artichoke and fermented soybeans powder mixture is effective in the control
      of blood glucose level in subjects with prediabetes or newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.

      The objective of this clinical study was to evaluate the effect of jerusalem artichoke and
      fermented soybean powder mixture supplementation on blood glucose. A randomized,
      double-blinded, placebo-controlled study was conducted on 60 subjects with impaired fasting
      glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. The
      subjects were randomly assigned to either a group ingesting 40 g jerusalem artichoke and
      fermented soybean powder mixture supplementation daily or a placebo group for 12-week. We
      assessed fasting and postprandial levels of glucose.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        1. All subjects were with prediabetes (IFG or IGT) or newly diagnosed type 2 DM (T2DM) no
        taking medicine. IFG was defined as fasting glucose between 100 and 125 mg/dL and IGT was
        defined as 2-h OGTTs glucose levels 140-199 mg/dL. Newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes was
        defined as fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dL or 2-h OGTTs level ≥ 200 mg/dL.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. glucose lowering medications or insulin injections;

          2. abnormal liver or renal function;

          3. chronic stomach and intestines disease;

          4. chronic alcoholism;

          5. pregnancy or intending to become pregnant during time of study.

          6. complications;

          7. an occupation that could be dangerous if hypoglycemia should occur.
