      Study Objectives: To determine whether, in patients with large acute myocardial infarction
      undergoing primary or rescue angioplasty, the administration of subcutaneous Lenograstim
      [recombinant human Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor (rhu G-CSF), Myelostim 34,
      Italfarmaco] associated with Myocardial Contrast Echocardiography and the intravenous
      infusion of sulphur hexafluoride (Sonovue, Bracco) determines an improvement:

        -  in regional and global contractile function, myocardial perfusion and infarct size
           assessed by cardiovascular magnetic resonance.

        -  Echocardiographic parameters of LV function

      1. INTRODUCTION 1.1. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE OF THE STUDY The long term prognosis of
           patients suffering from acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has progressively improved
           since the introduction of reperfusion therapies and in particular primary angioplasty
           [1]. In the setting of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), the immediate
           reopening of acutely occluded coronary arteries via primary angioplasty is the treatment
           of choice to salvage ischemic myocardium. However, the sudden re-initiation of blood
           flow can lead to a local acute inflammatory response with further endothelial and
           myocardial damage. This phenomenon, described as 'reperfusion injury', may explain why,
           despite optimum myocardial reperfusion, the short-term mortality after AMI approaches 7%
           [1] and the incidence of heart failure approaches 15-20% [2][3]. Despite the use of full
           conventional treatment, including ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, aldosterone inhibitors
           and diuretics, in the context of randomised controlled trials yearly mortality rates of
           patients with post-infarction heart failure are still in the range of 10-13% and
           rehospitalisation for worsening of heart failure occurs at a yearly rate of 6-8 % [4].
           Registry data indicate a more dismal outcome in real world clinical experience. A major
           reason for the high morbidity and mortality is that the heart has an inadequate
           regenerative response to the myocardial necrosis sustained following AMI; cell death
           from the ischemic damage can lead to progressive ventricular dilation and dysfunction
           through the processes of adverse left ventricular remodelling. However, the discovery of
           tissue resident cardiac stem cells in the mammalian heart [5] has challenged the long
           held belief that the heart is a terminally-differentiated organ and opens up the
           possibility of using bone marrow derived stem cells to repair the heart. Indeed, recent
           experimental studies documented that bone marrow-derived cell (BMC) injection into the
           infarcted heart stimulates the formation of newly formed cardiac myocytes, although the
           origin of these myocytes is still a matter of debate[6]. Numerous pre-clinical studies
           provided high degree of evidence that bone marrow derived cells do contribute to cardiac
           repair after acute myocardial injury, limit infarct expansion and improve cardiac
           function most likely via a paracrine mechanism of action. Pre-clinical evidence is
           corroborated by several small to intermediate size clinical trials demonstrating
           beneficial effects of bone marrow derived cells on top of the state-of-the-art
           reperfusion treatment [7]. For this reason, European Community has recently funded
           within FP-7 &quot;The effect of intracoronary reinfusion of bone marrow derived mononuclear
           cells (BM-MNC) on all cause-mortality in acute myocardial infarction (BAMI)&quot; project
           aimed to definitively demonstrate the efficacy of BM-MNC in patients with myocardial
           infarction.

           Considering that recovery of post-infarction LV function is favourably correlated to
           bone marrow derived stem cell mobilization induced by endogenous Granulocyte-Colony
           Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) [8-9], therapeutic stem cell mobilization was proposed as an
           alternative method to ameliorate post-infarction LV function. Several basic studies have
           supported this notion suggesting that stem cell mobilization might improve LV function
           by increasing stem cell homing in the damaged myocardium in addition to a favourable
           direct effect of G-CSF on LV myocardium [10-12].

           On these bases several studies have evaluated the effect of G-CSF on LV function in
           patients with myocardial result with mixed results [13]. In general, G-CSF was proven
           safe but the effect appeared modest. However, in patients with large myocardial
           infarction the effect was significant and clinically relevant approaching a 5% increase
           in LVEF. In particular in the Rigenera Trial conducted at the Catholic University of the
           Sacred Heart of Rome 41 patients with large anterior wall AMI at high risk of
           unfavorable remodeling were randomized 1:2 to Lenograstim (rhu G-CSF, Myelostim 34,
           Italfarmaco) (10 μg/kg/day for 5 days) or to conventional therapy. After a median
           follow-up of 5 months patients treated with Lenograstim exhibited improvement of 5% in
           LVEF, in the absence of LV dilation. In contrast, patients treated conventionally
           exhibited significant LV dilation in the absence of an improvement in LVEF [14]. In the
           present study, a subgroup of 8 patients randomized to Lenograstim received also the
           administration of a second-generation ultrasound contrast agent containing sulphur
           hexafluoride (SonoVue®, Bracco, Milan, Italy) administered intravenously (5 ml at 1
           ml/min) for myocardial opacification to collect diagnostic images by Myocardial Contrast
           Echocardiography. Interestingly, a post hoc analysis, revealed that only patients
           receiving Sonovue® showed a significant benefit on LV function [unpublished data]. This
           could be due to an increased homing effect of mobilized bone marrow derived stem cells
           due to the myocardial destruction of contrast medium-microbubbles by 3.5 MHz ultrasounds
           produced by the Echo machine. As this regard, two basic studies demonstrated that the
           highly focused ultrasound-mediated stimulation of microbubbles increased the migration
           of stem cells across the myocardial endothelium into the post-ischemic myocardium in
           vivo [15-16]. Moreover, long term (10 years) follow up data of the RIGENERA trial have
           been recently collected, confirming the safety of the procedure and a significant
           improvement of the quality of life assessed by NYHA functional class, Seattle Heart
           Failure Model, Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (p&lt;0.005) when
           compairing patients treated with G-CSF versus standard therapy. Data regarding efficacy,
           in terms of LVEF, end-diastolic volume and end-systolic volume are currently under
           analysis.

           On the basis of the previous results, The Recupero dall'Infarto miocardico con G-CSF E
           Nuovi Esempi di Rigenerazione Avanzata (RIGENERA 2.0) trial will specifically test the
           efficacy of the combined effect of subcutaneous Granulocyte - Colony Stimulating Factor
           and sulphur hexafluoride on post-infarction left ventricular function.

           1.2 BENEFIT-RISK ASSESSMENT In every clinical trial, anticipated benefits need to be
           weighed against the study associated risks. In previous investigations where G-CSF has
           been used, no G-CSF associated adverse reactions were reported. Only the MAGIC trial was
           prematurely stopped due to possible safety concerns in treated patients in terms of an
           unexpectedly high restenosis rate in stented vessels [17]. However, only three patients
           in the G-CSF group received angiographic follow-up, thus no clear conclusion about the
           incidence of restenosis should have reasonably be drawn from this study. In all other
           studies using G-CSF adverse events were comparable between patients and controls [13].
           Nevertheless G-CSF is largely used in oncology for treatment of febrile neutropenia and
           in hematology for this indication and for mobilization of stem cells for
           transplantation. As this regard G-CSF is considered reasonably safe without any
           association with a documented increase in malignancies [18].

           SonoVue has been shown to be safe and well tolerated with minimal risk to patients. In
           clinical trials, the overall incidence of adverse events was relatively low (10.7%
           overall, 5.2% investigational product-related) in subjects receiving SonoVue. The most
           frequently reported adverse events were headache (2.1%), nausea (0.9%), chest pain
           (0.8%), and chest discomfort (0.5%). All other adverse events occurred at a frequency of
           &lt;0.5%. Most adverse events were mild and resolved spontaneously within a short time
           without sequelae. Serious adverse events occurred in 0.43% of patients and only 0.08% of
           events were considered to be of some relationship to the administration of SonoVue
           (probable, possible, or unlikely). No product- related deaths were reported within
           MAH-sponsored trials.

           The anticipated benefits of RIGENERA 2.0 trial for study participants are expected
           better LV function, a parameter that is well-known to influence long-term outcome.
           Nevertheless, chiefs of the different Units involved in the present study will form a
           Data Monitoring Committee that will stop the study in case of an observed increase in
           the rate of adverse events.

        3. OVERALL DESIGN AND PLAN OF THE STUDY 3.1. OVERVIEW OF STUDY FLOW The RIGENERA 2.0 trial
           is a phase II placebo-controlled, randomized, open label, with Blinded Evaluation of
           end-points. One hundred and twenty STEMI patients are planned to be enrolled in 4
           Italian centers (Rome - Catholic University of the Sacred Heart, Ferrara, Pisa and
           Padua). Patients with an acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction as defined by the
           universal definition of AMI undergoing acute revascularization (i.e. either acute PCI
           within 24 hours of symptom onset or thrombolysis within 12 hours followed by acute PCI
           within 24 hours of symptom onset) will be screened at investigational sites. Patients
           who had acute PCI at institutions different from the investigational sites (recruiting
           centers) can also be included: interested patients may be referred for screening to any
           of the participating study sites within 3 to 4 days. Informed consent and assessment of
           eligibility of patients with respect to in- and exclusion criteria will be done at the
           recruiting centers. If all other eligibility criteria are met, echocardiography will be
           performed 3 to 6 days after the acute PCI and ejection fraction will be quantified. In
           case of LVEF≤45% the patient will be 1:1 electronically randomized to G-CSF and MCE or
           placebo and MCE according to site. Patients will be randomized to receive either
           subcutaneous Granulocyte - Colony Stimulating Factor (group 1) or Placebo (group 2) both
           added on top of optimal standard of care and Myocardial Contrast Echocardiography with
           intravenous infusion of sulphur hexafluoride.

      Lenograstim (rhu G-CSF, Myelostim 34, Italfarmaco) (5 µg/kg twice daily for 5 days,
      subcutaneously) or placebo (saline solution twice daily for 5 days, subcutaneously) will be
      administered at least 5 days after admission.

      Both in patients treated with Lenograstim (rhu G-CSF, Myelostim 34, Italfarmaco) and in
      patients treated with placebo, immediately before the first dose of Lenograstim (rhu G-CSF,
      Myelostim 34, Italfarmaco) or placebo and in the morning of the last day of treatment in
      which the peak of BMSC mobilization is expected, an echocardiogram using an echocardiographic
      contrast agent (Sonovue, Bracco) will be performed. In the days of administration of the drug
      or placebo, ECG, blood pressure, blood count and coagulation analyses will be monitored.

      In the case of muscle and bone pain or severe headache patients will be treated with
      paracetamol.

      In the case of leukocytosis (&gt; 40000/mcl) dose of G-CSF in 24 hours will be halved and in the
      case of leukocytosis (&gt; 70000/mcl) completely stopped.

      After hospital discharge, all study patients will return to the clinical centre for a follow
      up visit after 30 days. Six months after randomization all the patients will undergo
      outpatient Cardiac Magnetic Resonance and Conventional Echocardiography. At the same time,
      all patients will undergo Myocardial Contrast Echocardiography. At 1 year all patients will
      attend a final site visit at the clinical centers collecting any clinical event. However, all
      clinical endpoints will be reported as occurring throughout the follow up. Clinical Major
      adverse cardio-cerebrovascular events (death, myocardial infarction, stroke and
      re-hospitalization due to heart failure) at 1 year will be adjudicated by a clinical event
      committee blinded to the patient treatment allocation. This will ensure a consistent and
      unbiased adjudication of events across all investigational sites.

      3.2. STUDY POPULATION 3.2.1. Number of patients A total of approximately 120 male and female
      patients are planned to be enrolled in the RIGENERA 2.0 trial. Enrolment will involve 4

      4.2. PATIENT SCREENING AND RANDOMISATION Patients will be recruited based on the existing
      medical information from the pool of AMI patients at the clinical centres. Patients who had
      the primary PCI performed at clinical centres that are different from the recruiting centre
      can also be included: interested patients may be referred for screening to any of the
      participating study sites within 3 to 4 days. Informed consent and assessment of eligibility
      of patients with respect to inclusion and exclusion criteria will be done at the recruiting
      centre. Written informed consent must be obtained from patients prior to any study specific
      procedures. After consenting, patients undergo the procedures listed for the screening visit.
      After ensuring that a patient meets all other eligibility criteria, the investigator will
      perform the echocardiography and an electronic record of the echocardiography will be kept
      and transferred to the central Echocardiography Core Laboratory for following analyses. After
      local quantification of left ventricular ejection fraction, randomisation will be allowed for
      all patients with LVEF ≤ 45%. At randomization a patient number that will be used as the key
      identifier for the entire study period, will be supplied. Patients will be randomised to
      investigational therapy or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. Patients with a LVEF &gt; 45% will not be
      randomised, but will be classified as screening failures. Patients randomised but not treated
      will be replaced. Patients who discontinue the study after treatment, will not be replaced.

      4.3. DESCRIPTION OF STUDY ASSESSMENTS 4.3.1. Medical history / demographics A complete
      medical history will be obtained from each patient at the screening visit. Demographics,
      including gender, age and ethnic origin, and the smoking status will be recorded.

      4.3.2. Killip Class

      Patients will be ranked according to the Killip Class status. Definitions of the grading
      system are as follows:

      Class I: Absence of rales over the lung fields and absence of S3. No heart failure. No
      clinical signs of decompensation.

      Class II: Rales over 50% or less of the lung fields or the presence of an S3. Heart failure.
      Diagnostic criteria include rales, S3 gallop and venous hypertension.

      Class III: Rales over more than 50% of the lung fields. Severe heart failure. Frank pulmonary
      edema.

      Class IV: Cardiogenic shock. Hypotension (a systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mmHg for
      at least 30 minutes or the need for supportive measures to maintain a systolic blood pressure
      of greater than or equal to 90 mmHg), end-organ hypoperfusion (cool extremities or a urine
      output of less than 30 ml/h, and a heart rate of greater than or equal to 60 beats per
      minute). The hemodynamic criteria are a cardiac index of no more than 2.2 l/min per square
      meter of body-surface area and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of at least 15 mmHg.
      Signs include hypotension (systolic pressure &lt; 90 mm Hg) and evidence of peripheral
      vasoconstriction such as oliguria, cyanosis and diaphoresis. Heart failure, often with
      pulmonary oedema, has also been present in the majority of these patients.

      4.3.3. Physical examination All patients will undergo standard or abbreviated physical
      examinations. The standard examination is based on the following body systems: body
      temperature, HEENT (head, eyes, ears, nose, throat), respiratory system, cardiovascular
      system, abdomen, extremities, neurological system. The abbreviated physical examination
      consists of body temperature, respiratory system, cardiovascular system, and lymph nodes. The
      body weight will be determined at each physical examination. The body height will be obtained
      at screening only.

      4.3.4. Vital signs Blood pressure and heart rate at rest will be determined using a standard
      method.

      4.3.5. Electrocardiography A 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) will be recorded. ECGs will be
      recorded while the patient is resting in supine position. Abnormal findings in ECG recordings
      will be documented and the clinical relevance will be judged. A de-identified copy of the
      baseline ECG will be digitally stored.

      4.3.6. Clinical laboratory Blood sampling and sample analysis will be performed at the
      clinical centre. The local investigator is responsible for proper judgment of abnormal blood
      test results, and is responsible for appropriate patient care following clinically
      significant pathological results. Please refer to section 6.4.5 to determine whether an
      abnormal laboratory value may constitute an adverse event.

      The following analysis will be obtained at screening, daily during the five days of treatment
      (from day 0 to day 5) and at 5, 30 and 180 days:

      Screening:

      Hematology: Hemoglobin, hematocrit, Red blood count, white blood count, platelets
      Biochemistry: Serum creatinine, serum urea, serum uric acid, glutamic-oxaloacetic
      transaminase (GOT), glutamic-pyruvate transaminase (GPT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), total
      cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), high density lipoprotein cholesterol
      (HDL), triglycerides, glycosylated hemoglobin(HbA1c), Creatine kinase (CK), Creatine kinase
      muscle-brain(CK-MB), high sensitive troponin T hs-TnT, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor
      (VEGF), Insulin Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1), hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF), Stromal Derived
      Factor 1 alpha (SDF-1 alpha) Urine: Pregnancy test for woman of childbearing potential
      Coagulation: Prothrombin Time (PT), International Normalised Ratio (INR), activated partial
      thromboplastin time (aPTT) 4.3.7. Concomitant medications All patients participating in the
      trial should receive treatment according to evidence based guidelines. Concomitant
      medications will be recorded throughout the study.

      4.3.8. Standard Echocardiography A resting echocardiogram at enrollment and at 4-6 months
      will be recorded and digitally stored. See details in 5.3.1 Only if the patient qualifies
      with LVEF ≤ 45% in the local reading, the patients will be randomised

      4.3.9. Investigational therapy/placebo Lenograstim (rhu G-CSF, Myelostim 34, Italfarmaco) (5
      µg/kg twice daily for 5 days, subcutaneously) or placebo (saline solution twice daily for 5
      days, subcutaneously) will be administered at least 5 days after admission.

      Both in patients treated with Lenograstim (rhu G-CSF, Myelostim 34, Italfarmaco) and in
      patients treated with placebo, immediately before the first dose of Lenograstim (rhu G-CSF,
      Myelostim 34, Italfarmaco) or placebo and in the morning of the last day of treatment in
      which the peak of BMSC mobilization is expected, an echocardiogram using an echocardiographic
      contrast agent (Sonovue, Bracco) will be performed in the days of administration of the drug
      or placebo, ECG, blood pressure, blood count and coagulation analyses will be monitored.

      In the case of muscle and bone pain or severe headache patients will be treated with
      paracetamol.

      In the case of leukocytosis (&gt; 40000/mcl) dose of G-CSF in 24 hours will be halved and in the
      case of leukocytosis (&gt; 70000/mcl) completely stopped.

      Patients will be safely discharged on the basis of laboratory data.

      4.4. DURATION OF THE STUDY 4.4.1. Study duration for study patients Each enrolled patient
      will remain in the study throughout the entire study duration, with a minimum follow-up of 1
      year for each patient. A study patient's participation may be terminated early for reasonable
      cause, such as the investigator's medical decision. At any time, the patient has the right to
      withdraw consent without a negative impact on her/his medical treatment. However, the
      investigators are encouraged to ask for the patient's permission for further follow-up
      telephone contacts from those whose decision for discontinuation was based on the need for
      further outpatient visits.

      4.4.2. Duration of the whole study Patients will be enrolled during a recruitment phase of
      approximately 2 years. Since minimum study duration for one patient is one year, the overall
      study duration is approximately 3 years. The Data Monitoring Committee may terminate the
      study earlier based on safety concerns at any time, or based on the interim efficacy
      analysis. Competent authorities/ethics committees retain the right for premature termination
      of the study according to applicable regulations. At an individual study centre, the study
      may be terminated early if the work performed is not compliant with Good Clinical Practice
      (GCP).
