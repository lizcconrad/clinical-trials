  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients undergoing ambulatory shoulder arthroscopy experience moderate to severe pain
      after surgery. Finding ways to minimize postoperative pain are ideal. Dexamethasone is a
      corticosteroid that is commonly used to prevent and/or treat nausea and inflammation. The
      addition of higher doses of dexamethasone to nerve blocks, which are injections of local
      anesthetics into the upper shoulder area, has been shown to prolong block duration and reduce
      pain. However, it is unclear whether the advantage of longer pain relief outweighs patient
      dissatisfaction with the prolonged feeling of a numb arm. Furthermore, recent studies have
      shown that systemic, intravenously administered dexamethasone may similarly reduce pain
      levels when compared with dexamethasone in the block. In our study, the investigators propose
      to examine the effect of low-dose IV versus block dexamethasone on interscalene block
      duration in patients undergoing shoulder arthroscopy. Most studies have used 4 mg or more.
      One study suggests that 1 mg may have the same effect as larger doses. Our aims are to
      determine whether the addition of low-dose dexamethasone to a local anesthetic in the block
      can prolong its duration, and whether there are differences in postoperative pain,
      consumption of painkillers, side effects, and satisfaction in patients who received IV or
      block dexamethasone. Patients (128 total) will be randomly assigned to either receive IV or
      block dexamethasone, and postoperative assessments (pain, painkiller use, side effects, block
      duration, satisfaction, complications) will be made via phone at 2, 3, 4 (if needed), and
      7-10 days after surgery. Results from this study will reveal whether patients prefer the
      longer-duration analgesia that may be obtained with low-dose dexamethasone in the block.
