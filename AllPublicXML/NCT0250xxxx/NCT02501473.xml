  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2 open label trial of G100 in patients with low grade NHL. G100 is composed
      of glucopranosyl lipid A in a stable emulsion and is a potent TLR4 (toll-like receptor-4)
      agonist. G100 will be administered by direct injection (intratumorally) into tumors of low
      grade NHL following standard low dose radiation therapy. Preclinical models and clinical
      studies in other cancers such as Merkel cell carcinoma have demonstrated that G100
      administered in this manner can alter the tumor microenvironment, activate dendritic cells, T
      cells and other immune cells and induce systemic anti-tumor immune responses. In this trial,
      the safety, immunogenicity, and clinical efficacy of G100 will be examined alone or with
      pembrolizumab.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center Phase 1/2 open label trial of intratumoral G100 in patients with low
      grade NHL. Patients with NHL who are to be treated with local radiation will be enrolled and
      receive G100 to an accessable tumor mass. Clinical response will be evaluated in the injected
      lesion and systemic (abscopal) responses will be evaluated in distal areas involved with
      tumor.

      The study will be conducted in 3 parts. In Part 1, Dose Escalation, 2 sequentially enrolled
      cohorts of patients will be treated at one of 2 dose levels of G100 using a standard
      escalation design. In this portion of the study, both follicular and marginal zone NHL will
      eligible. In Part 2, 2 groups of patients with follicular NHL may be examined. One group will
      be randomly assigned to receive either single agent G100 intratumorally at the maximum safe
      dose determined in Part 1 following local radiation or will receive the same treatment
      regimen sequentially administered with pembrolizumab. A second treatment group may be
      explored if the safety profile in Part 1 is acceptable. In this optional group, patients with
      injectable tumors of 4 cm or greater would be enrolled and treated with a higher dose of
      G100. In Part 3, expansion of a higher dose (20µg of G100) in patients with follicular NHL
      will be enrolled to receive local radiation therapy and intratumoral G100 (no tumor size
      requirement in this arm).

      The primary goal of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of different doses
      of G100 when administered by intratumoral injection. The development of anti-tumor immune
      responses and preliminary evidence of clinical responses in local and distal tumor sites will
      also be examined.
