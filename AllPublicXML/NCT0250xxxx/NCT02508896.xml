  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study AFF012 is a single blind, single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel
      group, phase I clinical trial of repeated administration by subcutaneous injection of a
      single dose of one of two different proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 targeting
      AFFITOPE® vaccines or Placebo. This study will assess Safety, Immunogenicity and low density
      lipoprotein cholesterol-lowering activity of the two vaccines.

      72 healthy subjects are divided into three test groups (2 treatment groups, 1 placebo group),
      each consisting of 24 subjects. The subjects are randomized to receive either of two
      AFFITOPEs® (AT04A or AT06A, adsorbed to 1 mg aluminium oxyhydroxide) or placebo (1 mg
      aluminium oxyhydroxide).

      The study consists of 3 parts, part A, encompassing Visit 1 to Visit 8, covering 3 priming
      immunizations at a dose of 15μg at days 0, 28 and 56 and the immediate observation period
      extending to day 140; the prolonged observation period: part B, encompassing Visit 9 and
      Visit 10 at days 273 and 365; and part C consisting of 7 visits (V11 to V17). Study
      participants having received 3 priming vaccinations and having completed part B will receive
      in part C one boost immunization at a dose of 75μg, which will be applied one year after the
      3rd immunization (day 420). Probands will proceed directly from part A to part B and to part
      C. Continuation of parts B and C will be considered based on the part A results, primarily
      the immunological results. The following scenarios apply (provided that there is no safety
      issue). None of the two treatment groups exhibits a vaccine-specific antibody response over
      the placebo group at Visit 8 - this will lead to termination of the trial. One of the two
      groups fails to exhibit a vaccine-specific antibody response over the placebo group at Visit
      8 - this will lead to its discontinuation; the other treatment group and the placebo group
      will be continued.
