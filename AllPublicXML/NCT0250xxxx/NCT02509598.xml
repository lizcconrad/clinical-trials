  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Open label, non-randomized, multi-center, within-subject comparative study to evaluate the
      tolerability and the diagnostic utility of Lymphoseek with optional comparison to VBD in
      pediatric subjects with melanoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, or other solid tumor. Subject age will
      range from neonatal through 17 years.

             physician-approved contraceptive methods simultaneously or practice complete
             abstinence while on study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has had preoperative radiation therapy

          -  Has had previous surgery or radiation to node basins that would be involved in the
             intraoperative lymph node mapping (ILM) procedure

          -  Has a known allergy to dextran or VBD (if intended to be used)

          -  Has a history of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependency in the 3 years before study
             entry, or is an alcoholic or drug addict, as determined by the investigator

          -  Before the administration of Lymphoseek, has received any radiopharmaceutical within 7
             radioactive half-lives of that radiopharmaceutical
