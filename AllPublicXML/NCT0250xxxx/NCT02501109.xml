      The purpose of this study is to compare the rate and extent of absorption of Aripiprazole
      Oral Soluble Film 10 mg (Test) versus Abilify® 10 mg tablet (Reference) in healthy male
      volunteers

    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a single centre, bioavailability, open-label, randomized, single-dose,
      3-period, 6-sequence, crossover study under fasting conditions. Each volunteer will be given
      a single dose of the Test formulation in two study periods (with and without water), and a
      single dose of the Reference formulation (with water) in the other study period.
