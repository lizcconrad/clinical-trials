    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically and/or cytologically confirmed pancreatic adenocarcinoma

          2. Stage IV disease (metastatic only)

          3. No prior systemic therapy for their diagnosis (except in adjuvant setting&gt;six months
             previously)

          4. ECOG performance status of 0-1

          5. At least 18 years of age

          6. Evidence of either or both of the following RECIST-defined measurable disease (lesions
             that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension with the longest diameter ≥
             20mm using conventional techniques or ≥10 mm with spiral CT scan)

          7. Female patients must be either surgically sterile or postmenopausal, or if of
             childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test (serum or urine) prior to
             enrollment and agree to use effective barrier contraception during the period of
             therapy. Oral, implantable, or injectable contraceptives may be affected by cytochrome
             P450 interactions, and are therefore not considered effective for this study. Male
             patients must be surgically sterile or must agree to use effective contraception
             during the period of therapy. The definition of effective contraception will be based
             on the judgment of the investigator.

          8. Adequate bone marrow function:

               -  ANC ≥ 1500/uL

               -  platelet count ≥ 100,000/uL

               -  hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL

          9. Adequate hepatic function:

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN or until 2mg/dL

               -  AST (SGOT) ≤ 2.5 X ULN

               -  ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 X ULN

         10. Adequate renal function as determined by either:

             - Calculated or measured creatinine clearance ≥ 40 mL/min (for calculated creatinine
             clearance, Cockroft-Gault equation will be used).

         11. Ability to understand the nature of this study protocol and give written informed
             consent.

         12. Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans, laboratory
             tests, and other study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or
             clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition
             that, in the opinion of the investigator, renders the subject at high risk from
             treatment complications or might affect the interpretation of the results of the
             study.

          2. Presence of central nervous system or brain metastases.

          3. Life expectancy &lt; 12 weeks

          4. Pregnancy (positive pregnancy test) or lactation.

          5. Pre-existing sensory neuropathy &gt; grade 1.

          6. Clinically significant cardiac disease (e.g. congestive heart failure, symptomatic
             coronary artery disease and cardiac arrhythmias not well controlled with medication)
             or myocardial infarction within the last 12 months.

          7. Major surgery within 4 weeks of the start of study treatment, without complete
             recovery.

          8. Prior malignancy except for adequately treated basal cell skin cancer, in situ
             cervical cancer, adequately treated Stage I or II cancer from which the patient is
             currently in complete remission, or any other form of cancer from which the patient
             has been disease-free for 5 years.
