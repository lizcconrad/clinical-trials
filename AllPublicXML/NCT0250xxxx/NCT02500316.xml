          2. History of radiation therapy or chemotherapy.

          3. Malnourished children defined as:

               1. Serum albumin below the lower limit of normal (LLN) according to the reference
                  ranges of central laboratory;

               2. Serum iron below the lower limit of normal (LLN) according to the reference
                  ranges of central laboratory;

               3. BMI &lt; -2 Standard Deviation for age and sex;

          6. Presence of anti-hGH antibodies at screening.

          7. Any clinically significant abnormality likely to affect growth or the ability to
             evaluate growth, such as, but not limited to, chronic diseases like renal
             insufficiency, spinal cord irradiation, etc.

          8. Patients with diabetes mellitus.

          9. Patients with impaired fasting sugar (based on WHO; fasting blood sugar &gt;110 mg/dl or

         11. Closed epiphyses.

         12. Concomitant administration of other treatments that may have an effect on growth such
             as anabolic steroids and methylphenidate for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
             (ADHD), with the exception of hormone replacement therapies (thyroxine,
             hydrocortisone, desmopressin (DDAVP))

         13. Children requiring glucocorticoid therapy (e.g. asthma) who are taking a dose of
             greater than 400 Âµg/d of inhaled budesonide or equivalents for longer than 1 month
             during a calendar year.

         14. Major medical conditions and/or presence of contraindication to r-hGH treatment.

         15. Known or suspected HIV-positive patient, or patient with advanced diseases such as

             to study conduct.

         20. Participation in any other trial of an investigational agent within 30 days prior to
             Screening.
