    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if pembrolizumab, an infusion of
      T-cells, chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide and fludarabine), and either high or low dose
      interleukin-2 (IL-2) can help to control metastatic melanoma. The safety of this drug
      combination will also be studied.

      T-cells are white blood cells in your body that are important to the immune system. The
      T-cells used in this study will be collected and grown in a separate study (MD Anderson
      Protocol 2004-0069)

      This is an investigational study. Cyclophosphamide is FDA approved and commercially available
      for the treatment of several types of cancer such as leukemia, lymphoma, and breast cancer.
      Fludarabine is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of B-cell chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia. It is considered investigational to give cyclophosphamide and
      fludarabine to treat melanoma.

      High dose IL-2 is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of metastatic
      melanoma and a type of kidney cancer. If you are assigned to receive low-dose IL-2, the drug
      will be provided by the supporting company Prometheus at no cost to you.

      Pembrolizumab is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of melanoma.

      T-cells are not FDA approved or commercially available. This therapy is currently being used
      for research purposes only.

      The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 36 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as
      in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 treatment groups (treatment arms):

        -  If you are assigned to Arm A, you will receive high-dose IL-2.

        -  If you are assigned to Arm B, you will receive low-dose IL-2.

      Both you and the study staff will know to which dose of IL-2 you have been assigned.

      The dose level of cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, you receive will depend on your weight and
      what the study doctor thinks is in your best interest. The dose of T-cells that you receive
      will depend on the amount than can be made by the lab. You will receive a fixed dose of
      pembrolizumab.

      Study Drug Administration:

      The days leading up to Day 1 of the study are considered negative days. For example, the day
      before Day 0 is Day -1. Day 0 is when you will receive the T-cells (described below).

      You will stay in the hospital to receive the T-cells, chemotherapy, and IL-2 starting on Day
      -7. You may stay in the hospital up to 3 weeks.

      On Days -7 and -6, you will receive cyclophosphamide by vein over about 2 hours.

      On Days -5 to -1, you will receive fludarabine by vein over about 15-30 minutes.

      On Day 0, you will receive T-cells through a central venous catheter (CVC) over about 15-60
      minutes. A CVC is a thin flexible tube that is inserted into the body. The catheter may be
      placed into a vein in your arm or in a large vein in your neck. If the cells need to be given
      through a large vein in your upper chest or in your neck, the area will be numbed with
      anesthetic before the catheter is put in. Tylenol (acetaminophen) will be given by mouth
      before the T-cell infusion to decrease the risk of these side effects.

      If you are assigned to Arm B, you will receive low dose IL-2 as an injection under the skin
      (like a shot) 1 time each day for 14 days. Other catheters may be needed in 1 or both of your
      arms to give you fluids, drugs, or extra nutrition. You will sign a separate consent form for
      the catheter, which will describe the procedure and its risks in more detail.

      On Day 1, if you are assigned to Arm A, you will receive a high dose of IL-2 by catheter over
      about 15 minutes every 8-16 hours for up to 5 days.

      On Day 21 (+/- 7 days) and then every 3 weeks after that, you will receive pembrolizumab by
      vein over 30 minutes.

      You will be given standard drugs by vein to help decrease the risk of side effects. You may
      ask the study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks.

      Study Visits:

      Before the start of treatment:

      Within 28 days before your hospital stay:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  Blood (about 4 ½ tablespoons) will be drawn to check what type of T-cells you have in
           your body.

      Every 1-2 days during your hospital stay, blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine
      tests.

      If the blood tests performed at screening showed you had CMV in the past, on Days 0 and 3,
      blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to check for CMV.

      On Day 7, blood (about 4½ tablespoons) will be drawn to study different types of T-cells and
      how active they are in the body.

      On Days 21 and 42 and then every 3 weeks after that (Weeks 12, 15, 18, and so on):

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  On Day 21 only, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to test for CMV.

        -  On Days 21 and 42 only, you will also a tumor biopsy to check the status of the disease,
           if the doctor thinks it is safe. The type of biopsy you have will depend on the size and
           location of the tumor. Your doctor will discuss this with you.

        -  On Days 21 and 42 only, blood (about 4½ tablespoons) will be drawn to study different
           types of T-cells and how active they are in the body.

      On Day 63 and then every 12 weeks after that (Weeks 21, 33, 45, and so on):

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 4½ tablespoons) will be drawn to study different types of T-cells and how
           active they are in the body.

        -  You will have a CT, MRI, and/or PET/CT scan.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests. This routine
           blood and urine collection will also include a pregnancy test, if you can become
           pregnant.

        -  On Day 63 only, you will have an EKG.

        -  You will fill out the 2 questionnaires about your quality of life.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed and safe, you will have a tumor biopsy to check the
           status of the disease.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have photographs taken of any skin lesions.

      You may have any of the above tests/procedures repeated at any time during the study, if the
      doctor thinks it is needed.

      Length of Study Drug Dosing:

      You may receive up to 2 years of pembrolizumab. You will only receive T-cells, chemotherapy,
      and IL-2 one time (while you are hospitalized). You will no longer be able to take the study
      drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to
      follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after you have completed the follow-up visits.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      As soon as you stop taking pembrolizumab:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to study different types of T-cells and how
           active they are in the body.

        -  You will have a CT, MRI, and/or PET/CT scan.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have photographs taken of any skin lesions.

      Follow-Up:

      After you have completed up to 2 years of pembrolizumab, you will be called every 3 months by
      a member of the study staff to ask how you are doing and if you are having any side effects.
      The call will last about 15 minutes.

          2. Primary immunodeficiency and need for chronic steroid therapy, Exception: Patients on
             chronic physiologic dose of steroid equivalent to prednisone &lt; 10 mg/day is allowed.

          3. Patients who are pregnant or nursing.

          4. Presence of a significant psychiatric disease, which in the opinion of the principal
             investigator or his designee, would prevent adequate informed consent.

          5. Turnstile II - Treatment: Is currently participating in or has participated in a study
             of an investigational agent or using an investigational device within 4 weeks of the
             first dose of treatment.

          6. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any
             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to initiation of
             lymphodepletion. Exception: Patients on chronic physiologic dose of steroid equivalent
             to prednisone &lt; 10 mg/day is allowed.

          7. Has not recovered (i.e., &lt;/= Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to
             investigational or standard agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          8. Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy
             within 2 weeks prior to lymphodepletion or who has not recovered (i.e., &lt;/= Grade 1 or
             at baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent. - Note:
             Subjects with &lt;/= Grade 2 neuropathy, alopecia, hypophysitis stable on physiologic
             dose of steroid equivalent to prednisone &lt; 10 mg/day, hypothyroidism stable on hormone
             replacement are an exception to this criterion and may qualify for the study. - Note:
             If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the
             toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy.

             Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the
             skin, or in situ cervical cancer that has undergone potentially curative therapy.

         10. Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous
             meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided
             they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks
             prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned
             to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using
             steroids for at least 7 days prior to initiation of lymphodepletion.

         11. Has an active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment within the past 3 months
             or a documented history of clinically severe autoimmune disease. Subjects with
             vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy would be an exception to this rule.
             Subjects that require intermittent use of bronchodilators or local steroid injections
             would not be excluded from the study. Subjects with hypothyroidism stable on hormone
             replacement or Sjorgen's syndrome will not be excluded from the study. Subjects with
             hypophysitis stable on physiologic dose of steroid will not be excluded from the
             study.

         12. Has evidence of interstitial lung disease or has a history of non-infectious
             pneumonitis that required steroids or current pneumonitis.

         13. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.

         14. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

         15. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit
