  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) has long been a practical and effective therapeutic modality
      for various settings of management in radiation oncology. For example, the indications for
      WBRT should include brain metastasis or metastases, the setting of prophylactic cranial
      irradiation (PCI) used mainly for patients with limited-stage small cell lung cancer, and
      even some patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer. The rationales for WBRT are
      essentially based on that it can target both microscopic and gross intracranial disease.

      In addition to providing rapid alleviation of neurologic symptoms and enhanced intracranial
      disease control, WBRT might also prolong the time to develop neurocognitive function (NCF)
      decline. However, paradoxically NCF decline can also occur due to a sequel of WBRT. In terms
      of the time course of WBRT-induced NCF decline, it might vary considerably according to the
      specific domains which are selected to be measured. Early neurocognitive decline occurs
      within the first 1 - 4 months after WBRT for brain metastases. The domains of early
      neurocognitive decline principally involve verbal and short-term memory recall.

      Since several decades ago, it has been understood that hippocampus plays an essential role in
      memory function. Not little evidence supports that radiation-induced damage to hippocampus
      should be strongly associated with NCF impairment. Furthermore, several studies have shown
      that isodose distribution in hippocampus is closely related to neurocognitive function in
      patients with benign or low-grade brain tumors. As a consequence, it is hypothesized that
      conformal hippocampal sparing during the course of WBRT (HS-WBRT) might provide significant
      preservation in terms of cognitive function.

      This prospective cohort study aims to explore and evaluate the impact of the delivery of
      HS-WBRT on the pattern of NCF change and the extent of NCF decline in patients receiving
      prophylactic or therapeutic WBRT. As compared with previous related and relevant studies, it
      will also be investigated whether neurocognitive functional preservation can be achieved via
      the integration of hippocampal sparing with the course of WBRT.

To achieve conformal hippocampal sparing during the delivery of whole brain radiation (WBRT), the technique of volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) via Linac‐based RapidArc®.In terms of dose prescription, a dose of 30 Gy in 12 fractions was prescribed to whole-brain planning target volume (PTV) if the role of RT was considered either adjuvant following craniotomy with tumor removal or therapeutic for treating oligometastatic brain disease.</description>
