      We seek to compare biochemically and histologically the nasal cartilage and ear in the
      newborn cleft lip and slot carrier in order to improve the quality of care and patient
      comfort after surgery of cheilorhinoplasty which is the primary treatment slots .

      The concentration of hyaluronic acid as well as in type 1 collagen and 3 are assayed by
      immunohistochemistry and study of mRNA and then they are compared according to the type of
      cartilage.

      This comparison is done on nasal cartilage samples and atrial newborns holders of cleft lip
      and operated in the neonatal period.

      Given the difficulty and constraint of time it takes to reach the 20 subjects of our study ,
      we will also add to our population the stillborn babies before 25SA and newborns who die
      before the age of 28 days and having had an autopsy.
