    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to determine the early diagnosis rate and mortality rate of the
      Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC) in the study population.

      The secondary objective is to determine the incidence of NPC in the study population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research is to evaluate the effect of NPC screening, also as an extended study of
      Screening for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma in High Risk Populations (NCT00941538).

      The program was conducted in Xiaolan and Minzhong towns of Zhongshan city in 2012.

      All participants will be tested for anti-EBV antibody by using serum samples. Participants
      are stratified into those having high, moderate and low antibody levels, those having
      moderate antibody levels are invited to retest annually in the following 3 years and those
      found to have high antibody levels on these occasions are referred to centers for diagnostic
      workup for NPC.
