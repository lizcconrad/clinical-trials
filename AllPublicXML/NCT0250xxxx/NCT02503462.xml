  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether a boosting by cobicistat results in similar
      concentrations of darunavir in the brain compared to a boosting by ritonavir.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cobicistat is a new pharmacokinetic enhancer or booster of the HIV protease inhibitor
      darunavir. Cobicistat is distinct from the conventional booster ritonavir in that cobicistat
      presents a more selective inhibition of the enzymes metabolizing drugs. In addition,
      cobicistat is a weaker inhibitor of the efflux drug transporters expressed at the level of
      the blood-brain barrier (i.e. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance Protein
      (BCRP)). A weaker inhibition of these efflux transporters could possibly result in less
      darunavir entering the brain when boosted by cobicistat as compared to a boosting by
      ritonavir. Such a difference could potentially be critical in patients with HIV-associated
      neurocognitive disorders as sufficient drug levels are needed to efficiently inhibit HIV
      replication inside the brain.

      The aim of this study is to determine whether the boosting of darunavir by cobicistat results
      effectively in lower darunavir concentrations in the CSF as compared to a boosting by
      ritonavir. The study will be performed in HIV infected patients presenting HIV associated
      neurocognitive disorders (HAND) and requiring a lumbar puncture for clinical reasons. In
      addition, the patients will be only eligible if the are treated or if they qualify for a
      darunavir/ritonavir (800/100 mg once daily) containing regimen. Darunavir concentrations will
      be measured simultaneously in the CSF and plasma (CSF/plasma ratio) first with the ritonavir
      boosting and subsequently with the cobicistat boosting.
