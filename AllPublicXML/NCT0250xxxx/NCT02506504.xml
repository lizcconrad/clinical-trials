    <textblock>
      In patients with severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), exercise tolerance is
      severely impaired due to a ventilatory limitation, levelling off the intensity of exercise.
      This reduces the physiological benefit of pulmonary rehabilitation. In these patients, it is
      then proposed to add an Inspiratory Pressure Support (IPS) in order to increase the intensity
      and the duration of every training session. In a preliminary study, the investigators showed
      that IPS applied during an exhaustive cycling exercise allowed to prevent the onset of
      post-exercise quadriceps fatigue evaluated by the endurance time to isotonic quadriceps
      contractions (TlimQ).

      The aim of this study is to determine the relationship between the prevention of
      post-exercise fatigue (TlimQ) and the change in training load (intensity x time x number of
      sessions) during a pulmonary rehabilitation programme. At the beginning of the training
      programme, 25 patients will be evaluated for TlimQ after a cycling exercise (70% maximal
      workload) with and without IPS in random order. The training load was then monitored at every
      exercise session of the programme.

    <description>At the beginning of the programme, we evaluate the influence of IPS on TlimQ (visits 2 and 3). After the training period, we repeated the same evaluations (visits 23 and 24). Then, we will compare this difference before and after the training period, and we will seek for a relation with the training load.</description>
