  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blepharoptosis, inferodisplacement of the upper eyelid, can be congenital or acquired.
      Acquired Blepharoptosis is usually aponeurotic, due to stretching or disinsertion of the
      levator aponeurosis. Treatment is surgical and can be performed by three common procedures -
      Levator advancement, Müller's muscle-conjunctival resection procedure and White line
      advancement. A number of reports inspected the possibility that Blepharoptosis repair
      procedures may cause deterioration in dry eye status. The investigators would like to assess
      whether there is a difference between the different procedures in their influence on dry eye
      status.
