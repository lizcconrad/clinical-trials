      This study evaluates the impact of a biomarked guided intervention on the development of
      acute kidney injury in high risk surgical patients. Eligible patients are screened for marker
      of tubular stress in the urine; if patient specific results are above a pre-defined cutoff
      they are randomized into a standard care group or an interventional group in which patients
      receive intensified volume therapy.

      This study evaluates the impact of a biomarked guided intervention on the development of
      acute kidney injury in high risk surgical patients.Used markers have been identified as
      markers of tubular stress and have been validated in previous studies with more than 1500
      patients. The advantage of a biomarker guided approach is the saving of time for the
      diagnosis a developing acute kidney injury (AKI) in high risk surgical patients, since
      clinical signs of AKI (rise in creatinine/decline of estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate
      (eGFR), decline of diuresis). If used biomarkers are above a predefined cutoff within &lt; 4
      hours after surgery, patients are randomized in to a standard care population receiving
      treatment in accordance with Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines. In
      the intervention population patients receive individual volume therapy (= balanced
      electrolyte solution (Ionosteril)) (1,25 ml/kg bw up to 5 ml/kg bw for 6 hours). Degree of
      volume therapy is estimated by several predifined parameters, e.g. central venous pressure
      (CVP).
