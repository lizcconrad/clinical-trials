  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The subjet of this study is to explore the effect of using virtual reality environment at the
      clinic and at home (using Timocco) on the motor and participation abilities of children with
      DCD (Developmental Coordination Disorder).

      The study will examine the efficacy of using virtual reality gaming environment (Timocco) for
      treating children with DCD and the use of remote therapy, by shifting the focus of therapy
      from the clinic to the home environment, using the remote control system of Timocco for home
      practice.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The efficacy of using VR (Virtual Reality) as a therapeutic tool as an integral part of
      Occupational Therapy intervention will be examined in this study. The study will be conducted
      in two stages: the first will be conducted at the Child Development Center of the Clalit HMO
      (Health Maintenance Organization), and the second will take place in the child's home.

      The first intervention will take approximately 8 to 10 weeks, during which eight data
      collection sessions will be conducted, each of 45 minutes duration.

      The study group will integrate the use of Timocco in occupational therapy sessions while the
      control group will be given conventional occupational therapy without using Timocco.

      In the second intervention, the study group will be given access to the virtual-reality
      environment of Timocco to be used at home, and will not include therapy sessions at the Child
      Development Center. An assessment before and after intervention will be held for both groups
      for comparison.

    <description>The study group will integrate the use of Timocco in occupational therapy sessions. The session will begin with 15 minutes of spatial activity involving sensory-motor practice, 15 minutes of activity in a virtual environment, and 15 minutes of structured activity at a desk.</description>

In order to ensure that the therapy sessions in this group have a structure similar to that one used in the study group, each session will include 25 to 30 minutes of spatial sensory-motor activity, followed by 15 to 20 minutes of structured practice at a desk.</description>
