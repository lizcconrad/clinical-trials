      Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a primitive myocardic disease and the first of genetic
      cardiac diseases. The definition of HCM is an increase of the myocardial thickness of the
      left ventricle (LV) wall without any other causes of hypertrophy. It's characterized by an
      important heterogeneity of prognosis and clinical expression going from a asymptomatic state
      until the devastating sudden death occurring in a young person.The diagnosis of HCM is
      definite by a myocardial thickness greater or equal to 15mm (or 13mm if there is a familial
      history).This hypertrophy is often accompanied by other abnormalities detected by
      echocardiography: dynamic left ventricular outflow obstruction at rest or stress, mitral
      regurgitation …Now, the current challenge is to determine the prognosis factors of the
      disease that could help to identify the patients with high risk of sudden death. Some
      prognosis factors are knowed and used in the calculation of a new risk score. This risk score
      allows to estimate the risk of sudden death at 5 years and propose depending on the result,
      the implantation of a defibrillator for primary prevention.The physiopathological mechanism
      of HCM is very complex and still misunderstood. Myocardial fibrosis could be a major
      mechanism of the disease evolution. Indeed, fibrosis is responsible of scar areas where
      ventricular tachycardia may develop. Moreover, if the fibrosis is very extensive, it can be
      the responsible of a systolic or diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle leading to heart
      failure.Myocardial ischemia caused by a microvascular dysfunction is now recognized as an
      important mechanism of the disease evolution. Acute ischemic events could be a trigger of
      malignant arrhythmia whereas chronic ischemia leads to fibrosis.Left ventricle function is
      long time preserved in HCM. Segmentary hypokinesia corresponding to extensive fibrosis
      appears at a very advanced stage of the disease. Exercice stress echocardiography permits to
      detect myocardial ischemia caused by microvascular dysfunction in the HCM before the fibrosis
      apparition. Moreover the investigators suggest to study the deformation parameters by speckle
      tracking or 2D strain witness of a contractile LV dysfunction before the apparition of
      segmentary hypokinesia.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is now recognized as the more
      sensible technique to identify focal myocardial fibrosis resulting in areas of late
      gadolinium enhancement (LGE). LGE is frequent in HCM and his extension is correlated with the
      severity of the hypertrophy and the risk of sudden death. Myocardial ischemia is detected by
      hypoperfused defects in the perfusion sequences and as LGE, is correlated with the degree of
      hypertrophy. Some studies using stress MRI with vasodilatator agent show inductible
      hypoperfused areas correlated to the degree of hypertrophy. T1 mapping is a new hopeful
      sequence of MRI permitting to detect the diffuse and early myocardial fibrosis. Some studies
      show that T1 mapping values are reduced in the areas of LGE in HCM but also in areas without
      LGE which reflects the presence of new fibrosis.The objective of study is to compare these
      two imagery techniques in order to detect ischemia and fibrosis. These techniques are usually
      used in the diagnosis or the monitoring of the disease. The investigators propose to realize
      an exercise stress echocardiography to study: the segmentary kinetic of the left ventricle
      and the 2D strain and a stress MRI to study the LGE, the stress perfusion and the T1
      mapping.Actually the investigators consider that LGE is a risk factor of the disease
      (although not yet involved in the calculation of the risk of sudden death) and need to be
      study in each MRI realized for HCM. From the same way, the investigators suggest to follow
      patients to determine if the abnormalities detected by these two techniques and particularly
      2D strain abnormalities, stress myocardial ischemia and T1 mapping abnormalities are
      prognosis factors of the disease and appear more precociously than LGE.

    <description>Cardiac MRI: is usually recommended in the diagnosis or in the follow-up of the disease. The MRI will respect the standard protocol: cineMRI sequences, perfusion sequences, LGE sequences at 10 minutes after gadolinium injection. The investigators will realize some additional sequences: T1 mapping before and after gadolinium injection to study the diffuse fibrosis and stress perfusion sequences after injection of a vasodilatator (Persantine°).
Exercice stress echocardiography: is realized almost systematically in all the diagnosis of HCM and it's very informative. The investigators will research left ventricular dysfunction: in particular segmentary hypokinesia and anomalies of deformation parameters (2D Strain) and the development of a dynamic left ventricular outflow obstruction or a mitral regurgitation at exercice.</description>
