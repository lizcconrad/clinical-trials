  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) pain treatment has limitations in terms of serious adverse effects and
      low efficacy. The investigators aimed to evaluate efficacy and safety of naproxen
      sodium/codeine phosphate combination in these patients.

      In this prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled clinical trial, 135
      patients with osteoarthritis, who were 40-65 years; applied to institution's orthopaedics
      outpatient clinic; had grade 1, 2, or 3 primary osteoarthritis diagnosed in last 1 year; and
      had Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) score≥40, and
      Visual Analogue Scale score≥40,were enrolled. Subjects were randomized (1:1) to placebo (n=
      67) or combination (n= 68) arms, in which 550 mg naproxen sodium/30mg codeine phosphate was
      given orally twice a day for 7 days. Rescue medicine was 500 mg paracetamol (max= 6
      tablets/day). Demographic characteristics, medical history, adverse events, VAS and WOMAC
      scores were collected in study visits performed within 10days.The study was approved by local
      institutional ethics committee and written informed consents were obtained from all
      participants.
