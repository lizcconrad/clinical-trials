  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to investigate the clinical efficacy and safety of pramlintide
      co-administered as a fixed-dose ratio with basal-bolus SC insulin, delivered simultaneously
      via 2 separate pumps, in subjects with type 1 diabetes who are failing to achieve the desired
      level of glycemic control using insulin therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Potentially eligible subjects with Type 1 diabetes mellitus who are treated with with a
      basal-bolus insulin regimen through multiple daily injections or insulin pump at a total
      daily insulin dose ≤60 U, will be eligible. Visit 1 is approximately 3-6 weeks prior to
      randomization. Given some variability in HbA1c and C-peptide assays, re-testing for HbA1c and
      C-peptide can be performed within 18 days from the initial visit. Visit 2 is approximately
      2-5 weeks prior to randomization. Subjects are on lispro insulin throughout study except
      during Visit 4 and Visit 5, the domicile 24 hr treatment period, when they are switched to
      regular insulin U-100.

      Screen failed patients may be re-screened for inclusion in the study, as long as re-screening
      takes place at least 3 months after the original screening visit. If a subject is
      re-screened, he/she must continue to meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria. All study
      procedures of initial Visit 1 must be repeated at the re-screening visit.
