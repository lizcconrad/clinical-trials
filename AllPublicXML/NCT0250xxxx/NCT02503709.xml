      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of onalespib and CDKI AT7519 in
      treating patients with solid tumors that have spread from the primary site (place where they
      started) to other places in the body (metastatic) or cannot be removed by surgery. Onalespib
      and CDKI AT7519 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for
      cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To establish the safety, tolerability, and the maximum tolerated dose of the combination
      of onalespib and AT7519M (CDKI AT7519).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the pharmacokinetics of the combination of onalespib and AT7519M.

      II. To assess the pharmacodynamic effect of the combination of onalespib and AT7519M on HSP70
      expression and modulation of HSP90 client proteins in peripheral blood mononuclear cells
      (PBMCs) and plasma.

      III. To observe and record anti-tumor activity.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive onalespib intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1 and 4 (course 0 only).
      Patients then receive onalespib IV over 1 hour and CDKI AT7519 IV over 1 hour on days 1, 4,
      8, and 11 (course 1 and subsequent courses thereafter). Courses repeat every 21 days (7 days
      for course 0 only) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
