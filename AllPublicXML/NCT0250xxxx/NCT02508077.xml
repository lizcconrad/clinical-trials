      This phase II trial studies how well fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, and irinotecan
      hydrochloride (FOLFIRI) together with panitumumab work in treating patients with colorectal
      cancer that expresses the RAS and B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase (BRAF)
      wild-type genes, has spread from the original site of growth to another part of the body
      (metastatic), resists the effects of treatment with prior cetuximab (or panitumumab) plus
      irinotecan hydrochloride-based therapy, and who have failed at least one subsequent
      non-anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) containing treatment regimen. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, and irinotecan hydrochloride, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving more than one drug
      (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells. Monoclonal antibodies, such as
      panitumumab, may block tumor growth in different ways by targeting certain cells. Giving
      FOLFIRI together with panitumumab may be an effective treatment for colorectal cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate the response rate (RR) and progression-free survival (PFS) with FOLFIRI +
      panitumumab in patients with acquired resistance to panitumumab (or cetuximab) + irinotecan
      (irinotecan hydrochloride)-based therapy after a documented clinical response or prolonged
      PFS and following progression on a subsequent non-anti-EGFR containing regimen in extended
      RAS wild-type and BRAF wild-type patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate the overall survival (OS) in the re-challenge populations.

      II. Describe the safety of re-challenge in this population.

      III. Investigate the impact of PFS, RR on prior anti-EGFR + irinotecan-based exposure on the
      response and PFS on the current study.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Collect serial plasma samples to investigate the incidence of RAS and BRAF mutation in
      circulating free deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) at baseline, every 2 months, and at the time to
      progression (and following progression when feasible).

      II. Collect serial plasma samples for future biomarker exploration, including the potential
      investigation of micro-ribonucleic acid (RNA).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive panitumumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes, irinotecan hydrochloride
      IV over 90 minutes, leucovorin calcium orally (PO), and fluorouracil IV over 46 hours on day
      1. Courses repeat every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3
      months thereafter.

    <description>Standard descriptive methods will be used to summarize the role of mutational status and other studies. If the combination is not found to have sufficient activity, these patterns may help explain the lack of activity. If sufficient activity is found, then participants who experience an objective response will be compared to those who did not in terms of correlates. Estimates of variation will also prove useful for future clinical research on this regimen.</description>
