  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of SM04554 at concentrations of
      0.15% and 0.25%. Improved knowledge of the changes in hair counts and immunohistochemical
      analysis associated with androgenetic alopecia (AGA) before and after treatment with SM04554
      and compared to placebo may lead to a greater understanding of the underlying mechanisms of
      action of SM04554.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Willing to inform females, with whom they may interact, that they are using a topical

          -  Use of semi-permanent hair products (e.g., color, texturizers, relaxers) within 30
             days prior to study start

             any prescription shampoo or conditioner as well as any over-the-counter medicated
             shampoo or conditioner, such as those for treatment of dandruff or promoting hair
             growth) within 30 days prior to study start

          -  History of hair transplants

          -  Current use of an occlusive wig, hair extensions, or hair weaves

          -  Participation in any other investigational drug or medical device trial which included

             start

          -  Poor peripheral venous access

          -  Subjects who are immediate family members (spouse, parent, child, or sibling;
             biological or legally adopted) of personnel directly affiliated with the study at the
