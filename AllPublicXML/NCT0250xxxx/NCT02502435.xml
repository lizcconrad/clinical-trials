  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study wishes to look at the 24-hour rhythm of certain fats in the blood stream. Recent
      studies in animals and healthy participants suggest that unusual eating habits may be
      connected to a change in the 24-hour rhythm of the blood fats the investigators wish to
      measure. The investigators will ask persons suffering from night eating syndrome, a condition
      where people eat additional meals throughout the night, to participate in this study. Healthy
      volunteers who are of the same age and gender, and have a comparable body-mass-index, a
      number calculated from a person's weight and height, will also be asked to participate.

      The aim is to learn how the 24-hour rhythm of the blood fats the investigators measure
      differs between the persons experiencing the night eating episodes and persons who do not.

      A disease mechanism driving the clinical symptomology of the Night Eating Syndrome (NES) may
      be a metabolome, polyunsaturated fatty acids in particular, disrupted in its oscillations
      throughout the course of day and night. Blood and stool samples will be repeatedly taken
      during a 3-night/2-day protocol from NES patients and healthy controls with lights dimmed to
      20 lux and time cues removed. Body core temperature and physical activity during the study
      will be monitored continuously.

        Patients with Night-Eating Syndrome: Participants have to meet both of the criteria for
        nocturnal ingestions and evening hyperphagia; eat 30% of their caloric intake after dinner
        with nocturnal wake ups to eat at a frequency of ≥ 5 times per week.

        Matching healthy participants: Participantswill be matched to a patient with Night-Eating
        Syndrome by gender, age and BMI.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Volunteers must be in good health as based on medical history, physical examination,
             vital signs, and laboratory tests as deemed by PI, BMI of 27-32;

          -  Volunteers are capable of giving informed consent;

          -  18-65 years of age;

          -  Non-smoking; and

          -  Non-pregnant, female subjects must consent to a urine pregnancy test.

          -  Control subjects eat less than 25% of their caloric intake after dinner without
             nocturnal ingestions;

          -  NES patients have to meet both of the criteria for nocturnal ingestions and evening
             hyperphagia; eat 30% of their caloric intake after dinner with nocturnal wake ups to
             eat at a frequency of ≥ 5 times per week

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Recent travel across time zones (within the past month);

          -  Planned travel across time zones during the planned study activities;

             weeks prior to screening;
