    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study to evaluate efficacy, safety, toxicity, and feasibility of the
      addition of enzalutamide to leuprolide for a total duration of 24 months in patients with
      very high-risk prostate cancer or pelvic node positive disease receiving radiotherapy. Very
      high-risk prostate cancer is defined as 2 or more of the following characteristics: 1)
      cT3a/b, 2) PSA ≥20 and &lt;150, 3) Gleason 8-10, and 4) ≥33% core involvement.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically confirmed diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate within 180 days

               -  PSA ≥20

               -  Gleason score 8-10

               -  ≥33% core involvement OR any patient with pelvic lymph node involvement ≥1cm as
                  determined by pelvic CT or MRI imaging will meet eligibility criteria for
                  enrollment.

          2. Standard staging exams for patients with high-risk prostate cancer including bone scan
             or NaF PET/CT scan, and pelvic and prostate MRI.

          3. No distant metastases (M0) on bone scan or NaF PET/CT within 90 days prior to
             registration. Equivocal bone scan findings are allowed if the physician determines
             that distant metastases are unlikely based on clinical judgment.

          4. Zubrod Performance Status 0-2 within 60 days prior to enrollment.

          5. Age ≥18

          6. Complete blood count (CBC) with differential obtained within 30 days prior to
             registration on study, with adequate bone marrow function defined as follows:

               1. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1,800 cells/mm3

               2. Platelets ≥100,000 cells/mm3

               3. Hemoglobin ≥8.0 g/dl (The use of transfusion or other intervention to achieve Hgb
                  ≥ 8.0 g/dl is acceptable)

               4. Serum creatinine &lt;2.0 mg/dl and creatinine clearance &gt;40 mL/min within 30 days
                  prior to registration

          7. Patients, even if surgically sterilized (i.e., status post vasectomy), who:

               1. Agree to practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study
                  treatment period and for 4 months (120 days) after the last dose of study drug,
                  or

               2. Agree to completely abstain from intercourse

          8. Patient must be able to provide study-specific informed consent prior to study entry.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             requiring systemic therapy for a minimum of 3 years.

          4. Prior systemic chemotherapy for prostate cancer (Note that prior chemotherapy for a
             different cancer is allowed).

          5. Prior radiotherapy, including brachytherapy, to the region of the prostate that would
             result in overlap of radiation therapy fields.

          6. Previous hormonal therapy such as LHRH agonists (e.g. goserelin, leuprolide),
             anti-androgens (e.g. flutamide, bicalutamide), estrogens (e.g. DES), or surgical

          9. Patients who are sexually active and not willing/able to use medically acceptable
             forms of contraception; this exclusion is necessary because the treatment involved in
             this study may be significantly teratogenic.

             of consciousness requiring hospitalization). Also, current or prior treatment with
             antiepileptic medications for the treatment of seizures or history of loss of
             consciousness or transient ischemic attack within 12 months prior to randomization.

                  subjects with history of congestive heart failure NYHA class 3 or 4 in the past,
                  unless a screening echocardiogram or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan performed
                  within 3 months results in a left ventricular ejection fraction that is ≥45%;

               4. History of clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias (e.g. ventricular
                  tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, torsades de pointes);

               5. History of Mobitz II second degree or third degree heart block without a
                  permanent pacemaker in place;

               6. Uncontrolled hypertension as indicated by a resting systolic blood pressure &gt;170
                  mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure &gt;105 mm Hg at screening. Patients with
                  initially elevated systolic blood pressure &gt;170 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure
                  &gt;105 mm Hg are eligible if they undergo medical management and are re-screened.
