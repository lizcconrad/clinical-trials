    <textblock>
      This is a multi-institutional, randomized, placebo controlled, double-blinded phase II trial
      of maintenance pembrolizumab versus placebo after first-line chemotherapy in patients with
      metastatic urothelial cancer who have achieved at least stable disease on first-line
      chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center trial.

      Eligible subjects will be 1:1 randomized to placebo (Control Arm A) and pembrolizumab
      (Experimental Arm B). Stratification factors for randomization: presence of visceral
      metastatic disease (lung, liver, or bone or other organs vs. lymph node only) at the time of
      initiation of first-line chemotherapy, and response to first-line chemotherapy (CR/PR vs. SD.
      Subjects who progress on placebo will be assessed to determine if they are eligible to cross
      over to unblinded treatment with pembrolizumab.

      INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT:

      For Control Arm A, commercially available normal saline will be used as the placebo. No
      active placebo drug will be mixed with the normal saline.

      For Experimental Arm B, pembrolizumab (or placebo), 200 mg intravenous infusion (IV) every 3
      weeks for up to 12 months, or until progressive disease (PD) or unacceptable toxicity.

      The following required laboratory values must be obtained within fourteen days prior to
      registration for protocol therapy:

      Hematopoietic:

        -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1,500 /mcL

        -  Platelets ≥100,000 / mcL

        -  Hemoglobin ≥8.5 g/dL

      Renal:

        -  Creatinine ≤1.5x ULN OR

        -  Measured or calculated creatinine clearance ≥30 mL/min for subject with creatinine
           levels &gt;1.5x institutional ULN

        -  GFR can also be used in place of creatinine or CrCl

      Hepatic:

        -  Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN OR

        -  Direct bilirubin ≤ ULN for subjects with total bilirubin levels &gt; 1.5 ULN

        -  AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 X ULN OR ≤ 5 X ULN for subject with liver metastases

      Coagulation:

        -  International Normalized Ratio (INR) or Prothrombin Time (PT) ≤1.5 X ULN. If subject is
           on anticoagulant therapy, PT or PTT must be within therapeutic range of intended use of
           anticoagulants.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy within
             three days prior to registration for protocol therapy

          -  Sexually active, pre-menopausal women of childbearing potential must be willing to use
             an adequate method of contraception or be surgically sterile, or abstain from
             heterosexual activity for the course of the study through 120 days after the last dose
             of study drug. Subjects of childbearing potential are those who have not been

                  completed greater than 12 months prior to initiation of chemotherapy regimen for
                  metastatic or unresectable disease.

          -  Current or past participation in a study of an investigational agent or using an
             investigational device within four weeks of registration for protocol therapy.

          -  A diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving treatment with systemic steroid

             complications from the intervention prior to starting protocol therapy.

          -  A known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.
             Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the
             skin, or in situ cervical cancer that has undergone potentially curative therapy.

          -  A known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous
             meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided
             they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks
             prior to registration for protocol therapy and any neurologic symptoms have returned
             to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using

             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment.

          -  Has evidence of active, non-infectious pneumonitis.

          -  Has a history of interstitial lung disease.

          -  An active infection requiring systemic therapy.

          -  A history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating Investigator.

          -  Known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation
             with the requirements of the trial.

          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the screening period through 120 days
             after the last dose of protocol therapy.

          -  Prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CD137, or anti-Cytotoxic
             T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) antibody (including ipilimumab or any other
             antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or checkpoint pathways).
             Examples include nivolumab, MPDL3280, etc.

          -  A known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).

          -  A known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA
             [qualitative] is detected).

          -  Receipt of a live vaccine within 30 days prior to registration for protocol therapy.

          -  Unresolved toxicity (i.e., &gt; Grade 1 or above baseline) due to previously administered
             agents. Exception includes: subjects with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy are eligible for the
             study.
