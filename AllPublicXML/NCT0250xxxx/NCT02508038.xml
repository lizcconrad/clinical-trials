    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the safety of transplantation with a haploidentical donor
      peripheral blood stem cell graft depleted of TCRαβ+ cells and CD19+ cells in conjunction with
      the immunomodulating drug, Zoledronate, given in the post-transplant period to treat
      pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory hematologic malignancies or high risk solid
      tumors.

      REDUCED-INTENSITY CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG)
      intravenously (IV) on days -12 to -9, fludarabine phosphate IV on days -8 to -5, thiotepa IV
      twice daily (BID) on day -4, and melphalan IV on days -3 to -2.

      PERIPHERAL BLOOD STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo TCR-αβ+ and CD19+ depleted
      haploidentical donor peripheral blood stem cell transplantation on day 0.

      ZOLEDRONATE ADMINISTRATION: Patients receive zoledronate IV after transplant as determined by
      their assigned treatment group (Cohort). Patients in Cohort A do not receive zoledronate.

      Follow-up assessments will occur after transplantation.
