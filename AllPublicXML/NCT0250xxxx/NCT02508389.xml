    <textblock>
      The purpose of the phase 2, GT-201 clinical study is to determine if GC4419 administered
      prior to intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) reduces the incidence, duration, and
      severity of radiation induced oral mucositis in patients who have been diagnosed with locally
      advanced, non-metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GT-201 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study conducted in the
      U.S. to evaluate GC4419 administered IV for the reduction of incidence, duration, and
      severity of radiation induced oral mucositis in patients receiving cisplatin plus
      intensity-modulated radiation therapy for post-operative, or definitive treatment of locally
      advanced, non-metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, limited to the oral
      cavity or oropharynx. Patients will be randomized equally to 1 of 3 treatment arms:

      Arm A: 30 mg GC4419 per day (60 min IV infusion to complete within 60 minutes prior to IMRT),
      concurrent with daily fractions of IMRT (2.0 - 2.2 Gy) to a total of 60 - 72 Gy over
      approximately 7 weeks, plus cisplatin administered 80 - 100 mg/m2 once every three weeks for
      3 doses or 30 - 40 mg/m2 once weekly for 6-7 doses (investigator's choice).

      Arm B: 90 mg GC4419 per day (60 min IV infusion to complete within 60 minutes prior to IMRT),
      concurrent with daily fractions of IMRT (2.0 - 2.2 Gy) to a total of 60 - 72 Gy over
      approximately 7 weeks, plus cisplatin administered 80 - 100 mg/m2 once every three weeks for
      3 doses or 30 - 40 mg/m2 once weekly for 6-7 doses (investigator's choice).

      Arm C: Placebo daily (60 min IV infusion to complete within 60 minutes prior to IMRT),
      concurrent with daily fractions of IMRT (2.0 - 2.2 Gy) to a total of 60 - 72 Gy over
      approximately 7 weeks, plus cisplatin administered 80 - 100 mg/m2 once every three weeks for
      3 doses or 30 - 40 mg/m2 once weekly for 6-7 doses (investigator's choice).

      Planned radiation fields in all 3 arms must include at least two oral sites (buccal mucosa,
      floor of mouth, tongue, soft palate) with each site receiving a dose of at least 50 Gy.

      All patients will be assessed twice weekly for oral mucositis per WHO grading criteria until
      the completion of IMRT, and once weekly thereafter (if necessary) for 8 weeks, or until oral
      mucositis resolves to ≤ Grade 1.

      Approximately 200 total to ensure that roughly 60 patients per arm receive study drug and
      complete requirements for primary endpoint analysis, which is defined as patients receiving a
      minimum cumulative dose of 60 Gy.
