  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the outcomes of a traditional, exercise-based rehabilitation
      intervention for chronic low back pain with the outcomes achieved by combining a traditional
      intervention with adjunct therapy delivered using an interactive gaming-based system for
      home-based therapy. 50 subjects with non-specific cLBP will be recruited in the study.
      Following baseline measures, study volunteers will be randomized to either the Usual Care
      alone group or to the Interactive Home-Based System group. In each group, an endpoint
      assessment session will be conducted at approximately 4 and 8 weeks post baseline measures.
