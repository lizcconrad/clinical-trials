    <textblock>
      The focus of this research is to create a repository of ultrasonographic images and their
      corresponding medical data from pregnant women (the mothers of the fetuses that are imaged),
      focusing on fetal anomalies. These women will visit the obstetrical clinics at Regional One
      Health and the Le Bonheur Fetal Center.

      1. Repository data will be collected from the medical record and entered into the data base
           after the patient has completed the appointment.

        2. Data collection will continue into the postpartum period for each participant.

        3. Data collection will continue for the child during the treatment of the medical
           condition, up to approximately 6 months of age if required by the condition.
