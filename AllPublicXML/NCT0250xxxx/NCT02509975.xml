      This is a prospective, pilot, open-label, uncontrolled, non-randomized safety and
      effectiveness study of OCL 503 in men with BPH.

      Prior to entering the study, all patients will undergo pre-study assessments including
      compliance with inclusion and exclusion criteria, laboratory assessments, IPSS, uroflowmetry,
      IIEF, and MRI pelvic imaging. Following conventional catheter angiography with cone-beam CT
      to confirm catheter placement and prostatic vasculature, each patient will undergo
      transarterial embolization with OCL 503. OCL 503 will be administered intra-arterially via
      microcatheter until there is stasis of blood flow.

      Patient assessments include blood work, IPSS, uroflowmetry, IIEF, MRI and patient interviews
      conducted at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months post embolization.
