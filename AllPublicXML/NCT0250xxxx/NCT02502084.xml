  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      3NT flexible endoscope is a single-use disposable handheld endoscope that provides a means to
      visualize the nasal cavity and paranasal sinus space and deliver irrigation to treat the
      sinus ostia and spaces within the paranasal sinus cavities for diagnostic and therapeutic
      procedures.

      The rationale behind this feasibility study is to show that accessing and visualization of
      the nasal anatomy and paranasal sinuses (Maxillary, Frontal and Sphenoid sinuses) in patients
      suffering from symptoms attributable to sinusitis is feasible; This is an essential step in
      the development of a system that will later allow visualization, sampling, and treatment of
      the sinuses via the natural sinus ostium during the patient's first office visit in a
      minimally invasive manner while enabling treatment by lavage, and minimizing radiation
      exposure, antibiotic use, multiple office visits, and cost.
