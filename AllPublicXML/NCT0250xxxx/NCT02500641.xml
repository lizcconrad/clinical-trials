      Comparison of the effects of Febuxostat and Allopurinol on Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV) after 36
      weeks of treatment.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study physician responsible for randomization and drug supply handling is unblinded to
      study medications and therefore will not be involved in the main efficacy evaluations of each
      patient randomized in the study.

      Conversely, the study physician/s responsible for the main efficacy evaluation (Pulse Wave
      Velocity) will be blind to study treatments.

      Key efficacy variables will be performed by an independent centralized laboratory.
