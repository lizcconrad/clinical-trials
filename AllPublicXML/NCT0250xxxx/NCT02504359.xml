      This phase Ib trial studies the side effects of combination chemotherapy and donor stem cell
      transplant followed by ixazomib citrate maintenance therapy in treating patients with
      multiple myeloma that has returned after a period of improvement and is likely to recur (come
      back), or spread. Giving chemotherapy before a donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant
      helps stop the growth of cells in the bone marrow, including normal blood-forming cells (stem
      cells) and cancer cells. When the healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the
      patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood
      cells, and platelets. Giving ixazomib citrate after the transplant may improve the overall
      treatment outcome without causing additional toxicities.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Safety of BEAM (carmustine, cytarabine, etoposide, melphalan) allogeneic transplant within
      100 days, defined as the day 100 transplant related mortality (TRM).

      II. Safety of oral ixazomib maintenance therapy from day 100 post allogeneic transplant up to
      2 years, defined by the incidence of grade III-IV acute (or overlap) graft-versus-host
      disease (GvHD) and grade III-IV ixazomib related toxicity.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the proportion of patients who are eligible to start ixazomib maintenance
      therapy.

      II. To determine the incidence of discontinuation of ixazomib maintenance therapy at one and
      two years post initiation.

      III. To determine response rates (complete response [CR], very good partial response [VGPR]
      and partial response [PR]) by day 100 and at 12 and 24 months after transplant.

      IV. To determine two year progression-free survival and overall survival rate. V. To evaluate
      time to engraftment (defined by absolute neutrophil count [ANC] &gt; 500 and platelets &gt;
      20,000).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine rates of minimal residual disease by deep sequencing (by ClonoSEQ, Adaptive
      Biotechnologies).

      II. To estimate the cumulative incidence of disease progression rates. III. To determine
      rates of &gt;= grade 3 toxicities using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
      (CTCAE) version 4.03.

      IV. To determine the incidence of treatment emergent peripheral neuropathy (all grades).

      V. To determine the cumulative incidence and severity of chronic GvHD. VI. To determine the
      cumulative incidence of grades III-IV acute GvHD. VII. To evaluate health related quality of
      life. VIII. To determine donor and recipient chimerism. IX. To evaluate immune
      reconstitution.

      OUTLINE:

      BEAM CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive carmustine on day -6, cytarabine and etoposide on
      days -5 to -2, and melphalan on day -1.

      PERIPHERAL BLOOD STEM CELL TRANSPLANT: Patients undergo allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell
      transplantation on day 0.

      GVHD PROPHYLAXIS: Patients receive tacrolimus intravenously (IV) or orally (PO) on days -2 to
      at least 6 months with a taper as early as 3 months post-transplant and methotrexate IV on
      days 1, 3, 6, and 11.

      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Beginning between days 100 and 180 post-transplant, patients receive
      ixazomib PO on days 1 and 14 or days 1, 8, and 15 if the principal investigator deems it
      medically important. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 24 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 4 months for 1 year.
