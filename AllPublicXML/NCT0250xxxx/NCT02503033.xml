      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of HMPL-523 administered
      to patients with relapsed or refractory Hematologic Malignancies

      To determine the maximum tolerated dosage/recommended phase 2 dosage and characterize the
      dose limited toxicities associated with HMPL-523 when administered to patients with relapsed
      or refractory Hematologic Malignancies

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are two stages in this study: a dose-escalation stage (stage 1) and a dose-expansion
      stage (stage 2).

      Dose-escalation stage (stage 1) The conventional 3+3 design (3 patients per dose cohort, with
      the potential to add additional 3 patients to the same cohort to further evaluate toxicity)
      will be applied for dose escalation and maximum tolerated dosage determination. Approximately
      18 to 27 evaluable patients will be enrolled. The actual number of patients depends on the
      dose limited toxicities situation as well as the maximum tolerated dosage reached at this
      stage.

      Dosing will include QD and BID cohorts. A cycle of study treatment will be defined as 28 days
      of continuous dosing.

      Dose-expansion stage(stage 2) This phase is to further evaluate the safety, the
      pharmacokinetics and anti-tumor activity of HMPL-523 at recommended phase 2 dosage in
      approximately 20patients with relapsed or refractory Hematologic Malignancies.

      In this stage, approximately 20 patients with B-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas or Chronic
      Lymphocytic Leukemia will be enrolled with recommended phase 2 dosage as starting dose. The
      tumor types of the expansion stage are restricted to Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/ small
      lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL), Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), Follicular Lymphoma (FL), Diffuse
      large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM) Subjects will receive
      HMPL-523 with every 28-day treatment cycle until disease progression, death, or intolerable
      toxicity, whichever comes first.
