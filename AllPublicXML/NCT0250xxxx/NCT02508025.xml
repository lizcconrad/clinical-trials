      Purposes of this research:

        -  To study similarities and differences in FCE performances between participants from
           different countries, jurisdictions, and evaluators.

        -  To study determinants of FCE performance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A considerable amount of research has been made on the safety, reliability and validity of
      the Functional Capacity Evaluation (FCE). Evidence is accumulating on different aspects of
      validity of FCE in healthy workers and in different patient groups, which has indicated that
      we are measuring a complex construct consisting of biological, psychological and social
      variables. However, this knowledge is still unstable as the majority of studies stem from a
      limited amount of countries. The present project focuses on the biopsychosocial factors that
      influence FCE performance. Participants undergoing an FCE perform differently depending on
      biological, psychological and social variables, although the latter has been
      under-researched. Clinicians are currently unable to predict which factors determine the
      differences in patient's FCE results. In this project, in addition to biological and
      psychological variables, investigators include a variety of social variables from different
      countries, jurisdictions, and evaluators, which may help investigators to identify important
      determinants of FCE performance. Knowing which characteristics and behaviors are associated
      with better or poorer participant performances may help clinicians to deliver improved FCE
      services.
