  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims at investigating the direct effects of methylphenidate on school performance
      of primary school children. Although behavioral effects of this frequently prescribed drug
      are thoroughly studied (and confirmed), the effects of methylphenidate on school performance
      are less clear. Recent overviews indicate that effects are mainly quantitative and
      subject-specific. To gain more insight in this issue, the current double blind placebo
      controlled crossover study investigates not only the effects of methylphenidate on school
      performance but also it's effect on related variables such as short term memory, motivation
      and behavior. 60 children with ADHD are included and tested twice (with medication and with
      placebo) at their primary school.

      Rationale: ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) is a common childhood
      developmental disorder. Besides the behavioural symptoms of ADHD, many children with ADHD
      experience problems with academic activities. More specifically, these children show problems
      with math, spelling and reading. The most common treatment for ADHD is medical treatment with
      methylphenidate (MPH). This treatment is effective in the reduction of ADHD symptoms.
      However, it is unclear whether treatment with MPH can also improve academic activity. If MPH
      improves academic activity, it is of great interest to understand which variables influence
      or mediate this effect. The results from this study can give more insight in the working
      mechanisms and effectiveness of MPH in reducing the academic problems commonly observed in
      children with ADHD.

      Objectives: The main objective of this study is to assess the impact of MPH on academic
      activity and to estimate the role of three putative mediators in this relation.

      Study design and population: This study is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      cross-over design with a patient group and a control group. Main study parameters/endpoints:
      The main study parameters are changes in academic activity (ability, effort and engagement).
      In addition, changes in putative mediators are assessed.

    <measure>Cognitive performance</measure>
    <time_frame>3.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Cognitive performance will be measured with standardized tasks for interference control, verbal and spatial working memory. Using principal component analysis a combined (composite) score for cognitive performance will be calculated based on correlations between the measures.</description>

    <measure>Academic motivation</measure>
    <time_frame>3.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Academic motivation will be measured with a questionnaire measuring intrinsic motivation for schoolwork. In addition, an academic competence questionnaire will be completed by children, parents and teachers separately. A composite score will be calculated of these measures.</description>

    <measure>Classroom behavior</measure>
    <time_frame>3.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Classroom behavior will be measured with observation scales (by an independent observer) and behavioral rating scales (completed by teachers). Using principal component analysis, these scales will be combined (composite scores), depending on correlations between the measures.</description>
