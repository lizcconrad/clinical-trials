    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of oral propranolol versus
      nadolol in patients with Infantile Hemangiomas (IH) in a randomized, controlled,
      double-blinded study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study objective is to compare the efficacy and safety of oral propranolol in comparison
      with oral nadolol in patients with IH. Patients will be randomly assigned to either
      propranolol or dose equivalent nadolol. The duration of the study will be 24 weeks, however,
      patient will be monitored for up to 1 year post study enrolment. Both efficacy and safety
      will be closely monitored and captured.

    <description>Patients will be administered twice-daily doses of medication as follows: since Day 0- 0.5 mg/kg/day ; since Day 7-1.0 mg/kg/day and since Day 14- 1.5 mg/kg/day. In all subsequent visits the dosage will be adjusted based on the current weight rather than the baseline weight to maintain 1.5 mg/kg/day. Or the dose may be escalated (by 0.5 mg/kg/day at any following study visit) up to 3 mg/kg/day based on the clinical response to maintain the dose that led to at least 75% reduction in the hemangioma size until Week 24, when unblinding happen. At Week 24 paticipants can start weaning by 10% per week or continue with the last dose, depending on the investigator's decision.
S/he will be monitored until Week 52.</description>
