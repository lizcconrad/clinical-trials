  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dry eye is a multifactorial disease of the tears and ocular surface that results in symptoms
      of discomfort, visual disturbance, and tear film instability with potential damage to the
      ocular surface. It is accompanied by increased osmolarity of the tear film and inflammation
      of the ocular surface.

      Lubricin is a mucin-like glycoprotein originally discovered in synovial fluid, as a secreted
      product of cells that line the joint tissues, which is present at the surface of articular
      cartilage and it has been investigated on its roles at the ocular surface, in normal and
      pathologic conditions such as dry eye.

      The objective of the study is to assess the tolerability, safety and efficacy of Lubricin eye
      drops solution administered over 4 weeks versus sodium hyaluronate (Na-HY) eye drops solution
      in subjects with moderate dry eye.

      Dry eye, or keratoconjunctivitis sicca, is a chronic inflammatory condition of the ocular
      surface that may cause severe symptoms an 2007 international dry eye workshop (DEWS) defined
      the disease as follows: &quot;Dry eye is a multifactorial disease of the tears and oc symptoms of
      discomfort, visual disturbance, and tear film instability with potential damage to the ocular
      surface. It is accompanied the tear film and inflammation of the ocular surface&quot;.

      Lubricin is a mucin-like glycoprotein originally discovered in synovial fluid, as a secreted
      product of cells that line the joint tissues, surface of articular cartilage.

      In vitro studies have shown that lubricin in saline buffer acts as a lubricant between
      various surfaces, as well as in synovial fluid, pr lubricin is a principal lubricating
      protein in joints. Besides the lubricating property, lubricin has been shown to exert
      anti-adhesive ac dissipation, and a protective effect on underlying cells.

      Lubricin has been investigated on its roles at the ocular surface, in normal and pathologic
      conditions such as dry eye. In fact, Lubricin is the protein with most potent lubricant and
      anti-adhesive properties present on the ocular surface and on meibomian gland. The presence
      on the ocular surface was first described by the team of Sullivan D.

      Based on the available preclinical studies lubricin may be an important barrier to the
      development of corneal and conjunctival epitheliopathies in dry eyes and its use as a novel
      lubricating and anti-adhesive eye drop is under investigation in this clinical investigation.
      A clinical investigation is currently ongoing to demonstrate that a Lubricin 150 µg/ml eye
      drop formulation is non-inferior to an ocular surface lubricant sodium hyaluronate 0.13%.

      Up to now, there are no known anticipated adverse events associated with the use of lubricin,
      anyway the occurrence of side effect It must be considered that topical treatment with
      lubricin or hyaluronic acid could cause local irritation or allergic reactions. There ar
      contraindications to the use of lubricin or hyaluronic acid eye drops. All examinations and
      assessments that will be carried out durin invasive, are commonly used in the management of
      subjects with dry eye and pose no risk to the subjects. There are no known co lubricin or
      hyaluronic acid eye drops. . No data are available about the embryo and fetal toxicity,
      therefore the experimental treatment will not be allowed to pregnant women or nursing mothers
      and women of childbearing potential not using appropriate birth control methods.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate tolerability, safety and efficacy of Lubricin 150
      µg/ml eye drops when compared to a widely used commercial 0.18% sodium hyaluronate eye drop
      formulation in moderate dry eye patients.

             the International Dry Eye Workshop -DEWS, 2007)

          3. Best corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA) score of &lt; 0.1 decimal units in either
             eye at the time of study enrolment

          4. Evidence of an active ocular infection in either eye

          5. History or presence of ocular surface disorders not related to dry eye in either eye

          6. Use of any ocular topical medication other than the study medications for the
             treatment of ocular diseases including artificial tears during the study period

          7. Use of topical cyclosporine, topical corticosteroids or any other topical medication
             for the treatment of dry eye in either eye within 30 days of study enrolment

          8. History of any ocular surgery (including laser or refractive surgical procedures) in
             either eye within the 90 days before study enrolment. Ocular surgery will not be
             allowed during the study treatment period and elective ocular surgery procedures
             should not be planned during the duration of the follow-up period

          9. Presence or history of any ocular or systemic disorder or condition that might
             significantly hinder the efficacy of the study treatment or its evaluation, could
             possibly interfere with the interpretation of study results, or could be judged by the
             investigator to be incompatible with the study visit schedule or conduct of trail
             procedures (e.g. ocular trauma, progressive or degenerative corneal conditions,
             uveitis, systemic infection.)

         10. Known hypersensitivity to one of the components of the study or procedural medications

         11. Participation in another clinical study at the same time as the present study or
             within 90 days of screening/baseline visit

         12. History of drug, medication or alcohol abuse or addiction.

         13. Females of childbearing potential (those who are not surgically sterilized or
             post-menopausal for at least 1 year) are excluded from participation in the study if
             they meet any one of the following conditions:

               -  are currently pregnant or,

               -  have a positive result on the urine pregnancy test at the Screening/Baseline
                  Visit or,

               -  intend to become pregnant during the study treatment period or,

               -  are breast-feeding or,

               -  not willing to use highly effective birth control measures, such as: Hormonal
                  contraceptives - oral, implanted, transdermal, or injected and/or mechanical
                  barrier methods - spermicide in conjunction with a barrier such as a condom or
                  diaphragm or an Intra Uterine Device during the entire course of and 30 days
                  after the study treatment periods.
