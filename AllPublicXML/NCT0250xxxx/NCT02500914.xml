  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1a/1b study of SC-002 in patients with relapsed small cell lung cancer (SCLC)
      or large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC). SC-002 is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC)
      comprised of a monoclonal antibody linked to a potent chemotherapy.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of SC-002 at different
      dose levels, to determine the highest dose of SC-002 that can be given to patients with SCLC
      or LCNEC, to evaluate the side effects of SC-002, and to assess the anti-cancer activity of
      SC-002.

      Part 1A is a dose escalation study in patients with small cell lung cancer or large cell
      neuroendocrine carcinoma with cytologically confirmed, limited or extensive SCLC or LCNEC
      that have relapsed or refractory limited or extensive disease following no more than 2 prior
      chemotherapy regimens.

      Part 1B is an expansion study where patients will be enrolled and treated in order to further
      characterize safety and preliminary efficacy in patients with SCLC or LCNEC and further
      characterize PK, immunogenicity and target expression and possible relationship to clinical
      outcome.

    <description>Part 1A (Dose Escalation) - IV infusion; safety data will be reviewed prior to dose escalation decision. Dose escalation will complete when recommended dose (RD) is determined. RD will be the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or lower dose that provides adequate PK exposure, immunogenicity, and preliminary evidence of antitumor activity with tolerability.
Part 1B (Dose Expansion) - IV infusion; once MTD and/or RD has been determined in Part 1A, an expansion cohort of approximately 60 patients with SCLC or LCNEC will be enrolled to further characterize the safety profile and clinical activity of the RD. Patients may continue treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent.</description>
