      To further examine current intubation practice among critically ill patients who are in need
      of endotracheal intubation, the investigators plan to perform a prospective cross-sectional
      study of adult critically ill patients who needed endotracheal intubation at participating
      sites between August 1st, 2015 to August 1st, 2016. The investigators aim to describe the
      current intubation practice among the participating sites with a description of complications
      that may have surfaced during the peri-intubation period and to isolate predictive factors of
      these complications.

      In this study, the primary aim is to describe, through a prospective cross-sectional study,
      the current intubation practice of adult critically ill patients undergoing endotracheal
      intubations with secondary aims exploring complications that may emerge during the
      peri-intubation period and to isolate predictive factors of these complications. This
      information will generate hypotheses which will lead to further study with the ultimate
      impact of reducing patient-related outcomes such as morbidity and mortality.

  <detailed_description>

      Aim 1: To describe the current intubation practice among the participating sites by
      collecting data on both airway management and hemodynamics during the peri-intubation period
      defined as 60 minutes pre- and post-intubation in adult critically ill patients.

      Aim 2: To report the incidence of immediate (within 30 minutes after intubation)
      complications defined as the following: 1) cardiac arrest or death; 2) cardiovascular
      collapse (defined as a sustained decrease (&gt;30 minutes) in mean arterial pressure &lt; 65 mmHg
      or systolic arterial pressure &lt; 90 mm Hg despite 1000-2000 liters of fluid loading
      [crystalloid and/or colloid solution] and/or the requirement of any vasoactive agent); 3)
      hypoxemia (decrease in pulse oximetry to oxygen saturation &lt; 90% during attempts); 4)
      hypotension (mean arterial pressure &lt;65 mmHg or systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg occurring
      at any time); 5) difficult intubation (three or more attempts at laryngoscopy to place the
      endotracheal tube into the trachea and/or &gt;10 minutes using conventional laryngoscopy and/or
      the need for another operator); 6) aspiration; 7) esophageal intubation [immediate and
      delayed]; 8) dental injury; 9) and supraventricular or ventricular arrhythmia (without loss
      of pulse); 10) vomiting; 11) oral or laryngeal trauma; 12) laryngospasm; 13) pneumothorax;
      14) malignant hyperthermia; 15) medication error; 16) mainstem intubation; 17) nasal
      bleeding; 18) other.

      Aim3: To isolate predictive factors of immediate airway (hypoxemia/difficult intubation) and
      hemodynamic (cardiovascular collapse/hypotension) complications.
