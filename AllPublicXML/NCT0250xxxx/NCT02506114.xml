    <textblock>
      This is a multicentered, open label, randomized phase II trial of PROSTVAC or ipilimumab or
      the combination of PROSTVAC and ipilimumab as neoadjuvant therapy in patients with localized
      PC. Eligible patients will be randomized to PROSTVAC monotherapy (Arm A), ipilimumab
      monotherapy (Arm B), or combination therapy with both PROSTVAC and ipilimumab (Arm C), prior
      to RP. In arms A and C, PROSTVAC-V will be administered subcutaneously as the primary vaccine
      on Day 1, which will be followed 2 weeks later with a series of 2 PROSTVAC-F subcutaneous
      administrations, given 3 weeks apart. In arms B and C, ipilimumab will be administered twice,
      at a dose of 3mg/kg, 3 weeks apart. In the combination arm, ipilimumab administration will
      coincide with the PROSTVAC-F administration. In arm B, ipilimumab will begin on Day 1. In all
      three arms, RP will occur 21 days, or three weeks, following final treatment administration
      of PROSTVAC or ipilimumab. No further therapy will be administered on study following RP.

    <description>PROSTVAC-V/F is a PSA (prostate-specific antigen)-based immunization strategy. It is intended to generate immune responses to prostate specific antigens and prostate cancer cells. It uses poxviral vectors to introduce modified PSA to the patient in an immunogenic manner to break self-tolerance, and thereby induce immune responses directed against prostate cancer cells.</description>

             congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, stroke or
             myocardial infarction within 6 months, or psychiatric illness that would limit
             compliance with study requirements.

          -  Subject requires any medical intervention(s) or has any other condition(s) that, in
             the Investigator's opinion, will 1) make the administration of PROSTVAC-V/F or
             ipilimumab hazardous, 2) obscure the interpretation of AEs, 3) compromise adherence
             with study requirements, or 4) otherwise compromise the study's objectives.

          -  Subject has high-risk features (e.g., based on Gleason score, PSA, clinical stage, %
             positive biopsies), and the treating physician feels the subject should undergo
             radical prostatectomy sooner than planned within the protocol.
