    <textblock>
      The UNCODE Study seeks to better identify the neurological causes of muscle weakness
      associated with advancing age. The main study consists of 4 laboratory-based testing sessions
      that involve testing muscle strength and physical and cognitive function as well as a battery
      of tests to 1) quantify brain excitability (using non-invasive transcranial magnetic
      stimulation), 2) modulate brain excitability (using non-invasive transcranial direct current
      stimulation), 3) spinal motor nerve firing characteristics, and 4) brain structure and
      function characteristics based on magnetic resonance images of the brain. Additionally, three
      option sub-studies are also available for enrollment. The first is a genetics sub-study where
      a cheek swab will be used to examine associations between certain genes and the physiological
      and functional measures obtained from the main study. The other two sub-studies are
      interventions. The first sub-study is a progressive resistance exercise training study where
      study participants will undergo 12-weeks of exercise training (3x/wk) and at the completion
      of the exercise training the measures obtained in the main study will be re-assessed. The
      other sub-study is a mental imagery sub-study where subjects are randomly assigned to perform
      a mental imagery training program consisting of imaging strong muscle contractions and
      mobility tasks (5x/wk) or to serve as a control (i.e., to not modify lifestyle) for 6-weeks.
      At the completion of the respective intervention period the measures obtained in the main
      study will be re-assessed.

      that involve testing muscle strength and physical and cognitive function as well as a battery
      of tests to 1) quantify brain excitability (using single and paired pulse transcranial
      magnetic stimulation of the upper and lower extremity muscles), 2) modulate brain
      excitability of the upper extremity muscles (using non-invasive transcranial direct current
      stimulation), 3) spinal motor nerve firing characteristics using decomposition surface
      electromyography, and 4) brain structure and function characteristics based on magnetic
      resonance images of the brain. Additionally, three optional sub-studies are also available
      for enrollment. The first is a genetics sub-study where a cheek swab will be used to examine
      associations between certain genes (APOE-4 allele) and the physiological and functional
      measures obtained from the main study. The other two sub-studies are interventions. The first
