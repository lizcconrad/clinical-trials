      The Miami Heart Study at Baptist Health will be an observational, longitudinal and
      prospective cohort study in a target population of 4000 healthy subjects (40-65 years old)
      consisting of members from the Greater Miami Area (including eligible BHSF(Baptist Health
      South Florida) employees). Baseline examination will consist of (1) assessment for
      cardiovascular risk factors (including lifestyle and psychosocial factors); (2) screening for
      subclinical atherosclerosis using Coronary CT angiogram, Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC)
      testing, vascular 2D/3D ultrasound, endothelial function, arterial stiffness and (3) blood
      sampling for determination of traditional risk factors, advanced &quot;omics&quot; and biobanking.
      Participants will be followed yearly via telephone, email, or mail for change in health
      status with a focus on cardiovascular disease events, including acute myocardial infarction
      and other forms of coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and congestive heart failure;
      mortality; and for cardiovascular disease interventions.

      The Miami Heart Study at Baptist Health is expected to identify new imaging and biological
      factors associated with the presence and feature of earliest markers of subclinical
      atherosclerotic disease and provide opportunities for discovery/validation of novel
      biomarkers to identify these high-risk features. This is expected to lead to advances in
      understanding of evolution and progression of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease starts
      with an ultimate goal of establishing more personalized, evidence-based approach to medical
      care.

      What is this study about? The Miami Heart Study is a long term observational research study
      which is designed to identify new and novel relationships between risk factors, genetics,
      lifestyle behaviors and cardiovascular disease in the greater Miami area. Miami is uniquely
      situated to capture a diverse, multi-ethnic population. As an employee of Baptist Health and
      a very important stakeholder in Baptist Health's mission, you are being asked to take part in
      this research study. The investigators expect approximately 4,000 members of the South
      Florida community and/or employees of Baptist Health to participate in this study over the
      next 5 years.

      The research study aims to better understand heart disease and what causes it. Heart disease
      often starts many years before a person has a heart attack or develops symptoms of heart
      disease. This is called subclinical disease - and it refers to heart disease and the body
      processes causing heart disease, at a stage before any symptoms are experienced. Although
      doctors and researchers have a good understanding of heart disease in some areas, subclinical
      disease is not very well understood.

      Better understanding subclinical disease can allow doctors and healthcare staff to intervene
      and prevent the process from developing further and causing symptomatic (with symptoms) heart
      disease. Progression refers to the process by which subclinical (without symptoms) heart
      disease develops into clinical (with symptoms) disease.

      Therefore, the purpose of this research study is to:

        -  To examine the presence and severity of subclinical disease in the South Florida
           community.

        -  To examine what unique factors contribute to development of subclinical disease and
           appearance of clinical symptoms.

      In the future, the investigators hope this information will allow us to better predict and
      prevent the development heart disease in diverse populations. Participants will be asked to
      come to the Miami Heart Study clinic for an examination that may take 4 to 6 hours to
      complete. During the examination, information about the participant's health will be
      collected and standard procedures routinely done a physician's office such as height, weight,
      and blood pressure will be performed.

      Approximately 115 mls of blood will be drawn by a Registered Nurse. Blood samples will be
      tested for markers of the diseases and health conditions under investigation. These will
      include standard markers (cholesterol, blood sugar, etc) and novel markers which are not
      commonly evaluated by a physician. Additionally, any remaining blood samples will be stored
      and kept for future risk factor evaluation, biomarker testing and genetic studies.

      Whole blood and serum will be retained.

        Since the MiHEART Study is primarily concerned with the determinants and natural history of
        subclinical cardiovascular disease, participants with known clinical disease will not be
        recruited. Most exclusion criteria relate to the long-term nature of the study or to
        incompatibility with certain study procedures. Eligibility (or ineligibility) status will
        be determined from self-reported information.
