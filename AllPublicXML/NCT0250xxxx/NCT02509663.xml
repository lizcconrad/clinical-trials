  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The sinuplasty balloon offers a more physiological first of the sinuses which minimizes risks
      associated to traditional surgery. Its atraumatic characteristic also helps to reduce the
      risk of bleeding (so any use of Pack), limit scarring ransom, reduce the post-operative pain,
      ensure faster return to daily life activities (reduction of the average length of
      hospitalization). Patient's quality of life would be improved (SNOT-22 questionnaire) and
      reduction of post-operative pain score seams decrease on EVA.

      The economic impact of the sinuplasty balloon appears very favourable and fits into the
      strategy of development of the ambulatory practice.

      The primary objective is to estimate the cost-utility ratio of the sinuplasty balloon after
      frontal sinus surgery, compared to surgery by rigid instrumentation, in a randomized
      single-blind controlled study.

      The secondary objectives is to compare:

        -  the two types of surgery

        -  the quality of life

        -  the feeling of pain in patients but also the occurrence of surgical times or
           complications between the two proposed techniques.

    <description>Balloon Sinuplasty uses a small, flexible, balloon catheter to open up blocked sinus passageways and facilitate drainage of the mucus that builds up in patients suffering from frontal sinusitis symptoms. When the sinus balloon is inflated, it restructures and widens the walls of the sinus passageway while maintaining the integrity of the sinus lining.</description>
