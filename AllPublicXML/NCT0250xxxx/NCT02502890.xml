  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a growing problem, especially in children. It causes frequent wheezing, shortness
      of breath, chest tightness, and cough. A cold that is caused by a virus (viral cold) can
      sometimes make asthma symptoms worse. This study will help investigators learn about the way
      colds are related to asthma attacks among children who need higher amounts of medications to
      control their asthma. Investigators want to learn why viral colds sometimes cause asthma
      attacks and other times do not by studying the immune system response in samples taken from
      the nose and blood.

      This study is a prospective, longitudinal, nested case-control study designed to identify
      changes in gene transcription predictive of and associated with asthma exacerbations in
      children ages 6 to 17 years with difficult-to-control, exacerbation-prone asthma.

      Participants will be followed prospectively for the onset of a cold and a subsequent asthma
      exacerbation. An internet-based asthma and cold symptom diary will be accessed by
      participants using a hand-held device. When the participant reports development of a cold, a
      clinic visit will be scheduled as soon as possible (within 48 hours of cold symptom onset) to
      collect blood and nasal samples. A second clinic visit will occur 4-6 days from the onset of
      cold symptoms to obtain samples after the initial cold, but prior to the use of systemic
      corticosteroids. Participants will be followed for up to two colds or approximately 6 months
      after Visit 0, whichever comes first.

        The MUPPITS study will enroll inner-city children 6-17 years of age with
        difficult-to-control, exacerbation-prone asthma. Approximately 150 children will be
        enrolled and followed prospectively.

             for systemic corticosteroids and/or hospitalization;

          -  Have the following requirement for asthma controller medication at the Screening and
             Enrollment Visit (Visit 0) according to the MEDS program[4, 2]:

               -  For participants aged 6 to 11 years, treatment with at least fluticasone 250 mcg
                  1 puff twice daily or its equivalent;

               -  For participants ages12 years and older, treatment with at least Advair 250/50
                  mcg 1 puff twice daily or its equivalent.

          -  Have peripheral blood eosinophils &gt;=150 per mm^3. Results can be obtained from
             participation in a previous ICAC study if obtained within 6 months of the Screening
             and Enrollment Visit (Visit 0);

          -  Parent/legal guardian is willing to sign the written informed consent;

             Board (IRB) guidelines;

          -  Has some form of insurance that covers costs of usual care asthma control and rescue
             medications at the Screening and Enrollment Visit (Visit 0).

        Exclusion Criteria:
