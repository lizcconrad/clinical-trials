      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has:

               1. been diagnosed with Diabetes Mellitus (insulin or non-insulin dependent) and
                  peripheral neuropathy (loss of protective sensation) in affected foot

               2. a HbA1c of less than 10% assessed within last 12 weeks

               3. a full-thickness diabetic neuropathic foot ulcer that is free from tunnels/sinus
                  tracks, necrotic tissue, exposed bone and/or tendon, and osteomyelitis post
                  debridement (Wagner 1 or 2; Appendix I)

               4. one (target) diabetic neuropathic foot ulcer of less than 12 months duration that
                  has an area that measures ≥ 1.5 and ≤ 10 cm2 post debridement (max length x max
                  width) at screening that is on any surface and part of the foot (fore-, mid- or
                  hind-foot) with an etiology related to loss of protective sensation in that foot.

               5. a target ulcer that closed &lt;30% during the 2 week run-in period (2 weeks
                  management with SOC following signature of informed consent prior to potential
                  randomization)

               6. sufficient arterial supply to affected foot tested within the past 60 days

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has:

               1. ulcers of non-diabetic etiology on the study foot

               2. a target ulcer clinically infected or has underlying osteomyelitis at time of
                  study treatment initiation

               3. clinical evidence of gangrene on any part of the affected foot

               4. a target ulcer with exposed bone or tendon

               5. any malignancy or a neoplasm at the target ulcer site

               6. active Charcot Foot or Charcot Foot that is unable to be offloaded (stable,
                  non-active Charcot deformity that is able to be offloaded is acceptable)

               7. more than 3 ulcers on the study foot, including the target ulcer, and all other
                  ulcers must be at least 3 cm removed from the target ulcer

               8. any significant comorbid disease that may interfere with wound healing

               9. received chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunosuppressant or corticosteroid (greater
                  than 10 mg prednisone-equivalent per day) within the past 30 days.

              10. had the diabetic foot ulcer treated with an experimental drug/biologic/device, or
                  a live-cell therapy (experimental or marketed), or active moist wound healing
                  therapy within 30 days of randomization day
