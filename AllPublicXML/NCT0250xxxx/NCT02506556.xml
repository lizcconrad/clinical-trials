      This is a phase II, exploratory, open-label, single arm study of BYL719 monotherapy, a
      selective phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) alpha inhibitor, in adult patients with
      advanced metastatic breast cancer progressing after first line therapy. Patients with
      advanced hormone receptor positive tumors will be required to have an alteration of the PI3K
      pathway. Those patients with advanced triple negative breast cancers are genetically
      unselected for this study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The technology now exists to advance the concept of personalized medicine for all cancer
      patients. The advent of next generation sequencing can allow us to potentially characterize
      each individual's tumor for oncogenic driver mutations. It is unknown at present if a wide
      range of mutations in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway predict for
      responsiveness to a PI3K inhibitor as would be expected in a situation of &quot;oncogene
      addiction&quot;. In this study, we plan to explore two cohorts of patients and response to BYL719,
      an oral selective PI3K-alpha inhibitor: 1. Metastatic triple negative breast cancer (triple
      negative breast cancer [TNBC] which is defined as ER-/HER2-) and 2. PI3K pathway abnormal
      metastatic luminal breast cancer (ER+/HER2-). Both cohorts are eligible for this study after
      progression after standard first line therapy. In recent large sequencing efforts, for
      example The Cancer Genome Atlas [TCGA], primary breast cancers were found to have a large
      number of Pi3K pathway abnormalities- in TNBC there was a high rate of genetic abnormalities
      in the Pi3K pathway (combined mutations, amplifications and deletions in nearly 100% of
      TNBC)- as well as in ER+/HER2- disease. Therefore, in this study we plan to study responses
      to BYL719 and associations with genetic features that could signify Pi3K pathway activation
      in a cohort of fully molecular- characterized metastatic breast cancers in order to identify
      biomarkers of response to selective PI3K alpha inhibition in breast cancer.
