  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this project is to conduct a randomized controlled pilot study evaluating
      the feasibility and potential effectiveness of a newly developed combined Health At Every
      Size and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (HAES/ACT) treatment, known as Accept Yourself!
      compared to a commercial behavioral weight loss program, Weight Watchers (WW). Obese women
      (BMI â‰¥ 30) with Major Depressive Disorder will be randomly assigned to one of these two
      treatments. Depression, physical health, and other psychosocial outcomes will be assessed
      prior to treatment, at post-treatment, and at 3, 6, 9, and 12-month follow up assessments.
