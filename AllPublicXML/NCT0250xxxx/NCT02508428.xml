  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether crosslinked Marathon and standard Enduron
      polyethylene liners show differences in survivorship due to wear-related revisions at minimum
      14-year follow-up and every 5 years after.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several institutions have reported very low wear rates with crosslinked polyethylene based on
      early and midterm clinical data. However, since revisions associated with osteolysis
      typically occur after 10-year follow-up, the greatest benefits of the reduced wear associated
      with crosslinked polyethylene are expected to be reflected in lower revision rates for
      wear-related complications at long-term follow-up.

      While crosslinking has proven to substantially reduce polyethylene wear during the first
      decade in vivo, characterizing the long-term clinical performance of Marathon polyethylene
      remains important because crosslinking is accompanied by a reduction in the ultimate tensile
      strength, fatigue strength, and elongation to failure of ultra high molecular weight
      polyethylene. As a consequence, concerns have been expressed about the potential for the
      liner fracture, in vivo polyethylene oxidation or accelerated wear at long-term follow-up,
      the effects of femoral head roughening over time and the bioreactivity of crosslinked
      polyethylene debris particles. Ultimately, the best way to address these concerns is in the
      context of well-controlled, long-term clinical outcome studies. This study will evaluate
      outcome at a minimum of 14-years after surgery among the same group of patients whose outcome
      was previously reported at 10-year follow-up. As part of our efforts to follow patients
      throughout their lives to obtain long-term outcome data, we will continue to obtain routine
      follow-up every 5 years from the date of the patient's primary total hip arthroplasty for the
      duration of the patient's life or until revision of the polyethylene liner (estimated to be
      25 years). Because we anticipate that the reduced incidence of wear and osteolysis will
      result in a lower incidence of revision surgery among the patients randomized to Marathon
      liners, implant revision for reasons related to wear will be our primary outcome measure at
      long-term follow-up.

    <description>Survivorship will be calculated using the number of wear-related revisions. The rate of revision will be based on the number of wear-related revisions in each group.</description>

    <time_frame>At minimum 14-year radiographic follow-up and every 5 years after from the date of the patient's primary total hip arthroplasty for the duration of the patient's life or until revision of the polyethylene liner (estimated to be 25 years)</time_frame>
    <description>A single reviewer, blinded to the type of polyethylene liner, will evaluate femoral head penetration among all hips using serial anteroposterior pelvic radiographs. Two-dimensional head penetration will be determined for each follow-up radiograph using Hip Suite Analysis version 8.0 with elliptical correction, a validated, computer-assisted technique. A linear wear rate will be evaluated for each hip that has a minimum of three follow-up radiographs using a least-squares linear regression to calculate the slope of the best-fit line for the wear vector magnitude versus time in situ data. The slope from this regression will represent the steady-state linear wear rate. The steady-state linear wear rate data from all hips in a group will be used to compute a mean polyethylene wear value.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of Clinically Significant Osteolysis</measure>
    <time_frame>At minimum 14-year radiographic follow-up and every 5 years after from the date of the patient's primary total hip arthroplasty for the duration of the patient's life or until revision of the polyethylene liner (estimated to be 25 years)</time_frame>
    <description>The incidence of clinically significant osteolysis will be based on the number of THAs (total hip arthroplasties) with at least 1.5 square centimeters of pelvic and/or femoral osteolysis. Osteolysis will be defined as an area of localized loss of trabecular bone or cortical erosion that was not apparent on the pre-operative or immediate postoperative radiograph. To obtain lesion sizes, the defects will be outlined on the anteroposterior pelvic radiograph and the area of the lesion will be measured using Martell's Hip Analysis Suite software. Lesions will be considered clinically important if the total area of osteolysis around a hip replacement is at least 1.5 square centimeters.</description>
