      This feasibility study will assess the effects of the Nativis Voyager therapy in patients
      with recurrent GBM who have either failed standard of care or are intolerant to therapy. The
      study will enroll and treat up to eleven subjects over six months. Safety and clinical
      utility will be evaluated.
