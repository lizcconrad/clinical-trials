    <textblock>
      Thyroid hormone is a key regulatory hormone for a range of physiological systems. An impaired
      function of the thyroid gland such as subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) can affect quality of
      life. Older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism often report non-specific symptoms such as
      tiredness. In addition, muscle symptoms such as cramps, weakness and myalgia are more common
      in SCH than in healthy controls. At present, evidence is lacking about the benefits of
      thyroxine replacement in the elderly with SCH, as no large randomized clinical trials (RCT)
      on the full range of relevant clinical outcomes, including tiredness have been performed.
      Moreover, there is continued uncertainty about the long-term impact on health related quality
      of life of thyroxine treatment for SCH. The aim of the study is to examine, within a large
      RCT of elderly participants with subclinical hypothyroidism, the impact of thyroxine therapy
      on the association between subclinical thyroid disease (SCTD) and the level of physical and
      mental fatigue. The existing trial infrastructure (TRUST thyroid trial-Euresearch FP7;
      clinicaltrials.gov ID: NCT 01660126) will be utilized to collect information on the level of
      physical and mental fatigue by using the Pittsburgh Fatigability Scale at baseline and at 1
      year from 220 participants with persistent subclinical hypothyroidism randomized to either
      thyroxine or placebo.

      Background

      Thyroid hormone is a key regulatory hormone for a range of physiological systems. An impaired
      function of the thyroid gland such as subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) can affect quality of
      life. Older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism often report non-specific symptoms such as
      tiredness. In addition, muscle symptoms such as cramps, weakness and myalgia are more common
      in SCH than in healthy controls. At present, evidence is lacking about the benefits of
      thyroxine replacement in the elderly with SCH, as no large randomized clinical trials (RCT)
      on the full range of relevant clinical outcomes, including tiredness have been performed.
      Moreover, there is continued uncertainty about the long-term impact on health related quality
      of life of thyroxine treatment for SCH.

      Objective

      To examine, within a large RCT of elderly participants with subclinical hypothyroidism (the
      TRUST trial), the impact of thyroxine therapy on the association between subclinical thyroid
      disease (SCTD) and the level of physical and mental fatigue.

      Methods

      The existing trial infrastructure (TRUST thyroid trial-Euresearch FP7, clinicaltrials.gov ID:
      NCT 01660126) will be utilized to collect information on the level of physical and mental
      fatigue by using the Pittsburgh Fatigability Scale at baseline and at 1 year from 220
      participants with persistent subclinical hypothyroidism randomized to either thyroxine or
      placebo.

    <description>The intervention will start with Levothyroxine 50 mcg daily (reduced to 25 mcg in subjects &lt;50 kg of body weight or if known coronary heart disease - previous myocardial infarction or symptoms of angina pectoris) vs. matching placebo; at 3 months, if the serum TSH level is &lt;0.4 mU/L, dose will be reduced by 25 mcg; TSH &gt;=0.4 and &lt;4.6 mU/L, no change to dose; TSH &gt;=4.6 mU/L, additional 25 mcg. The process will be repeated at 12 months, then annually; mock titration will be performed in the placebo group. The maximum possible dose of Levothyroxine which will be prescribed is 150 mcg (after 4 increments of 25 mcg at 3 months, 1, 2, 3 years; from the starting dose of 50 mcg).</description>
