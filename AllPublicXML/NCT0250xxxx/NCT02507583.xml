  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This human Phase 1 trial is a continuation of a Phase 1 trial which enrolled patients with
      recurrent gliomas (#TJU-14379-101) and which was designed after a previously conducted Phase
      1 human trial at our institution. With certain modifications, it is intended to reproduce the
      safety results of the recurrent glioma previous trials as well as explore any objective
      clinical responses in newly diagnosed patients. Protocol 14379-101 is closed to accrual and
      Abbreviated Clinical Report is prepared for FDA submission. The safety profile for this
      protocol was quite favorable.

      This treatment involves taking the patient's own tumor cells at surgery, treating them with
      an investigational new drug (an antisense molecule) designed to shut down a targeted surface
      receptor protein, and re-implanting the cells, now encapsulated in small diffusion chambers
      the size of a nickel in the patient's abdomen within 24 hours after the surgery. Loss of the
      surface receptor causes the tumor cells to die in a process called apoptosis. As the tumor
      cells die, they release small particles called exosomes, each full of tumor antigens. The
      investigators believe that these exosomes as well as the presence of the antisense molecule
      work together to activate the immune system against the tumor as they slowly diffuse out of
      the chamber. Immune cells are immediately available for activation outside of the chamber
      because a wound was created to implant these tumor cells and a foreign body (the chamber) is
      present in the wound. In this trial, a dose escalation of the therapeutic agent will involve
      an increase in both biodiffusion chamber number as well as the time the biodiffusion chambers
      remain implanted. The wound and the chamber fortify the initial immune response which
      eventually leads to the activation of immune system T cells that attack and eliminate the
      tumor. By training the immune system to recognize the tumor, the patient is also protected
      through immune surveillance from later tumor growth should the tumor recur. Compared to
      treatment alternatives for tumor recurrence, including a boost of further radiation and more
      chemotherapy, this treatment represents potentially greater benefit with fewer risks.

      This trial will be an adaptation of Protocol 101 which recently closed after rapid and
      complete accrual, now with an escalation of the induction vaccination in four cohorts. For
      practical purposes, a standard dose-escalation study is not possible with the current
      paradigm. Although the investigators may have identified a distinct bioactive byproduct of
      Insulin-like growth factor receptor-1 Antisense Oligodeoxynucleotide (IGF-1R/AS ODN)-induced
      tumor cell apoptosis (exosomes), it is difficult to perform a dose escalation in a typical
      fashion. Also, antigen concentration can affect immune response in a biphasic manner: too
      little or too much can dampen an immune response, so even if the antigen or antigens were
      known, a typical pharmacologic dose escalation would not follow typical pharmacokinetics. For
      these reasons, in Protocol 102, 32 patients will have therapy at initial surgery followed by
      implantation of 20 chambers for a duration of 48 hours. There was a documented increase in
      tumor infiltrating lymphocytes after treatment in our original trial, this observation
      provided preliminary supporting evidence that this therapeutic vaccine will elicit an
      adaptive immune response. Protocol 102 has been designed to further elucidate an immune
      response with a quantitative assessment of tumor specific T cells as well as circulating M2
      macrophages before and after treatment. The design of the Phase 1 trial will allow a
      statistical analysis of both antigen dose (number of chambers) and time of exposure (chamber
      dwell time) as either variable may relate to any toxicity or treatment response.

      A summary of the treatment paradigm includes: Pre-operative plasma leukopheresis, then
      surgery with tissue harvest and implantation of 20 diffusion chambers in the rectus sheath
      with IGF-1R/AS ODN as previously reported within 24 hours of craniotomy, implanted for 48
      hours. All patients who meet the eligibility criteria and agree to participate in this study
      will be potential candidates for therapy.

Blood (equivalent of 8 units of mononuclear cells by plasma leukopheresis) will be collected within 3 days of craniotomy and 7 tbsp of blood on days 14, 28, 42, 56, followed by every 3 months after vaccination to measure the degree of anti-glioma Cytotoxic T lymphoctye immunity achieved.</description>
