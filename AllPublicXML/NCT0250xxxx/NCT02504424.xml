    <textblock>
      This study is designed to allow existing investigators continued access to the AeroForm
      Tissue Expander to treat patients while AirXpanders completes a marketing application and
      during the review process by FDA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, single arm, open-label, continued access clinical study.
      Subjects who meet the inclusion criteria and agree to participate in the study will be
      enrolled and implanted with the investigational AeroForm Tissue Expander. If the subject is
      having a bilateral procedure, the AeroForm expander will be implanted in each side. Subjects
      will be followed until the first post-operative visit after explant of the tissue expander(s)
      and exchange for permanent implant(s).

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The safety of the device will be evaluated by the data collected on device related adverse events, serious device related adverse events, all adverse and serious adverse events (regardless of whether there is a causal relationship to the device), and device malfunctions leading to expander removal and/or replacement.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is female between the ages of 18-70

          -  Subject requires tissue expansion as part of breast reconstruction

          -  Subject is able to provide written informed consent

          -  Subject is able and willing to comply with all of the study requirements

          -  Subject has the physical, perceptual and cognitive capacity to understand and manage
             the at home dosing regimen

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject's tissue integrity is unsuitable for tissue expansion

          -  Subject has residual gross malignancy at the intended expansion site

          -  Subject has current or prior infection at the intended expansion site

          -  Subject has a history of failed tissue expansion or breast reconstruction

          -  Subject has any co-morbid condition determined by the Investigator to place the
             subject at an increased risk of complications (e.g., severe collagen vascular disease,
             poorly managed diabetes)

          -  Subject is taking any concomitant medications determined by the Investigator to place
             the subject at an increased risk of complications (e.g., Prednisone, Coumadin).
