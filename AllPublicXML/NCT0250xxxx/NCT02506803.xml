      Gemcitabine plus nub-paclitaxel (GEMABR) regimen was recently presented at an international

      Gemcitabine plus nub-paclitaxel (GEMABR) regimen was recently presented at an international
      oncology meeting and represents a new standard regimen in the treatment of metastatic
      pancreatic cancer. GEMABR is one of the high response rate treatment regimen, the
      investigators considered as a promising treatment as neoadjuvant chemotherapy . On the other
      hand , incidences of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia , febrile neutropenia and peripheral neuropathy
      were significantly higher in the g group compared with gemcitabine group. Therefore, it was
      decided to consider the balance of safety and efficacy as a preoperative chemotherapy, the
      investigators use the NAC-GEMABR regimen includes only two cycles (three times weekly and one
      week rest) of GEMABR regimen. The investigators also evaluate the optimal treatment schedule
      of NAC-GEMABR therapy as neoadjuvant chemotherapy, optimal duration between surgery and
      chemotherapy, R0 resection rate, and resection rate for borderline resectable pancreatic
      cancer.
