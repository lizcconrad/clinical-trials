    <textblock>
      M.M.A.TECH Ltd. product is an Acetabular Liner Family produced of an advanced polyimide -
      MP-1™.

      M.M.A.TECH Ltd. produces the Liners according to EN ISO 13485:2012 approved manufacturing
      process and supplies them to the customer.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate, in the frame of PMCF, the safety and performance of
      using AL-X MP1 Polyimide Acetabular liners in Total Hip Replacement surgery by clinical
      following up of patients for a period of 2 years .

      The procedure involves removal of the diseased parts of the joint, that is the damaged
      cartilage and adjacent bone, and replacing them with artificial parts which closely resemble
      in structure and/or function the removed native parts.

      The artificial parts fit onto the reshaped bone and are fixed either with bone cement (e.g.,
      polymethylmethacrylate) and press fit of the part(cemented), or by self-anchorage with bone
      ingrowth to its porous surface(cementless).

      The design of the artificial parts may include a stem, a keel or pegs, which fit onto the
      medullary canal of the bone or into a hole pre-prepared in the bone. An artificial part may
      fit loosely and be fixed with bone cement, press-fit for self- anchorage or include
      extendible anchors which are retracted upon placement and extended thereafter so as to secure
      the implant in place.

      Following fixation of the components, the joint is reduced and the soft tissue tension is
      appropriately checked to reassure stability of the joint.

      The MP-1™ acetabular liner will be tapper locked in acetabular metal shells to resurface the
      acetabular socket in cementless total hip replacement.

      MMaTech Ltd will manufacture the liners to perfectly fit into the external metallic shell of
      the following sizes (mm):

      LINER CUP SIZE LINER SIZE HEAD Liner thickness AL-2MP132040 44-48 32 ID 40 OD 32 4 mm
      AL-2MP136044 50-54 36 ID 44 OD 36 4mm AL-2MP136048 56-66 36 ID 48 OD 36 6mm AL-2MP140048
      56-66 40 ID 48 OD 40 4mm

      The MP-1™ Acteabular liners are intended to be used only against ceramic femoral heads-
      Biolox Delta

        Inclusion Criteria:

        The inclusion criteria for subject participation in the study are:
