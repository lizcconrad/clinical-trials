  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physicians play a critical role in reducing tobacco use by advising smoking patients to quit.
      After receiving such advice to quit smoking, patients were more likely to report trying to
      quit, quitting for at least 24 hours, making more quit attempts, and having more successful
      quitting outcomes compared with those who received no such advice. On the other hand, most
      physicians are not performing smoking cessation counselling, and miss the opportunities to
      advise patients to quit smoking. One of the common reasons is the lack of time. Physicians
      are busy and cannot afford even one minute to advice their patients to quit smoking. Other
      barriers include lack of training and experience, lack of knowledge and skills, no awareness
      about the benefits and effects of physicians' advice, no incentives and no support or
      requirement from hospital management that they have to do it.

      We designed a brief smoking cessation counselling model (AWARD) which takes only 10-20
      seconds. We will train the physicians to perform the AWARD cessation counselling model in
      clinic, and encourage them to participate in our brief smoking cessation intervention project
      using the randomized controlled trail (RCT) design and to train more peer physicians to
      perform brief smoking cessation counseling. We propose to investigate the effect of the
      training program on physicians' knowledge of tobacco cessation, practice of performing
      cessation counselling, and attitudes toward tobacco control policies.

      Participating hospitals/clinics will invite 100-120 internal medicine physicians to take part
      in the brief smoking counselling intervention project and participate in a half-day mini TTT
      training program. The training will cover the following topics:

        -  Goal and the details of the brief smoking counselling intervention;

        -  Objective of the mini TTT training program;

        -  Tobacco epidemic and control measures in China and the world;

        -  Physicians' role in tobacco control;

        -  Health risks of smoking, secondhand smoke exposure;

        -  WHO FCTC (Framework Convention on Tobacco Control) and the MPOWER measures;

        -  Brief smoking cessation counselling (AWARD model), and counselling skill with practice;

        -  Placebo counselling and counselling skill with practice.

      On the training day, the investigators will explain at the beginning of the workshop the
      purpose of the training, and the details of the brief smoking cessation intervention to all
      physicians who attend the training workshop. The investigators will explain that the
      participation is totally voluntary, and the participants will be invited to complete a
      paper-and-pencil survey before and right after the training workshop, perform smoking
      cessation counselling or placebo counselling among patients at their clinics, and complete
      online survey at 6- and 12-month follow-up. Agreement to participate in the training program
      will be considered as consent and participants are required to sign a written consent form.

      At the end of the workshop, participants should be confident to perform brief smoking
      cessation counselling and placebo counselling for patients.

      We hypothesize that the training program will increase the participants' knowledge level of
      smoking and secondhand smoke exposure and the important role of physicians in tobacco
      control, increase their skill and confidence of performing smoking cessation counselling, and
      generate stronger support for tobacco control policies.
