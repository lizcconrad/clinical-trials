  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The utility of adjuvant chemotherapy in the management of Small Bowel Adenocarcinoma (SBA)
      remains unproven and awaits the results of a large, global, prospective, phase III,
      randomised, controlled trial. Across the 830 million population of North America and Europe,
      there are approximately 3,000 patients with stage I-III SBA every year who would be
      potentially eligible for such an adjuvant chemotherapy trial.

      Given the absence of good-quality and evidence-based data, it has been agreed that a trial
      considering adjuvant chemotherapy versus no chemotherapy was appropriate for patients with
      stage I-III SBA in whom the oncologist and patient feel that the benefit of adjuvant
      chemotherapy is uncertain. For those patients with stage I-III SBA who, with their
      oncologists, feel that the potential benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy is certain (and hence
      are not willing to accept randomisation to the 'no chemotherapy' arm), a randomisation
      between single agent fluoropyrimidine versus doublet fluoropyrimidine and oxaliplatin
      chemotherapy will be offered. Tumour stage will be used as a stratification factor. Those
      patients who do not consent to be randomised will be offered registration to allow collection
      of demographic, clinicopathological and survival data, thereby making optimal use of the rare
      patient population available. In addition, archival Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded (FFPE)
      tissue and contemporaneous venous blood samples will be collected from every registered
      patient to allow molecular profiling and future translational research. A questionnaire about
      underlying risk factors (e.g. Crohn's disease, coeliac disease, Lynch syndrome etc) will be
      completed along with the other collected data on all registered patients.
