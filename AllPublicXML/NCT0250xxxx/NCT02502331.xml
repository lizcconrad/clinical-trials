      -  Number of doses and intervals: Two doses, 2 weeks apart

        -  Method of administration: Oral administration

        -  Volume of vaccine to be administered: 1.5 mL/dose

        -  Observational period: 4 weeks (2 weeks after each dose)

        -  Number of visits: 3 visits

             1. Visit 1: Screening and enrollment (1st dosing)

             2. Visit 2: 2nd dosing 2 weeks after 1st dose (14+3 days)

             3. Visit 3: 2 weeks after the 2nd dose (28+3 days), end of subject participation. This
                study will be carried out in healthy adults and children, at two sites, enrollment
                will be competitive between the sites. Subjects will be stratified according to age
                into adults (18~40 years of age) and children (1~17 years of age). According to the
                pre-generated randomization list, the participants will be randomized to the test
                or comparator groups (Visit 1) and will be given either the test vaccine or the
                comparator vaccine. For immunogenicity assessment, blood sample will be taken at
                Visit 1 (prior to vaccination), Visit 2 (prior to vaccination), and at the
                end-of-study Visit (Visit 3). For Safety assessment: the participants will be
                observed for 30 minutes post vaccination and instructed to record solicited adverse
                events that occur up to 6 days after vaccination on the participant diary card.

      This study is observer-blind: vaccine administrator and vaccine safety evaluator will be two
      distinct persons to avoid bias of safety assessment. Trial staff other than the vaccine
      administrator will remain blinded and will not handle the investigational product.

      1. Primary immunogenicity endpoint

             -  Geometric Mean Titer (GMT) of Vibriocidal antibodies against Inaba serogroup O1
                post second dose

             -  GMTof Vibriocidal antibodies against Ogawa serogroup O1 post second dose

             -  GMT of Vibriocidal antibodies against serogroup O139 post second dose

        2. Secondary immunogenicity endpoints

             -  Proportion of participants showing seroconversion against Inaba serogroup O1, Ogawa
                serogroup O1and serogroup O139 post vaccinations

             -  Seroconversion is defined as 4-fold rise in vibriocidal antibody titer at Visit 3
                two weeks after the second dose, compared to baseline titers, measured at Visit 1
                prior to vaccination.

      Proportion of participants with:

        1. Immediate reactions within 30 minutes after each dose of vaccination.

        2. Solicited systemic Adverse Events: nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, headache, fatigue,
           myalgia, fever, and anorexia/loss of appetite within 7 days after each vaccination.

             1. Diarrhea is defined as having 3 or more loose/watery stools within a 24-hour period
                or at least 1 bloody loose stool or any number of loose stools with signs of
                dehydration.

             2. Fever is defined as having an axillary temperature of 38 ℃

        3. Unsolicited Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events occurring 14 days following each
           vaccination, as reported by participants Measurement of Geometric Mean Titer of
           vibriocidal antibodies post vaccination, Ratio ofGeometric Mean Titer of vibriocidal
           antibodies post vaccination of Test vaccine' compared with 'Comparator vaccine'.

      Expected outcome: Statistical equivalence of the two vaccines.
