             drugs or the tolerability/safety measurements.

         22. Presence of clinically significant physical, laboratory, or electrocardiogram (ECG)
             findings (e.g., QTcF &gt; 470 msec for females, &gt; 450 msec for males, LBBB) at Screening
             that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may interfere with any aspect of study
             conduct or interpretation of results.
