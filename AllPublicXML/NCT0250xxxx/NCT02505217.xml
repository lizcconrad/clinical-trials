  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of patients who have had a heart attack with drugs that prevent formation of blood
      clots has been shown to reduce the patient's risk of subsequent cardiovascular events such as
      heart attack, stroke, and death. Because new drugs have increased treatment options, the
      development of tests that can guide treatment should improve treatment selection and further
      reduce the risk of cardiovascular events as well as bleeding. This study is designed to
      assess the value of new tests. It is a prospective study that will enroll patients who have
      had a heart attack. Blood will be taken during hospitalization for a heart attack (1 day
      after their heart attack) and a second time 6 months later during an ambulatory clinical
      visit. Investigators will perform biochemical tests on the blood that assess the likelihood
      of making blood clots. One tablespoon of blood will be taken at each time. Taking this amount
      of blood poses no risk to the participant. Investigators will ask the participant whether
      they have had bleeding or cardiovascular events during the initial evaluation, the ambulatory
      follow-up at 6 months, and during a telephone interview 1 year after enrollment. During their
      1 year of participation, investigators will review medical records and record information in
      a manner that protects the identity of all participants. We hypothesize that the biochemical
      test results will be similar at baseline and 6 month follow-up and that these biochemical
      tests will identify patients at greater risk of cardiovascular events and bleeding. Treatment
      of participants will not be altered by their participation in this study.
