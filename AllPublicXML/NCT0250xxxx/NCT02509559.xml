  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the present study is to combine two lines of research, investigating
      the interaction between emotional processing and memory performance (on both behavioral and
      electrophysiological levels) and its modulation by ß-blockade.

      Concerning pharmacological manipulations with ß-blockers, there are no studies, which
      investigated the effects of propranolol on electrophysiological (ERPs) and behavioral
      measures of recognition memory along with their codependence on individual variations of
      adrenergic receptors' polymorphisms. Till now, also the findings about genetic influences of
      ADRB1 and ADRB2 on recognition memory for emotional contents are lacking.

      Therefore, the current investigation has been designed to replicate the former results which
      revealed reduced ERP correlates of recognition memory for emotional pictures due to
      administration of ß-blocker propranolol. Furthermore investigators goal is to test, whether
      there are any differences between carriers of genetic variants of the ADRB1 and ADRB2 in
      memory performance and/or changes in event-related potentials and in propranolol influences
      on the above mentioned processes.

      In conclusion, investigators hypothesize: (1) a memory advantage of emotionally arousing
      stimuli over emotionally neutral pictures; (2) more pronounced ERP components (EPN, LPP,
      old-new effect) associated with encoding and memory for emotional stimuli; (3) a reduction of
      electrocortical correlates of emotional recognition memory (old-new effect) caused by
      propranolol; (4) a potential impact of genetic variants of the ADRB1 and ADRB2 on the
      emotional information processing and memory formation alone, and on the propranolol
      modulation of those processes.

      Furthermore, investigators hypothesize additional pharmacodynamic effects of propranolol such
      as influence on skin- conductance, pulse waves, burdening heart frequency, pulmonary function
      and metabolomics, which might depend on the ADRB1 and ADRB2 genotype.

    <description>ERPs were extracted from the continuous electroencephalography signal (EEG). ERPs analyzed during encoding were late positive potentials (LPPs) in the time-range 550-1000 ms after stimulus onset. ERPs analyzed during recognition were late positive complexes (LPCs) for stimuli associated with hit responses (learned pictures correctly recognized as known) and correct rejections (unlearned pictures correctly categorized as unknown) in time range 550-700 ms after stimulus onset. Subtraction of amplitude values for both types of LPCs results in ERP old/new effects.</description>
