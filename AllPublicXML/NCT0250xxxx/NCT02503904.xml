  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The principal aim of the present research is to compare two methods of antibiotic delivery:
      concomitant tumescent antibiotic delivery (TAD) and intravenous antibiotic delivery (IVAD)
      versus IVAD alone, (TAD+IVAD vs IVAD), with respect to the prevention of surgical site
      infections (SSI). The investigators hypothesize that TAD+IVAD will significantly reduce the
      incidence of SSI compared to IVAD.

      TAD is the subcutaneous infiltration of a dilute solution of antibiotic(s) in a solution of
      tumescent local anesthesia (TLA). TLA consists of a dilute solution of lidocaine (1gm/L),
      epinephrine (1mg/L) and sodium bicarbonate (10mEq/L) in 0.9% physiologic saline.

      A secondary aim of this study is to compare TAD+IVAD vs IVAD with respect to the prevention
      of post-operative venous thromboembolism (VTE).

      Tumescent antibiotic delivery (TAD) is defined as the subcutaneous infiltration of a dilute
      solution of antibiotic(s) in a solution of tumescent local anesthesia (TLA). TLA consists of
      a dilute solution of lidocaine (1gm/L), epinephrine (1mg/L) and sodium bicarbonate (10mEq/L)
      in 0.9% physiologic saline.

      The investigators hypothesize that TAD with intravenous antibiotic delivery (IVAD) will
      significantly reduce the incidence of SSI.

      The Principal aim of the present research is to compare two methods of antibiotic delivery:
      concomitant TAD and IVAD versus IVAD alone (TAD+IVAD vs IVAD) with respect to the prevention
      of surgical site infections (SSI). The secondary aim of this study is to compare TAD+IVAD vs
      IVAD with respect to the prevention of post-operative venous thromboembolism (VTE). This
      research is an open label randomized clinical trial (RCT) comparing two modes of antibiotic
      delivery. It is not a trial comparing antibiotics.

      The target populations for the present clinical trial are patients who have a high risk of
      SSI. These include patients exposed to high-risk surgical procedures (open abdominal
      surgeries, trauma surgeries, burn surgeries, sternotomy) or are obese, have diabetes, are
      immune-compromised or are otherwise at increased risk of SSI.

        pre-existing bacterial infections are not exclusionary in burn or trauma patients.

        12. Foreign material in the incision that cannot be removed 13. Recent systemic
        antimicrobial therapy 14. Clinically significant renal impairment or a creatinine clearance
