  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clopidogrel is a potent anti-thrombotic drug that inhibits adenosine diphosphate
      (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation. This is an open-label, randomized, single dose, three-way
      cross over, six sequence study to investigate the relative bioavailability of two 75
      milligrams (mg) clopidogrel tablet formulations (clopidogrel SB224326 test formulation 1
      [Clop F1] and clopidogrel SB224326 test formulation 2 [Clop F2]) compared with the reference
      product (innovator) in healthy human subjects. A total of 18 healthy human subjects will be
      randomized, such that approximately 14 evaluable subjects complete the study. Total duration
      in the study for each subject will be approximately 8 weeks from screening to the follow-up
      visit.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult subjects aged between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing
             the informed consent.

          -  Healthy, non-smoker, as determined by the investigator or medically qualified designee
             based on a medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination,
             laboratory tests and cardiac monitoring.

          -  A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameter(s) which is/are not
             specifically listed in the inclusion or exclusion criteria, outside the reference
             range for the population being studied may be included only if the investigator in
             consultation with the Medical Monitor if required, agree and document that the finding
             is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study
             procedures.

          -  Body weight &gt;=50 kilograms (kg) and Body mass index (BMI) within the range 19 - 24.9
             kg/square meter (m^2) (inclusive).

          -  Healthy male or female subjects: MALES: Male subjects with female partners of child
             bearing potential must comply with the following contraception requirements from the
             time of first dose of study medication until 24 hours after the last dose of study
             medication: a) Vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia. b) Male condom plus
             partner use of one of the contraceptive following options: Contraceptive subdermal
             implant, Intrauterine device or intrauterine system, Oral Contraceptive, either
             combined or progestogen alone, Injectable progestogen, Contraceptive vaginal ring,
             Percutaneous contraceptive patches, This is an all inclusive list of those methods
             that meet the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) definition of highly effective: having a failure
             rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and, correctly and, when
             applicable, in accordance with the product label. For non-product methods (e.g. male
             sterility), the investigator determines what is consistent and correct use. The GSK
             definition is based on the definition provided by International Conference on
             Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human
             Use (ICH). The investigator is responsible for ensuring that subjects understand how
             to properly use these methods of contraception. FEMALES: Eligible to participate, if
             she is not pregnant (as confirmed by a negative serum human chorionic gonadotrophin
             [hCG] test), not lactating, and at least one of the following conditions applies: a)
             Non-reproductive potential defined as: Pre-menopausal females with one of the
             following: Documented tubal ligation, Documented hysteroscopic tubal occlusion
             procedure with follow-up confirmation of bilateral tubal occlusion, Hysterectomy,
             Documented Bilateral Oophorectomy, Postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous
             amenorrhea (in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle
             stimulating hormone [FSH] and estradiol levels consistent with menopause). Females on
             hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be
             required to use one of the highly effective contraception methods if they wish to
             continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow
             confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study enrolment. b) Reproductive
             potential and agrees to follow one of the options listed below in the Modified List of
             Highly Effective Methods for Avoiding Pregnancy in Females of Reproductive Potential
             (FRP) from 30 days prior to the first dose of study medication and until 24 hours
             after the last dose of study medication and completion of the follow-up visit.

          -  Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             included.

          -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and bilirubin &gt;1.5xupper limit of normal (ULN)
             (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct
             bilirubin &lt;35%).

          -  Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities
             (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones)

          -  Corrected QT interval (QTc) &gt; 450 milliseconds (msec) NOTES: The QTc is the QT
             interval corrected for heart rate according to Bazett's formula (QTcB), Fridericia's
             formula (QTcF), and/or another method, machine-read or manually over-read. The
             specific formula that will be used to determine eligibility and discontinuation for an
             individual subject should be determined prior to initiation of the study. In other
             words, several different formulae cannot be used to calculate the QTc for an
             individual subject and then the lowest QTc value used to include or discontinue the
             subject from the trial. For purposes of data analysis, QTcB, QTcF, another QT
             correction formula, or a composite of available values of QTc will be used.
