      Background: In mainland China, the development of pediatric liver transplantation (LT) has
      lagged behind that of adult LT during the past two decades, but it has been progressing
      immensely in recent years. Renji hospital(shanghai) is currently the largest pediatric
      transplant center in mainland China.

      Aim and method: This study is performed for establishment of key techniques for pediatric LT
      in mainland China, including the indications and timing for pediatric LT, the criteria for
      donor selections, living donor LT planning, prevention and treatment for posttransplant
      complications, long-term follow-up management et al.

      Outcome measures:

        -  Annual caseloads of pediatric liver transplantation

        -  Patient survival: 1-, 3- and 5-year patient survival after liver transplantation

        -  Graft survival: 1-, 3- and 5-year graft survival after liver transplantation

        -  Posttransplant complications, such as biliary complications, vascular complications,
           acute rejections, infections et al.

        -  Perioperative data, such as duration of operations, postoperative hospital stay et al.

        -  Clinical data for living donors.
