  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical stenosis may occur in up to 19% after conization. It is a cause of infertility and
      amenorrhea. This study will test a new device named DUDA Device (&quot;Dispositivo Uterino para
      dilatar canal endocervical&quot;) placed just after the conization, in order to evaluate the
      safety, efficacy and quality of life.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This device has the potential to improve outcomes by means of a significant stenosis
      reduction and maintain patency of the endocervical canal to view the squamo-columnar junction
      (SCJ) of the cervix during follow-up of this patient.

    <description>The main safety events to be considered in this analysis are vaginal bleeding and uterine infection. The device is considered unsafe and consequently disrupted the study if a two adverse events Grade 3 or 4 (CTCAE v. 4.0) or a single adverse event Grade 5 related to the procedure/device happens during the phase 1.</description>

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Stenosis of the endocervical canal (early and late) will be assessed by clinical information and physical examination at each visit to the hospital after surgery. The participant will be asked about the menstrual flow and dysmenorrhea during history taking. On physical examination, after the visualization of the cervix through the speculum examination, the doctor will check the channel permeability introducing a hysterometer through it. The difficulty of introducing the hysterometer 2.5mm the channel will be scored according to the following scale:
Possible passage of hysterometer? () No difficulty () Little difficult, however possible passage of hysterometer () Unable to pass</description>

Procedure: Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure (LEEP) followed by implantation of the device called DUDA (plastic device developed in barretos cancer hospital that will be placed after conization. It has 2.5 cm in length and 5mm in diameter and remains within the endocervical canal for 30 days and is set at 4 points with nonabsorbable sutures in the ectocervix.)</description>
