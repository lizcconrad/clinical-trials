  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are testing different ways of following up with drivers who attend our
      health fairs to find the best way to make sure that taxi drivers go to important medical
      appointments and have a regular doctor to help with their health problems.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Garage Inclusion:

          -  Located in the NYC Borough of Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, or the Bronx

          -  Has a roster of at least 100 drivers

        Driver Inclusion:

          -  Male

          -  Between 21 to 85 years of age (We are selecting participants older than three years
             past the legal driving age of 18, as younger drivers tend to change jobs more often)

          -  Planning on remaining in NYC for at least 1 year, (with no vacations or trips to
             exceed two months)

          -  Licensed taxi driver for at least three months

          -  Affillated with a NYC garage

          -  Speaks English, Bengali, Urdu, Spanish, or French

          -  Owns a cell phone that can receive text messages and is willing to receive text
             messages for this study.

          -  Does not have a usual primary care provider(PCP) at baseline

          -  Has not seen a doctor for an annual physical within the last year not including annual
             required physical for work at baseline

        TIPs Inclusion:

          -  Between 21 to 85 years of age

          -  Male

          -  Planning on remaining in NYC for at least 1 year, (with no vacations or trips to
             exceed one month)

          -  Licensed taxi driver for at least two years

          -  Affilliated with a NYC garage

          -  Speaks English, (English proficiency required for TIPs training)

          -  Willing and able to attend in person TIPs training sessions

          -  As per study team judgment, based upon the TIPs screening tool, is socially active
             among fellow taxi drivers, cares about health issues, and wants to help others improve
             their health

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Garage/Site Exclusion:

          -  Does not agree to holding screening health fairs on location (e.g. does not sign
             enrollment form, or send email confirming agreement, or verbally agree to study team
             management)

        Driver Exclusion:

          -  Part-time driver (drives fewer than 35 hours per week) Although it is highly unlikely
             for NYC taxi drivers to work for multiple garages at study baseline, drivers may
             switch jobs and/or their garage base affiliation while participating in this study.
             New jobs and/or garage base affiliations will be tracked during follow-up assessments
             and noted for potential limitations with study retention and intervention
             contamination. Drivers will be allowed to continue the study even if they are no
             longer working with the initial garage base.
