  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) is characterized by repeated episodes of airway
      obstruction while sleeping. Upper airway obstruction while sleeping leads to a dramatic
      decrease in oxygen saturation and to hypoxemia finally, in which consequence the patient
      rapidly awake. Clinical signs are sleepiness and functional cognitive deficits. The Gold
      standard therapy is &quot;continuous positive airway pressure&quot; ventilation during sleep. However,
      the success depends strongly to the patient´s compliance. Surgical treatment is an
      alternative option, which could be considered if clinical success failed. A comparison of the
      cognitive function of both therapies is not yet analyzed. The study addresses the question
      which of this treatment options is favorable regarding cognitive function and outcome.

      Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) is characterized by repeated episodes of airway
      obstruction while sleeping. The &quot;Apnea-hypopnea index&quot; (AHI) defined as events per hour,
      gives information about the severity of the disease. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine
      Task Force&quot; defined that more than 5 episodes per hour is strongly suspect for an OSAS
      disease. Upper airway obstruction while sleeping leads to a dramatic decrease in oxygen
      saturation and to hypoxemia finally, in which consequence the patient rapidly awake. The
      prevalence rise with age and about 20% of the population is suspect to a sleep disorder.
      However about 1-5% of male and about 0,5-2% of female aged adults are affected. Main reason
      is obesity. Clinical signs are sleepiness and functional cognitive deficits. The Gold
      standard therapy is &quot;continuous positive airway pressure&quot; ventilation during sleep. However,
      the success depends strongly to the patient´s compliance. Surgical treatment is an
      alternative option, which could be considered if clinical success failed. It is notable that
      the long-term mortality is comparable in both medical treatment options. However, a
      comparison of the cognitive function of both therapies is not yet analyzed. The study
      addresses the question which of this treatment options is favorable regarding cognitive
      function and outcome.

    <description>Using different tests addressing a various quality of neurocognitive function (attention, memory, perceptual and processing speed, alertness and executive function) participants score test appropriate values. Comparing test values separately allows to distinguish between prior - and post - operative and prior and post - interventional status. Moreover it allows to discriminate achieved test results between both groups and calculate statistical differences. Favorable test results lead to a potential better neurocognitive function outcome and enable to assess neurocognitive function in the light of operation or interventional consequence.</description>
