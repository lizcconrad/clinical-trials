      The purpose of the proposed project is to pilot-test in the clinic setting a computer-based
      clinical decision support system (CDSS) designed to optimize medication prescribing for older
      persons with multiple chronic conditions and polypharmacy.

    <description>A modified version of the Patient Assessment of Care for Chronic Conditions (PACIC) will be used. The original tool is a 20 item instrument (100 points total) designed to assess a patients perception of one's health care (for chronic conditions). A higher score indicates a more favorable rating.</description>

    <description>A chart review will be completed of the 3 months following the clinic appointment at which the patient is enrolled in the study to document any changes that were made to the medication regimen.</description>

    <description>The Active Patient Participation Coding Scheme (APPC) is a validated instrument to assess indicators and facilitators of patient participation. Audio recordings will also be coded for evidence of providers' partnership building in the form of verbal encouragement to ask questions, express opinions, talk about their feelings, and participate in decision making.</description>

    <description>The intervention consists of completion of the tool (COMET) by means of a 30 minute telephone interview prior to the primary care visit and provision of the tool's output to the patient and primary care physician. The COMET tool takes information about the patient's medications and chronic conditions from the electronic health record, and then supplements this with information obtained by a telephone interview assessing the patient's cognition, social supports, medication adherence, home medication regimen, medication side effects, and health status. In addition, there is a chart review screen to record renal function, blood pressure, and hemoglobin A1C. All of this information is run through a set of algorithms to identify medication reconciliation errors and potentially inappropriate medications.</description>
