    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single injection of GEN0101
      in patients with recurrence of castration resistant prostate cancer.

      The subjects receive GEN0101 injection 4 times per two weeks (1st intratumoral injection and
      followed subcutaneous injection) and two weeks of observation as one cycle treatment period.
      Each subject receive two cycle treatment period.

      Low dose group: 30,000m NAU per injection of GEN0101 High dose group: 60,000m NAU per
      injection of GEN0101 Each group included minimal 3 subjects.
