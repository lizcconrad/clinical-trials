    <textblock>
      Despite the wide variety of products and antiseptic agents, no agent is ideal for every
      situation. The investigators would like to evaluate the difference in reducing bacterial
      load, using 4% chlorhexidine digluconate and 3% parachlorometaxylenol after a preoperative
      surgical scrubbing.

      The investigators conducted a controlled, prospective, randomized study to evaluate the
      antiseptic effectiveness of preoperative surgical scrubbing using 4% chlorhexidine
      digluconate and 3% parachlorometaxylenol. Samples were taken from the hands of each volunteer
      after a preparatory handwash, pre-surgical scrubbing, post-surgical scrubbing and 3 hours
      after surgical scrubbing.

    <description>Both hands were scrubbed using a sterile disposable surgical scrub brush with plastic bristles on one side and a foam sponge on the other side. The bristled side was used to scrub the entire hands, including all nails, palm and back of the hand, and interdigital spaces, and the foam side was used to rub between the fingers. Each side of each finger, between fingers and back al palm of the hand were rubbed for two and a half minute. Then, the forearms were rubbed from the wrist to the elbow, maintaining the hand highest than the arm, using a minute to wash each side. Both hands were rinsed by current water in an one-way (from the fingertips to the elbow), and wiped with a sterile disposable towel, including nails and interdigital spaces.</description>

Both hands were scrubbed using a sterile disposable surgical scrub brush with plastic bristles on one side and a foam sponge on the other side. The bristled side was used to scrub the entire hands, including all nails, palm and back of the hand, and interdigital spaces, and the foam side was used to rub between the fingers. Each side of each finger, between fingers and back al palm of the hand were rubbed for two and a half minute. Then, the forearms were rubbed from the wrist to the elbow, maintaining the hand highest than the arm, using a minute to wash each side. Both hands were rinsed by current water in an one-way (from the fingertips to the elbow), and wiped with a sterile disposable towel, including nails and interdigital spaces.
