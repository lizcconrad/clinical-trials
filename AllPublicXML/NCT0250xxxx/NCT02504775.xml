    <description>AUC(0-t) of paracetamol was calculated using the trapezoidal rule. Blood samples were taken before the administration of the reference/test product (pre-dose) and at 0.250, 0.333, 0.500, 0.667, 0.833, 1.000, 1.250, 1.500, 1.750, 2.000, 4.000, 6.000, 8.000, 12.000 and 16.000 hours (h) after each period.</description>
