  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/1b dose-escalation study of BTCT4465A (Mosunetuzumab) administered as a
      single agent and in combination with atezolizumab in participants with relapsed or refractory
      B-cell NHL and CLL. The study will consist of a dose-escalation stage and an expansion stage
      where participants will be enrolled into indication-specific cohorts.
