  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether the add of Rifaximin in patients with liver
      cirrhosis and esophageal varices treated with a standard therapy with beta blockers, leads to
      a significant reduction of portal hypertension.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is well recognized that the gut flora may play an important role in the development of
      complications of liver cirrhosis, such as hepatic encephalopathy (HE), spontaneous bacterial
      peritonitis (SBP) and variceal bleeding, which are are directly caused or aggravated by the
      translocation of enteric bacteria or their products into the blood of cirrhotic
      patients.Preliminary studies have shown that selective intestinal decontamination appears to
      ameliorate the hyperdynamic circulatory state of cirrhosis. The investigators hypothesize
      that a modulation of gut microbiota by administering a non-adsorbable antibiotic, in addition
      to beta-blockers, can be a safe strategy to reduce the portal pressure, influencing favorably
      hemodynamics of portal circulation. Thus, the purpose of this study is to evaluate if in
      patients with liver cirrhosis and esophageal varices at high risk of bleeding, Rifaximin,
      administered in addition to standard therapy with beta - blockers (propranolol), for a time
      of 60 days: leads to a significant reduction of Hepatic Venous Pressure Gradient (it will be
      assessed by hepatic vein catheterization), 2) modify the intestinal flora in favor of
      specific families of bacteria (it will be assessed by fecal microbiota analysis), 3) change
      systemic inflammatory responses (it will be assessed by serum pro-inflammatory cytokines) 4)
      change in cognitive functions (it will be assessed by neuropsychological and
      electroencephalogram evaluations).

    <description>At Time 0 and after 60 days all patients will underwent hepatic vein catheterization to obtain the Hepatic Venous Pressure Gradient. Treatment response is defined as a decrease from baseline in the hepatic venous pressure gradient of at least 20% or less than 12 mmHg</description>

    <description>Both at time 0 and after 60 days, samples of 3 mL of faeces produced within 6 hours will be collected and frozen at -80° for the analysis of the gut microbiota (the samples will be stored at -80°C). Gut microbiota will be studied through sequencing of hyper-variable regions of the 16S Ribosomal Ribonucleic Acid gene.</description>

    <time_frame>Time 0 and after 60 days</time_frame>
    <description>Cognitive function will be assessed at time 0 and after 60 days by neuropsychological and neurophysiological measures. Neuropsychological investigation will be performed using the Italian version of the Psychometric Hepatic Encephalopathy Score that and with the Animal Naming Test (number of animals named in 60 sec). Neurophysiological investigation will be done by Emotiv Electroencephalogram equipment. Spontaneous closed-eyes rest activity will be recorded by a 14 channels plus 2 references offering optimal positioning for accurate spatial resolution.</description>
