      Parabolic flight is the only ground-based condition in which free-fall (0G) can be created
      long enough for safely testing changes in human perception and behavior. In addition to the
      0G period, parabolic flight generates equal duration periods of 1.8G, which present another
      unique opportunity to test the same responses to hypergravity and back to 1G.

      It is well known that performance decrements occur in astronauts during and after gravity
      level transitions. Illusions are commonly felt in orbit as well disorientation and perceptual
      limitations, mainly due to both psycho-physiological changes and adaptation and lack of
      familiar points of reference in the space environment. Studies performed during previous
      space missions showed several changes occurring in different gravity conditions, pointing
      out, for example, that colors and shadows were misleading, the depth and distance perception
      were weakened, and the linear perspective was lost. Visual perception is of primary
      importance for spatial orientation and object recognition because the static vestibular
      (otolithic) and proprioceptive signals are absent when free-floating. Consequently,
      astronauts become increasingly dependent on vision to perceive motion and orientation. All
      these factors play an important role in the adaptation of humans to spaceflight that needs to
      be analyzed to understand the underlying mechanisms that regulate human psycho-physiological
      adaptive process to changing gravity. Human psycho-physiological health has to be safeguarded
      and possibly improved when long-term human space missions are programmed in the near future.

      The primary objective of this experiment is to investigate if the SWI illusion is present in
      altered gravity environments. Since weight cannot be estimated in 0G, investigators have
      developed a procedure during which the subject is asked to estimate the objects' mass by
      shaking them rather than lifting them. Our results in 1G indicate that a size-mass illusion
      (SMI) is also present in 1G. Our hypothesis is that the previously observed alteration in 3D
      visual perception in 0G, particularly in the height of 3D objects, as well as the change in
      proprioceptive inputs, will be responsible for changes in the SMI in 0G and 1.8G compared to
      1G. In a separate proposal, investigators will also propose to perform this experiment using
      the ESA short-arm human centrifuge (SAHC), with subjects exposed to various centrifugal force
      levels, to further investigate the role of proprioceptive cues in the size-mass illusion.
