  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential role of the enteral feeding systems on the
      bacterial colonization of premature infants during their NICU admittance and its evolution
      after 2 years, which is the age when the infant's gut starts to contain an adult-like
      microbiota.

    <textblock>
      First spontaneously evacuated meconium and fecal samples were collected by the medical staff
      of the Hospital weekly from the diapers of the infants during their stay at the Neonatal
      Intensive Care Unit.

      To evaluate the potential role of the enteral feeding systems as a site for colonization by
      nosocomial bacteria, and, its impact on early gut colonization of preterm neonates, mother's
      own milk, donor milk and preterm formula samples were obtained after passing through the
      external part of the enteral feeding tubes and cultured.

      Later, when the infants reached 2 years of age, parents were contacted by phone to provide an
      additional fecal sample if their infants had not taken antibiotics within the previous 2
      months.

    <description>The meconium and fecal samples of the infants have been analysed microbiologically. In parallel, own's mother milk, donor milk and formula milk have been analyzed microbiologically after their pass through the nasogastric feeding tube. The bacterial strains isolated from fecal samples of each infant have been compared with the bacterial strains isolated from the milk that have received each of them.</description>
