  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inclusion and exclusion criteria for fetal repair of MMC was established by the Management of
      Myelomeningocele Study (MOMS Trial) and these criteria are the standard of care throughout
      the United States. These criteria state exclusion for hypertension and diabetes which are
      known co-morbidities for obesity. Investigators plan to expand one exclusion criteria for
      open fetal repair surgery. Currently, an exclusion factor is a maternal BMI of 35.0 and
      greater.Investigators will maintain all other inclusion and exclusion criteria (including
      excluding for hypertension and diabetes) with the exception of expanding the BMI to include
      mothers with a BMI of 35.0 to 40.0. Co-morbidities of the research group will be compared to
      the comorbidities of the mothers published in the MOMS trial.

      The MOMS trial proved prenatal repair of myelomeningocele was an advantage over postnatal
      repair for the fetus/neonate/child and is the standard of care for maternal/fetal dyads who
      meet the inclusion exclusion criteria. Investigators plan to maintain all inclusion exclusion
      criteria for open fetal repair surgery of myelomeningocele with one exception, the expansion
      of the maternal BMI to 40.0. This population of mothers with a BMI of 35.0 to 40.0 have not
      been studied. The morbidities of these mothers will be compared to morbidities of mothers
      with a BMI less than or equal to 34.9 currently in the scientific literature.
