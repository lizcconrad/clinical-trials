      The goal of this study is to find out what clinical reasoning process physiotherapists
      undergo when observing hemiplegic patients gait.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Physiotherapists don't usually use any assessments to evaluate gait but observe it without an
      instrument. The questions in this study are:

        -  what abnormalities can physiotherapists detect when observing a patient walking?

        -  what do they consider the main problem that has a negative effect on the patient's
           walking?

        -  what hypothesis do they generate?

        -  how is the inter-rater reliability for the &quot;main problem&quot; and the hypothesis?

    <description>The questionnaire will be the basis of this study as it will be the basis for open coding. It is handed out to 54 observers (=physiotherapists) and will be filled in 6 times (for 6 patient videos).
The questionnaire consists of 3 main questions:
what gait abnormalities do you see?
What do you consider the main problem (1 sentence)
what is your hypothesis (max. 3) The question one delivers different items (each new observation is a new item) that were determined patient by patient and rater by rater by three independent researchers. They were then listed and categorised by consensus. Finally, the frequency of each item was analysed globally and for each patient.</description>

Items were afterwards categorised. Finally the frequency of each item was analysed globally and for each patient.</description>

    <description>54 Physiotherapists (PT's) working in north-west Switzerland (at Bruderholzspital, RehaB Basel, Klinik Tschugg, Reha Rheinfelden, RehaClinic Zurzach) are asked to analyse videos of 6 hemiplegic patients when walking. They are asked to write down their main observations, the major problem and hypotheses about how this major problem is produced.
