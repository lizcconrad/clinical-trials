    <textblock>
      This project focuses on an at-risk adolescent and young adult population who may gain
      long-term health benefits from detection of risk factors at a young age. The primary aims of
      this proposal are: 1) To observe whether adolescents and young adults with Polycystic Ovary
      Syndrome (PCOS) are more likely to have elevated liver fat (&gt;/=4.8%) than controls by
      studying liver fat deposition measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS); 2) To assess
      the association of percentage liver fat with biomarkers of Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
      (NAFLD), dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and body composition in PCOS and controls.

      In the proposed study, 40 adolescents and young adults with PCOS and 40 age-comparable
      control subjects will be evaluated for metabolic disturbances and elevated liver fat using
      noninvasive and state-of-the-art techniques including MRI, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry
      and an oral glucose tolerance test in order to fully assess the metabolic and body
      composition differences between these groups. This research proposal represents a critical
      step in understanding the metabolic and cardiovascular comorbidities of PCOS and their
      relationship to NAFLD. The investigator hopes to use the results generated by this research
      proposal in order to lay the groundwork for the prevention and treatment of metabolic
      disorders in adolescents with PCOS. The overarching goal is to decrease and prevent lifelong
      morbidity associated with this common disorder.

      PCOS is a common condition that frequently presents in adolescence and young adulthood and is
      defined by the presence of hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction. Affected individuals
      are at increased risk of insulin resistance, NAFLD and dyslipidemia, which are features
      associated with the metabolic syndrome, a major public health concern. The associations
      between PCOS and both insulin resistance and dyslipidemia have been extensively described;
      however, its association with NAFLD has only recently been noted and superficially studied in
      adolescents and young adults. Additionally, it has not yet been fully elucidated why
      seemingly healthy nonobese adolescents with PCOS are predisposed to insulin resistance and
      its related complications. The susceptibility of certain PCOS patients to developing NAFLD is
      theorized to be due to the following potentiating factors: insulin resistance,
      hyperandrogenemia, and a genetic predisposition.
