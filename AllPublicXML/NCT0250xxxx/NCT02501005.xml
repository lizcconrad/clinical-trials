    <textblock>
      The BERLIN VT study is designed to evaluate the impact of prophylactic ventricular
      tachycardia (VT) ablation on all-cause mortality and unplanned hospital admission for
      congestive heart failure or symptomatic ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (VF)
      when compared to VT ablation after the third appropriate implantable
      cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) shock.
