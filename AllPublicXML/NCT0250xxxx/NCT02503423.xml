    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, dose-escalation Phase 1/2 study to assess the safety of ASTX660,
      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), and recommended
      dosing regimen, and to obtain preliminary efficacy, pharmacokinetic (PK), and target
      engagement data, in subjects with advanced solid tumors or lymphoma for whom standard
      life-prolonging measures are not available.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ASTX660 is a synthetic small molecule dual antagonist of cellular inhibitor of apoptosis
      protein (cIAP) 1 and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) that has been shown to
      have potent proapoptotic and tumor growth inhibitory activity in nonclinical models. ASTX660
      has not been previously evaluated in human subjects. The Phase 1 portion of the study will
      determine the MTD, RP2D, and recommended dosing regimen. The Phase 2 portion will evaluate
      activity in selected tumor types.

      Subjects will continue to receive their assigned treatment throughout the study until the
      occurrence of disease progression, death, or unacceptable treatment-related toxicity, or
      until the study is closed by the sponsor.

      Tolerability and safety of study treatment will be evaluated throughout the study by
      collection of clinical and laboratory data. In Phase 2, antitumor response will be assessed
      using computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans or other appropriate
      disease evaluation methods. In subjects with solid tumors, response will be evaluated
      according to standard Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1; Appendix 3).
      In subjects with DLBCL and PTCL, antitumor response will be evaluated according to the 2014
      Lugano classification (Appendix 5). In subjects with CTCL, global overall response criteria
      will be used, based on skin, blood, node, and viscera assessments (Appendix 4).
