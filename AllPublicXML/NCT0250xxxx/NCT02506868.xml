      The purpose of the study is to prove equivalence of efficacy and safety of BCD-066 and
      Aranesp® in treatment of anemia in end-stage chronic kidney disease patients on dialysis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study CKD patients on dialysis previously treated by short-acting epoetins will
      switch to one of darbepoetin alfa products - BCD-066 (experimental arm) or Aranesp (active
      comparator) to maintain previously achieved target level of hemoglobin (100-120 g/l).

      Patients will be treated for 52 weeks. IV iron supplementation will be provided to maintain
      serum ferritin level above 500 µg/l according to KDIGO Anemia Guidelines (2012).
