    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the factors that influence limb fitting in those with
      diabetes compared to those without diabetes. The population without diabetes will usually
      present with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and are similar in management following LEA.
      The impact that not walking with a prosthesis has long term on both populations will be
      explored. In general, previous research has used retrospective analysis of case notes which,
      although valuable, have fixed fields and only allow the researcher to look at associations
      between factors not at causation. Additionally, very few have followed a population over
      time. Therefore this study will be a prospective observational analysis of all those who
      undergo a LEA in one year from 01/03/14 to 28/02/15 within the Greater Glasgow &amp; Clyde area
      with follow up at 6, 12 &amp; 18 months from date of amputation.

      This research has been designed to ask the following question: What are the factors that
      influence the rehabilitation and functional outcomes following LEA, in the long term in both
      those with and without diabetes.

      Therefore this study will be a prospective observational analysis of all those who undergo a
      LEA in one year within the Greater Glasgow &amp; Clyde area with follow up at 6, 12 &amp; 18 months
      from date of amputation.

        -  Primary Endpoint Comparison of rehabilitation and functional outcomes in those with
           diabetes to those without diabetes, up to 18 months post LEA.

        -  Secondary endpoints

             1. At discharge from rehabilitation, the characteristics of those who proceed to limb
                fitting following LEA to those who do not will be defined.

             2. At discharge from rehabilitation, the characteristics of those with diabetes that
                do not proceed to limb fitting following LEA compared to those who do.

             3. At discharge from rehabilitation to 18 months post LEA, a comparison of the
                characteristics in those with and without diabetes.

             4. From six months post LEA, at 6 monthly intervals (6,12 &amp; 18 months), a comparison
                of the health status, social circumstances, mobility and quality of life measures
                in those with and without diabetes.
