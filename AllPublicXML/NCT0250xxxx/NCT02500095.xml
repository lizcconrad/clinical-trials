    <textblock>
      Background: Calorie restriction increases longevity in many species and attenuate the
      development of chronic disorders including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and
      cancer. In mice reduced activity of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and/or insulin is
      associated with extended longevity. Growth hormone (GH) is the main regulator of IGF-I
      production, but the molecular mechanism whereby GH switches from IGF-I stimulation (protein
      anabolism) to fatty acid oxidation (fatty acid catabolism) as well as induction of insulin
      resistance during fasting remains enigmatic.

      Hypotheses: The changes of the global set of metabolites, induction of insulin resistance,
      and the shift in metabolism from protein anabolism to lipolysis together with the potentially
      favorable effect of calorie restriction during fasting depend on preserved fasting-induced GH
      secretion.

      Aim: The investigators wish to provide knowledge on changes in metabolites and shift in
      signaling pathways that take place at the transition to the fasting state among healthy
      overweight and obese subjects. Furthermore the investigators wish to determine the effect of
      GH on the adaption of the metabolism to a fasting state.
