      alcohol use disorder or substance use disorders.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to sustained military conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq over the past decade, there are
      an increasing number of U.S. military personnel and Veterans returning home with
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and comorbid alcohol use disorders (AUD) and substance
      use disorders (SUD). If left untreated, Veterans with co-occurring PTSD and substance use
      disorders are at increased risk for developing other mental health problems (e.g.,
      depression, anxiety), suicidal ideation and attempts, physical health problems, reduced
      resiliency and military readiness, employment problems, violence, and family/relationship
      impairment. While mental health services are in place for U.S. service members, substantial
      gaps in the treatment of co-occurring PTSD and SUD exist and there is little scientific
      evidence available to guide the provision of care. As part of the Consortium to Alleviate
      PTSD (CAP), the proposed study directly addresses this critical knowledge gap by testing the
      efficacy of doxazosin, a long-acting and selective alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist, as compared
      to placebo in reducing PTSD and AUD/SUD severity among U.S. military personnel. The
      medication to be investigated (doxazosin) represents a novel treatment approach for PTSD and
      AUD/SUD. While prazosin, also an alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist, has been shown to improve
      sleep and nightmares in military personnel with PTSD and may help reduce substance use
      severity, it has a short half-life of 2-3 hours and requires multiple doses each day, which
      is a significant limitation. In several pilot studies, doxazosin has shown promise in
      significantly reducing symptoms of PTSD and AUD/SUD and, in contrast to prazosin, it requires
      once per day dosing which confers a significant advantage in terms of translating positive
      findings into routine clinical practice. In this Stage II study, the investigators will (1)
      employ a two-arm randomized, double-blind, between-groups experimental design that will
      consist of 12 weeks of treatment with doxazosin or placebo medication; (2) use standardized,
      repeated dependent measures to rigorously assess PTSD symptomatology and AUD/SUD severity;
      (3) measure impairment in associated mental and behavioral health problems (e.g., depression,
      anxiety, sleep, risky behaviors, family/social functioning); and (4) use functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the underlying pathophysiology of comorbid PTSD/AUD
      and identify prognostic indicators of treatment outcome. To achieve these aims, the
      investigators have assembled a multidisciplinary team of investigators with
      nationally-recognized expertise in combat-related PTSD, substance use disorders and
      neuroimaging who have successfully collaborated in the past and are uniquely qualified to
      implement this type of investigation. The investigators represent a collaboration of faculty
      at the Ralph H. Johnson Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center and the Medical University of
      South Carolina (MUSC) in Charleston, SC.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female; any race or ethnicity.

          2. Served in U.S. Military - any branch or operation.

          3. Subjects must be able to comprehend English.

          4. Meet criteria for current (i.e., last 6 months) Substance Use Disorder (SUD) using a
             modified version of the MINI 7.0 (i.e., must meet DSM-5 criteria for SUD in the past 6
             months instead of 12 months).

          5. Meet DSM-5 criteria for current (i.e., last month) PTSD.

          6. Subjects taking psychotropic medications will be required to be maintained on a stable
             dose for at least four weeks before treatment initiation. This is because initiation
             or change of medications during the course of the trial may interfere with
             interpretation of results.

          7. Must consent to random assignment to doxazosin or placebo.

          8. Must consent to complete all treatment and follow-up visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects meeting DSM-5 criteria for current bipolar affective disorders, as the study
             protocol may be therapeutically insufficient.

          2. Subjects experiencing significant withdrawal symptoms, as evidence by a score of 10 or
             above on the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment of Alcohol (CIWA). These subject
             will be referred for clinical detoxification and may be re-assessed for study
             eligibility after medically supervised detoxification has been completed.

          3. Individuals considered an immediate suicide risk or who are likely to require
             hospitalization during the course of the study.

          4. Previous treatment with doxazosin.

          5. Subjects on maintenance anxiolytic, antidepressant, or mood stabilizing medications
             which have been initiated during the past four weeks. If it is determined, based on
             clinical criteria, that a subject needs to be started on maintenance medications for
             anxiety, mood or psychotic symptoms during the course of the study, they may be
             discontinued from the treatment trial.

          6. Women who are pregnant, nursing or not practicing an effective form of birth control.

          7. Individuals with a history of or current medical illness including unstable angina,
             myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure or other cardiac condition,
             hypotension, renal or hepatic disorders, endocrine disorders, prostate or other
             cancer, pancreatitis, or a seizure disorder.

          8. Subjects with abnormal liver function test (LFTs) as evidenced by laboratory findings
             of SGOT or SGPT greater than two times normal.

          9. Subjects with a history of adverse reactions to quinazolines or other
             alpha-1-antagonists (such as allergic reactions, priapism, hepatitis, angioedema, or
             intraoperative floppy iris syndrome).

         10. Individuals currently taking alpha blockers (terazosin, prazosin),
             hypnotics/benzodiazepines, atypical antipsychotics (olanzapine, quetiapine,
             risperidone, clozapine), alpha-2-agonists (Clonidine, methyldopa, tizanidine,
             guanfacine), conivaptan, boceprevir, idelalisib, PDE-5 inhibitors or
             alpha-1-antagonists, protease inhibitors (treatment of HIV), oral antifungals,
             alfuzosin, pazopanib, silodosin, tadalafil, or tamulosin.

         11. MRI exclusions: Claustrophobia; tattoos above the shoulders after evaluation by MRI
