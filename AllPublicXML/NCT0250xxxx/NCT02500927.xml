  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, the antitumor activity and the
      pharmacokinetics of ASP8273 in EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI)-naïve patients with
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring EGFR activating mutations.

      This study consists of a single-dose period (Cycle 0 lasting 3 days) and a multiple-dose
      period (from Cycle 1 onwards, each cycle lasting 21 days). To compare the PK between ASP8273
      Capsules and ASP8273 Capsules A, enrolled subjects will receive a single oral dose of ASP8273
      Capsules A on Day 1 of Cycle 0 in the single-dose period and will then be observed for 3 days
      (including the day of dosing). In the multiple-dose period, subjects will receive multiple
      oral doses of ASP8273 Capsules during each cycle lasting 21 days. From the viewpoint of PK
      comparison (bioavailability [BA] evaluation) between ASP8273 Capsules and ASP8273 Capsules A,
      data from approximately 15 subjects are sufficient for the evaluation. Therefore, if PK data
      of approximately 15 subjects included in BA evaluation are obtained and the sponsor judges
      that further acquisition of PK data is not necessary, the single-dose period will not be
      conducted in subjects who are enrolled thereafter (subjects not included in BA evaluation).
      Subjects will continue to receive treatment with ASP8273 until they meet the discontinuation
      criteria.
