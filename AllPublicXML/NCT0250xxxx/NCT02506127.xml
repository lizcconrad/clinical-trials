      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the effectiveness and efficacy of
      intermittent Theta Burst Stimulation (iTBS) for treatment of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).
      Subjects will be randomly assigned to two weeks (10 sessions) of treatment with open-label
      iTBS, blinded iTBS or blinded sham. 'Open-label' means that you (the subject) and the study
      staff will know that you are receiving active iTBS treatment. 'Blinded' or 'sham-controlled'
      means that you, the subject, will not know whether the treatment you receive is the active
      treatment or the non-active treatment. In the 'sham' condition, the stimulator will turn on
      but will not actually be stimulating your brain. Subjects who do not show remission of
      symptoms after the first 2 weeks of treatment will receive 10 additional treatment sessions
      with open-label active iTBS. Subjects will be evaluated at Week 12 to assess the durability
      of symptoms changes.

    <description>Theta burst stimulation (TBS) is a form of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Standard TBS parameters consisting of 3-pulse, 50Hz bursts every 200 ms (5 Hz) at an intensity of 80% motor threshold (MT) will be utilized. Intermittent TBS will be delivered in 2-second trains of bursts repeated every 10 seconds for a total of 570 seconds (1800 pulses) in each session.
Each treatment session thus involves &lt; 10 minutes of stimulation. The subject and researchers know what treatment is being administered.</description>

    <description>This is a sham treatment which will mimic the open-label and blinded active to enable the effects of the supposedly &quot;active&quot; treatment to be assessed objectively. The subject and researcher will not know what type of treatment will be administered.
Each treatment session will be &lt; 10 minutes in duration.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Outpatients with non-psychotic, unipolar Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) assessed via
             the MINI structured interview

          2. Must have been on a stable dose of antidepressant medication (excluding tricyclic
             antidepressants) for at least 1 month prior to randomization, and with significant
             residual MDD symptoms as evidenced by a HamD17 score &gt; 17;

          3. If receiving medication other than for depression (e.g., anxiety, sleep, mood
             stabilization), must have been on stable dose for at least 1 month prior to
             randomization

          4. A history of treatment failure with at least one adequate trial of an antidepressant
             medication in the current episode, assessed by the Antidepressant Treatment and
