  <brief_summary>

      The present study is designed to assess the effects of Rifampin on the pharmacokinetics of
      N91115 in healthy subjects.

    <textblock>
      This study will assess the effects of multiple oral dose administration of rifampin on the
      steady state plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) of N91115 in healthy subjects.

      Eligible subjects (n=15) will receive oral doses of N91115 twice daily (approximately every
      12 hours) on Study Days 1 through the morning of Day 13. On Study Days 8 through 12, rifampin
      administered 600 mg once daily will be added to the N91115 regimen. Study subjects will be
      monitored for safety while housed in the clinical research unit (CRU) until discharge on Day
      14. Pharmacokinetics will be followed from Study Day 1 through Study Day 14. A follow-up
      phone call will be made on Day 20 (1 day). Participation of an individual subject may last up
      to approximately 48 days from the time of screening until the end-of-study follow-up call.
