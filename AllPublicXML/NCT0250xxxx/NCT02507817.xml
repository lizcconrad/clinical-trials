  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During embryonic development, there are several cytokines such as: LIF (Leukemia inhibitory
      factor), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), epidermal growth factor family (EGF), neuregulin
      1 (NRG1) and transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) that were found are associated with
      neurogenesis and differentiation of brain cells.

      LIF is a cytokine that is essential for the development of the central nervous system, and
      has recently been shown in rats that maternal LIF stimulates placental ACTH
      (adrenocorticotropic hormone) that in turn promotes secretion of fetal LIF from nRBC
      (nucleated red blood cell ), which in turn promotes brain development of the fetus In other
      studies on rats a theory was proposed that LPS (lipopolysaccharide) and infection during
      pregnancy influence the normal development of the brain and may cause brain damage by
      altering placental ACTH thank in turn alters LIF secretion in the embryo which could be the
      cause of brain damage.

      Our hypothesis is that by treating the mother with Magnesium Sulphate we can protect the
      embryo's brain in one of two ways:

        1. Altering Placental ACTH

        2. Altering the number of receptors for LIF in the brain Women who are at risk for preterm
           labor prior to 32 weeks of gestation are treated with Magnesium Sulphate for
           neuroprotection, randomized controlled studies showed that if these women are treated in
           the 24 hours prior to labor with magnesium sulphate the risk for cerebral palsy and
           other severe motor problems are decreased.

      The mechanism for this decrease is unknown and that is the purpose of our study.

      The purpose of our research is to examine maternal LIF levels prior to birth and Maternal and
      cord levels after delivery and to see if levels are different if the mother was treated with
      Magnesium Sulphate. We will also check the placental ACTH level
