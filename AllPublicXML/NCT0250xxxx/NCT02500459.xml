    <textblock>
      Topotecan is an FDA-approved drug when given by intravenous infection. The purpose of this
      study is to determine if treatment with topotecan by an alternative method, direct delivery
      into the part of the brain where the tumor has spread, is safe and well tolerated. The
      Cleveland Multiport Catheter is a new, investigational device that will be used to deliver
      topotecan into tumor-infiltrated brain. A second purpose of this study is to determine
      whether the Cleveland Multiport Catheter can be used effectively and safely to deliver
      topotecan into tumor-infiltrated brain. This study will also examine how tumors responds to
      treatment with topotecan. This study will also look at the way topotecan is injected into
      tumors-infiltrated brain. A small amount of contrast dye (called gadolinium DTPA) will be
      added to topotecan before it is injected. Pictures will be taken of the brain with an MRI
      machine. This will allow the investigators to see where in the tumor-infiltrated brain the
      topotecan has been injected. This study will collect medical information before, during, and
      after treatment in order to better understand hot to make this type of procedure accessible
      to patients.

      Primary Objectives

        -  To investigate by magnetic resonance (MR) imaging the spatial and temporal distribution
           of topotecan in tumor-infiltrated brain administered by convection-enhanced delivery
           (CED) in patients with recurrent/progressive WHO grade III or IV (high grade) glioma
           (HGG) who have failed standard therapy comprising surgical biopsy and/or resection and
           adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy, following a clinically-indicated resection of
           the contrast enhancing tumor mass.

        -  To investigate by MR imaging the influence of catheter positioning, on the spatial and
           temporal distribution of topotecan administered by CED in patients with
           recurrent/progressive HGG

        -  To evaluate the extent of spatial distribution of topotecan, by MR imaging, when
           delivered into non-enhancing tumor tissue (as defined on pre-operative conventional MRI
           imaging with and without intravenous gadolinium) in the intraoperative setting, the
           immediate peri-operative setting, and in the post-operative setting.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To investigate the extent to which CED-mediated delivery of topotecan

        -  To investigate the extent to which infusate can be distributed in the 2 cm margin around
           the resection cavity by administration by CED

        -  To assess the safety, tolerability and toxicity profile of topotecan administered by CED
           using different infusion rates.

        -  To observe evidence of activity of single-agent topotecan administered by CED to
           patients with recurrent/progressive HGG who have failed standard therapy comprising
           surgical biopsy and/or resection and adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
