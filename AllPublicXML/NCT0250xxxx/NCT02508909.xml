  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Groin lymph node dissection for melanoma patients is burdened by high post-operative
      morbidity, mainly related to wound. This is a prospective pilot trial investigated
      feasibility and postoperative outcomes of videoscopic ilioinguinal lymphadenectomy in
      patients with inguinal lymph node melanoma metastases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Videoscopic ilioinguinal dissection is a two-stage procedure. Dissection is performed using
      an ultrasound dissector. The inguinal step is performed via three ports (one 3-5 cm above the
      apex of the femoral triangle, a second 5 cm medial to the adductors, and the third 5 cm
      lateral to the Sartorius muscle). After subcutaneous inflation, a formal inguinal lymph node
      (LN) dissection is performed, removing the contents of the femoral triangle, with incision
      and removal of the femoral fascia and proximal and distal ligation of the saphenous vein with
      vascular endostaplers and endoclips. The specimen is extracted using an endobag from the
      incision of SLNB, which is systematically removed, or through a small enlargement of the
      incision of the apex trocar for patients with clinically positive LNs. The iliac step starts
      with open insertion in the pro-peritoneal space of a Hasson trocar, followed by positioning
      of two additional trocars (5 and 10 mm respectively) just laterally of the umbilical pubic
      line. After creation of pneumo-pelvis, the iliac femoral vessels are identified, isolated and
      all the external iliac LNs removed. Afterwards, the obturator LNs are dissected off the
      obturator nerve. LNs are retrieved with an endobag or directly through the 10mm trocar after
      insertion of protective endotrocar. Two drains are positioned at the end of procedure in the
      obturator fossa and in the inguinal space, respectively. Intra-operative and early
      post-operative outcome (lenght of stay, complications, number of LNs) is recorded. Follow-up
      consists in detection of any recurrence, measurement of lymphedema of the leg and evaluation
      of quality of life

    <measure>Quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life was evaluated with European Organization Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)-Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) administered pre-operatively and after 3-6 and 9-12 months after surgery.This questionnaire is made up of 30 items to be later summarized in 5 functional scales, 3 symptom scales, 6 single items and a global health status scale. All of the scores are standardized using linear transformation and converted onto a 0-100 scale. Thus, a higher score for a functional scale and the global health status scale mean a high level of functioning/quality of life. Conversely, a high score for a symptom scale/item means a worse quality of life due to the symptoms perceived.</description>

    <description>Patients were re-evaluated 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after surgery and every 6 months thereafter. Whole body CT scan and inguinal ultrasonography were performed every six months. Local, in-transit, regional and distant recurrences were recorded.
