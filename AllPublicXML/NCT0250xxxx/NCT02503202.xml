  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of 3 consistency lots and a high-dose
      lot of rVSV-ZEBOV-GP (V920 Ebola Vaccine) in healthy adults. The primary purpose of this
      study is to demonstrate consistency in the immune responses of participants receiving 3
      separate lots of V920 (at release dose) through 28 days postvaccination. A subset of
      participants representative of all treatment groups will continue through 24 months
      postvaccination in the extension study for the evaluation of safety, and durability of immune
      response. Safety of the vaccines and matching placebo will be evaluated through 6 months
      postvaccination for all participants and through 24 months postvaccination for participants
      continuing in the study extension.
