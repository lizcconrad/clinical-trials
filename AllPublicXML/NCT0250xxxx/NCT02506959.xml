  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if a combination of panobinostat,
      gemcitabine, busulfan, and melphalan and a stem cell transplant can help to control MM. The
      safety of this combination will also be studied.

      This is an investigational study. Panobinostat and melphalan are FDA approved for the
      treatment of MM. Busulfan is FDA approved for the treatment of leukemia. Gemcitabine is FDA
      approved for the treatment of lymphoma, breast cancer, and lung cancer. The use of these
      study drugs in combination is investigational. The study doctor can explain how the study
      drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 80 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      Busulfan Test Dose:

      If you agree to take part in this study, you will receive a test dose of busulfan by vein
      over about 60 minutes. This low-level test dose of busulfan will help the doctor decide what
      dose of busulfan you will receive during the study. You will most likely receive this in an
      outpatient clinic during the week before you are in the hospital. If it cannot be given to
      you as an outpatient, you will be admitted to the hospital on Day -11 (11 days before your
      stem cells are returned to your body) and the test dose will be given on Day -10. With stem
      cell transplants, the days before you receive your stem cells are called minus days (Days
      -11, -10, and so on). The day you receive the stem cells is called Day 0. The days after you
      receive your stem cells are called plus days (Days +1, +2, and so on).

      On the day of your busulfan test dose, blood (about 1 teaspoon each time) will be drawn for
      pharmacokinetic (PK) testing of busulfan. PK testing measures the amount of study drug in the
      body at different time points and will help the study doctor decide what your dose of
      busulfan in this study should be. These blood samples will be drawn before your dose of
      busulfan and then 10 more times over the next 11 hours.

      The PK blood samples will be repeated again on the first day of high-dose busulfan treatment
      (Day -8). A temporary heparin lock line will be placed in your vein to lower the number of
      needle sticks needed for these draws. If it is not possible for the PK tests to be performed
      for technical or scheduling reasons, you will receive the standard fixed dose of busulfan.

      If you receive the busulfan test dose as an outpatient:

      On Days -12, -11, and -10, you will receive palifermin by vein over about 30 seconds each day
      to help decrease the risk of side effects in the mouth and throat.

      You will be admitted to the hospital on Day -9.

      If you receive the busulfan test dose as an inpatient:

      On Days -14, -13, and -12 (the 3 days before you are admitted into the hospital), you will
      receive palifermin by vein over about 30 seconds each day to help decrease the risk of side
      effects in the mouth and throat.

      You will be admitted to the hospital on Day -11.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Beginning on Day -9, you will swish the liquids caphosol and glutamine in your mouth 4 times
      a day, for about 2 minutes each time. You will swish these liquids every day until you leave
      the hospital. These drugs are used to help decrease the risk of side effects in the mouth and
      throat.

      On Day -9 through Day -2, you will receive dexamethasone 2 times a day by vein over about 10
      minutes, and you will take panobinostat by mouth 1 time a day.

      On Day -8 you will receive gemcitabine by vein over about 4 hours.

      On Days -8, -7, -6, and -5, you will receive busulfan by vein over about 3 hours a day.

      On Day -3, you will receive gemcitabine by vein over about 4 hours and melphalan by vein over
      30 minutes.

      On Day -2, you will receive melphalan by vein over about 30 minutes.

      On Day -1, you will rest.

      On Day 0, you will receive your stem cells by vein over about 30-60 minutes.

      On Days 0, +1, and +2, you will receive 3 more doses of palifermin by vein over about 15-30
      seconds.

      You will also be given standard drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects. You may ask
      the study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks.

      As part of standard care, you will remain in the hospital for about 3-4 weeks after the
      transplant. After that, you will need to stay in the Houston area, so that you can continue
      as an outpatient and be checked for infections and side effects.

      Study Tests:

      Before you start study treatment, you may have a bone marrow biopsy and aspiration to check
      the status of the disease. To collect a bone marrow biopsy and aspirate, an area of the hip
      or other site is numbed with anesthetic, and a small amount of bone and bone marrow is
      withdrawn through a large needle.

      Length of Treatment:

      The study treatment period is between Day -12 and Day +2, with follow-up described below. You
      may be taken off study early if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or
      if you are unable to follow study directions.

      If for any reason you want to leave the study early, you must talk to the study doctor. It
      may be life-threatening to leave the study after you have started to receive the study drugs
      but before you receive the stem cell transplant. This is because your blood cell counts will
      be dangerously low.

      Follow-Up:

      About 1 month, 100 days, 6 months, 1 year, and then about every 3-6 months for at least 2
      years after the transplant for as long as the doctor thinks it is needed:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to learn how the body has
           accepted the transplanted cells, and to check the status of the disease.

      About 100 days after the transplant, you will have a bone marrow biopsy and aspiration to
      check the status of the disease. This will be repeated 1 time a year or earlier, if your
      doctor thinks it is needed.

      One (1) time a year, you will have x-rays of all the bones in your body to check the status
      of the disease.

      The study staff will also stay in contact with your local doctor to find out if the disease
      comes back and to check how you are doing.

    <description>The 1-year PFS rate in cohort 1 (refractory, 1st transplant) associated with GemBuMel is 62%. With 40 patients in this cohort, assuming exponentially-distributed PFS times, 1.5 years of accrual followed by 2 years of follow-up, and a one-sided 5% Type I error rate, 40 patients provides more than 80% power to detect an increase in one-year PFS to 75% in this cohort.
