      Treatment protocol to see if people with hepatitis C (HCV) and chronic kidney disease (CKD)
      who are treated with Harvoni for 12 weeks have improvements in their kidney disease.

      The investigators hypothesize that patients with early stage (1-3) CKD caused by HCV
      infection will have significantly improved proteinuria and eGFR after viral eradication with
      12 weeks of treatment Harvoni (LDV/SOF). This trial data will serve as the basis to support
      further study of LDV/SOF in patients with early CKD. Slowing progression of CKD is a critical
      goal, as the increasing incidence and prevalence of advanced CKD and ESRD (end stage renal
      disease) places significant health burden on patients and tremendous costs on our health-care
      system.

             partners agree to an additional barrier method of contraception for the duration of
             the study and for 4 weeks after the last administration of the study drug. Women of
             childbearing potential must not rely on hormone-containing contraceptive as a form of
             birth control during the study but may use. An intrauterine device, female barrier
