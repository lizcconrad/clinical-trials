      A retrospective chart review will be performed for all patients presenting to the ED with
      agitation and subsequently given antipsychotic therapy for treatment. Identification of
      patients will be through chart review of patients presenting with agitation. Data to be
      recorded include patient age, gender, medical history, time of presentation, time of
      treatment, co morbidities, use of restraint, time to disposition and patient outcome.
      Inclusion criteria include all patients over age 18 presenting to the ED with agitation and
      treated with antipsychotics. No patients will be knowingly excluded from analysis. We will
      compare resulting outcomes of patients treated for agitation to see if Adasuve is superior to
      other commonly prescribed antipsychotics through its rate of discharge home and overall time
      in the emergency department.
