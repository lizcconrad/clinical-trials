  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a three-arm randomized controlled trial of a mindfulness stress reduction
      intervention, with the aim of dismantling the experience-monitoring and
      nonjudgmental-acceptance elements of mindfulness programs to determine the active treatment
      component. In addition to enhancing understanding of mechanisms underlying the effects of
      mindfulness interventions, identifying the therapeutic constituent(s) could inform
      development of targeted interventions as well as provide strategies to optimize adherence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a growing body of randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence indicating that
      mindfulness training interventions may reduce stress and improve stress-related disease
      outcomes. Yet little is known about the underlying active training mechanisms of mindfulness
      training. Although it is generally believed that mindfulness training interventions foster a
      capacity to monitor and accept present moment experience, debate currently focuses on whether
      it is the capacity to both monitor and non-judgmentally accept experience that drives the
      salutary effects observed in mindfulness training interventions. This project will test these
      putative active mechanisms by comparing two different types of mindfulness meditation
      training programs. N=135 stressed community adults will be recruited and randomized to either
      two different types of 8-week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) programs or a No
      Treatment Control (assessment only) comparison condition. Participants will complete 3 days
      of daily experience sampling (Ecological Momentary Assessment) immediately before and after
      the 8-week intervention period to measure attentional control and stress perceptions in daily
      life. In order to measure psychological and HPA-axis stress reactivity to a controlled
      stressor, participants will also complete a standardized acute stress challenge task (the
      Trier Social Stress Test, TSST) immediately following the 3-day post-intervention assessment
      period. This project provides the first dismantling study of mindfulness meditation training,
      it utilizes cutting-edge daily experience sampling of real life stress (using EMA) and stress
      biomarkers (salivary cortisol), and will provide important initial information for designing
      more effective (and efficient) mindfulness training interventions in at-risk stressed patient
      populations.

    <description>Mindfulness training practices aim to foster attention and acceptance toward one's present moment experience. Mindfulness consists of two components-- (1) deploying attention to monitor one's moment-to-moment experience, and (2) fostering an attitude of acceptance toward one's moment-to-moment experience</description>
