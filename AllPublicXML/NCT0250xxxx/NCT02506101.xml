      The objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness and safety of
      narrowband-ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) treatment in adult subjects with vitiligo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vitiligo is a chronic acquired cutaneous disease of pigmentation that affects patients'
      quality of life across all degrees of involvement and severity. Phototherapy is a clinically
      indicated treatment for skin lesions. Treatments are usually administered in an outpatient
      setting, typically three times per week. This is a proof-of-concept study as there are few
      well-designed prospective clinical studies showing the efficacy of NB-UVB phototherapy in the
      treatment of vitiligo in terms of repigmentation and quality of life. The following are the
      proposed objectives of this study:

        1. NB-UVB phototherapy improves vitiligo with at least 50% repigmentation compared to no
           treatment on affected areas of the trunk and extremities over 24 weeks.

        2. NB-UVB phototherapy leads to improvement in quality of life as measured by standardized
           quality of life metrics (DLQI and Skindex-29) over 24 weeks.

    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>VASI scores of treated versus untreated symmetrical body sites.The percentage of vitiligo involvement is calculated in terms of hand units. One hand unit is approximately equivalent to 1% of the total body surface area. The degree of pigmentation is estimated to the nearest of one of the following percentages: 100% - complete depigmentation, no pigment is present; 90% - specks of pigment present; 75% - depigmented area exceeds the pigmented area; 50% - pigmented and depigmented areas are equal; 25% - pigmented area exceeds depigmented area; and 10% - only specks of depigmentation present. The VASI for each body region is determined by the product of the area of vitiligo in hand units and the extent of depigmentation within each hand unit measured patch. Total body VASI = S All body sites [Hand Units] Â´ [Residual depigmentation].</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults 18 years or older with bilateral symmetrical vitiligo lesions, in general good
             health as determined by the Principal Investigator by medical history and physical
             exam.

          -  Able to understand consent procedure

          -  Able to comply with protocol activities

          -  If a woman, before entry she must be:

               1. postmenopausal, defined as 45 years of age with amenorrhea for at least 18
                  months, or &gt;45 years of age with amenorrhea for at least 6 months and a serum
                  follicule stimulating hormone (FSH) level &gt;40 IU/mL, or surgically postmenopausal
                  (bilateral oophorectomy), or

               2. surgically sterile (have had a hysterectomy or tubal ligation or otherwise be
                  incapable of pregnancy), or

               3. If heterosexually active and of childbearing potential, practicing a highly
                  effective method of birth control, (examples include hormonal prescription oral
                  contraceptives, contraceptive injections, contraceptive patch, intrauterine
                  device, double-barrier method (e.g. condoms, diaphragms, or cervical cap, with
                  spermicidal foam, cream, or gel), or male partner sterilization consistent with
                  local regulations regarding the use of birth control methods for subjects
                  participating in clinical trials, for the duration of their participation in the
                  study, or

               4. Not heterosexually active

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients less than 18 years old

          -  Patients not able to understand consent procedure

          -  Patients unable to comply with protocol activities

          -  Patients that do not have bilateral symmetrical vitiligo lesions

          -  Non-English speakers: the study assessments/questionnaires/evaluations are not
             scientifically validated in languages other than English. Given the lack of
             translators in over 50% of patient encounters in the dermatology clinic and the
             interpreters' limited time commitments when one does show up, it is impossible to
             safely enroll or follow patients who do not speak English. Phone translators are
             impossible given that we have written consent forms, which often exceed 10 pages in
             length.

          -  Patients with a photosensitive disorder or on a medication which has been demonstrated
             in these patients to cause photosensitivity

          -  Patients receiving concomitant phototherapy to test sites

          -  Patient receiving topical medication to test sites within 2 weeks of study initiation

          -  Patient receiving oral medications for vitiligo within 4 weeks prior to study
             initiation

          -  Receipt of an investigation agent within the past 4 weeks (or within 5 half lives)
             prior to study initiation

          -  Systemic corticosteroid therapy within the past month Concurrent use of drugs listed
             in Appendix C.

        <description>VASI scores of treated versus untreated symmetrical body sites.The percentage of vitiligo involvement is calculated in terms of hand units. One hand unit is approximately equivalent to 1% of the total body surface area. The degree of pigmentation is estimated to the nearest of one of the following percentages: 100% - complete depigmentation, no pigment is present; 90% - specks of pigment present; 75% - depigmented area exceeds the pigmented area; 50% - pigmented and depigmented areas are equal; 25% - pigmented area exceeds depigmented area; and 10% - only specks of depigmentation present. The VASI for each body region is determined by the product of the area of vitiligo in hand units and the extent of depigmentation within each hand unit measured patch. Total body VASI = S All body sites [Hand Units] Â´ [Residual depigmentation].</description>

narrow-band ultraviolet B phototherapy: There are two types of UVB: broad band and narrow band, with the major difference being that narrow band emits a smaller range of ultraviolet light, typically 311-312 nm. NB-UVB is a clinically indicated treatment for vitiligo lesions and treatments are usually administered in an outpatient setting 3 times a week.</description>
