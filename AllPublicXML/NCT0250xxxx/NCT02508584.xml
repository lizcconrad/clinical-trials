      M. A. suffers from hypogammaglobulinemia that has been complicated by refractory Mycoplasma
      hominis septic arthritis. He has been receiving the antibiotic valnemulin under Emergency
      Investigational New Drug (eIND) 114686 following many prior treatments with standard
      antibiotics. M.A. has also been receiving intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) replacement. The
      antibiotic and IVIG have been helpful, but not sufficient for cure. Antibodies have been
      shown to be critical for defense against mycoplasma. Hyperimmune serum against mycoplasma
      isolated from rabbit or goat has been effective in cases of chronic erosive arthritis in the
      setting of immune deficiency, and in some cases resulted in cures. The investigators propose
      to use M. hominis isolated from M. A. to vaccinate one transgenic cow (developed by SAB
      Biotherapeutics), purify human antibody after vaccination, test the purified antibody in
      killing assays to confirm potency, and then administer the purified human IgG to M. A. after
      FDA compassionate use IND application and local Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval.

      M. A. suffers from hypogammaglobulinemia that has been complicated by refractory Mycoplasma
      hominis septic arthritis. He has been receiving the antibiotic valnemulin under Emergency
      Investigational New Drug (eIND) 114686 following many prior treatments with standard
      antibiotics. M.A. has also been receiving intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) replacement. The
      antibiotic and IVIG have been helpful, but not sufficient for cure.

      Antibodies have been shown to be critical for defense against mycoplasma. Hyperimmune serum
      against mycoplasma isolated from rabbit or goat has been effective in cases of chronic
      erosive arthritis in the setting of immune deficiency, and in some cases resulted in cures.

      SAB Biotherapeutics, Inc. (formerly Sanford Applied Biosciences, LLC) located in Sioux Falls,
      SD, have developed transchromosomic (Tc) cows containing human immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy
      (IgH) and light (IgL) chain loci in the setting of inactivated bovine IgH and Ig lambda loci.
      To date, SAB Biotherapeutics (SAB) has several products in development that have been tested
      in animal models, but to date no human trials.

      Investigators propose to use M. hominis isolated from M. A. to vaccinate one transgenic cow,
      purify antibody after vaccination, test the purified antibody in killing assays to confirm
      potency, and then administer the purified human IgG to M. A. after FDA compassionate use IND
      application and local Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval.

      M. A. is a highly educated person with full decision making capacity and is well aware of the
      uncertainties and risks associated with this treatment. This proposal is designed to offer
      this patient an alternative and perhaps curative approach to his disease.
