      rate to cervical cancer screening follow-up appointments.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Connected2Care is a non-blinded, multicentre, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial.
      Tanzanian Women testing positive to HR HPV at inclusion are randomly assigned in an
      allocation ratio of 1:1 to the SMS intervention or the control group (standard care). In a
      period of 10 months, the intervention group will receive 15 one-directional health educative
      text messages and SMS-reminders for their appointment. The total sample size will be 700 with
      350 women in each study arm. Primary outcome is attendance rate for follow-up. Secondary
      objectives are cost-effectiveness measured through incremental ratios and knowledge of
      cervical cancer by a 16-item true/false scale questionnaire at baseline and follow-up.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Effect of SMS intervention on attendance rate to follow-up screening appointment</measure>
    <time_frame>14 months</time_frame>
    <description>The effect measure of the intervention is the 14-month follow-up attendance rate for HPV positive women. The number of women in the intervention group that attend follow-up screening will be compared to the the number of women that attend follow-up screening in the control group.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cost-effectiveness of SMS intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>14 months</time_frame>
    <description>The cost-effectiveness of the intervention is estimated through a conventional Cost-Effectiveness Analysis based on the RCT. Two Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratios will be calculated; one with and one without the costs of HPV testing.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Effect of SMS intervention on knowledge of cervical cancer and screening</measure>
    <time_frame>14 months</time_frame>
    <description>A 16-item true/false questionnaire regarding cervical cancer and screening will be used to measure the effect of the intervention on HPV positive women's level of knowledge. The questionnaire will be answered by all participants at baseline and by the intervention group at follow-up.</description>
