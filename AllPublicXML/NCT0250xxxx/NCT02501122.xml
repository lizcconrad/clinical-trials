      The purpose of this study is to interrogate the Partners for Kids (PFK) and the pediatric
      health information (PHIS) databases in addition to our own perioperative Nationwide
      Children's data base to look at outcomes, resource utilization, and cost trends for
      adenotonsillectomy in the nationally versus locally. The investigators also want compare
      Nationwide Children's to other regional and national tertiary pediatric institutions.
