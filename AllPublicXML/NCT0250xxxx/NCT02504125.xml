      A randomized, double-blind, single-center and controlled study comparing the efficacy and
      safety of intravenous administration of tranexamic acid to reduce blood loss in simultaneous
      bilateral total knee arthroplasty. Subjects will be monitored for occurrence of any
      complications, particularly deep venous thrombosis and thromboembolism during the hospital
      stay and for 1 months postoperatively.
