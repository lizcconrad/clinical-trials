  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators wish to evaluate the association between tryptase values as well as c-Kit
      mutation and adverse effects in the course of immunotherapy. The investigators also intend to
      assess the effect of immunotherapy on tryptase levels.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to the presently available reports there is an association between systemic
      allergic responses to hymenoptera venom and elevated tryptase levels or c-Kit mutation. The
      presence of these findings may imply the existence of mast cell activation syndrome or
      mastocytosis. Therefore, baseline tryptase evaluation has become standard evaluation in
      patients with systemic responses. Meir Medical Center is the only hospital in Israel in which
      tryptase can be measured. Consequently, the Meir Clinic has accumulated considerable data
      with regards to tryptase levels in subjects with allergy to hymenoptera venom. The
      investigators wish to evaluate the association between tryptase values as well as c-Kit
      mutation and adverse effects in the course of immunotherapy. The investigators also intend to
      assess the effect of immunotherapy on tryptase levels.
