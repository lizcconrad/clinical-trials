    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and tolerability of GS-4997 in
      adults with impaired hepatic function relative to matched, healthy controls. Each participant
      in the control group will be matched to a participant with impaired hepatic function by age
      (± 10 years), gender, and body mass index (± 20%).
