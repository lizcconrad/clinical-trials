      The purpose of this study is (1) The success rate of OK-432 pleurodesis after thoracic
      surgery that air leak over 48 hours (2)The side effects and treatments of OK-432 pleurodesis.

      [Methods] This study was a prospective, randomized, open-label, controlled study to evaluate
      the effectiveness of OK-432 pleurodesis of persistent air Leak after pulmonary Resection. The
      adult patient have persistent air leak &gt;48 hours after thoracic surgery, will randomized to
      OK-432 pleurodesis (OK-432 group) or normal saline pleurodesis (NS group). The trial will be
      conduct from May 25, 2015 to May 25, 2018 in the Department of Surgery at national Taiwan
      University Hospital, a medical center. The study protocol was approved by the hospitals'
      Institutional Review Boards. A total of 80 cases, the subjects will be the hospital thoracic
      surgery ward and received outpatient programs. Eligible Subjects : adults (minimum age&gt; 20
      years; maximum age ≦ 70 years old) patients with thoracic surgery and over48 hours of
      continuous air leak. The exclusion criteria include: penicillin allergy,primary pneumothorax,
      esophageal cancer, immune dysfunction, those who can not sign a consent form, and pregnant or
      lactating, other serious concomitant illness such as uremia or liver cirrhosis. Study steps:
      eligible Patients will randomize according to computer-generated random numbers, with 1:1
      ratio in sequentially numbered, sealed envelopes by a study nurse who was masked to the
      study. Randomization envelopes were opened, and randomization was performed by the study
      nurse after informed consent was obtain. Eligible inpatients were randomized to the OK-432
      group or the normal saline (NS) group，each group are 40 cases.

      All subjects were observed by the physician who was masked to the study， about air leak stop
      time, chest tube removal time, discharge time, outpatient chest X-ray, pulmonary function
      tests as necessary. cases if persistent air leak more than seven days, the attending
      physician determines whether pleurodesis again or surgery or other medical treatment.
      Finally, the researcher who do not know groups will collection data by &quot;air leak case record
      form&quot; including diagnosis, surgical site，the start and end time of the surgery, the use of
      antibiotics, discomfort problems (pain , stomach discomfort, cough, fever&gt; 38 ℃, allergic
      reactions and respiratory discomfort), postoperative air leak time, air leak stop time ,
      chest tube removal time, discharge time, the data will be use SPSS20.0 version of the
      statistical software package, and T-test, pair T-test ，Anova ,linear correlation statistical
      methods for analysis.

      Outcome measures: OK-432 success rate, OK-432 side effects, air leak time, chest tube remove
      time, length of hospital stay.

      [Background and Objective] :Air leak produced after thoracic surgery is a common
      phenomenon.Prolonged chest tube placement can lead to empyema or infection, and extended
      hospitalization or even death. In 2010 many researchers reported that The incidence of lung
      resection produce air leak about 8-26% (Singhal et al., 2010), and even up to 50% (Mueller &amp;
      Marzluf, 2014).How to effectively treatment is still not clear.The chemical pleurodesis is an
      effective option in management of air leak.There are several chemical agents for pleurodesis,
      such as tetracycline and minocycline, talc, Taurolidine, bleomycin, iodopovidone, picibanil
      (OK-432), silver nitrate, quinacrine. What kind of chemical agent effective remain
      controversial. A study evaluated after thoracoscopic operation for primary spontaneous
      pneumothorax the safety and efficacy of chemical pleurodesis with a comparison between
      minocycline and OK-432. The OK-432 pleurodesis (19 patients) as the primary treatment and the
      primary success rate was 95%.(How et al., 2014).Another retrospective case-control study
      examining post-isolated lobectomies and bilobectomies by thoracotomy of Persistent air
      leak，sclerosis (talc, bleomycin, minocycline, doxycycline)for the treatment of prolonged air
      leak was successful in 40 of 41 patients (the success rate of 97.6%) (Liberman et al., 2010).
      The prolonged air leaks after major pulmonary resection still no empirical treatment of
      clinical research.

      Hypothesis: patients were persistent air leak after 48 hours chest surgery will perform
      OK-432 pleurodesis .The chest tube time can reduce and length of hospital stay. Extended
      applications can significantly reduce medical costs and manpower, and to explore OK -432
      pleurodesis side effects and treatment.
