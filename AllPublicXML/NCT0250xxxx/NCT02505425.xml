  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advanced heart failure affects nearly 6 million Americans, and less is known about how this
      illness affects the 80% of heart failure patients who are 65 years and older because research
      tends to focus on younger patients. Older patients with heart failure and their family
      caregivers, rarely have access to palliative supportive care services because the disease is
      unpredictable and palliative treatment may not be provided until after other medical
      treatments have been tried. Investigators are studying whether palliative care provided when
      advanced heart failure patients are still well will result in better quality of life, mood
      and less symptom distress compared to usual or standard heart failure care.

      Specific Aims and Hypotheses:

      Specific Aim 1: Determine whether ENABLE: CHF-PC leads to higher advanced heart failure
      patient-reported quality of life (QOL) and mood (depression/anxiety); and lower symptom
      burden and resource use (e.g. hospital admissions and days, emergency visits) at 8 and 16
      weeks after baseline.

      • Hypothesis 1: Intervention participants will experience higher QOL and mood, and lower
      symptom burden and resource use at 8 and 16 weeks after baseline compared with those
      receiving usual HF care.

      Specific Aim 2: Determine whether ENABLE: CHF-PC leads to higher caregiver-reported QOL, mood
      (anxiety/depression), and self-reported health and lower caregiver burden at 8 and 16 weeks
      after baseline.

      • Hypothesis 2: Intervention caregivers will report higher QOL, mood, and self-reported
      health, and lower caregiver burden at 8 and 16 weeks after baseline.
