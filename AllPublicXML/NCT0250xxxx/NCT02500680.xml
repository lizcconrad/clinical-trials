      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerance, and immunogenicity of
      MAS-1-Adjuvanted seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) (MER4101) with hemagglutinin
      dose escalation compared to non-adjuvanted comparator IIV standard dose (SD) in healthy
      adults and high dose (HD) IIV in ambulatory elderly subjects.

      Hypothesis: Reduced HA dose IIV formulated in MAS-1 adjuvant (MER4101) has been shown under
      Phase 1A to be safe, tolerable and demonstrated a more robust and durable immune response to
      IIV over 6 months post-vaccination in healthy young adults 18 - 49 years of age compared to
      SD IIV. Under phase 1B the 9 µg/HA dose of IIV in 0.3 mL MAS-1 was safe and well tolerated
      and immunogenically comparable or superior to 60 µg/HA HD IIV control. It is anticipated that
      the increased dose of MAS-1 (0.3 mL vs 0.5 mL) at 9 µg/HA IIV and an increased dose of HA (15
      µg/HA vs 9 µg/HA) in the 0.5 mL dose of MAS-1 will be safe well tolerated and more robustly
      immunogenic in adults who are 65 years of age and older compared to HD IIV.

      The study is a Phase 1A, 1B and 1B extension, randomized, double-blind, single-center,
      clinical trial, in healthy adults (18-49 years old) and ambulatory elderly subjects (aged 65
      years and older). Phase IA evaluated the safety, tolerability and hemagglutination inhibition
      assay (HAI) antibody response of each of four escalating doses of influenza hemagglutinin
      (HA) antigen with a fixed dose of a water-in-oil emulsion adjuvant MAS-1 (Mercia Adjuvant
      System-1), compared with licensed, unadjuvanted, standard dose (SD) of licensed inactivated
      trivalent influenza virus vaccine (IIV). Phase IB evaluated the optimal dose of IIV in MAS-1
      selected under phase IA for safety, tolerability and HAI antibody response (from Phase 1A
      known to be 9 µg of HA antigen in 0.3 mL dose of MAS-1 adjuvanted emulsion) in ambulatory
      elderly subjects compared to high dose (HD) IIV. The Phase 1B extension will evaluate if the
      increased dose volume of MAS-1 (0.5 mL vs 0.3 mL) at the same 9 µg/HA adjuvanted IIV vaccine
      is safe, well tolerated and immunogenic, and then whether the increased dose of 15 µg/HA in
      0.5 mL MAS-1 is safe, well tolerated and still more immunogenic in elderly subjects.

      The ability of standard dose (SD) IIV to protect against seasonal influenza virus infection
      in the elderly is less than vaccine efficacy observed in healthy young adults. The
      MAS-1-adjuvanted influenza virus vaccine offers the potential for higher seroconversion and
      seroprotection rates, higher antibody levels, prolonged duration of protective antibodies,
      hemagglutinin (HA) antigen dose-sparing and cross-protection against antigenically divergent
      viral strains. This study will determine if the adjuvanted vaccine formulated with one or
      more of the reduced HA antigen doses is safe. The study will also determine if it is likely
      to induce an improved HA antibody response (HAI) when compared to SD IIV in healthy adults
      and HD IIV in elderly subjects. This trial will inform future clinical trials in at-risk
      populations of older patients
