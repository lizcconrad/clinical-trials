  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine the effect of the environment on
      six-minute walk test performance in individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
      due to alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. The aim of the study is to determine the environmental
      impact on physical performance in this population to determine if any factors influence
      quality of life. This study was developed to evaluate the efficacy of the using the indoor
      six-minute walk test to determine eligibility for ambulatory oxygen therapy.

      Participants will be asked to come to the Clinical Research Center (CRC) for a visit lasting
      about one hour. Participants will be asked to review and sign an informed consent document to
      participate in this trial. If participants agree to participate and sign the consent, the
      following procedures will be done. If they have not had pulmonary function testing performed
      in the past 18 months, standard spirometry testing will be performed. Participants will
      perform two six-minute walk tests, one indoors and one outdoors. First, they will be randomly
      assigned to perform either the indoor or outdoor testing first. Then participants will have
      their vital signs taken, perform the first six-minute walk study and immediately after have
      their vital signs taken again. Participants will have a rest period between the two
      six-minute walk tests of at least 30 minutes. Participants will then perform the second
      six-minute walk test with the same above procedures for the first test.
