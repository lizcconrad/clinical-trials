      ED patients who are able to drink juice will be approached and asked their beverage
      preference.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Once per week for 26 weeks, patients will be enrolled during a randomly selected 1-hour
      block. The random blocks will be assigned using STATA. During these enrollment periods, all
      current ED patients will be screened by the treating physicians and research associates,
      excluding patients in the &quot;Special Care&quot; unit, where most patients are intoxicated with
      alcohol.

      Eligibility for oral consumption of water and juice will be determined by treating
      physicians. Patients who are deemed eligible to drink water or juice will be approached and
      asked their beverage preferences. Their response will be recorded, and the beverage will be
      procured for them.
