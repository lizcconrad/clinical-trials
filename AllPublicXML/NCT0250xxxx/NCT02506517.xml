  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 study (the second phase in testing a new drug) to see how useful an
      investigational drug called afatinib is in patients with advanced cancer with changes in the
      HER gene.

      Afatinib is a drug that is approved by Health Canada for the treatment of advanced lung
      cancer with changes in the HER gene. Afatinib works by attaching to and blocking a protein
      called HER from working. HER is an important protein that contributes to the growth of cancer
      cells.
