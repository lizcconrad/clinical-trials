      Prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled First-In-Human study with three
      sub-parts: Part A, a single ascending dose study (SAD) in normal human volunteers (NHVs),
      Part B, a multiple ascending dose study (MAD) in NHVs, Part C, a multiple dose (MD) study in
      patients with a complement-mediated disorder.

      Study TNT009-01 is a First in Human (FIH) study that uses an Integrated Protocol Design. This
      Phase 1 study protocol will comprise three sub-parts: a Single Ascending Dose (SAD) and
      Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) study in normal male and female human volunteers (NHVs), and a
      Multiple Dose (MD) study in patients with various complement-mediated disorders not confined
      to a single disease or therapeutic area. Although these patients represent a population with
      a diverse set of clinical diagnoses they are united by a common mechanism of disease matched
      to the mechanism of action of TNT009. Several key safety measures have been incorporated into
      the design of this study, including use of Sentinel Dosing Groups and an independent Data
      Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), as well as an appropriate program of prophylactic
      vaccinations and clinical biomarker surveillance related to the risks potentially associated
      with inhibition of the complement system.
