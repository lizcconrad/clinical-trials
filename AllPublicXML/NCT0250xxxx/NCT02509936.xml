  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to evaluate the impact of an intensive home-based education intervention
      targeting severely stunted Guatemalan children for catch up growth and improved development.
      Half of the children in the study will receive standard of care, which includes micronutrient
      supplementation and a food ration. The other half of children in the study will receive, in
      addition to the above, home-based dietary assessment and individualized parental nutrition
      education.
