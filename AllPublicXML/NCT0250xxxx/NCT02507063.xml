  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) measurements as a non invasive test for raised
      ICP has many potential benefits. This includes having assessments that can be made at the
      bedside instead of requiring patient transport to CT or MRI, which in itself can cause a rise
      in ICP. If ONSD represents an acute and sensitive measurement of elevated ICP, it may prove
      useful in the emergency department (ED) setting in the evaluation of shunts used for
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion. The investigators hypothesize that ONSD will correlate
      with measured ICP and thus be a reliable tool for the bedside assessment of ICP. The
      investigators further hypothesize that ONSD changes will correlate with changes in ICP,
      making it a useful bedside tool for assessing ICP changes over time. This is a prospective,
      observational study using a convenience sample. Children who are 0 - 18 years old who have an
      invasive intracranial ICP monitoring device admitted to the hospital Pediatric Intensive Care
      Unit (PICU) are eligible for participation in the study. Children who are 0-18 years old who
      are determined to require a shunt revision following evaluation in the ED will also be
      included in the study. 10. After the invasive intracranial pressure monitoring device is
      placed, for every recruited patient, ONSD measurements will be taken and the ICP will be
      recorded 8 hours post placement and then repeated 3 times a day until the intracranial
      pressure monitoring device is removed.12. For ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt revision
      patients, the investigators will obtain a measurement just before surgery, immediately
      post-op, and then 12 hours, 24 hours, and 36 hours post-op. If the patient is otherwise ready
      for discharge prior to 36 hours, the measurement may be omitted or done early so as to not
      unnecessarily prolong the hospitalization
