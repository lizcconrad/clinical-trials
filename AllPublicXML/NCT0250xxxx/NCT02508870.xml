  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 1b study of atezolizumab (anti-programmed
      death-ligand 1 [anti-PD-L1] monoclonal antibody) in participants who have hypomethylating
      agent (HMA)-na√Øve myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and are International Prognostic Scoring
      System-Revised (IPSS-R) intermediate/high/very high-risk, or have MDS relapsed or are
      refractory (R/R) to prior HMA therapy. The primary objectives of this study are to determine
      the safety and tolerability of atezolizumab therapy in these participant populations,
      including treatment in combination with azacitidine.
