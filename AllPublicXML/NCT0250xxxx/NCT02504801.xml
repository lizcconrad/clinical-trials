    <textblock>
      To test the hypothesis that nebulized Pulmicort Respules could reduce post operation
      pulmonary complication incidence in primary lung cancer patients with COPD. Compare
      post-operation pulmonary complication incidence in two treatment arms among primary lung
      cancer patients with COPD required single lobectomy from 3days before operation to 7 days
      after operation.
