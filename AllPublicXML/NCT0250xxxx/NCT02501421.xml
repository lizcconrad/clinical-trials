    <textblock>
      The study is a single centre, phase I, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial
      that explored the safety and immunogenicity of 2 doses (Day 1 and Day 21) TB/FLU-04L
      tuberculosis vaccine versus matched placebo in BCG-vaccinated healthy adult subjects aged
      18-50 years.
