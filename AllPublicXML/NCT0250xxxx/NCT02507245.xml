      The aim of this study is to assess the developmental patterns of lung function in children
      affected by growth hormone deficiency after one year of GH therapy.The assessment by specific
      questionnaires of quality of life and of parental stress index.Parameters will be evaluated
      at the time of the diagnosis and after 12 months of GH therapy.

      Observational longitudinal study in children affected by idiopathic growth hormone deficiency
      (GHD): lung function parameters assessment; quality of life assessment; stress parenting
      assessment (Pneumo GHD). The aim of this study is to assess the developmental patterns of
      lung function in children affected by growth hormone deficiency after one year of GH
      therapy.The assessment by specific questionnaires of quality of life and of parental stress
      index.Parameters will be evaluated at the time of the diagnosis and after 12 months of GH
