  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety and tolerability, and make a preliminary assessment of
      activity, of a combination of pertuzumab and erlotinib in patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have failed on at least one prior
      chemotherapy regimen. The anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity, and the target sample size is less than 100 individuals.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to end of the study (up to 42 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>A DLT was defined as: Any non-hematological toxicity ≥ Grade 3 according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0, except for fever, chills, and flu-like symptoms, which occurred despite adequate participant management. The following Grade 1-3 toxicities were exempt: Grade 1-3 skin and/or epithelial toxicities consistent with erlotinib single agent therapy, unless they did not respond to treatment or dose reduction or interruption (Grade 4 skin and/or epithelial toxicities were considered to be a DLT); Grade 4 neutropenia occurring for &gt; 7 days; febrile neutropenia which occurred despite adequate participant management; Grade 4 thrombocytopenia or any thrombocytopenia requiring platelet transfusion; and any subjectively intolerable toxicity felt by the investigator to be related to either one of the compounds.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Classified as Responders</measure>
    <time_frame>within 18 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Responders are participants who achieved either a complete response or a partial response according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. RECIST is a set of published rules that define when tumors in cancer patients improve (&quot;respond&quot;), stay the same (&quot;stabilize&quot;), or worsen (&quot;progress&quot;) during treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a Complete Response or Partial Response at the End of Cycles 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to the end of the study (up to 42 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Complete and partial responses were determined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. A complete response was defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. A partial response was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of the longest diameter.</description>

    <measure>Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax) for Pertuzumab (Cycle 2) in the Presence of Erlotinib (at Steady-state) in Patients With NSCLC</measure>
    <time_frame>on day 1 of cycle 2, 1 hour pre-dose and 0.5, 1.5, 4, 8, 24, 168, 336 and 504 hours after the start of the infusion</time_frame>
    <description>Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax), which is the maximum (peak) concentration (amount of drug) measurable in blood plasma after a dose is administered, typically measured in nanograms/milliliter (ng/mL), reported as mg/L.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time of Cmax (Tmax) for Pertuzumab (Cycle 2) in the Presence of Erlotinib (at Steady-state) in Patients With NSCLC</measure>
    <time_frame>on day 1 of cycle 2, 1 hour pre-dose and 0.5, 1.5, 4, 8, 24, 168, 336 and 504 hours after the start of the infusion</time_frame>
    <description>The time at which maximum concentration (Cmax), which is the maximum (peak) concentration (amount of drug) measurable in blood plasma after a dose is administered, is reached (Tmax).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Terminal Phase Plasma Half-life (t ½) for Pertuzumab (Cycle 2) in the Presence of Erlotinib (at Steady-state) in Patients With NSCLC</measure>
    <time_frame>on day 1 of cycle 2, 1 hour pre-dose and 0.5, 1.5, 4, 8, 24, 168, 336 and 504 hours after the start of the infusion</time_frame>
    <description>Terminal phase plasma half-life (t ½) is the time required to divide the plasma concentration by two after reaching pseudo-equilibrium, rather than the time required to eliminate half the administered dose.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Area Under the Plasma Concentration Versus Time Curve (AUC) for Pertuzumab (Cycle 2) in the Presence of Erlotinib (at Steady-state) in Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)</measure>
    <time_frame>on day 1 of cycle 2, 1 hour pre-dose and 0.5, 1.5, 4, 8, 24, 168, 336 and 504 hours after the start of the infusion</time_frame>
    <description>Bioavailability [AUC(0-t)] is a measure of how much of the drug reaches the person's bloodstream from time 0 (pre-dose) to a given time point (t) for the body to use. The extent of product bioavailability is estimated by the area under the blood concentration vs time curve. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) is calculated by plotting the drug's blood levels on a graph at different times during the set period. The area under this curve reflects the amount of drug exposure in the set time period, calculated as hour * nanograms (ng) per milliliter (mL), which equates to mg.day/L. Bioavailability Extrapolated to Infinity [AUC (0-inf)] is a calculated measure of how much of the drug will ever reach the person's bloodstream for the body to use. AUC (0-inf) stands for the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time zero (pre-dose) to extrapolated infinite time (forever). It is obtained from calculating AUC (0-t) plus AUC (t-inf).</description>

    <measure>Clearance (CL) for Pertuzumab (Cycle 2) in the Presence of Erlotinib (at Steady-state) in Patients With NSCLC</measure>
    <time_frame>on day 1 of cycle 2, 1 hour pre-dose and 0.5, 1.5, 4, 8, 24, 168, 336 and 504 hours after the start of the infusion</time_frame>
    <description>A fundamental concept in pharmacokinetics is drug clearance (CL), that is, elimination of drugs from the body. The clearance is simply the ratio of the dose to the area under the curve (AUC), so that the higher the AUC for a given dose, the lower the clearance. If a drug is administered by continuous infusion and a steady state is achieved, the clearance can be estimated from a single measurement of the plasma drug concentration.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Volume of Distribution at Steady-state (Vss) for Pertuzumab (Cycle 2) in the Presence of Erlotinib (at Steady-state) in Patients With NSCLC</measure>
    <time_frame>on day 1 of cycle 2, 1 hour pre-dose and 0.5, 1.5, 4, 8, 24, 168, 336 and 504 hours after the start of the infusion</time_frame>
    <description>Steady-state volume of distribution of a drug is an estimate of drug distribution independent of elimination processes. It is most useful for predicting the plasma concentrations following multiple dosing to a steady-state or pseudo-equilibrium. Vss is proportional to the amount of drug in the body versus the plasma concentration of the drug at steady state (pseudo-equilibrium). It is a calculated measure.</description>

        <title>Area Under the Plasma Concentration Versus Time Curve (AUC) for Pertuzumab (Cycle 2) in the Presence of Erlotinib (at Steady-state) in Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)</title>
        <description>Bioavailability [AUC(0-t)] is a measure of how much of the drug reaches the person’s bloodstream from time 0 (pre-dose) to a given time point (t) for the body to use. The extent of product bioavailability is estimated by the area under the blood concentration vs time curve. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) is calculated by plotting the drug’s blood levels on a graph at different times during the set period. The area under this curve reflects the amount of drug exposure in the set time period, calculated as hour * nanograms (ng) per milliliter (mL), which equates to mg.day/L. Bioavailability Extrapolated to Infinity [AUC (0-inf)] is a calculated measure of how much of the drug will ever reach the person’s bloodstream for the body to use. AUC (0-inf) stands for the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time zero (pre-dose) to extrapolated infinite time (forever). It is obtained from calculating AUC (0-t) plus AUC (t-inf).</description>
