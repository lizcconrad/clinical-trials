  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 6-month study followed by a 6 month
      open-label extension phase to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of MN-001 in
      moderate to severe IPF patients. MN-001 750 mg or matching placebo will be orally
      administered twice daily over a 26 week period in subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of IPF
      per the ATS )American Thoracic Society) 2011 Guidelines. Approximately 15 subjects are
      planned to be enrolled. This study will consist of two treatment arms, MN-001 and matching
      placebo. Randomization will occur in a 2:1 ratio (MN-001: placebo). Eligible subjects will
      consist of males and females ranging in age from 21 to 80 years old, inclusive.

      The study will consist of a Screening Phase (up to 3 months prior to Day1) followed by a 26
      week double-blind Treatment Phase, a 26 week Open-Label Extension (OLE) phase and a Follow-up
      Visit (within 4 weeks after the last dose).

    <description>Subjects who complete all of the screening assessments and meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria will be started on MN-001 (tipelukast) 750 mg or matching placebo bid. Subjects will return to the clinic on Treatment Day 1 to receive their first dose of study medication. Subsequently, subjects will return to the clinic on a regular basis for 26 weeks.
During the Treatment Phase, safety and efficacy parameters will be assessed and concomitant medications will be documented. The safety and tolerability of MN-001 will be evaluated by an Independent Safety Monitor during this phase.</description>

             and laboratory screening, as determined by the investigator.

             opinion of the study nurse/coordinator and the Investigator.

          -  Beta blockers within 14 days of Screening Visit and throughout the study

          -  Macrolide or quinolone class antibiotics within 14 days of Screening Visit and
             throughout the study.

          -  Poor peripheral venous access that will limit the ability to draw blood as judged by
             the Investigator.

          -  Currently participating, or has participated in, a study with an investigational or
             marketed compound or device within 3 months prior to signing the informed consent.

          -  Unable to cooperate with any study procedures, unlikely to adhere to the study
             procedures and keep appointments, in the opinion of the Investigator, or is planning
