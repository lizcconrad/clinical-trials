  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For the gastric cancer, paclitaxel is recommended as salvage standard treatment. Afatinib is
      a novel, potent, small ErbB family blocker that covalently binds and irreversibly blocks
      signaling through activated EGFR, HER2 and ErbB4 receptors, as well as the
      transphosphorylation of ErbB3. The investigators suggest a randomized phase II trial of
      afatinib plus weekly taxol(paclitaxel) for previously treated EGFR positive gastric cancer
      patients. The aim of current trial is to evaluate the antitumor efficacy of afatinib for
      target enriched patients in gastric cancer.
