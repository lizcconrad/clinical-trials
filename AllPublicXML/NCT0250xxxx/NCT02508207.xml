    <textblock>
      To evaluate the clinical mechanisms of action in lung and extrapulmonary systems of VX-661 in
      combination with ivacaftor (IVA) (VX-661/IVA) in subjects with cystic fibrosis (CF) who are
      homozygous for the F508del mutation on the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)
      gene.

             subject.

          -  An acute upper or lower respiratory infection, pulmonary exacerbation, or changes in
             therapy for pulmonary disease within 28 days before Day 1

          -  History or evidence of clinically significant findings on ophthalmologic examination
             during the Screening Period.
