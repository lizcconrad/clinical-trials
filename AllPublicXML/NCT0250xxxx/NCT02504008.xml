  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in patient reported pain intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Patient reported pain intensity is recorded as an average daily pain intensity using an 11-point scale (0 = no pain to 10 = worst pain possible).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) Pain Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The BPI is a nine-question survey completed by the patient that assesses quality of life and health status. BPI scores range from 0 to 10, with higher values indicating greater pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patients' Global Impression of Change (PGI-C)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PGI-C is a patient/patient's caregiver rated scale to assess the patients overall treatment response. PGI-C is a 7-point (1-7) scale rated as; very much improved, much improved, minimally improved, no change, minimally worse, much worse, or very much worse.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinicians' Global Impression of Change (CGI-C)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-C is an investigator-rated scale to assess the overall treatment response. CGI-C is a 7-point (1-7) scale rated as; very much improved, much improved, minimally improved, no change, minimally worse, much worse, or very much worse.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in EuroQOL 5-dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D descriptive system comprised the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension is rated by the patient at one of 5 levels, with level 1 indicating the best health state (no problems) and level 5 indicating worst health state (e.g., unable to walk about).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ-2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-MPQ-2 measures both neuropathic and nonneuropathic pain. It contains a total of 22 descriptors, which are rated on an intensity scale of 0 = None, to 10 = Worst Possible.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in bone turnover markers</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Bone turnover is measured from 2 biomarkers collected from peripheral blood samples: serum carboxy terminal telopeptide of collagen type I (CTX) and serum procollagen type I N terminal propeptide (s-P1NP).</description>
