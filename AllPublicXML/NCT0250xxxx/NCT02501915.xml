  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Kinesio Taping (KT ) method was developed more than thirty years ago in order to cause
      sensory effects through the epidermis and dermis, generating a variety of physiological
      effects in other systems. Clinical effects are well known levels in muscle, neurological
      system, injuries, inflammation, edema, among other physiological effects are thus largely in
      the theoretical framework. Objectives: The aim of this study is to evaluate the
      Electromyographic (EMG), Electroencephalographic (EEG), muscle temperature and flexibility
      effects with the Rectus Femoral muscle KT application. Methods: This is a pilot study with
      six subjects in which they were divided into two groups, A and B. Group A received the
      application of KT from muscle Origin to Insertion and group B Insertion to Origin, with both
      groups taped the non-dominant limb and the dominant limb was used as control group. The first
      application was conducted at 0% and the second with 75 to 100% tension. Evaluations were
      performed before the first application, immediately and 24 hours later. After this last
      evaluation, was withdrawn taping, evaluated without taping, reapplied 75 to 100 % of rated
      voltage and in sequence. The sixth last review was conducted 24 hours after this last
      application. Before every application a specific vibration was performed on the patellar
      tendon in order to trigger a neurophysiological imbalance rectus femoral.
