  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is about an experimental biomedical monocentric search concerning twelves patients
      presenting a infiltrative glioma of low rank OMS type II and realizing a surgery awakened on
      the site of the CHU of Montpellier.

      The objective of this search is to understand exactly how the electric impulses, delivered by
      the neurosurgeon to make a functional mapping of the brain during the surgery awakened by
      tumors infiltrates of low rank, propagate in this one and to identify the nervous networks
      inhibited by these electric impulses.

      Having verified the eligibility of the patients and having obtained their consent, they will
      be included in the study. Before the beginning of the surgery, the electroencephalography
      activity of the brain of every patient will be recorded. Before and after the surgical
      resection, the electrocorticography activity will be recorded.

      The collected data will then be analyzed, after the operation. Analyses will try to identify
      what we call potential evoked by the stimulation and which are small electric waves which
      appear after the electric stimulation was delivered.

    <textblock>
      All the surgical operations will be realized by Professor Hugues DUFFAU. The DEMAR-INRIA team
      will assure the collection and the data processing electrophysiological, the management of
      the data and the methodological follow-up, as well as the writing of the report and the
      distribution of the results.

      The quality assurance will be assured by a &quot;minimal&quot; monitoring by an assistant of clinical
      research for the department of the research and the innovation, to Montpellier, which will
      verify principally the consents.

      The electrophysiological data digitized will be stored in the form of computer files via
      PowerLab.

      All the analyses of treatment of signals required to highlight the potential evoked will be
      realized with the software Matlab.
