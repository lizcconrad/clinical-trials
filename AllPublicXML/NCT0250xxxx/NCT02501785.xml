  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand the level of caregiver burden related to caring
      for a patient who goes home within the first 24 hours following surgery. As the caregiver
      they are providing care to a family member, friend, or neighbor. Even when not formally
      trained, the care they provide is important to the patient's recovery. Providing care in this
      manner can be stressful. This study will help us understand what aspects of the patient's
      recovery are most difficult for the caregiver.
