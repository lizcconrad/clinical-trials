  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to adapt and implement a district-led, policy-based, low cost Maternal and
      Newborn Health (MNH) intervention package using the MamaToto process, proven successful in
      Uganda, in rural Tanzania. The investigators hypothesize that the 'MamaToto Package' will be
      successfully implemented in the Misungwi District and will be effective in improving key
      maternal and newborn health indicators of study participants.

      This study will collect baseline data on indicators related to pre-natal care, delivery,
      post-natal care, treatment of childhood illnesses and family planning. Data collection
      tools/strategies include 1) a mapping exercise, 2) health facility audit 3) household surveys
      and 4) exit interviews. Data will be collected at baseline and endline. Operational data will
      be collected throughout the life of the study. Results will be used to inform implementation
      of interventions that aim to improve health facility capacity to deliver good quality care to
      women and children and to strengthen families and communities to better advocate for and
      engage in activities that promote healthier women and children.

      Mapping data will be collected in two districts 1) Misungwi and 2) Kwimba. Baseline and
      endline data will be collected in Misungwi The intervention will begin in Misungwi in Yrs 1
      and 2 and then roll out to Kwimba in YR 3.
