      The first objective of this study was to characterize the pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of daptomycin with a daily dose of 12mg/kg in septic shock patient; the
      second objective is to identify the optimal dosing scheme for daptomycin among patients with
      septic shock and to enhance therapeutic outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Daptomycin is a novel lipopeptide exhibiting concentration-dependent bactericidal activity
      against multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens, including Methicillin-resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). In recent years, daptomycin plays an important role in the
      treatment of septic shock. The pharmacokinetics of daptomycin is significant changed in
      patients with septic shock, it is proved that the recent dosage regiment comes with a low
      blood drug concentration and unsatisfactory outcome. Although the high-dose daptomycin shows
      safety and effectiveness in the treatment of critically ill patient, but still the
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics data is scant. So the purposes of this study is to
      characterize the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of daptomycin with a daily dose of
      12mg/kg in septic shock patient; the second objective is to identify the optimal dosing
      scheme for daptomycin among patients with septic shock and to enhance therapeutic outcomes.

    <description>A maximum of 12 blood samples (1.5mL) were collected in Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt (EDTA-Na2) tubes over a 6-dose administration sequence.Sampling was done prior to the administration of the first dose, at 30 minutes (end of infusion),and at 4,12,and 24 hours after the initial dose.Additional blood samples were collected at the end of infusion (peak) and prior to the subsequent dose (trough) for doses 2-5.After the sixth dose the blood samples were collected prior to the administration and at 4,and 24 hours after the end of infusion.</description>
