      Impact of acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) using hydroxyethyl starch before initiating
      cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) on whole blood viscoelastic profile after CPB has not been well
      established.

      Patients undergoing cardiac surgery employing moderate hypothermic CPB (n=40) are randomly
      allocated into one of two groups: in Group-ANH(n=20), ANH is applied by using a balanced
      hydroxyethyl starch (HES 130/0.6); and in Group-C, ANH is not applied.

      After weaning from CPB, intergroup differences of INTEM, EXTEM, FIBTEM and APTEM profiles are
      analyzed.

      As a primary outcome, inter-group difference between maxiaml clot firmness of EXTEM will be
      determined at 10 min after ANH in Group-ANH and that at control.

      Background: Impact of acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) using hydroxyethyl starch before
      initiating cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) on whole blood viscoelastic profile after CPB has not
      been well established.

      Method: Patients undergoing cardiac surgery employing moderate hypothermic CPB (n=40) are
      randomly allocated into one of two groups: in Group-ANH(n=20), ANH is applied by using a
      balanced hydroxyethyl starch (HES 130/0.6); and in Group-C ANH is not applied.

      Intergroup differences of INTEM, EXTEM, FIBTEM and APTEM profiles are analyzed. after
      anesthesia induction (control) and after weaning form CPB and protamine neutralization
      (after-CPB) in both groups. In Group-ANH, those are determined after ANH (after-ANH).

      As a primary outcome, inter-group difference between maxiaml clot firmness of EXTEM is
      determined at 10 min after ANH in Group-ANH and that at control.

      As secondary outcomes, intergroup differences of Hematocrit (Hct), Na+, K+, HCO3-, Ca2+,
      osmolarity, s-Cr are determined Intergroup difference of data at T2 are performed.
