  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the VAC (Vacuum Assisted Closure) therapy in transplants of leg ulcers versus
      usual dressing method. The VAC Therapy system consists of:

        -  A unit delivering a precise under atmospheric pressure, controlled and regulated in the
           wound site,

        -  Consumables necessary for the implementation of the dressing,

        -  Collecting tanks exudates with gel. VAC therapy is a system using negative pressure. It
           is known to be efficient into care of chronic wounds and ulcerous wounds by increasing
           the cicatrisation.

      This system is systematically used into the dermatology unit of the CHU of Saint-Etienne
      after transplants of leg ulcers, but no data confirms the interest of this method compared to
      usual dressing method. This study will provide this data.
