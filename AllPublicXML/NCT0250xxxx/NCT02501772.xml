    <textblock>
      For diabetic patient with persisted albuminuria under the intensive control on blood pressure
      and blood glucose, the non-invasive method of acupressure at Sanyinjiao (SP6) is easy to use
      and significantly effect on albuminuria reduction in patients of diabetic nephropathy.

    <description>In addition to maintain current treatment included oral anti-hyperglycemia agent and ACEI(angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ) or ARB, subjects should wear ankle band at Sanyinjiao point ( calf , ankle on the foot tip 3 inch ), with the thumb pressing daily five minutes later and carry more than four hours for 8 weeks</description>
