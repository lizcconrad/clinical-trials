  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sustained high-intensity activity, such as survival training with little nourishment
      available, can result in a loss of muscle performance. This study will examine the effects of
      a nutritional supplement to maintain muscle and muscle performance during this period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sustained high intensity activity that is often accompanied by sleep and nutrient deprivation
      is a common characteristic of survival training. Survival training is a requirement in the
      preparation of pilots, where they learn evasion and survival skills that they may need to
      avoid capture in a situation in which they have bailed from their plane. The physiological
      stresses associated with the nature of these operations often results in significant
      decrements in lean body mass, muscle size and muscle endurance and power. During a sudden
      evacuation from the aircraft the pilot only takes a small survival bag. There is a limit to
      what can possibly be put in this bag. However, the ability to provide a dietary supplement
      specifically targeting muscle may provide an important resource for maintaining muscle mass
      and performance. Thus, the purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of 14 days of
      HMB-FA ingestion on maintaining muscle architecture and muscle performance during 4-days of
      survival training. In addition, anabolic and catabolic markers of stress, inflammation and
      muscle damage will be assessed.
