  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted to evaluate the effect of once daily treatment with fluticasone
      furoate (FF) on lower leg growth in pediatric subjects with persistent asthma by using
      knemometry. Approximately 65 paediatric asthmatic subjects, aged 5 to 11 years (inclusive),
      will be screened to achieve 60 randomised and 50 evaluable subjects. Subjects meeting the
      eligibility criteria will enter the 2 week run-in period. After completing run-in period,
      each subject will be randomly allocated to one of two treatment sequences: inhaled
      fluticasone furoate followed by placebo or placebo followed by inhaled fluticasone furoate.
      Each treatment will be administered via the ELLIPTA™ dry powder inhaler. The two treatment
      periods will be separated by a two-week wash-out period. Subjects completing two treatment
      period will enter into 7 days follow-up period. ARNUITY™ ELLIPTA (FF) is approved in the US
      for adults and adolescents aged 12 and above.

    <measure>Mean Growth Rate in Lower-leg Growth, as Determined by Knemometry.</measure>
    <time_frame>Over a two week (14 day) treatment period for FF 50mcg OD and Placebo respectively.</time_frame>
    <description>Lower leg growth rate was assessed in growth population as change in the lower leg length from start to end of each 2-week period, divided by time interval (number of days) between the two measurements, multiplied by 7. The Growth Population is defined as the Intent-To-Treat (ITT) population excluding participants having any of the following: did not fulfill growth-specific criteria; did not have growth assessment(s) at any defined time point; withdrawal from study due to adverse events related to major trauma to the legs, major surgery, or severe dehydration; received protocol prohibited medications that may affect short term growth, prior to randomization and during the study; protocol deviations defined in exclusion criteria for growth population. ITT Population consists of all randomized participants who received at least one dose of study drug.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Any Adverse Events (AE) and Any Serious Adverse Event (SAE).</measure>
    <time_frame>From the start of study treatment until follow-up (assessed up to 54 days)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Number of participants with AEs and SAEs have been presented. Two participants randomized to Sequence 1 (Placebo/FF), were treated with placebo in Period 1; however, neither received FF in Period 2, due to premature withdrawal.</description>

          <description>Participants received oral inhalation of 50 microgram (mcg) fluticasone furoate (FF) once daily (OD) or placebo for 14 days in either of the treatment periods in a two-way crossover design. Sequence 1 participants received oral inhalation of placebo OD for 14 days +/- 4 days in Period 1, followed by oral inhalation of FF 50 mcg, OD for 14 days +/- 4 days in Period 2. Sequence 2 participants received oral inhalation of FF 50 mcg, OD for 14 days +/- 4 days in Period 1 followed by oral inhalation of placebo, OD for 14 days +/- 4 days in Period 2. The two treatment periods were separated by a two-week wash-out period. Additionally, all participants were provided a salbutamol inhaler for symptomatic relief of asthma symptoms during the 2-week run-in, washout, and treatment periods as needed.</description>

        <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Number of participants with AEs and SAEs have been presented. Two participants randomized to Sequence 1 (Placebo/FF), were treated with placebo in Period 1; however, neither received FF in Period 2, due to premature withdrawal.</description>
