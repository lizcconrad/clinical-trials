      The current study is designed to determine the effect on mean glucose, hypoglycemia, glucagon
      usage, and insulin usage of adjusting upward the glucose target of the bi-hormonal bionic
      pancreas, and determine whether there is a target at which adequate glycemic control is
      achieved by an insulin-only bionic pancreas with minimal hypoglycemia.

      This study has multiple Aims and includes subjects with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

      In our subjects with type 1 diabetes, we have two specific aims:

      Aim 1 is to conduct an outpatient study testing multiple configurations of the bionic
      pancreas in 20 adult subjects with type 1 diabetes in a random cross-over study versus usual
      care with an insulin pump. These bionic pancreas configurations include the insulin only BP
      at 145 mg/dl set point, 130 mg/dl set point, 120 mg/dl set point and 110 mg/dl set point and
      the bihormonal BP at 130 mg/dl set point, 115 mg/dl set point and 110 mg/dl set point. These
      arms are all compared to usual care.

      Aim 2 is to evaluate the incremental utility of glucagon in the context of automated insulin
      delivery by the bionic pancreas in preventing hypoglycemia during exercise in the fasted
      state. The 130 mg/dl set points and 110 mg/dl set points also participate in this fasted
      exercise visit. These two set points are double blinded, so neither the subjects nor the
      study staff are aware which arm is bihormonal and which arm is insulin only.

      In our subjects with type 2 diabetes, we are conducting a similar study aim 1 for the
      subjects with type 1 diabetes, but we are using different configurations of the bionic
      pancreas. The BP configuration used for this trial is the insulin only BP with a set point of
      100 mg/dl. This arm is compared to usual care.

          -  Have someone over 18 years of age who lives with them, has access to where they sleep,
             is willing to be in the house when the subject is sleeping, and is willing to receive
             calls from the study staff and check the welfare of the study subject if telemetry
             shows a technical problem or severe biochemical hypoglycemia without subject response
             and the subject does not answer their telephone (up to two individuals can share this
             role, but they must be willing to carefully coordinate with each other and the subject
             so that one of them is clearly designated as having this responsibility at any given
             time)

          -  Willing to wear two infusion sets and one CGM sensor and change sets frequently (at
             least one new glucagon infusion set daily during bi-hormonal arms, and insulin
             infusion set every other day throughout the study)

          -  Have a mobile phone they are willing to keep with them and answer calls from study
             staff

             impaired memory, unable to speak and read English)

          -  Current participation in another diabetes-related clinical trial that, in the judgment
             of the principal investigator, will compromise the results of this study or the safety
             of the subject

          -  Pregnancy (positive urine HCG), breast feeding, plan to become pregnant in the
             immediate future, or sexually active without use of contraception

          -  Need to go outside of the designated geographic boundaries during the study

          -  Current alcohol abuse (intake averaging &gt; 3 drinks daily in last 30 days), use of
             marijuana within 1 month of enrollment, or other substance abuse (use within the last
             6 months of controlled substances other than marijuana without a prescription)

          -  Unwilling or unable to refrain from drinking more than 2 drinks in an hour or more
             than 4 drinks in a day or use of marijuana during the trial

          -  Unwilling or unable or to avoid use of drugs that may dull the sensorium, reduce
             sensitivity to symptoms of hypoglycemia, or hinder decision making during the period
             of participation in the study (use of beta blockers will be allowed as long as the
             dose is stable and the subject does not meet the criteria for hypoglycemia unawareness
             while taking that stable dose, but use of benzodiazepines or narcotics, even if by
             prescription, may be excluded according to the judgment of the principal investigator)

          -  History of liver disease that is expected to interfere with the anti-hypoglycemia
             action of glucagon (e.g. liver failure or cirrhosis). Other liver disease (i.e. active
             hepatitis, steatosis, active biliary disease, any tumor of the liver, hemochromatosis,
             glycogen storage disease) may exclude the subject if it causes significant compromise
             to liver function or may do so in an unpredictable fashion.

          -  Renal failure on dialysis

          -  Personal history of cystic fibrosis, pancreatitis, pancreatic tumor, or any other
             pancreatic disease besides type 1 diabetes

          -  Any known history of coronary artery disease including, but not limited to, history of
             myocardial infarction, stress test showing ischemia, history of angina, or history of
             intervention such as coronary artery bypass grafting, percutaneous coronary
             intervention, or enzymatic lysis of a presumed coronary occlusion)

             myocardial infarction, proximal LAD critical stenosis (Wellen's sign), prolonged QT
             interval (&gt; 440 ms). Non-specific ST segment and T wave changes are not grounds for
             exclusion in the absence of symptoms or history of heart disease. A reassuring
             evaluation by a cardiologist after an abnormal EKG finding may allow participation.

          -  Congestive heart failure (established history of CHF, lower extremity edema,
             paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or orthopnea)

          -  History of TIA or stroke

          -  Seizure disorder, history of any non-hypoglycemic seizure within the last two years,

             last year), or treatment with anti-psychotic medications that are known to affect
             glucose regulation.

          -  Electrically powered implants (e.g. cochlear implants, neurostimulators) that might be
             susceptible to RF interference

             sulfonylureas, glitinides, DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT-2 inhibitors) anti-diabetic
             medications

          -  Type 2 diabetes subjects: Use of oral anti-diabetic medications other than metformin

          -  Lives in or frequents areas with poor Verizon wireless network coverage (which would
