  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For ten years, rTMS, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex, has
      found its place in the treatment of drug-resistant neuropathic pain. Patients relieved by
      some sessions may thereafter receive a chronic invasive stimulation via electrodes implanted
      through a neurosurgical procedure. This is common practice at the University Hospital of Caen
      and in different CHU with the proper equipment rTMS. It seems permissible to provide in our
      center only a non-invasive technique for patients challenged with brain surgery, since
      according to the various meta-analyzes the analgesic efficacy of rTMS seems to be correlated
      to the repetition of sessions.

      Assessment centers and the treatment of pain allow a multidimensional assessment,
      bio-psycho-social of patients in order to optimize their management and experience
      efficiently analgesics first- and second-line.

      We propose a study evaluating the analgesic efficacy of rTMS, in relevant stimulation
      parameters reproduced according to a literature review, during 3 months after 5 active
      sessions separated by one week apart, in 15 patients with neuropathic pain chronic refractory
      to treatment of first and second line, followed by multidisciplinary center specializing in
      chronic pain Lower Normandy. The quality of life will also be assessed by validated scales,
      and the results will be compared to the literature data.
