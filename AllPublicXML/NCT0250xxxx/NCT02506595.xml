      The purpose of this study is to obtain preliminary data of the efficacy of Exposure,
      Relaxation, and Rescripting Therapy for nightmares among active duty military personnel.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a pilot randomized controlled trial to compare the effects of Exposure,
      Relaxation, and Rescripting Therapy for military populations (ERRT-M) among active duty
      service members. Participants will be randomized to 5 sessions of ERRT-M (n = 20 ) or to a
      5-week waitlist control group (WL; n = 20).

      Participants will complete all interviews and self-report measures 1 weeks following
      treatment or the WL condition and 1 month after completing treatment.
