    <textblock>
      Purpose:

      Fluid responsiveness in a context of circulatory failure can be predicted by different way.
      Dynamic criteria such as pulse pressure variation, stroke volume variation during an
      end-expiratory occlusion maneuver or a passive leg raising have been reported to predict
      fluid responsiveness. Only aortic velocity peak variation measured with transthoracic
      echocardiography during mechanical ventilation has been reported to predict fluid
      responsiveness in children. Besides some physician use a maneuver of abdominal compression to
      predict fluid responsiveness in children with circulatory failure. This strategy has never
      been formally evaluated.

      The investigators will study the diagnosis accuracy of the stroke volume variation induced by
      an abdominal compression to predict stroke volume variation after 10 ml/kg fluid load in
      children with circulatory failure.

      Thirty-eight pediatric patients under eight years old in circulatory failure, for whom the
      attending physician has decided a fluid load will be included. Hemodynamic parameters:
      arterial pressure, heart rate, stroke volume measured with echocardiography; will be
      recorded. This data collection will be performed before, after abdominal compression and
      after a fluid load of 10 ml/kg.

      Patients will be aposteriori sorted in two groups: Fluid responders and Fluid non-responders.
      Fluid responders are defined as patients that show an increase greater than 15 % in stroke
      volume. The diagnosis ability of the Stroke volume variation after an abdominal compression
      to predict fluid responsiveness will be investigate and receiving operative characteristic
      (ROC) curve will be built. The correlation between the variation of stroke volume during
      abdominal compression and during the fluid load will be studied. Other parameters such as
      arterial pressure and heart rate will also be investigated.

    <description>Stroke volume will be measured before and after a calibrated abdominal compression and after a fluid load. Patient will then be sorted in two groups. Responders defined as patient that show an increase in stroke volume after a 10ml/kg fluid load and Fluid non responders, defined as patient that show an increase of less than 15 % in stroke volume. The ROC curve will investigate the ability of stroke volume variation after abdominal compression to predict fluid responsiveness.</description>
