  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a disease with restricted cognitive memory
      function and intellectual skills, which occurs after surgery with and without anesthesia. The
      POCD strongly depends on patient's age and the surgical operation type. The anesthesia
      procedure plays a pivotal role as well and regarding the current knowledge it is still
      uncertain which technique matches the lowest risk. Elevated stress level accompanied with
      regional anesthesia procedures are accused to cause POCD in elderly patients. The
      investigators address the question weather regional or general anesthesia leads to a
      pronounced POCD in dependence of stress incidence.

      Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a disease with restricted cognitive memory
      function and intellectual skills, which occurs after surgery with and without anesthesia. The
      limiting cognitive ability leads to a lack of quality of life for a lot of patients. The POCD
      strongly depends on patient's age and the surgical operation type. In aged adults the
      incidence of POCD after one week following surgery is 25,8%. Risk factors for the development
      of a POCD is beside age less education and a reduced cognitive reserve. However, the
      anesthesia procedure plays a pivotal role as well and regarding the current knowledge it is
      still uncertain which technique matches the lowest risk. Elevated stress level accompanied
      with regional anesthesia procedures are accused to cause POCD in elderly patients. This fact
      leads to the question if a general anesthesia technique has a lower stress level and
      consequently leads to a reduced risk for a POCD development. Likewise the investigators
      address this hypothesis and analyze cognitive function following both anesthesia techniques
      separately in elderly patients.

    <description>Using different tests addressing a various quality of neurocognitive function (attention, memory, perceptual and processing speed, alertness and executive function) participants score test appropriate values. Comparing test values separately allows to distinguish between prior - and post - operative status. Moreover it allows to discriminate achieved test results between both groups and calculate statistical differences. Favorable test results lead to a potential better neurocognitive function outcome and enable to assess neurocognitive function in the light of operation consequence.</description>
