    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is the evaluation of the safety and immunogenicity of two candidate
      Ebola vaccines Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo, in a heterologous prime-boost regimen.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is staged Phase 3 study to gather information on the safety and immunogenicity of a
      heterologous prime-boost regimen. In this regimen, Ad26.ZEBOV will be administered as a prime
      vaccination, then boosted with the candidate vaccine MVA-BN-Filo and later the third
      vaccination using Ad26.ZEBOV will be administered 2 years post prime vaccination to
      participants in Stage 1 who consent to this. The study will take place in Sierra Leone and
      will consist of a screening phase, an active phase (vaccination) and a follow-up phase. The
      active phase of the study will be conducted initially in two stages. In the first stage
      approximately 40 adults aged 18 years or older will be vaccinated to gain information about
      the safety and immunogenicity of the prime-boost regimen. In stage 2 a larger group of
      approximately 976 individuals will be vaccinated to further evaluate the safety and
      immunogenicity of the prime-boost-post prime regimen across different age groups. In this
      stage, children aged 1 year or older, adolescents and adults will be included. Solicited
      local and systemic adverse events will be collected until 7 days after the prime and boost
      vaccination. Unsolicited adverse events will be collected from signing of the informed
      consent form (ICF) onwards until 56 days after the boost vaccination in Stage 1 and then
      again from the day of the third vaccination until 28 days after the third vaccination, and
      until 28 days after the prime vaccination in Stage 2, and then again until 28 days after the
      boost vaccination. Serious adverse events will be collected from signing of the ICF onwards
      until 12 and 36 months after the prime vaccination in Stage 2 and Stage 1, respectively.
      These data will be reviewed by an independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) to assess
      whether initiation of vaccination in the next stage or age group can be provided. Safety
      evaluations will include assessment of adverse events, which will be monitored throughout the
      study. Participants in Stage 2 will be followed up for safety and immunogenicity until 12
      months (children and adolescents) or 24 months (adults) after the prime vaccination.
      Participants in Stage 1 will be followed up for safety and immunogenicity until 36 months
      after the prime vaccination or until 1 year after the third vaccination.
