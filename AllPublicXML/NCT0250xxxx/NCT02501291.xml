  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic gastrointestinal inflammatory disease characterized by
      relapse and progression. The incidence and prevalence of IBD are increasing in different
      regions around the world, indicating its emergence as a global disease. Though modern medical
      therapies including immunomodulators and biologic agents have revolutionized treatment of CD,
      the occurrence of steroids-dependence and resistance or intolerance to medical therapy is
      quite common. The limitation of present therapeutic management and the high expense of
      biologic agents leads to the treatment of CD become &quot;refractoriness&quot;. The occurrence rate of
      steroids-dependence and resistance or intolerance to thiopurine therapy is quite high during
      the course of CD. Approximately 38% of cases required surgery within 10 years. Therefore, the
      management of such refractory CD remains a great therapeutic challenge for clinicians.

      Thalidomide is an oral agent that has immunomodulatory, antiangiogenic and TNF(tumor necrosis
      factor)-a- suppressing effects. The potential role for thalidomide in the treatment of
      refractory paediatric and adult CD has been investigated in more and more small open-label
      studies and retrospective case series. Recently, a randomized controlled trial showed
      thalidomide improved clinical remission at 8 weeks of treatment and longer-term maintenance
      of remission in pediatric refractory CD. Gerich et al reported in a retrospective study that
      thalidomide improved long-term outcomes among 37 refractory CD adults followed up for a
      median of 58 months. However, the dose of thalidomide used in these studies ranged from
      50mg/d to 150mg/d, and the occurrence rate of side effects reported variously but all quite
      high. The side effects related to the dose of thalidomide were the major concerns of using it
      in CD. Moreover, the effect of thalidomide on endoscopic response including mucosal healing
      which is a more objective and important outcome in CD was rarely reported. Therefore the aim
      of this study is to investigate the efficacy on clinical and endoscopic response and the
      adverse effects of using low-dose thalidomide in active adult CD patients.

    <description>Thalidomide was administered at a daily dose of 50 mg to the patients. Dosage adjustment of thalidomide from 25mg daily to 100mg daily was tailored individually according to patients' tolerance to thalidomide. To minimize the sedative effect of thalidomide, the investigators recommended patients take a single dose of the study drug in the evening before bedtime.</description>
