    <textblock>
      This is prospective cohort study, in pregnant women who present with signs and symptoms of
      possible deep vein thrombosis. All patients will have the same method of assessment of their
      deep vein thrombosis (DVT) symptoms (the LEFt clinical decision rule will be applied and
      D-dimer test will be done) to determine if a compression ultrasound is required. All patients
      will be followed for a period of 3 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      VTE is a leading cause of maternal death in the developed world. Suspected DVT in pregnancy
      is a common clinical problem faced by clinicians daily. The only validated method to exclude
      DVT in pregnancy requires leg vein CUS imaging. This imaging modality is costly and has
      limited availability (only available in radiology departments and, usually, only during
      weekday daytime hours) often necessitating referral to the emergency room for initiation of
      heparin injections until leg vein CUS can be obtained. A simple and seemingly powerful
      clinical decision rule (LEFt) and a simple blood test (D-dimer) may be promising to exclude
      DVT in pregnancy without the need for diagnostic imaging. Validating the safety of a simple,
      non-invasive, widely available approach to suspected DVT in pregnancy would be an important
      advance in maternal health.

      A prospective cohort diagnostic management study in pregnant women with suspected DVT, with
      three-month follow-up for symptomatic VTE will take place in multiple centres in Canada.

      After obtaining informed consent, all patient will have the LEFt clinical decision rule
      applied by the attending physician and will have D-Dimer testing (D-Dimer results of test
      performed within 24 hours will be accepted and do not need to be repeated).

      Patients with an &quot;unlikely&quot; LEFt score of 0 or 1 point and a negative D-dimer will not
      undergo diagnostic imaging.

      Patients with either a &quot;likely&quot; LEFt score of 2 or 3 points or a positive D-dimer will
      undergo either a single complete leg vein compression ultrasound (CCUS) (Day 1) or a serial
      proximal leg vein (CUS) (Day 1 and Day 7).

      All patients will be followed for 3 months for symptomatic VTE.

    <description>The primary outcome will be the number of VTE (any DVT (distal or proximal), PE (sub-segmental or greater PE), death attributable to VTE) documented during the three-month follow-up in those patients left untreated for DVT on the basis of the study's initial diagnostic management (see Figure 2) i.e. not doing CUS on patients with an &quot;unlikely&quot; LEFt score (0 or 1 points) and a negative D-dimer</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of VTE, in all patients</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months after presentation</time_frame>
    <description>The number of major VTE events (any proximal DVT, segmental or greater PE, death attributable to VTE) documented during the 3-month follow-up in the patients. Some clinicians may not treat distal DVT or sub-segmental PE in pregnancy, instead following these patients with serial US imaging, and hence may prefer to focus on this outcome that excludes distal DVT and sub-segmental PE.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of women requiring CUS</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of women requiring CUS using the study's diagnostic strategy (i.e. no imaging in patients with an &quot;unlikely&quot; LEFt score (0 or 1 points) and a negative D-dimer). We anticipate that an important proportion (&gt;40%) of women will be able to avoid the need for CUS imaging based on safely excluding DVT on the basis of an &quot;unlikely&quot; LEFt (0 or 1) and a negative D-dimer. However, if this proportion is very low (&lt;5%) this may argue against the widespread adoption of our proposed diagnostic management strategy even if it proves to be safe.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Average number of CUS in pregnant women with suspected DVT</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days from initial presentation</time_frame>
    <description>The mean number of ultrasounds per patient with suspected DVT. In the study by Chan, validating serial CUS in pregnancy, the mean number of US per patient was 2.8630. We anticipate that we will be able to reduce this by &gt;40% with our diagnostic approach.</description>
