  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of Z-215 (10
      mg, 20 mg, 40 mg) , compared with Rabeprazole Sodium (10 mg, 20 mg ) in Healthy Male
      Subjects. And to evaluate food-effect in Healthy Male Subjects administrated Z-215 20 mg.
