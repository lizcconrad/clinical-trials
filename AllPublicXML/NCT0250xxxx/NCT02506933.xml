    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies the safety and how well multi-peptide cytomegalovirus
      (CMV)-modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vaccine works in reducing CMV complications in patients
      previously infected with CMV and are undergoing a donor hematopoietic cell transplant. CMV is
      a virus that may reproduce and cause disease and even death in patients with lowered immune
      systems, such as those undergoing a hematopoietic cell transplant. By placing 3 small pieces
      of CMV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (the chemical form of genes) into a very safe, weakened
      virus called MVA, the multi-peptide CMV-MVA vaccine may be able to induce immunity (the
      ability to recognize and respond to an infection) to CMV. This may help to reduce both CMV
      complications and reduce the need for antiviral drugs in patients undergoing a donor
      hematopoietic cell transplant.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of CMV-MVA Triplex (multi-peptide CMV-MVA vaccine)
      in vaccinated hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients by assessing the following:
      non-relapse mortality (NRM) at 100 days post HCT, severe (grade 3-4) acute graft-versus-host
      disease (GVHD) (aGVHD), and grade 3-4 adverse events (AEs) (Common Terminology Criteria for
      Adverse Events [CTCAE] 4.0) probably or definitely related to the vaccination within 2 weeks
      from each vaccination.

      II. To determine if CMV-MVA Triplex reduces the frequency of CMV events defined as
      reactivation or CMV disease in allogeneic CMV positive HCT recipients (HCT-R+).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize CMV reactivation and CMV disease in recipients of CMV-MVA Triplex compared
      to placebo by assessing time-to viremia (defined as number of days from transplantation to
      the date of &gt; 500 CMV gc/mL), duration of viremia, recurrence of viremia, incidence of late
      CMV viremia/disease (&gt; 100 and =&lt; 360 days post HCT), use of antiviral drugs (triggered by
      clinically significant viremia of &gt;= 1500 CMV gc/mL), cumulative number of CMV specific
      antiviral treatment days.

      II. To evaluate the impact of CMV-MVA Triplex on transplant related outcomes by assessing the
      incidence of acute GVHD (aGVHD), chronic GVHD (cGVHD), relapse, non-relapse mortality,
      all-cause mortality, infections.

      III. To determine 1) if CMV-MVA Triplex increases levels, function and kinetics of
      CMV-specific T cell immunity in vaccinated compared to placebo treated human leukocyte
      antigen (HLA) A*0201, CMV seropositive HCT-recipients, 2) to determine whether vaccination
      induces adaptive natural killer (NK) cell population changes, and increase in the highly
      cytotoxic memory killer cell lectin-like receptor subfamily C, member 2 (NKG2C)+ NK cells,
      and 3) to explore GVHD biomarkers and compare between the vaccine and placebo groups.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive multi-peptide CMV-MVA vaccine intramuscularly (IM) on days 28 and 56
      post-HCT.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo IM on days 28 and 56 post-HCT.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 1 year post-HCT.
