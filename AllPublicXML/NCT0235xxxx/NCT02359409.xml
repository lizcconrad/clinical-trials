    <textblock>
      This study aims to look if use of goggle balloon can help to complete colonoscopy in patients
      with very redundant colons.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      About 5% of colonoscopies are technically difficult because the colon is elongated or
      redundant. There is an increased risk of the colonoscope not reaching the cecum in these
      cases. One solution to this is to try to keep the colon shorter by not insufflating it with
      gas. In order to achieve that, in these cases the investigators typically fill the colon with
      water, which does not distend the colon as much. Another technique, which can improve
      visualization, is to use a device called the goggle balloon. This is a small balloon filled
      with a few mL of water which fits over the end of the colonoscope and pushes the colonic
      mucosa away from the end of the scope so that the luminal direction can be visualized with
      minimal insufflation. In patients with normal colons, the goggle balloon can be used to
      insert the colonoscope to the cecum with virtually no air or water filling. We aim to study
      if the goggle balloon can be used to help complete the colonoscopy in patients with redundant
      colons.
