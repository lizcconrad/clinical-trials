  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this randomised clinical trial is to is to compare the frequency of
      recurrence between patients who received nasal spray calcitonin after curettage of Central
      Giant Cell Granuloma and without it.

      A total of 24 patients with aggressive Central Giant Cell Granuloma (CGCG )will be selected .
      All examinations were performed by calibrated clinicians and gender, age, medical history,
      symptoms, lesion size and site, disease duration and form of treatment were recorded for all
      participant. Radiographic examination with cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) and panoramic
      radiograph was done for all patients. All patients were randomly assigned to one of two
      treatment groups; 2 weeks after the biopsies were taken.

      The case group (n =12 with) underwent 200 IU/day ones a day for 3 months after the surgeries.
      conservative curettage surgical procedure was done for them. while placebo was treated by
      curettage of CGCGs and received a placebo ones a day for 3 months after surgeries.. Patients
      were followed up by a maxillofacial surgeon who did not participated in surgeries.None of
      surgeons did not aware about the research before and during the operations.Patients were
      blinded from the drugs which they received after surgeries.

      All patients were follow up for 5 years after operations. Recurrence lesions were documented
      by clinical and radiographical examinations and proved by histopathological evaluation.
