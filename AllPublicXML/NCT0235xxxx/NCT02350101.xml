  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2008 at the University Hospital Zurich (USZ) a massive transfusion protocol was
      introduced. Based on laboratory diagnostics and point of care (POC) devices including ROTEM.

      Goal of this retrospective study is to evaluate the influence of this algorithm on
      coagulation, use of blood products, coagulation factors and ROTEM evolution.

    <description>Point of care devices are used in bleeding patients. In the university hospital of Zurich an algorithm in the case of massive bleeding was introduced in 2008. The primary outcome measure is to investigate the changes of ROTEM parameters in the sense of amelioration reflected by better coagulation by using goal directed transfusions.</description>

    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the blood products and coagulation factors needed and to evaluate if there is a reduction between the time before the introduction of the algorithm compared to afterwards.</description>
