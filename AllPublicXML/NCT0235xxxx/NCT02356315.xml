  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      New advances in medical imaging have allowed for the measurement of brain activity related to
      chronic pain. In addition to the brain, the investigators aim to use functional magnetic
      resonance imaging to investigate pain processing in the brainstem and spinal cord in healthy
      subjects and chronic neck pain patients. The information gained from this study will increase
      the investigators understanding of how chronic pain is encoded in the nervous system and
      assist in developing more effective treatment strategies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The experimental design is an observational (non-interventional) cross-sectional clinical
      study. The principal goal of the proposed research is to utilize functional magnetic
      resonance imaging to further investigate and characterize pain-related neural activity at the
      level of the brain, brainstem, and spinal cord in healthy subjects and chronic neck pain
      patients. Healthy subjects and chronic neck pain patients will be recruited and participate
      in a single session of data collection. For both the healthy and chronic neck pain groups,
      painful thermal stimuli will be applied over the skin of the upper extremity while whole
      brain, brainstem, and cervical spinal cord functional images are acquired (on separate
      scans). For the chronic neck pain group, additional scans (brain, brainstem, and cervical
      spinal cord) will be acquired while the subjects rate their spontaneous chronic neck pain.
