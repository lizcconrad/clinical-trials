    <textblock>
      This study is a double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 12 week study
      performed in 2 centres in Sweden to assess the effect of Omega-3 carboxylic acids and
      fenofibrate on liver fat measured with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with
      over-weight and hypertriglyceridemia.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria: - Provision of informed consent

          -  Men or women ≥40 years and ≤75 years with suitable veins for cannulation or repeated
             venepuncture

          -  Have serum triglycerides ≥1.7 mM

          -  Have liver fat content as assessed by MRI &gt;5.5%

          -  Have a body mass index (BMI) &gt;25 and ≤40 kg/m2

             , Exclusion Criteria: - History of or presence of any clinically significant disease
             or disorder which, in the opinion of the investigator, may either put the subject at
             risk because of participation in the study, or influence the results or the subject's
             ability to participate in the study.

          -  Creatinine clearance &lt;60 mL/min at screening (Cockcroft-Gault formula).

          -  Severe hepatic insufficiency and/or significant abnormal liver function defined as
             aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt;3x upper limit of normal (ULN) and/or alanine
             aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;3x ULN

          -  Total bilirubin &gt;2.0 mg/dL (34.2 µmol/L)

          -  Type 2 diabetes, as defined by WHO criteria e.g. fasting plasma Glucose &gt;7.0 mM or use
             of antidiabetic therapy

          -  Any clinically significant abnormalities in clinical chemistry, haematology or
             urinalysis results as judged by the investigator. This includes signs of liver disease
             other than NAFLD that motivates further investigations of treatment based on clinical
             judgement

          -  Recent history (past 12 months) of drug abuse or alcohol abuse. Alcohol abuse was to
             be defined as &gt;14 drinks per week (1 drink = 35 cl beer, 14 cl wine, or 4 cl hard
             liquor) or as judged by the investigator
