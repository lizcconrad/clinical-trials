  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alopecia areata (AA) is an autoimmune disease that involves the hair follicles. Topical
      corticosteroids are the established agents for treating this disorder. There are several case
      reports and case series which have demonstrated the efficacy of topical prostaglandins. The
      two agents have not been compared head-to-head in the published literature. The investigators
      attempt to compare the efficacy and safety of topical betamethasone and topical latanoprost
      in the treatment of localised alopecia areata.

      Alopecia areata (AA) is an autoimmune disease that involves the hair follicles. Topical
      corticosteroids are the established agents for treating this disorder. Topical prostaglandins
      like latanoprost have also been used for this disorder. There are several case reports and
      case series which have demonstrated the efficacy of topical prostaglandins. However, the two
      agents i.e. topical corticosteroids and topical latanoprost have not been compared
      head-to-head in the published literature. The investigators attempt to compare the efficacy
      and safety of topical betamethasone and topical latanoprost in the treatment of localised
      alopecia areata.
