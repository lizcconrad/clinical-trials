      The purpose of this study is to determine whether supplementation with OcuStem, a nutritional
      supplement, will reduce the progression of mild to moderate diabetic retinopathy.

      This research study is designed to evaluate the effects of a nutritional supplement, OcuStem,
      on mild to moderate nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy. In this condition blood vessels in
      the back of the eye, an area termed the retina, are deteriorating. OcuStem contains
      ingredients that have previously been demonstrated in clinical trials to stimulate a type of
      cell, called &quot;endothelial progenitor cells&quot; to increase in circulation. Animal studies have
      shown that increasing endothelial progenitor cell numbers inhibits progression of diabetic
      retinopathy. The hypothesis of the study is that a 6 month course of OcuStem will reduce
      progression of mild to moderate diabetic retinopathy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age â‰¥ 18 years

          -  One or both study eyes per subject may be enrolled.

          -  Diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (type 1 or type 2)

          -  Any one of the following will be considered to be sufficient evidence that diabetes is
             present:

               1. Current regular use of insulin for the treatment of diabetes

               2. Current regular use of oral anti-hyperglycemia agents for the treatment of
                  diabetes

               3. Documented diabetes by ADA and/or WHO criteria.

          -  The study eye must meet the following:

               1. Presence of microaneurysms or at least mild non-proliferative diabetic
                  retinopathy (level 20 or higher) on clinical exam.

               2. No presence of center-involved diabetic macular edema (DME) as evidenced by OCT
                  central subfield thickness &lt;250 microns(or spectral domain OCT equivalent).

               3. Visual acuity light perception or better.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A current ocular condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, visual acuity
             might be affected now and/or may need to be treated (e.g., DME, foveal atrophy,
             pigment abnormalities, dense subfoveal hard exudates, nonretinal condition (cataract
             ), epiretinal membrane or vitro-macular traction) or during the course of the study
             (e.g., vein occlusion, uveitis or other ocular inflammatory disease, neovascular
             glaucoma, etc.).

          -  A history of a major ocular surgery (including vitrectomy, scleral buckle, any
             intraocular surgery, etc.) within prior 4 months or major ocular surgery including
             cataract removal anticipated within the next 4 months following enrollment.
