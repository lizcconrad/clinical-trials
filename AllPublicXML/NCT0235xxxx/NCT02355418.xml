  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the hypothesis that diffuse interstitial cardiac fibrosis develops in
      response to chronic volume overload from severe degenerative mitral regurgitation. The
      investigators will investigate the functional (exercise) and symptomatic (PROMS) outcomes of
      patients with severe but asymptomatic mitral regurgitation who have the option of choosing
      surgical repair or watchful waiting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The optimal management of chronic severe primary degenerative mitral regurgitation (MR) is to
      repair the valve, but timing of surgery remains controversial. Current guidelines suggest
      'watchful waiting' until the onset of symptoms or left ventricular dysfunction but have been
      criticized for promoting 'rescue surgery'. Better predictors are required to optimize timing
      of surgery and patient outcomes.

      Chronic volume overload is a stimulus for adverse adaptive left ventricular (LV) remodeling.
      Subclinical reduction in LV strain before mitral repair predicts a fall in LV ejection
      fraction following surgery and is thought to reflect myocardial fibrosis. The investigators'
      pilot cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) data support this hypothesis. The aims of this study
      are:

        1. identify whether diffuse interstitial myocardial fibrosis impacts upon post-operative
           complications, symptomatic improvement and ventricular recovery following surgery,

        2. to show that diffuse fibrosis (assessed by T1 mapping CMR) is validated by histological
           assessment on myocardial biopsy,

        3. identify independent pre-operative imaging / biomarker / exercise predictors of
           post-operative clinical outcomes

      The investigators will investigate and follow up patients with severe degenerative mitral
      regurgitation, who do meet a class 1 indication for mitral valve surgery using present AHA
      guidelines. Patients have the option of choosing either close monitoring or early surgical
      repair of their mitral valve (class 2a indication). The relationship between patient
      symptoms, CMR findings, blood and histological measures of fibrosis will be studied and
      correlated with patient outcomes.

    <description>Using T1-mapping CMR and myocardial biopsy, the investigators can confirm the development of diffuse interstitial fibrosis in patients with chronic severe degenerative mitral regurgitation. Using a range of clinical markers, the investigators will study the development of diffuse interstitial fibrosis and its relationship to left ventricular recovery following surgery, length of in-hospital stay, and patients' functional (exercise) and symptomatic (PROMS) status.</description>

      Blood samples will be taken from all patients as part of their routine care, including
      measurements for full blood count, urea and electrolytes, liver function test, and markers of
      cardiac fibrosis.

      In patients who chooses to undergo surgical repair of mitral regurgitation, myocardial
      biopsies will be taken to look for the degree of diffuse myocardial fibrosis.
