  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot research study is to identify the characteristics of
      magnetocardiograms that correlate with a non ischemic chest pain status and a myocardial
      infarction patient status. The study uses a non SQUID magnetocardiogram device.

      Magnetocardiography (MCG) is a passive, non-contact technique to measure the electromagnetic
      activity of the heart.

      Heart muscle is controlled by electrical impulses that initiate contraction of the myocardium
      to pump blood around the body. A wave of depolarisation and repolarisation helps to
      coordinate the heart's activity which is usually measured using an electrocardiogram (ECG)
      which reflects the surface electrical manifestation of myocardial depolarisation and
      repolarisation

      For every electrical signal there is a corresponding magnetic field, as defined by Faraday's
      law of induction, and it is this magnetic field that MCG measures.

      There are two key advantages of looking at the magnetic field rather than the electrical
      signal. (1) The signal is not attenuated as it passes through the body, so information is not
      lost and (2) changes in the action potential (for example those caused by ischemia) are
      'magnified' in the magnetic field so are easier to detect by sensors that are not in direct
      contact with the body.

      SQUID MCG has been used widely in cardiology research, and previous clinical studies have
      shown that the technology has potential for the analysis of patients with coronary artery
      disease.

      The aim of this pilot study is to identify characteristics of MCG that differentiate patients
      with non-ischaemic chest pain from those with a myocardial infarction.
