  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK1265744 (744) is an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) currently in development
      for both the treatment and prevention of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Renal
      elimination of unchanged 744 is extremely low, with no parent 744 detected in the urine after
      a single 30 mg radiolabeled dose. Despite the minimal contribution of renal clearance on
      overall 744 elimination, renal impairment may potentially inhibit some pathways of hepatic
      and gut drug metabolism and transport, and as a result may impact 744 pharmacokinetics. The
      current Food and Drug Administration (FDA) draft guidance for renal impairment studies
      suggests that a pharmacokinetic (PK) study in patients with renal impairment be conducted
      even for those drugs primarily metabolized or secreted in bile.

      The study will be comprised of two cohorts (severe renal impairment and normal renal
      function) of 8 subjects each. Upon enrolment, each subject will be admitted to the study
      center and undergo serial PK sampling following a single dose of oral 744 30 milligrams (mg).
      Subjects will return to the clinic for follow-up evaluations 10-14 days after the 744 30 mg
      dose.
