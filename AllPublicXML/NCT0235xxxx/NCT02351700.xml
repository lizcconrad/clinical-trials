    <textblock>
      A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention trial involving 100 treated
      subjects undergoing endonasal trans-sphenoidal (ENTS) resection of pituitary lesion. Subjects
      will be randomized into two groups: 50 treated in the opioid-sparing arm and 50 treated in
      the standard post-operative medication arm.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-operative pain control is a common concern patients have when they consider undergoing a
      surgical procedure. Although effective for treating acute pain, opioid analgesics are also
      associated with dose-dependent adverse effects, including constipation, nausea and vomiting,
      altered mental status, and respiratory depression, all of which have been shown to increase
      patient length of stay. The use of non-opioid analgesics with different mechanisms of actions
      for acute pain control via a multi-modal approach is efficacious in reducing opioid
      consumption, decreasing the incidence of adverse effects, improving patient satisfaction and
      recovery time, and decreasing hospital costs.Certain minimally invasive procedures may afford
      many patients the opportunity to achieve adequate post-operative pain control with minimal to
      no requirement of opioid analgesics, thereby sparing the patient known adverse effects that
      can increase length of stay and costs. The ENTS approach for resection of pituitary tumors is
      the standard surgical procedure for these lesions, and is associated with pain that is more
      easily managed post-operatively, making it an ideal procedure for an opioid-sparing
      post-operative pain regimen. Anecdotally, the investigators note that in the investigator's
      post-operative pituitary patient population that post-operative pain can frequently be
      adequately managed with scheduled non-opioid analgesics, often without requiring breakthrough
      opioid doses. Another safe and effective non-opioid analgesic that is widely used in
      multi-modal pain management for moderate pain is IV Caldolor (ibuprofen). After literature
      review, the investigators were unable to find a study that had attempted to use an
      opioid-sparing analgesic regimen for post-operative pain control following ENTS approach for
      resection of pituitary tumors.
