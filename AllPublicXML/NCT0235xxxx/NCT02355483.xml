  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether non-contrast abdominal computed tomography
      (CT) impacts management (diagnosis, need for surgery and treatment) in elderly patients
      admitted to the emergency department with abdominal pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A systematic unenhanced abdominal CT is performed in elderly patients admitted to the
      emergency patients with acute abdominal symptoms. Accuracy of unenhanced CT is assessed by
      comparing diagnosis and therapeutic management recorded before and after unenhanced CT versus
      gold standard diagnosis and management. Gold standard diagnosis and management are
      established at 3 month follow up, based on patient's medical records and a systematic
      telephone interview.
