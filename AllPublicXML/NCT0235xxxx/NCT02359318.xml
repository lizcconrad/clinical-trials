  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Orthodontic bracket debonding is known to cause side-effects such as enamel
      cracks or fractures. There is a lack of information on potential benefits or side-effects of
      removing brackets from infiltrated enamel, in terms of enamel damages, in vivo.

      Purpose: To assess enamel damages following debonding in demineralised teeth with or without
      prior infiltration (Icon, DMG, Hamburg, Germany), compared to those following bracket removal
      from sound enamel, in order to provide guidelines for the right time point of infiltration of
      post-orthodontic lesions (during or following orthodontic treatment).

      Design: Single-center, randomized, single blinded, split-mouth controlled clinical trial
      Subjects: 30 subjects with fixed multi-bracket (MB) appliances treated at the orthodontic
      clinic of Dr. Roberto Vogel, Temuco, Chile: It is planned to include 20 consecutive patients
      with extensive decalcifications, and 10 patients without decalcifications. Random allocation
      of demineralized dental arch quadrants to the different treatment groups (debond with or
      without prior infiltration, and sound teeth).

      Investigated tooth groups: Upper and lower canines, and upper and lower incisors.

      Methods: Bracket bonding procedure (Transbond XT 3M, Unitek) is identical for all patients
      and also for the re-attachement of brackets. Teeth allocated to the infiltration group will
      receive bracket removal, infiltration and rebonding of new brackets 4 weeks prior to final
      debonding. De-bonding procedures are identical for all patients.

      Silicone replicas are made directly following bracket removal (prior to adhesive removal).
      Replica analysis is performed using a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM780) at the Department of
      Cell Biology, University of Concepción, Chile.

    <description>Brackets (Gemini metal brackets, 3M Unitek) are bonded and de-bonded by one clinician (Roberto Vogel) and using the same bonding and de-bonding techniques and materials for all patients. Brackets that were de-bonded in preparation of infiltration were not re-used, but replaced by new brackets. Infiltration was carried out according to the manufacturer's instruction, with a maximum of three times of prior etching. In accordance with the instructions, the numbers of etching intervals were adapted to the depth of the lesions by visual clinical evaluation. All brackets were finally de-bonded at the end of the treatment, with silicon impressions taken before adhesive removal.</description>
