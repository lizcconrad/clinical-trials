  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess whether a low dose of GH supplementation (0.5
      IU/day) increases clinical pregnancy rates in women with a history of POR who failed to
      become pregnant in two previous IVF cycles.

      The investigators aim to study the impact of a low-dose growth hormone (GH) supplementation
      in pregnancy rates in poor responders in a prospective, self-controlled study of 64 poor
      responders to previous IVF cycles who failed to achieve pregnancy and were supplemented with
      low-doses of GH in a subsequent cycle using the same gonadotropin dose and protocol. Our
      primary endpoint was the clinical pregnancy rate (CPR), considering secondary endpoints the
      number of retrieved oocytes, embryos, embryo quality and the proportion of cycles with embryo
      transfer.

      Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation will be performed using a GnRH agonist long protocol from
      day 21-23 of the menstrual cycle at a dose of 1 mg/ day, using the same schedule and dose as
      in the previous cycle, so that the only difference between them is the GH supplementation.

      After confirming pituitary inhibition, the dose of GnRH agonist will be decreased to 0.5
      mg/day, and COH will begin with gonadotropins at a dose of 300 UI, subsequently adjusting
      according to clinical response. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) will be administered when
      follicles reached &gt; 17 mm in diameter. A dose of 0.5 IU of GH will be administered daily from
      the first day of the agonist until the day of hCG administration. Oocyte retrieval will be
      performed 36 hours after hCG administration by ultrasound-guided follicle aspiration.
