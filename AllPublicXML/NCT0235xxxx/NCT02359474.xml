  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial compares trabectedin alone to trabectedin in combination with regional
      hyperthermia in patients with high-risk soft tissue sarcoma. The study is designed to
      demonstrate a significant benefit for sarcoma-therapy by adding regional hyperthermia.

    <description>The rationale for combining Trabectedin and regional hyperthermia is that clinical hyperthermia might also prevent repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) which are induced by Trabectedin. Preclinical investigations show an enhanced anti-tumor efficacy of Trabectedin in different human STS cell lines by heat exposure (41.8°C). Using BRCA2 deficient cells or BRCA2 knock-down the thermal enhancement of Trabectedin efficacy seems to be related to DSB repair.</description>
