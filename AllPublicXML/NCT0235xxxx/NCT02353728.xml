  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is an open-label phase 2 clinical and translational trial designed to evaluate the
      effects of nilotinib on the leukemic stem cell population in subjects with newly diagnosed
      chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (Ph+ CML in CP). Nilotinib is FDA-approved to treat
      subjects with Ph+ CML in CP. Subjects on study will be monitored according to accepted
      National Cancer Comprehensive Network [NCCN] clinical guidelines for 24 months. After 24
      months, if continued therapy is needed subjects will be transitioned to commercial supply of
      study drug.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ CML in chronic phase will be eligible for enrollment in
      this trial. Prior treatment with nilotinib for less than 2 weeks and hydroxyurea is allowed.

      Before therapy and during therapy, peripheral blood and bone marrow samples will be obtained
      for cytogenetic and molecular evaluations. During study, blood will be collected at
      approximately month 1, month 3, and every 3 months thereafter; aspirate samples will be
      collected at approximately month 1, month 3, and month 12. These samples will be collected to
      analyze the quantitative and qualitative changes in the leukemic stem cell population before
      and during therapy with nilotinib. The study is intended as a hypothesis finding analysis in
      order to establish whether in response to nilotinib therapy, defined differences in the
      baseline or therapy-induced changes in the characteristics of the stem cell population will
      be predictive of the ability to successfully discontinue therapy in subjects with CML.

      In order to determine the effect of nilotinib in stem and progenitor populations we will
      evaluate 40 newly diagnosed CML subjects undergoing treatment with nilotinib at different
      time points. We will evaluate the levels of expression of Breakpoint Cluster Region-Abelson
      protooncogene (BCR-ABL) in purified stem cell populations during the course of treatment. In
      addition, we will compare the stem and progenitor populations present during the course of
      treatment in peripheral blood and bone marrow. We will perform transcriptional profiling of
      such populations to determine changes in signaling pathways driving survival, self-renewal or
      proliferation. Whole exome sequencing will be also performed in all diagnostic samples to
      determine whether there are novel cooperating mutations.
