    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical research study is to learn if pazopanib when given in
      combination with topotecan can help to control sarcomas. The safety of this drug combination
      will also be studied. Pazopanib hydrochloride and topotecan hydrochloride may stop the growth
      of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine progression free rate at week 12 for patients with soft tissue sarcoma (STS)
      treated with pazopanib (pazopanib hydrochloride) plus oral topotecan (topotecan
      hydrochloride).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the overall response rate for patients with STS treated with combination
      pazopanib and topotecan.

      II. To determine the clinical benefit rate (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR] +
      stable disease [SD]) for patients with STS treated with combination pazopanib and topotecan.

      III. To determine median progression-free rate (PFR) for patients with STS treated with
      combination pazopanib and topotecan.

      IV. To evaluate overall survival (OS) for patients with STS treated with combination
      pazopanib and topotecan.

      V. To assess safety and tolerability for patients treated with combination pazopanib and
      topotecan.

      VI. To estimate the PFR for patients with osteosarcoma treated with combination pazopanib and
      topotecan.

      VII. To estimate the PFR for patients with liposarcoma treated with combination pazopanib and
      topotecan.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the correlation of PFR and OS to levels of soluble vascular endothelial growth
      factor receptor 2 (sVEGFR2) and phosphatidylinositol-glycan biosynthesis class F (PIGF).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and
      topotecan hydrochloride PO on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or until discontinuation per patient
      preference or physician recommendation.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 2 or 5
      years.
