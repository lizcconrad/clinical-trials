  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether dexamethasone as an adjuvant to
      ropivacaine for adductor canal block increases duration of the sensory block, when
      controlling for a systemic effect using a paired design and bilateral blocks.

      The investigators hypothesize that adding dexamethasone to ropivacaine will prolong block
      duration compared with ropivacaine + placebo.

    <measure>Difference in duration of sensory block between dexamethasone and placebo assessed as cold sensation with an alcohol swab</measure>
    <time_frame>0-36 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Duration is defined as time from block performance until recovery of cold sensation to an alcohol swab, assessed every hour post-block (and every half hour when pain scores during the tonic heat stimulation test is above 0, except at 2 and 3 hours post block where there will be a break and no assessments will be performed.</description>

    <measure>Difference between dexamethasone and placebo in the duration of a sensory block assessed as maximum pain during a tonic heat stimulation test</measure>

    <description>Duration is defined as time from block performance until recovery of normal sensation, assessed on the hour post block (except at 2 and 3 hours post block where there will be a break and no assessments will be performed).
Recovery of normal sensation is defined as VAS pain scores ± 10 mm of the pre-block value.</description>

Recovery of normal sensation is defined as detection thresholds of ± 2 degrees C of the pre-block value.</description>
