  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ultrasound is used increasingly to aid placement of neuraxial blocks. Good visibility of
      ligamentum duramater complex and posterior longitudinal ligament (LF, PLL) has a positive
      predictive value of 85% for successful neuraxial block. Dural puncture could still be
      feasible despite the absence of a good view, as reflected by a negative predictive value of
      30%.

      Poor neuraxial ultrasound view could be due to limitations of ultrasound or various other
      anatomical reasons which might include absent LF, calciÔ¨Åcation of ligaments, spinous process
      contact and presence or absence of epidural or subdural fat. This will be the first study of
      its kind to compare neuraxial ultrasound with MRI. The aim of this study is to look for
      anatomical correlation between neuraxial ultrasound and MRI at various lumbar interspinous
      levels and to look at factors that contribute to abnormal neuraxial imaging. Assuming the
      predicted abnormal ultrasound images to be around 30% and predicted abnormal MRI images to be
      5%, 79 images should give a power of 0.9 and alpha 0.01 to analyse the association between
      the two. Sample Size Calculations were performed using statistical software R version 2.15.2

      After ethical committee approval, 20 consenting patients scheduled for MRI lumbar spine were
      included in the study. Patients with previous spinal surgeries or with gross spinal
      deformities were excluded. In all patients ultrasound scanning of the lumbar interspinous
      spaces was performed with curvilinear 2-5 MHz Sonosite probe. At each lumbar interspinous
      level (L1-2 to L5-S1) the best possible transverse and paramedian oblique sagittal view was
      obtained. The obtained ultrasound images were the graded based on the visibility of LF and
      PLL. The lumbar spine MRI images were analyzed by radiologists who were blinded to the
      ultrasound images. On MRI various parameters such as depth of epidural space, absence of LF,
      thickness of LF, characteristics of muscular and intervening fatty tissue, epidural/subdural
      fat thickness etc was noted. The correlation between neuraxial ultrasound images and various
      parameters observed in MRI was identified.

    <description>Ultrasound images were the graded based on the visibility of Ligamentum Flavum (LF) and Posterior longitudinal ligament (PLL) as good (Both PLL and LF visible), intermediate (either LF or PLL only visible) or poor (both LF and PLL not visible. An abnormal MRI is defiined as one with any of the following - presence of fascet joint hypertrophy or non fusion of ligamentum flavum.</description>
