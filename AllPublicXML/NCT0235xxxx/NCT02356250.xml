      Rationale for the study:

      To try and define PEF in cirrhotic patients with CSPH, and maybe to try to find a correlation
      between HVPG result and PEF result in a way that the result of the PEF test will be able to
      predict if a patient has CSPH (yes of no). By this, to try and develop a portable
      office-based device that can produce immediate results in a non-invasive manner in cirrhotic
      patients and help in evaluating prognosis in these patients in a noninvasive manner.

      Aim:

      The aim of this study is to try and characterize the peripheral endothelial function (PEF) in
      patient with cirrhosis and CSPH. This will be evaluated by measuring the PEF in every patient
      before evaluating his HVPG level in a hemodynamic study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. &gt; 18 years old (Male/Female) and not more than 75 years old

          2. Diagnosis of cirrhosis:

        i. By liver biopsy ii. Or strong suspicion of cirrhosis by accepted criteria for the
        clinical diagnosis of cirrhosis (e.g. peripheral edema or varices, palpable hard left lobe
        of the liver, small right lobe span or palpable splenomegaly), and/or radiological evidence
        of cirrhosis (by abdominal US, CT, or MRI, showing a nodular liver and/or portosystemic
        collaterals with portal vein patency and/or ascites and/or splenomegaly, and/or colloid
        shift on a colloid-isotope liver-spleen scan), and/or laboratory variables (platelets
        &lt;100,000/mm3, albumin&lt; 3.5g/dL, or INR &gt;1.3) and/or presence of esophageal varices (without
        previous variceal bleeding episode) or HVPGâ‰¥12mmHg from previous testing, or by FIbroscan
        or Fibrotest results showing fibrosis stage- 4.

        c. Has been scheduled for hemodynamic study testing. d. Patients should have a Child Pugh
        score A or higher

         12. Patients that are participating in other clinical trials evaluating experimental
             treatments or procedures or have participated in a clinical trial in the past 3
             months.

         13. Active smoking

         14. Uncontrolled hypertension

        Withdrawal criteria:

          1. Patient that based on the opinion of the investigator should be withdrawl from the
             study due to no compliance
