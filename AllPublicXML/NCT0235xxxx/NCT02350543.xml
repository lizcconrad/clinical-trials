    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the continuation (non-discontinuation) of Aspirin during TURBT. Half of
      participants will continue their usual low-dose Aspirin regimen during TURBT and throughout
      the perioperative period, while the other half will discontinue Aspirin use ten days prior to
      surgery (standard recommendation) and restart therapy two weeks post-discharge.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recently, the American College of Chest Physicians in their 2012 clinical guidelines on
      perioperative anti-thrombotic therapy associated TUR of bladder tumour (TURBT) with an
      increased risk of bleeding associated with anti-thrombotic therapy. Despite this,
      contemporary series of TURBT identify the rate of significant in-hospital postoperative
      bleeding at only 2-3.4%. Previous prospective work by our group demonstrated no increase in
      postoperative hemorrhagic complications with early initiation of Aspirin following TURBT.
      These findings are supported by a recent retrospective work on TURBT showing a similar
      complication profile between continued perioperative antiplatelet therapy and antiplatelet
      naive patients.

      The risk associated with Aspirin withdrawal prior to surgery, including increased
      thrombogenicity, has been extensively studied. Following cessation of Aspirin, full platelet
      recovery is expected within 12-14 days, however, hemostasis may be regained with as little as
      20% of normal platelet activity. Further, evidence supports a platelet rebound phenomenon in
      the setting of acute Aspirin withdrawal and a resultant clinical prothrombotic state, with
      thrombotic events peaking ten days following drug cessation. Finally, the acute stress
      response postoperatively is well known; one component being hypercoagulability which lasts at
      least seven days after major and uneventful abdominal surgery, predominantly caused by
      increased platelet activity.

      Whereas TURBT generally carries a low overall risk of cardiac morbidity, the general
      requirement to discontinue Aspirin pre-operatively potentially increases certain patients'
      cerebrovascular or cardiac risk (eg. post-coronary stent placement). As shown above, the risk
      of significant post-operative hematuria is minimal, and as such, Aspirin withdrawal may be
      unnecessary. We will perform a prospective, randomized controlled trial to address the safety
      and tolerability of continued Aspirin use during TURBT.

    <description>(Composite endpoint): 1. Requiring bladder catheter drainage (after catheter removal), 2. requiring re-hospitalization, 3. requiring operative intervention (ie. cystoscopy +/- transurethral fulguration). Each sub-element within the composite endpoint will receive a binary score [0,1] to denote occurrence. Similarly, the primary endpoint is a binary measure indicating occurrence of any sub-element. Sub-elements 1-3 (re-cath, re-hospitalization, or cystoscopic intervention) may occur at any point throughout the followup period.</description>

    <measure>Time to urinary catheter removal</measure>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Withholding or withdrawal of Aspirin</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 45 days</time_frame>
    <description>A binary measure [0,1]. In the control group (Aspirin restarted two weeks post-discharge), if Aspirin is withheld due to continued hematuria, this will constitute an event. Similarly, in either group, if Aspirin is withdrawn at any point post-operatively due to hematuria, this will constitute an event.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to urine clearance</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 45 days</time_frame>
    <description>Measured in postoperative days until any lingering, sporadic macrohematuria has resolved. Patients will be discharged with a Hematuria Grading Scale based on that developed by Lee et al, a VAS-like scale of hematuria intensity (redness), and will note their most intense hematuria level on a daily basis until urine clearance. It is assumed that postoperative macrohematuria will resolve by 45 days postoperatively, the duration of followup.</description>
