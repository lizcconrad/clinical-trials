  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed clinical trial is an outgrowth of the safety record and functional improvement
      seen in the BMD follistatin gene therapy trial. In this study the investigators propose to
      inject AAV1.CMV.huFS344 at a total dose of 2.4E12 vg/kg to six DMD patients. This dose will
      be divided between gluteal muscles, quadriceps and tibialis anterior. This is a wider
      distribution of vector than given to BMD patients, who overall improved the distance walked
      on the 6MWT without adverse events related to viral transduction into a single muscle.

      The primary objective of this study is safety and endpoints will include hematology, serum
      chemistry, urinalysis, immunologic response to rAAV1 and follistatin, and reported history
      and observations of symptoms. Efficacy measures will be used as secondary outcomes and
      include the distance walked on the 6MWT, functional tests by PT, life quality questionnaire,
      MRI, EIM, and muscle biopsy. Subject will have follow up visits on days 7, 14, 30, 45, 60,
      90, 180 and 9,12, 18 and 24 months post-gene transfer.

    <description>The vector will be delivered to both limbs via multiple, direct intramuscular injections of rAAV1.CMV.huFollistin344; the number of injections per muscle will depend on the size of the patient.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 7 or older

          -  Confirmed DMD gene mutations

          -  Impaired muscle function based on clinical evidence including difficulty climbing
             stairs, getting from the floor (Gowers' sign), and weakness of individual muscles of
             extremities

          -  Males of any ethnic group will be eligible

          -  Ability to cooperate with study procedures including muscle testing.

          -  Willingness of sexually active subjects with reproductive capacity to practice
             reliable method of contraception

          -  Subjects must be on stable dose of prednisone for three months at time of enrollment
             or be started on oral dose of daily prednisone regimen for 30 days prior to gene
             transfer. Study participants will continue prednisone post gene transfer unless there
             is adverse event that warrants prednisone taper or withdrawal.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active viral infection based on clinical observations.

          -  The presence of a DMD gene mutation without weakness or loss of function

          -  Symptoms or signs of cardiomyopathy, including:

          -  Dyspnea on exertion, pedal edema, shortness of breath upon lying flat, or rales at the
             base of the lungs

          -  Echocardiogram with ejection fraction below 40%

          -  Serological evidence of HIV infection, or Hepatitis A, B or C infection

          -  Diagnosis of (or ongoing treatment for) an autoimmune disease

          -  Concomitant illness or requirement for chronic drug treatment that in the opinion of
             the PI creates unnecessary risks for gene transfer

          -  Subjects with rAAV1 binding antibody titers &gt; 1:50 as determined by ELISA immunoassay

          -  Abnormal laboratory values for liver, kidney, CBC, in the clinically significant
             range, based upon normal values in the Nationwide Children's Hospital Laboratory
