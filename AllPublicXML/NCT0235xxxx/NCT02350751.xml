  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, single-dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study to
      evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of MEDI8852 compared to placebo when administered to
      healthy adult subjects. Approximately 40 subjects will be entered to receive treatment across
      4 fixed dose cohorts at 1 site. Investigational product will be delivered intravenously (IV).
      A total of 4 different dose levels of investigational product will be evaluated across the
      cohorts. Subjects will be followed for approximately 100 days.
