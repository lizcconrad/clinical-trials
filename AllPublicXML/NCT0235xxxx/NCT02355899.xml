    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the potential usefulness of photodynamic therapy with PD P 506 A in
      patients with distal subungual onychomycosis of the great toenail. Patients will receive four
      PDT treatments with PD P 506 A in weekly intervals.

    <measure>Percentage of nails with Clinically Complete Cure</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months after last study treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Complete Clinical Clearance of each treated nail will be determined 3, 6 and 12 months after last study treatment. Based on a visual inspection, the nail(s) will either be defined as &quot;completely cleared&quot; or &quot;partially&quot; or &quot;not cleared&quot;.
To be defined as &quot;completely cleared&quot;, a nail must show 100% absence of the 4 following clinical signs of onychomycosis (according to Scher et al., J Am Acad Dermatol. 2007 Jun;56(6):939-44):
Residual changes of the nail plate compatible with dermatophyte infection
White/yellow or orange brown/patches or streaks in or beneath the nail
Lateral onycholysis with debris in an otherwise clear nail plate
Hyperkeratoses on the lateral nail plate/nailfold edge. If the nail shows an improvement but still one of the above signs, it will be rated as &quot;partially cleared&quot;.
If the nail shows no improvement in comparison to the Screening Visit, it will be rated as &quot;not cleared&quot;.</description>

          -  Presence of dermatophytoma (defined as demarcated and localised thick masses (≥ 3 mm)
             of fungal hyphae and necrotic keratin between the nail plate and nail bed) on the
             target nail

          -  Other conditions than DSO known to cause abnormal nail appearance

          -  Topical antifungal treatment of the nails within 1 month before PDT

          -  Diagnosis of polyneuropathy

          -  Dementia or psychic condition that might interfere with the ability to understand the
             study and thus give written informed consent

          -  Simultaneous participation in another clinical study or participation in another
             clinical study in the 30 days directly preceding treatment
