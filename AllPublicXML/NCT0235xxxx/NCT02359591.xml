      【Background&amp; Purpose】In order to early detect the problems a child might have during his/her
      development, an effective screening tool is of great needs. The [Taipei City Child
      Development Screening checklist] is often used to serve this process. This text version is
      mainly distributed to the parents to fill out during their child regular check-ups to the
      hospitals and clinics. The drawbacks of this checklist is that it lacks of active
      participation of the target population, and the text version limits its usage to people who
      are not familiar with Chinese characteristics, such as those new inhabitant. These lead to
      low screening rates therefore causing delayed early intervention. 【Purpose】The purpose of
      this study was to design and develop the multi-media graphic version of the [Taipei City
      Child Development Screening checklist] based on its original text version.【Method】The
      developed muti-media system will be checked for is validity. Thirty parents/legal guardians
      of children in each target age groups will be recruited randomly for the clinical reliability
      evaluation.
