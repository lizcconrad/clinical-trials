  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Nowadays ventricular tachycardia (VT) ablation in structural heart disease is
      performed primarily by early referral; while at the same time we still struggle with the
      limited longterm ablation success of endocardial VT ablation. An underestimated number of VTs
      from ischemic substrate have an epicardial exit. However, one cannot accurately predict who
      is in need of epicardial ablation. The investigators hypothesise endo/epicardial substrate
      homogenization in a first approach to be superior to endocardial substrate homogenization
      alone, in terms of recurrence on follow-up.

      Objective: To show superiority of a combined endo/epicardial approach compared to a stepwise
      approach in the ablation of ventricular tachycardia in a population with ischemic
      cardiomyopathy on VT recurrence.

      Study design: Multicenter prospective open randomized controlled trial. Study population: All
      patients above 18 years with an ischemic cardiomyopathy being referred for a ventricular
      tachycardia ablation.

      Intervention: One group undergoes endo/epicardial ablation and the other group has
      endocardial ablation only as a first approach.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The main study endpoint is the difference in recurrences of
      ventricular tachycardia on follow-up - clinical or on implantable cardioverter defibrillator
      (ICD) interrogation - between the two ablation groups; secondary endpoints are procedure
      success and safety.
