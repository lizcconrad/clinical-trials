  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Control rules are common parental practices that use food as reward to encourage children to
      conduct parents' preferred behaviors. This field observational study aims to examine whether
      control rules are associated with children's increased fat, carbohydrate and total energy
      intake in everyday eating, and whether this effect is moderated by individual differences in
      sensitivity to reward, and by gender differences.

      Control rules are parental practices that use food as an instrumental reinforcer to encourage
      children to behave in a normative manner in non-food domains. Since food high in fat or sugar
      is usually chosen as a reinforcer for control rules, these rules may lead to children's
      increased preference and every day intake of food high in sugar/fat. Research propositions
      were examined in 207 six to twelve-year-old children (97 boys and 110 girls). Their parents
      reported the children's everyday dietary intake through a food frequency questionnaire, and
      provided information regarding the children's sensitivity to rewards as well as an indication
      of how frequently they enforce family control rules.

    <description>A web-based Food Frequency Questionnaire was used to aske participants' parents to recall their children's food intake over the last month based on a list of 136 individual food items or food clusters, which covered eight categories of food and beverages. For each individual food item or cluster, participants were asked to indicate how frequently their children consumed that food and the typical portion size.</description>
