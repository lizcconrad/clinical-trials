    <textblock>
      This study is to further develop and optimise the design and manufacturing process of a
      handheld device to monitor and manage Warfarin (blood thinning anticoagulation drug) therapy.
      The device comprises of a handheld instrument and a disposable test strip and reports how
      blood coagulation is working in terms of standardised units called International Normalised
      Ratio (INR). A single drop of fresh whole blood and plasma will be added to the strip and the
      INR result displayed on the instrument. Blood samples are to be collected from patients
      attending a hospital based INR clinic who are on Warfarin Therapy. The samples are to be used
      in a series of experiments in the laboratory to test the Microvisk POC INR Monitors accuracy,
      precision, stability and robustness.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number of patients receiving anticoagulation therapy with warfarin and other vitamin K
      antagonists has been rising in recent years. Increasing life expectancy is increasing the
      proportion of the population having conditions such as Atrial Fibrillation and venous
      thrombosis, where primary and secondary prevention of thromboembolic complications are best
      achieved with anticoagulation.

      Unpredictable pharmacokinetics, widespread interactions with drugs and food and the narrow
      therapeutic window make closely monitoring Vitamin K antagonists a necessity. Portable point
      of care (POC) coagulometers which measure PT from capillary whole blood and provide an INR
      reading within a few minutes are already widely available throughout North American and
      Europe. They give comparable results when compared to laboratory based systems are popular
      with patients and significantly shorten the duration of clinics. In addition, the United
      Kingdom Department of Health has been encouraging the use of anticoagulation services in
      Primary Care Trusts the aim being to provide INR monitoring in community clinics and General
      Practice surgeries relieving pressure on hospital services and reducing inconvenience for
      patients.

      Although coagulometers are now commercially available the Microvisk INR Testing System has
      been designed to have advantages, particularly in terms of test robustness, user comfort,
      ease of use and reduction of user error. The present trial has been designed to develop the
      second generation Microvisk INR Test System; blood samples will also be used to optimise
      manufacturing processes and verify the quality of Test Strip Lots.
