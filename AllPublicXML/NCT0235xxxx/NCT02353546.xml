  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Managing Cancer And Living Meaningfully (CALM) is a brief psychotherapy designed to alleviate
      distress in advanced cancer. In an earlier intervention-only pilot trial, CALM was associated
      with reductions in depressive symptoms and death anxiety and an increase in spiritual
      wellbeing. The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of a large-scale randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) of CALM and to identify preliminary effects in advanced cancer. This
      phase 2b pilot RCT employed intervention and usual care arms with 3 and 6 month follow-ups.
      The primary outcome was depressive symptoms (PHQ-9) and secondary outcomes included diagnosis
      of major depression (SCID), death anxiety, attachment security and spiritual wellbeing.
      Multilevel regression was used to compare change over time between groups. 60 patients with
      advanced cancer will be recruited from the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, Canada,
      and equally randomized into intervention and usual care conditions.
