  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to test the effectiveness of internet-delivered and
      therapist-guided internet-based cognitive behavior therapy (ICBT) for children with anxiety
      disorders (including social anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, generalized
      anxiety disorder, panic disorder and specific phobia) in a randomized trial where
      participants will be allocated to either ICBT or to a supportive control condition.
      Non-responders (defined as those participants who still uphold their primary anxiety disorder
      after the ICBT treatment) will be offered traditional (face-to-face) CBT. Follow-ups are
      conducted at 3 and 12 months after treatment completion.
