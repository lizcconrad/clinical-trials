    <measure>Percentage number of patients with hepatitis due to HBV reactivation</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years (every 3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage number of patients with hepatitis due to HBV reactivation during the preemptive tenofovir therapy and for 24 weeks after withdrawal from tenofovir.
Definition;
Hepatitis was defined as a more than 3-fold increase of serum ALT on 2 consecutive determinations at least 5 days apart.
Hepatitis was defined to be due to HBV reactivation when it was preceded or accompanied by an increase of serum HBV DNA to more than 10 times that of the pre-exacerbation baseline and the serum HBV DNA turned from negative to positive.</description>
