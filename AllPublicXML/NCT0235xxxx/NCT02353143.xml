      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety of MEN1112, given as intravenous infusion,
      in patients with relapsed or refractory AML. Pharmacokinetics, clinical activity and
      potential immunogenicity of MEN1112 will be evaluated as well.

      This trial is designed as an open label, non randomised, dose escalation and cohort
      expansion, first administration to human study to be conducted in approximately 20 European
      sites. The study is aiming to identify the Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) and Maximum Tolerated
      Dose (MTD), to assess the pharmacokinetics and to determine the clinical activity and
      potential immunogenicity of MEN1112, administered as IV infusion given once every week in a
      21 days cycle in patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

      Approximately 50 male and female ≥ 18 years-old patients, with a documented diagnosis of
      relapsed or refractory AML (not M3 FAB subtype), will be treated in the study, which consists
      of two steps.

      Step 1 is the dose escalation phase according to a 3+3 patients cohort design.Incremental
      mg/Kg doses will be tested given at day 1, 8 and 15 of a 21-day cycle. Briefly, MEN1112 doses
      are to be administered to 3 patients; if no DLT is observed in a cohort of 3 DLT evaluable
      patients at a given dose level, the next cohort of 3 new patients will be treated with the
      next higher dose. In case of DLT occurrence by one of the three patients at any dose, the
      cohort will be expanded to 6 DLT evaluable patients at the same dose level. If two or more
      patients at a given dose level exhibit DLT, the dose escalation phase will be concluded as
      the MTD will be identified as one dose level below the one at which ≥ 2 DLT out of 6 treated
      patients occur.

      Step 2 is the cohort expansion phase which will include patients treated at the MTD or the
      maximum dose level judged to be tolerable.

      In each study Step, patients will be given two induction cycles of MEN1112 followed by a
      three weeks End of Induction period. Patients will then undergo to 4
      post-induction/maintenance visits every 28 days (maintenance administration is allowed in
      patients who achieve a clinical benefit based on Investigator's judgement) and to an End of
      Study Visit. Along the study period, adverse events, changes in hematology/serum biochemistry
      parameters and bone marrow treatment response will represent the major clinical findings to
      be monitored on regular basis. The individual experimental clinical phase will last up to 6
      months (except for female patients of childbearing potential that will undergo monthly
      pregnancy test until 6 months from the last study drug administration) encompassing 40
      planned visits at site, including Screening, Induction, End of Induction,
      Post-induction/Maintenance and the End of Study visit.
