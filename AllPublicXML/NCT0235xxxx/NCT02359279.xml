  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed test is intended to enable dentists to differentiate between cavitated and
      non-cavitated tooth decay in the areas where teeth are in contact (interproximal surfaces).
      In these areas, dentists cannot visually inspect for caries, and currently bitewing X-rays
      (BWs) only correctly detect the presence of enamel decay 15-25% of the time. This low
      sensitivity can lead to late treatment resulting in unnecessarily large fillings, crowns,
      pain, root canals, and possible later loss of teeth.

    <textblock>
      Tooth sites will be recorded by both tooth number, type of surface (mesial, distal,
      occlusal), cavitated, non-cavitated, healthy. Radiographs will similarly be scored. Although
      contrast agents are classified as drugs this is not a study of drug properties or effect on
      cells since the properties of the agent are already well known and its safety record well
      established. This study will be recording the radiopacity of the contrast agent on healthy
      tooth surfaces, non-cavitated tooth surfaces and cavitated tooth surfaces. The outcome for
      each surface type will be presence or absence of a radiopacity on a radiograph which will be
      made at the one and only visit for each study subject. The radiograph contains the data from
      the intervention (placement of contrast agent) and the outcome will be assessed some weeks
      later after the completion of the data collection.

    <time_frame>Immediately after application of sodium iodide</time_frame>
    <description>The PI will perform the clinical application of the sodium iodide and radiograph the subject. A control radiograph will be taken of tooth crowns before the application of the contrast. Immediately after the contrast application another radiograph will be exposed. If caries is present a lucency will be seen in the control The test radiograph will show either contrast on the tooth surface (non-cavitated) or below the surface (caviiatetd). Rubber impressions will be made of the tooth surfaces and scanned with a laser to provide a 3D replica which will be the gold standard for presence or absence of cavitation. At a later date 3 independent dentists will be provided with blinded radiographs in a randomized order to report the presence or absence of cavitated cries lesions.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must have a minimum of 2 adjacent teeth so that interproximal surfaces of interest are
             in contact and hidden from direct visual examination.

        The occlusal plane plane should be normal so that the interproximal contact regions are
        normal.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant women. A person who has participated in a similar study involving dental
             radiography within the last 12 months.

        Fillings must not be present in the regions of interest.
