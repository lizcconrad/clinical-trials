  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test a study drug called patritumab. Patritumab may work when
      combined with other medications that are approved in the UK for treating Squamous Cell
      Carcinoma of the Head and Neck (SCCHN), called cetuximab, cisplatin or carboplatin. It is
      hoped that patritumab may have some benefit in treating patients with cancer. This study will
      help identify how much patritumab can be given in combination with cetuximab, and cisplatin
      or carboplatin. This study will show how safe and how well tolerated patritumab is when these
      medications are given together.

      The trial will be performed in two &quot;phases&quot; (Periods):

      Period 1: Initial phase in which the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) is determined

      Period 2: Extension phase in which participants who are deriving benefit (stable disease or
      better) will have the opportunity to continue treatment at the discretion of the Investigator

    <description>A titer is a way of expressing concentration.

The titer corresponds to the highest dilution factor that still yields a positive reading.</description>
