      Introduction: Patient safety, risk management, and cultural competency are essential topics
      for healthcare provider mastery in a high stakes, urban academic Labor and Delivery Unit.

      Methods: A prospective cross sectional pilot study was performed with IRB exempt status to
      examine the effect of an internet based educational curriculum on topics including patient
      safety, risk management and cultural competency over 6 months amongst OB/GYN and Family
      Medicine medical students, nurses, and physicians. 76 healthcare providers participated.
      Assessments took place before and after curriculum implementation. Primary outcome measures
      were cultural competency as measured by the Tucker-Culturally Sensitive Health Care Inventory
      (TCSHCI) Provider Form, Pascal Metrics of Patient Safety survey for healthcare providers,
      patient satisfaction measured by the Press Ganey patient survey scores, and poor Labor and
      Delivery Outcomes. The curriculum intervention included five online lectures lasting 30-60
      minutes pertaining to cultural competency, risk management, patient safety, and Team STEPPS
      training.
