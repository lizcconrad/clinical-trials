  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Echocardiography (cardiac ultrasound) is being used more often in the critical care setting
      for management of severe infection (septic shock). Early studies show echocardiography to be
      useful in these patients, but at this time, there are no good clinical trials to justify its
      use.

      Our study goals/objectives are as follows:

        1. To conduct an unblinded, two-group randomized controlled clinical trial to compare an
           echocardiography-guided resuscitation protocol with an Early Goal Directed Therapy
           (EGDT) protocol in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock.

        2. Demonstrate that a sepsis treatment protocol using transthoracic echocardiography and
           other non-invasive assessments of cardiac output will result in more rapid resolution of
           septic shock compared to invasive EGDT.

        3. Demonstrate patients receiving the non-invasive echocardiography protocol will receive
           less administration of intravenous fluid.

    <description>EGDT is currently standard of care in management of septic shock, so assignment to this treatment arm will confer no additional risk above that of standard of care. EGDT utilizes placement of a central venous catheter, an arterial catheter, and administration of intravenous fluid and vasoactive medications. EGDT uses central venous catheter to assess central venous pressure and ScVO2.</description>

    <description>The echo arm also utilizes placement of a central venous catheter, an arterial catheter, and administration of intravenous fluid and vasoactive medications, all of which are interventions found in standard care. The central venous pressure will not be monitored in this arm. Instead, decisions for giving fluids will be directed by the results of Echocardiography. Echocardiography poses no known risk to the patient, and it is non-invasive. The only risk of echocardiography is that of misdiagnosis.</description>
