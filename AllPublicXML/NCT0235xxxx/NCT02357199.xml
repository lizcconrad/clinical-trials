      This study aims to investigate the prevalence of oral infection in chronic renal disease
      patients and to examine whether a focused oral hygiene intervention can reduce oral infection
      leading to reduced systemic inflammatory parameters in chronic renal disease patients in
      hemodialysis, chronic renal disease patients waiting for kidney transplantation, and chronic
      renal disease patients who has been transplanted 1-1½ year previously. The results will be
      compared to a gender- and age-matched healthy control group.

      Aim:

      The aim is to examine if a focused oral care procedure to reduce oral infection will be
      mirrored in reduction of systemic inflammatory parameters in chronic renal disease patients.

      Specific research questions:

      Can oral infection and systemic inflammatory parameters in chronic renal disease patients be
      reduced by 1 month of professional oral care and individual prophylactic instruction and can
      a potential reduction of inflammation be continuously achieved at a 3 months follow-up.

      Study design:

      Randomized, double-blinded (investigator, outcomes assessor), controlled study. For
      Eligibility Criteria and Outcome Measures, please see elsewhere in the ClinicalTrials.gov
      Protocol Registration System.

      Participants:

      A: Hemodialysis patients, inclusion n=34, B: Hemodialysis patients on a kidney transplant
      waiting list, inclusion n=34, C: Patients who have had a kidney transplant (1-1½ years after
      transplantation), inclusion n=34. D: Gender- and age-matched healthy control group.

      Number of included patients is estimated from a hypothesis-generating pilot study, a
      statistical power analysis and the estimated loss to follow-up based on experience from
      previous research projects in the Nephrology Department.

      Intervention and control:

      The intervention consists of professional oral care (addressing periodontal and oral mucosal
      infections, salivary gland dysfunction and caries prevention) and a didactic approach to
      individual instruction in oral hygiene/prophylactic measures performed by a dental hygienist
      at three visits: baseline, 2 weeks after baseline and 1 month after baseline.

      The research data will be registered by a blinded investigator before the first visit at the
      dental hygienist and after 3 months.

      The control group will follow best-clinical-practice procedures currently implemented in the
      hospital.
