  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the safety and best dose of melphalan and bortezomib when given
      prior to an autologous stem cell transplant and to see how well they work in treating
      patients with multiple myeloma. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as melphalan, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Bortezomib may help melphalan work
      better by making cancer cells more sensitive to the drug. Giving chemotherapy before an
      autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant helps kill any cancer cells that are in the
      body and helps make room in the patient's bone marrow for new blood-forming cells (stem
      cells) to grow. After treatment, stem cells are collected from the patient's blood and
      stored. More chemotherapy is then given to prepare the bone marrow for the stem cell
      transplant. The stem cells are then returned to the patient to replace the blood-forming
      cells that were destroyed by the chemotherapy. Giving melphalan together with bortezomib
      prior to autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant may be a better treatment for multiple
      myeloma.

      This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of melphalan and bortezomib followed by a phase II
      study.

      Patients receive melphalan intravenously (IV) continuously on days -5 to -2 and bortezomib IV
      over 3-5 seconds on days -4 and -1. Patients also receive dexamethasone IV on day -1 prior to
      the second dose of bortezomib. Beginning two days after completion of melphalan infusion,
      patients undergo autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Eligible patients may undergo
      a second transplant 2-4 months after completion of the first transplant.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly for at least 1 year and
      then every 3-6 months thereafter.

    <measure>Maximally Tolerable Dose (MTD) of Both Melphalan and Bortezomib as Combination</measure>
    <time_frame>100 days</time_frame>
    <description>MTD is defined as one dose below that which 33% of patients within cohort experienced dose limiting toxicity. Unacceptable toxicity is defined as intractable veno-occlusive disorder, new onset of renal failure requiring dialysis, acute heart failure of New York Heart Association class III/IV, or interstitial pneumonia requiring ventilator management for longer than 3 days or grade 4 neuropathy. A 100-day mortality/toxicity rate of 3% or more is considered unacceptable. Will consider as evidence an observed 100-day mortality/toxicity rate whose lower one-sided 90% confidence bound exceeds 3%.</description>

        <title>Maximally Tolerable Dose (MTD) of Both Melphalan and Bortezomib as Combination</title>
        <description>MTD is defined as one dose below that which 33% of patients within cohort experienced dose limiting toxicity. Unacceptable toxicity is defined as intractable veno-occlusive disorder, new onset of renal failure requiring dialysis, acute heart failure of New York Heart Association class III/IV, or interstitial pneumonia requiring ventilator management for longer than 3 days or grade 4 neuropathy. A 100-day mortality/toxicity rate of 3% or more is considered unacceptable. Will consider as evidence an observed 100-day mortality/toxicity rate whose lower one-sided 90% confidence bound exceeds 3%.</description>

Patients also received dexamethasone IV on day -1 prior to the second dose of bortezomib. Beginning two days after completion of melphalan infusion, patients underwent autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant.</description>
