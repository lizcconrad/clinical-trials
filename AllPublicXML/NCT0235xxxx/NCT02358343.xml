    <textblock>
      Patients whose kidneys fail generally require dialysis treatments to sustain life. The
      ability of patients to make major adjustments in their lives for dialysis is hampered by
      depression that affects almost one-quarter of such individuals. There are no studies that
      have adequately tested whether treatment of depression is effective in dialysis patients and
      if there is any difference between the response to the two most commonly available forms of
      treatment, psychotherapy and anti-depressant drug therapy.

      To fill this important gap in the investigators knowledge, the investigators propose to
      undertake (1) a randomized controlled clinical trial of 200 patients to test whether an
      engagement interview will result in a higher proportion of dialysis patients accepting
      treatment for depression; and (2) a randomized controlled clinical trial of 120 patients to
      determine whether there is any difference in the likelihood of improvement of depressive
      symptoms with psychotherapy or drug therapy among dialysis patients with depression. Patients
      in these studies will be enrolled from among individuals receiving care in 50 dialysis
      facilities in three metropolitan areas - Seattle, Dallas, and Albuquerque. The research
      proposal has been developed with the support of patients, caregivers, and stakeholders to
      ensure that the findings from the study are relevant to them and can be readily implemented
      in day-to-day clinical practice. Hence, the engagement interview and psychotherapy will be
      delivered in a dialysis facility to ease the burden on patients, and the dose of the study
      drug will be changed in partnership with the study participants. In addition to depressive
      symptoms, the effect of treatment on other meaningful outcomes such as fatigue and sleep will
      be determined.

      The two forms of treatment for depression being tested in this clinical trial are very
      different from each other and patients differ with regards to the treatment option preferable
      and/or available to them. Successful completion of the clinical trial will provide patients,
      caregivers, and other stakeholders with the information that they would need when faced with
      a diagnosis of depression in patients undergoing hemodialysis. This will allow patients to
      select evidence-based treatments to improve outcomes that are relevant to them.

      BACKGROUND Patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (HD)
      have to adjust to complex treatment regimens, and experience frequent care transitions. This
      is compounded by a four-fold higher prevalence of comorbid depression than in the general
      population, which is strongly associated with poor patient-centered outcomes. Yet, depression
      is often not diagnosed when present, not treated when identified, and many HD patients are
      reluctant to accept treatment. This is likely a result of lack of high-quality evidence for
      the efficacy of different treatment options for comorbid depression in HD patients.
      OBJECTIVES Conduct an open-label, randomized controlled clinical trial among HD patients with
      comorbid depression to (1) compare the efficacy of an engagement interview with usual care in
      increasing acceptability of treatment (n=200); and (2) compare the efficacy of 12 weeks of
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or anti-depressant drug therapy (sertraline) for reducing
      the severity of depressive symptoms, and other meaningful outcomes (n=120). METHODS HD
      patients in up to 50 dialysis facilities in three different regions (Albuquerque, NM; Dallas,
      TX; Seattle, WA) will be pre-screened for the presence of clinically significant depressive
      symptoms. Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of major depression or dysthymia will be
      randomly assigned to an engagement interview or usual care to determine efficacy in
      increasing acceptability of treatment (n=200). Individuals who agree to treatment will be
      randomly assigned to individual CBT or drug therapy. CBT will be administered in a dialysis
      facility by a trained therapist. Sertraline will be titrated to the maximum tolerated dose
      using Measurement Based Care, a model of shared-decision-making. Patient-reported outcomes
      will be measured by a single assessor for all three sites, blinded to the treatment
      assignment. The primary efficacy measure will be a change in severity of depressive symptoms;
      secondary outcome measures will assess other important patient-reported outcomes such as
      somatic symptom burden, functioning, and adherence with dialysis treatment, diet, and
      medications. The longitudinal evolution of symptoms in patients who refuse to accept any
      treatment either within or outside the clinical trial will also be studied (n=40). PATIENT
      OUTCOMES (PROJECTED) This study will provide answers to three questions faced by HD patients
      with clinically significant depressive symptoms: (1) &quot;Given my preferences, what should I
      expect will happen to me?&quot;; (2) &quot;What are my options, and what are the potential benefits and
      harms of these options?&quot;; and (3) &quot;What can I do to improve the outcomes that are most
      important to me?&quot; Oversight of study will be provided by separate Patient Council and
      Stakeholder Council to align with PCORI's mission of generating high-integrity,
      evidence-based information from research guided by patients, caregivers, and broader health
      care community.

    <description>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a short-term psychotherapy that will focus on how the individual is thinking, behaving, and communicating today rather than on their childhood experience. The therapist will assist the patient in identifying specific distortions (cognitive assessment) and biases in thinking and will provide guidance on how to change this thinking. During the course of intervention, study subjects will undergo assessment of severity of depressive symptoms using Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms - Self-Report (QIDS-SR) every two weeks for the first six weeks (weeks 0, 2, 4, and 6) and every three weeks for the next six weeks (weeks 9 and 12).</description>

    <description>The site investigators will prescribe sertraline drug at a starting dose of 25 mg oral tablets. Dose titration will be implemented using standardized assessments of depressive symptoms and drug side effects; and the research team and the patient make joint decisions to maintain, increase, or decrease the dose. This will help establish the highest effective but tolerable dose tailored for each patient. The QIDS-SR scale will be used to assess the clinical response for dose titration. The FIBSER scale will be used to assess side effects and the degree to which they interfere with day-to-day functions. The participant-specific dose at week 6, up to a maximum of 200 mg/d, will be continued for the remaining 6 weeks.</description>
