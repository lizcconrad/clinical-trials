      This feasibility trial aims at assessing practical issues and feasibility of a future
      randomised controlled trial (RCT) to determine the effectiveness of vibrating vaginal pelvic
      floor training balls for postpartum pelvic floor muscle rehabilitation, at monitoring harms
      of the experimental intervention, and at exploring women´s perspectives on and experiences
      with the interventions and the trial.

      Background: Pelvic floor muscle training after childbirth is recommended to prevent or treat
      urinary incontinence and other pelvic floor problems. A device that is sometimes recommended
      to women in Austria to enhance their pelvic floor muscles are vibrating vaginal pelvic floor
      training balls. To date, only a small study on vibrating balls exists, and it researched
      women with urinary incontinence and not women after childbirth. Therefore, research is needed
      to scientifically objectify the popular claim of these balls´ effectiveness in the postpartum
      period and further evidence based practice.

      Method: The tested study features comprise

        -  recruitment strategies,

        -  inclusion and exclusion criteria,

        -  the necessary number of participants,

        -  the randomisation procedure,

        -  the interventions themselves,

        -  concordance and retention measures,

        -  data collection,

        -  effectiveness outcomes,

        -  a survey of women's views of and experiences,

        -  statistics and content analysis.

      Results: The results of this trial will inform the features and feasibility of a future full
      RCT. It will be concluded that a full RCT to determine the effectiveness of vibrating vaginal
      pelvic floor training balls post partum is feasible as planned, feasible with modifications
      or not feasible. If considered feasible, the results will enable the full study to be planned
      correctly.

    <description>Participants use a vibrating pelvic floor muscle training ball for 12 weeks. The ball is inserted into the vagina and left for 15 minutes daily in the first week, and if well tolerated 30 minutes daily from the second week onwards. To achieve the vibrating effect, the balls are worn while moving - performing everyday tasks or going for a walk.</description>
