      This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab works in treating patients with extensive
      stage small cell lung cancer after completion of combination chemotherapy. Pembrolizumab may
      be effective in controlling small cell lung cancer for a longer period of time in patients
      with responsive or stable disease after completion of combination chemotherapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 defined
      progression-free survival (PFS) in extensive stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients,
      who have complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease following minimum of
      4 cycles of platinum (cisplatin or carboplatin) and etoposide.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess modified PFS in all patients enrolled. II. To assess overall survival of
      patients enrolled on the trial. III. To assess programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1)
      expression in archival tumor tissues and in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and correlate the
      expression to RECIST defined PFS.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat
      every 21 days for up to 24 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then every 12
      weeks.
