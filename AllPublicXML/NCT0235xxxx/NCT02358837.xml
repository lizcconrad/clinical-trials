  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the proposed project we seek to advance the detection and diagnosis of breast cancer in
      an outpatient breast clinic. Novel sonographic approaches will be scrutinized. The first aim
      of this study will be to explore whether there is an advantage of ductosonography over
      conventional breast sonography in detecting and localizing breast lesions by comparing the
      diagnostic accuracy of ductosonography and conventional breast sonography in detecting
      suspicious and unclear sonographic lesions.In Addition, reliability and time requirement of
      ductosonographic examination will be investigated. The second specific aim is to investigate
      the potential of tissue elasticity as a diagnostic marker in solid breast lesions (US-BI-RADS
      3, 4 and 5) by elastosonography. The study design allows investigating the reproducibility of
      the method.

      The Research Project consists of mainly two parts that involve different methodological
      approaches: For the first part, different breast ultrasound techniques will be employed for
      the examination of an unselected population in a regular setting of a breast outpatient
      clinic. The second part includes measuring and characterizing tissue elasticity of breast
      lesions by elastosonography.
