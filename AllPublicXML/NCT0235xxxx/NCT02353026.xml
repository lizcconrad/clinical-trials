    <textblock>
      This is a Phase One study to determine the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose
      of intravenous artesunate in patients with solid tumors. A rapid dose escalation design will
      be used, in which single patients will be enrolled to escalating dose levels until a grade 2
      or higher toxicity occurs during cycle 1. Enrollment will then continue using 3 to 6 patients
      at each dose level until a dose is reached at which 2 or more patients out of 6 experience a
      treatment-related toxicity.

      A rapid dose escalation design will be used, in which single patients will be enrolled to
      each dose level until a grade &gt;/= 2 treatment-related toxicity occurs during cycle 1;
      enrollment then will proceed using a classic 3+ 3 dose escalation design. If the toxicity was
      grade 2, then enrollment will continue on that dose level. If the toxicity was grade 3 or 4,
      then enrollment will continue on one dose level below that dose. Dose escalation with the 3+3
      design will continue until &gt;/= 2 patients out of 6 experience a treatment-related
      dose-limiting toxicity. Then, the maximum tolerated dose and recommended Phase II dose of
      intravenous artesunate will be one dose level below the level at which the toxicities
      occurred.
