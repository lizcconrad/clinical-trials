      This study will provide clinical data in an observational setting. Individuals undergoing
      LSG, and who meet study entry criteria, may be enrolled. LSG procedures will be performed
      according to institutional standard-of-care (SOC) using the study stapler. All study subjects
      will be followed for approximately 4 weeks for safety and outcomes.
