    <textblock>
      This is a 1-month, prospective, multicenter, open-label study in pediatric subjects with
      bilateral middle ear effusion requiring tympanostomy tube placement. Eligible subjects will
      receive a single dose to each ear of 6 mg OTO-201, administered intraoperatively into the
      middle ear through the lumen of the tympanostomy tube (trans-tympanostomy tube TTT). The
      study is designed to characterize safety and any procedural issues associated with TTT drug
      administration of OTO-201.
