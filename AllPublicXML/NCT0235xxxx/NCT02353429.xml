    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study evaluating the activity and the safety of toremifene in patients
      with primary or recurrent sporadic DTs.

      Patients will be enrolled after the histological confirmation of DTs on biopsy Patients will
      start at 60 mg daily and dose-escalate to 180 mg upon progression. Disease assessment will be
      performed by contrast-enhanced MRI or CT scan, pain evaluation by a visual analog scale (VAS)
      every 3 months for the first and second year, twice yearly thereafter. Response will be
      evaluated either by RECIST and/or symptomatic relief.

      This is a prospective study evaluating the activity and the safety of toremifene in patients
      with primary or recurrent sporadic DTs.

      Patients will be enrolled after the histological confirmation of DTs on biopsy performed at
      the investigators institution or after the pathological review of tissue specimen obtained
      via needle biopsy or surgical excision (in case of recurrence) performed elsewhere. A new
      biopsy will be performed if the amount of tissue will not be sufficient for
      immunohistochemical analysis. Patients will start at 60 mg daily and dose-escalate to 180 mg
      upon progression. Disease assessment will be performed by contrast-enhanced MRI or CT scan,
      pain evaluation by a visual analog scale (VAS) every 3 months for the first and second year,
      twice yearly thereafter. Response will be evaluated either by RECIST and/or symptomatic
      relief.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patients (age &gt; 18 years) with primary or locally recurrent, sporadic or FAP
             associated, desmoid fibromatosis

          -  Histologically documented diagnosis of DF

          -  At least one measurable site of disease at CT or MRI scans, which has not been
             previously embolised or irradiated

          -  Progressive disease demonstrated at contrast-enhanced MRI or CT scan by Response
             Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)

          -  Radiologic or clinical evidence of PD in the previous 6 months. Radiologic PD will be
