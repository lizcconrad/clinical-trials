  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study is to investigate the impact that feces mixtures have on the
      peristomal skin when using a standard adhesive.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Six types of patches are tested:

      Patch 1: Standard adhesive with own feces

      Patch 2: Standard adhesive with own feces mixture

      Patch 3: Standard adhesive with simulated feces

      Patch 4: Standard adhesive with simulated feces mixture

      Patch 5: Standard adhesive with buffer (control)

      Patch 6: Standard adhesive with buffer feces mixture (control)

      Each subject is randomized to one of two arms testing three patches on the peristomal skin
      (patch 1, 3 and 5 or patch 2, 4 and 6). Furthermore, within each arm an attempt will be made
      to randomize each of the three patches on the peristomal skin to one of three locations
      surrounding the stoma (upper left, upper right, lower).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Trans Epidermal Water Loss after test of patches.</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 7-10 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Trans Epidermal Water Loss is a standardized non-invasive method for describing the barrier function of the skin. Damage to the skin surface (stratum corneum) will lower the barrier of the skin and thereby increase water loss. This can be used as a measure for the damaging effect of the adhesives to the skin. Trans Epidermal Water Loss is measured by applying a probe to the skin surface and is assessed nine times for each patch after applying the patch: three repeated measurements of the skin covered by the center of the patch (Center), three repeated measurements of the skin in the leakage pocket (Leakage pocket) as well as three repeated measurements of the skin covered by the adhesive (Adhesive).</description>
