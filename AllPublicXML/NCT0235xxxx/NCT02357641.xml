      Examination of probable distinction between cardiac or non- cardiac thoracal disorder via
      echocardiographic myocardial strain analysis

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with cardiac disorder have to undergo time- consuming and expensive examinations
      such as laboratory of cardiac biomarkers or ischemic diagnostic. To save time and money in
      this observational registry the probable distinction between cardiac and non- cardiac
      disorder in patients with vague thoracal disorder and the probability for coronary artery
      disease (determined via Grace Score) is examined via echographic myocardial strain analysis
      in 300 patients retrospectively to establish a cut off value corresponding to acute coronary
      disease also to prevent coronary angiography. Therefore patients undergo echography routinely
      with consecutive evaluation of systolic, diastolic and strain analysis to elevate exact
      statements with reference to deformation of the myocard and its velocity. Several study have
      shown that these strain parameters (circumferential and radial strain) enable vitality and
      ischemic diagnosis and therefore could be eligible for this purpose.

    <description>300 patients with thoracal disorder, cardiac or non- cardiac, are enrolled prospectively to undergo routinely examinations such as clinical and hemodynamic chemistry as well as echocardiography for strain analysis refering to myocardial deformation.
Especially analysis of strain data (circumferential and radial), regional and global left and right ventricular wall movement data and diastolic parameters will be analysed retrospectively to investigate a probable cut off value corresponding to acute coronary disease or non cardiac disorder (Intervention: retrospective echographic myocardial strain analysis refering to acute coronary syndrome).</description>

        300 patients with vague thoracal disorder -cardiac or non cardiac- are enrolled
        prospectively to undergo routinely echography as well as routine examinations such as
        anamnetic, hemodynamic examinations and laboratory. The distinction between non cardiac
        disorder or acute coronary disease (ACS) is offen difficult so that time- consuming and
        expensive ischemic diagnostics or coronary artery angiography will follow. To prevent these
        time consuming or expensive diagnostics retrospectively a cut off value will be determined
        of systolic, diastolic and additionally of circumferential and radial echographic strain
        data analysis corresponding to acute coronary disease.
