  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to demonstrate the performance and safety of the Femtosecond
      laser-assisted anterior capsulotomy and lens fragmentation on human eyes using the FEMTO LDV
      Z8 compared to conventional technique in cataract surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cataract Surgery according to conventional procedure, with the exception of two steps
      (Capsulotomy and Lens Fragmentation) which are performed with a Femtosecond Laser in the
      study group. Used equipment for measurements is the same for both groups and in line with the
      normal equipment used for the conventional cataract treatment (group A) Cataract surgery will
      be performed conventionally, this means the capsulorhexis will be performed manually by a
      hook, and the lens extraction will be done by phacoemulsification. (group B)
