    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether treating upper airway with intranasal
      corticosteroids in children with allergic rhinitis and no asthma may bring favors in reducing
      lower airway inflammation and improving small airway function.

      Type of study :

      This is a prospective randomized,double-blind, placebo-controlled study , to clarity whether
      treating upper airway with intranasal corticosteroids in children with allergic rhinitis may
      bring favors in reducing elevated lower airway inflammation，improving airway reactivity and
      airway resistance.

      Methods :

      The children with allergic rhinitis accompanied lower airway inflammation such as elevated
      percentage of eosinophil in induced sputums and/or higher level of fractional exhaled nitric
      oxide(FeNO) are recruited.By using a random digit table, eligible subjects were randomized
      into one of two groups,to receive budesonide nasal spray (BUD group) or nasal placebo(placebo
      group), 1 spray/nostril, 2 times/day, for three consecutive months observation. The following
      measurements were performed: skin prick test (SPT), peripheral blood cells
      five-classification test, serum total immunoglobulin E (IgE) and specific IgE of common
      inhalant allergens testing, nasal lavage and inflammatory cells classification ，pulmonary
      function test, bronchial provocation test，airway resistance measured by impulse oscillation
      technique. Meanwhile,history of all subjects were collected, visual analogue scale，rhinitis
      symptoms scores and rhinoconjunctivitis quality of life questionnaire (RQLQ) scores were
      evaluated. Symptom scores and laboratory examinations are performed at baseline,4 w,8w and 12
      w after treatment.
