      To determine the affects of Physical Therapists clinical reasoning using thoracic spine
      mobilization for neck pain compared to a standard protocol.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to compare the effects of two commonly used, safe, thoracic
      spine treatments: grade 1-4 as performed by Cleland et. al. and grade 1-4 mobilization to the
      thoracic spine as selected by the Physical Therapist for cervical spine pain. The immediate
      effects of thoracic spine mobilization have been shown to facilitate greater range of motion
      increases in the cervical spine and greater pain decreases within a treatment session and on
      follow-up visits. There is no research utilizing pain threshold perception as an objective
      outcome of these treatments. Only one study compared the two treatment techniques and
      concluded that future research should be completed which includes manual therapy for the
      thoracic spine. (Cleland 2007) If the PT identifies an appropriate patient they will ask if
      they are interested in being a research subject. The Physical Theapist recruiting subjects
      all have completed their Doctor of Physical Therapy Degree and have advanced training in
      manual Physical Therapy. The techniques employed are considered standard practice and are
      defined as entry level skills by the Comission of Accredicdation of Physical Therapy
      Programs. These techniques are typically taught in DPT degree programs.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with Neck Pain

          -  Ages 18 - 60

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Red flags: leg weakness, night pain, history of cancer, upper motor neuron signs,
             infection, tumors, osteoporosis, fracture (Boissonnault, 2011) (Cleland, 2004),
             cervical stenosis, CNS involvement, signs consistent with nerve root compression,
             previous surgery, pending legal action

        The inclusion and exclusion above represent a conservative approach based on combining
        criteria of recent studies in published review articles. (Cross, 2011; Walser, 2009
