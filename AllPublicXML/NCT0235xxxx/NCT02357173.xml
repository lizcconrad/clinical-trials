  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine cigarette smokers' use of electronic cigarettes
      (e-cigarettes), and how use of e-cigarettes affects short term smoking behavior.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study initiation will commence after the first telephone contact (phone pre-screen), at the
      baseline visit. Additional lab visits will occur at days 8, 15, and 22 (visits 2-4). At the
      first study visit, 2/3rds of the participants will be randomly assigned to sample
      e-cigarettes and 1/3rd will not. Participants in the e-cigarette group will be provided with
      sufficient product to sample and use as they wish, but with minimal instruction on purpose
      and level of use (non-use is an outcome). Smokers in the control group will smoke their own
      brand of cigarettes, as they wish, for the duration of the sampling period. All participants
      will engage in ecological momentary assessments, which will be completed 3 times daily for 3
      weeks. In-person follow-up assessments will be conducted at 1, 2, and 3 months after the
      final lab visit (Day 22).

      Overall, each participant will be contacted 8 times: at the phone pre-screening, the 4 lab
      visits, and 3 follow-up visits.
