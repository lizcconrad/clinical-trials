  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of home-based and lab-based
      stretching and active movement rehabilitation on ankle impairments in children with cerebral
      palsy using a portable rehab robot. Children with spastic cerebral palsy are placed into two
      groups, participating in robot-guided passive and active movement training in a research lab
      setting (lab group) or in home setting (home group).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The participants are randomly assigned to the lab group or home group.

      For the lab-based training (lab group), the participation will involve 18 training sessions
      over six weeks with 3 sessions/week. In addition, there are 3 visits for outcome evaluations
      carried out before and after the six-week training, and at six weeks after the multi-week
      training as follow-up.

      For the home-based training (home group), the training will last for six weeks and will take
      place at least three times a week at home, after the participants have been instructed and
      trained on how to use the portable rehabilitation robot properly. Participants will come to
      the research lab for outcome evaluations before, after the six week training, and at follow
      up.

      For the home group, the participants will be initially trained by the research team at the
      lab setting on how to use the rehabilitation robot. The training will be done over the first
      one or two sessions. The research team will go through with the participants and family
      members on how to operate the rehabilitation robot at home. The participants and their family
      members practice using the rehabilitation robot at the lab setting until they feel
      comfortable using the robot independently. Before taking the device home, the participants
      are asked to go through each step of the training without assistance from the research staff.
      After the training, the participants and family member will take the portable rehabilitation
      robot home using their own vehicles and conduct the training at home. Audiovisual interaction
      and instruction can be done through Internet if the participants need help in conducting the
      training. Training data and results saved in the rehabilitation robot, which can be uploaded
      to the server managed by the research team. Training parameters can be adjusted based on the
      progress.

      For both groups, in each of the 18 training sessions, the participant is seated with the foot
      attached to a footplate and leg fixed by a leg-support. The ankle joint will be rotated
      slowly to the joint extreme upward and downward to stretch the joint. The participant is also
      asked to move the joint voluntarily to play videogames on a computer. Each treatment session
      lasts approximately one hour.

      Outcome Evaluations

      Evaluations are done before, after the training treatment sessions, and at the follow-up.
      During the evaluation sessions, the ankle will be moved by the robot to evaluate the passive
      properties including passive range of motion and joint stiffness. The participants will also
      move the ankle voluntarily and their active control ability including active range of motion
      and muscle strength will be evaluated. Clinical examination is done to evaluate clinical
      scales including modified Ashworth scale, selective control Assessment of lower extremity
      (SCALE), balance, and walking ability (distance covered in 6 minutes).
