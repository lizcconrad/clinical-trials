  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess the effects of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) in patients
      with periodontitis during orthodontic-periodontal treatment for 12 months on the following
      aspects: (1) Effects on periodontal status; (2) Effects on alveolar bone remodeling; (3)
      Effects on cervical dentin sensitivity; (4) Effects on pain and quality of life.

      To eliminate any bias, the investigators will initially hypothesize that there is no
      difference in periodontal status, jawbone remodeling, tooth sensitivity, pain and quality of
      life in patients having teeth with chronic periodontitis and receiving LLLT with orthodontic
      treatment versus teeth undergoing orthodontic treatment without incorporation of LLLT.

    <textblock>
      On the basis of the investigators' pilot study results, 35 patients with chronic
      periodontitis will be recruited and initially treated for inflammation. Using a randomized
      split-mouth design,the teeth in experimental (laser) group will receive LLLT while the teeth
      in the control (placebo) group will receive no laser treatment. The effects of LLLT in
      orthodontic-periodontal treatment on periodontal inflammation control, jawbone remodeling,
      reduction of tooth sensitivity, pain relief and quality of life will be investigated.

    <description>The test teeth will receive LLLT using a 940 nanometer diode laser (EZLASE; BIOLASE Technology Inc., Irvine, CA, USA) with output power of 330 milliwatt. The experimental side was irradiated for 30 s in two sessions, delivering an energy density of 7 Joules per square centimeter.</description>
