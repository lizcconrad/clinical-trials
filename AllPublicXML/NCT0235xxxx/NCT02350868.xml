      The Dose Escalation Phase will determine the MTD of MPT0E028 and evaluate its safety and
      tolerability, PK, PD, and preliminary clinical effects; the subsequent Dose Confirmation
      Phase will be a cohort expansion at or below the MTD (i.e., an RP2D) of MPT0E028.

         18. Any severe, acute, or chronic medical or psychiatric condition, or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study
             drug administration, may interfere with the informed consent process and/or with
             compliance with the requirements of the study, or may interfere with the
             interpretation of study results and, in the Investigator's opinion, would make the
             subject inappropriate for entry into this study.
