  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether pl-vegf165 (Neovasculgen) is effective in
      the treatment of digital ulcers related to secondary Raynaud's phenomenon associated with
      systemic scleroderma

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open, comparing clinical trial assessing the therapeutic efficacy of
      pl-vegf165 (Neovasculgen) in treating scleroderma-associated Raynaud's syndrome. Each patient
      of clinical group will undergo several intramuscular injections with a treatment dose of
      pl-vegf165 (Neovasculgen) in hand where digital ulcers locate. In the control group patients
      will receive only standard of care without gene therapy drug.

      Study participants at the first study visit will complete study questionnaires, their hands
      will be assessed clinically for digital ulceration, and their hands will undergo non-invasive
      capillaroscopy. After this initial assessment, the patients of clinical group will undergo
      intramuscular injections of pl-vegf165 (Neovasculgen) in a hand altered with digital ulcers.

      Patient will report the severity of their Raynaud's symptoms weekly over the six month study
      period. At three month post-injection, the patient will complete study questionnaires, their
      hands will be assessed clinically for digital ulceration, and their hands will undergo
      non-invasive capillaroscopy. At six months post-injection, the patient will again complete
      study questionnaires, their hands will be assessed clinically for digital ulceration, and
      their hands will undergo non-invasive capillaroscopy.

    <description>Neovasculgen is an original gene construction that contains supercoiled plasmid DNA (1.2 mg) that encodes pCMV-vegf165 as the active substance. The drug will be supplied to the study centre as a sterile lyophilisate that will be then dissolved in 2 ml of water for injections immediately prior to administration. The drug will be administered intramuscularly (interosseous muscles of hand) at 4-5 injection sites in the dorsal surface of the hand.</description>
