      Evaluation of the EzT in comparison with the endotracheal tube (ETT) for its use during
      general anesthesia.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a recent paper suggesting that general anesthesia with the EzT is feasible and by no
      means worse than anesthesia with a conventional ETT, and there is little but growing evidence
      that narcosis with this SAD can be continued during general anesthesia. This brings up
      several potential benefits: The larger balloons of the EzT are less traumatic to the mucosal
      tissue compared to a conventional ETT or to a laryngeal mask. Since the insertion of the EzT
      can be performed without using a laryngoscope, this also reduces tissue damage and tooth
      injuries caused by a laryngoscope. Also, It has been demonstrated that a similar SAD - the
      Combitube - can be placed by anesthesiologists with relatively little formal training and
      that ventilation during elective surgery is feasible. However, such detailed data are missing
      for the EzT, with only smaller, monocenter-studies available. The next logical step was
      therefore to systematically evaluate the EzT beyond its purpose as a rescue device in a
      prospective, randomized multicenter-study to evaluate the use of the EzT in comparison with
      the ETT during general anesthesia.

      Methods 400 patients with ASA status I-II scheduled for elective surgery in 4 centers were
      randomized to either the EzT group (n=200) or the ETT group (n=200).
