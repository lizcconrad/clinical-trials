      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy of lanreotide on locally evolving
      and/or metastatic MCC in a national prospective multicentre phase II study (centres belonging
      to the skin cancer task force of the French Society of Dermatology namely &quot;Groupe de
      Cancérologie Cutanée de la Société Française de Dermatologie&quot;). This one-arm study, for which
      the primary endpoint is overall response to lanreotide, will follow an A'Hern plan in one
      step (A'Hern RP. Sample size tables for exact single-stage phase II designs. Stat Med 2001,
      20:859-66) with main evaluation at 12 weeks on a population of 35 patients. The investigators
      make assumption that a 40% success rate at 3 months would be desirable, but if it was 20% or
      less the treatment would be unacceptable. It gives a trial size of 35 patients with a cut-off
      of 12 patients. Over 12 patients lanreotide will be considered as effective.

      The lanreotide treatment (Somatuline LP 120 mg injected subcutaneously every 28 days) will be
      provided by IPSEN Pharma laboratory. An ancillary immunohistochemistry study on somatostatine
      receptors 2,3,5, dopamine receptors 1,2 and polyomavirus MCPyV will bring new data on this
      neuroendocrine tumour and potentially provide new therapeutic perspectives.

      The results of this study may :

        -  determine whether somatostatin analogues may help to treat locally advanced and/or
           metastatic MCC;

        -  address whether there is a correlation between positive SPECT-CT (octreoscan) assessment
           and therapeutic response to lanreotide;

        -  evaluate the place of TEP-CT and SPECT-CT for MCC evaluation/staging;

        -  evaluate in future studies, with the ancillary data, other analogues or hybrid
           molecules;

        -  consider, if positive results are obtained from this study, somatostatin analogues as
           adjuvant treatment after surgery of primary MCC.

      The efficacy will be considered as success if patient have a positive response to lanreotide.

      Primary criterion Positive response at 3 months will be defined according to the RECIST 1.1
      criteria (clinical and TDM evaluation will be done at 3 months): complete response (CR) or
      partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) at 3 months.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Assessment of the primary criterion at M6, M9, M12, M18 and M24

        -  Description of the overall survival and time to progression

        -  Assessment of the efficacy of the following radiological exams for staging the disease:
           SPECT-CT and TEP-CT

        -  Description of the correlation of SPECT-CT results (positivity or negativity) and
           response to treatment, and the correlation of TEP-CT results and response to treatment

        -  Description of the safety and tolerability of lanreotide in this study

      Population and Methods

      Experimental plan French national prospective multicentre phase II one-arm study. This
      one-arm study, for which the primary endpoint is overall response to lanreotide, will follow
      an A'Hern plan in one step.
