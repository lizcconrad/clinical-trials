  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have previously studied a group of young children with T1D using brain MRI,
      age-appropriate neurocognitive testing and continuous glucose monitoring, followed for 18
      months. The investigators observed significant differences in gray matter volumes and white
      matter microstructure in the children with diabetes as compared to controls. These
      differences appeared to increase over time, with slower rates of brain growth in the T1D
      group (Mazelli, et al, Diabetes 2014; Barnea-Goraly, et al, Diabetes Care 2014; Mauras, et
      al, Diabetes 2015). In this new protocol the investigators will include the same children
      with T1D and healthy controls previously studied and recruit new similar subjects to replace
      those lost by attrition. The investigators will be using structural and functional brain MRI,
      neurocognitive testing and measures of glycemic control, to determine if changes in the brain
      persist or worsen over longitudinal follow up, and whether these changes are associated with
      measures of glycemic control and neurocognitive metrics as these children grow and progress
      through puberty.

      Study participation will last about 2 to 2 1/12 years and will include a brain MRI without
      sedation, as well as a functional MRI and neurocognitive testing. The children with T1D will
      wear a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), will follow up every 3 months and will be asked to
      wear the CGM each time. The structural and functional MRI and neurocognitive testing will be
      repeated 2 yrs from baseline.

      The healthy controls will also undergo MRI and cognitive testing as well as have a blood
      sample at baseline and after 2 years.

      Parents of newly recruited subjects will also have abbreviated IQ testing.

    <description>Structural MRIs of children with T1 diabetes will be compared to age- and sex-matched, non-diabetic healthy controls. We will investigate whether these changes are associated with measures of glycemic control and neurocognitive metrics as these children grow and progress through puberty. The present cohorts (T1D and controls) of young children will be followed for 2 more years with similar studies repeated 2 years apart. Overall glycemic profiles will continue to be obtained every 3 months longitudinally between scans with CGM and HbA1c for children with Type 1 Diabetes.</description>
