    <textblock>
      This is a post-approval, multicenter, prospective, non-randomized, open-label, clinical study
      to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the LAP-BAND® AP System in a lower obese
      population (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 and &lt; 40 kg/m2) with one or more obesity-related comorbidity up to
      10 years after implantation.

      FDA post-approval study designed to collect prospective data in a real-world setting to
      evaluate long-term safety and effectiveness of the LAP BAND® System in patients with a BMI of
      ≥ 30 kg/m2 and &lt; 40 kg/m2 and one or more comorbid conditions. The Apollo-001 Study is a
      prospective, 10 year, multicenter study of patients who have decide to undergo implantation
      of the LAP-BAND AP® system. Outcomes include device explants, changes in weight, comorbid
      condition status, device- and procedure-related AEs, and reoperations.
