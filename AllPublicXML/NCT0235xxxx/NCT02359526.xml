        Chronic DME patients considered insufficiently responsive to available therapies (laser,
        anti-VEGF) with or without intravitreal corticosteroid therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults (≥18 years) with chronic DME;

          -  Patients considered as insufficiently responsive as defined as having underwent other
             previous treatments, including at least 3 anti-VEGF injections in the last 6 months,
             and the following:

               1. Mean central foveal thickness (central subfield thickness) ≥ 290 um in women and
                  ≥ 305 um in men in Zeiss Cirrus OR ≥ 305 um in women and ≥ 320 um in men in
                  Heidelberg Spectralis, in the study eye as measured using SD-OCT;

               2. Vision impairment (20/50 to 20/400 using Snellen visual acuity equivalent)
                  related to DME;

               3. If in the Investigator's opinion a further improvement is possible.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  IOP &gt; 21 mmHg at screening (day -14) in the study eye.

          -  Historical rise in IOP &gt; 25 mmHg following treatment with an intravitreal
             corticosteroid in the study eye.

          -  Use of ≥ 2 active agents as IOP-lowering medications to control IOP at screening in
             the study eye.

          -  Vitreomacular traction in DME and opaque media in the study eye.

          -  Severe proliferative diabetic retinopathy requiring pan retinal photocoagulation in
             the study eye.

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women.

          -  Active angiographic central macular ischaemia before baseline in the study eye.

          -  Pan retinal photocoagulation or cataract surgery 3 months before baseline in the study
             eye.

          -  Presence of pre-existing glaucoma, active or suspected ocular or periocular infection
             and/or hypersensitive to the active agent or to one of the excipients.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant UNLESS they are: using a highly effective method of birth control.
