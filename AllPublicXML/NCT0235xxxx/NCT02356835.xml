  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 10-week, randomized, controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the
      APT001 plasma and nitric oxide treatment in subjects with a diabetic foot ulcer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 80 subjects will be randomized by computer to receive equally either sham
      therapy or plasma / nitric oxide treatments topically. The nitric oxide / plasma treatment
      will be delivered from 11.5 to 15 centimeters from the wound surface for 10 seconds per cm2
      of wound size. Subjects will be evaluated for efficacy and safety on a regular basis with
      clinical observations. The wounds of both groups will be treated with sharp debridement as
      determined by the site Investigator. A collagen dressing, a non-adherent dressing, and an
      absorptive dressing will be applied to the wound after either the study therapy or the sham
      therapy.

      For an initial safety evaluation in patients with DFU, the first ten patients randomized will
      be limited to wound size of 7 cm2 or less and their wounds will be assessed 2-4 days after
      each treatment session. Following completion of the final assessment in these 10 patients,
      data will be submitted to FDA for review and approval before opening the enrolment for the
      remaining patients.

    <description>The APT001 is a medical device that generates a plasma flow containing nitric oxide intended to be applied topically to wound sites. The nitric oxide / plasma flow will be directed at the wound site and surrounding skin at a distance of 11.5 to 15 centimeters from the skin surface. Dose will be 10 seconds / cm2 wound surface area. Administration of the therapy will include a 2 cm border around the defined edges of the wound site.</description>
