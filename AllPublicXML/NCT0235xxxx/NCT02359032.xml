      The purpose of this study is evaluate the safety and tolerability of single and multiple
      ascending oral doses of ASP6858. This study will also evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      ASP6858 and its metabolites as well as the effect of food to the PK of ASP6858. The study
      will also evaluate the pharmacodynamics of ASP6858.

      This study has 2 parts: Part 1 is a placebo-controlled, single ascending dose study where
      male only subjects will be residential for 5-8 days (Part 1 will also include an open-label,
      food effect section); and Part 2 is a placebo-controlled, randomized, 2-way crossover,
      multiple ascending dose study where male and female subjects will be residential for 14-17
      days for each treatment period. There will be a washout period between the 2 periods in Part
      2.
