    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to understand why the regeneration of the cutaneous sensory nerve
      fibers is poor in post-burn scar.

      The presence or the lack of several molecular factors known to regulate neuronal cell
      development will be evaluate and compared within biopsies from healthy skin and post-burn
      scar.

    <description>To evaluate the differences of expression of genes coding for regulating proteins of the innervation on samples of healthy skins and post-burn scar. These biopsies will be removed from post-burn patients (at least one year after burn) and allowing the comparison between conflicting dermatomes: a healthy dermatome and a formerly burned dermatome</description>
