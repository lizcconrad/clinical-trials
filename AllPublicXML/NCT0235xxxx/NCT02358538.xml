      To evaluate the efficacy of open-label ganaxolone as adjunctive therapy for uncontrolled
      seizures in female children with PCDH19 mutation and other rare genetic epilepsies in an
      open-label proof-of-concept study.

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this proof-of-concept study is to evaluate ganaxolone as adjunctive therapy
      for uncontrolled seizures in female children with PCDH19 mutations and other rare genetic
      epilepsies. After establishing baseline seizure frequency, qualifying subjects will enter the
      study and be treated with open-label ganaxolone for up to six months.
