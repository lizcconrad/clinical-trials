  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is among the most common childhood-onset
      psychiatric disorders, with a negative and long-lasting impact on academic achievement,
      social integration and quality of life. In recent years, the efficacy of non-pharmacological
      treatments for ADHD, such as neurofeedback training (NF) and computerized cognitive training
      (CCT), has been at the centre of research. Although an increasing number of well-designed
      studies have shown that both methods may improve ADHD core symptoms according to parents'
      ratings, the underlying mechanisms are still a matter of debate. Teachers often report
      smaller improvements, if any. This has been explained by their lesser involvement in the
      training. It remains questionable, however, whether other factors may also account for this
      effect and whether methods other than placebo control may be applied in order to demonstrate
      the specificity and efficacy of NF and CCT.

      The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate and compare the efficacy of two different
      computer-based treatment methods for children and adolescents with ADHD, namely NF and CCT,
      and to examine the impact of different treatment settings, with half of the participants
      being trained in a clinical setting and the other half at school. The investigators want to
      show that is feasible to implement NF and CCT in a school setting and that both methods,
      conducted either at school or in a clinical setting, may lead to significant improvements of
      ADHD symptoms as well as to specific and differential effects. Besides the differential
      impact of the settings on informant ratings, the investigators will evaluate the effects of
      the training methods on neuropsychological and electrophysiological outcome. Classroom
      behavior of the children before and after the training will be evaluated by trained observers
      not informed on treatment assignments and settings.

    <description>In neurofeedback training, EEG-activity is visualized and fed back to the participant online on a computer screen. Successful regulation is rewarded by bonus points. The aim is to gain control over one's brain activity and to be able to switch to or to maintain a more wakeful, alert or focussed state.</description>

    <description>In computerized cognitive training, impaired neuropsychological functions, such as inhibition, working memory, distractibility, are directly trained by adaptive computerized software programs. We use training programs from a scientifically based training system for patients presenting problems with sustained, focussed or selective attention, working memory, inhibition, processing speed. Good performance / improvements are rewarded with bonus points.</description>
