    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Two symptomatic episodes of typical AFl (or chronic atrial flutter) during the
             one-year period prior to enrollment. This may include typical AFl occurring while
             receiving anti-arrhythmic drug (AAD) therapy for non-AFl tachyarrhythmia, including
             atrial fibrillation (AF).

          -  At least one episode of typical (clockwise or counterclockwise) atrial flutter
             documented by 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) within 6 months prior to enrollment.

          -  Subject has been diagnosed with symptomatic AFl

          -  Subject is at least 18 and ≤75 years of age.

          -  Subject is able and willing to give informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Intra-cardiac thrombus has not been eliminated in subjects exposed to less than 4
             weeks of therapeutic anticoagulation and a TEE (trans-esophageal echocardiogram)
             and/or CT did not conclusively rule out thrombus

          -  Subject developed persistent AF at least once in history (electrical or
             pharmacological cardioversion after 48h or episode duration &gt;7 days).

        Subject had any previous left atrial ablation.

          -  Subject had any previous cardiac surgery, e.g. prosthetic valves, except in the case
             of an isolated coronary bypass surgery performed more than three months prior to the
             procedure.

          -  Subject has permanent pacemaker or defibrillator implant.

          -  Subject has 2° type II, 3° degree atrioventricular (AV) block or left/right bundle
             branch block pattern

          -  Subject has unstable angina pectoris.

          -  Subject has history of previous myocardial infarction (MI) or percutaneous
             intervention during the last three months or planned in the next 3 months.

        Subject has symptomatic carotid stenosis.

          -  Subject has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with detected pulmonary hypertension
             or any other evidence of significant lung disease.

          -  Subject has any contraindication for oral anticoagulation.

          -  Subject has any history of previous transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke.

          -  Subject has known intra-cardiac thrombus formation.

          -  Subject has any significant congenital heart defect corrected or not (except for
             patent foramen ovale that is allowed).

          -  Subject has evidence of congestive heart failure (NYHA class II, III or IV) in sinus
             rhythm.

          -  Subject has hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

          -  Subject has abnormal long or short QT interval, signs of Brugada syndrome, known
             inheriting ion channel disease on the family, arrhythmogenic right ventricular
             dysplasia.

          -  Subject has sarcoidosis.

          -  Subject has myxoma.

          -  Subject has thrombocytosis (platelet count &gt; 600,000 / μl) or thrombocytopenia
             (platelet count &lt;100,000 / μl).

          -  Subject has any untreated or uncontrolled hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism.

          -  Subject has renal dysfunction with glomerular filtration rate &lt; 60 ml/min/1.72m2.

          -  Subject has a reversible causes for AF like alcoholism.

          -  Subject is a pregnant woman or woman of childbearing potential not on adequate birth
             control: only woman with a highly effective method of contraception [oral
             contraception or intra-uterine device] (who must have a negative pregnancy test within
             1 week of randomization) or sterile woman can be enrolled.

          -  Subject is a breastfeeding woman.

          -  Subject has an active systemic infection.

          -  Subject is unwilling or unable to comply fully with study procedures and follow-up due
             to any disease condition, which can raise doubt about compliance and influencing the
             study outcome especially any kind of cancer requiring ongoing in-hospital treatment,
             severe bleeding in history or a suspected pro-coagulant state.

          -  Legal incapacity or evidence that a subject cannot understand the purpose and risks of
             the study or inability to comply fully with study procedures and follow up.

          -  Subject has a life expectancy of ≤ 1 year.

          -  Subject is participating in any other clinical study
