             required

          -  Male or female over the age of 21 years at the time of surgery

          -  Undergone primary partial knee arthroplasty as unilateral arthroplasty or bilateral

             roentgenogram

          -  Vascular insufficiency, muscular atrophy, neuromuscular disease

          -  Incomplete or deficient soft tissue surrounding the knee

          -  Charcot's disease
