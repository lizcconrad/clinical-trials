  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility of an individual psychological and
      physical symptom intervention, called Emotion And Symptom-focused Engagement (EASE), to
      reduce traumatic stress and physical symptom burden in individuals newly diagnosed with acute
      leukemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study involves the pilot-testing of a newly developed, brief manualized individual
      psychotherapy and physical symptom control intervention, called Emotion And Symptom-focused
      Engagement (EASE), to reduce traumatic stress and physical symptom burden in individuals
      newly diagnosed with acute leukemia. The purpose of this study is to conduct a two-arm
      randomized pilot trial (RPT) to test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy
      of EASE against usual care (UC) for the reduction of traumatic stress and physical symptom
      burden in patients with acute leukemia. Usual care for individuals with acute leukemia
      treated at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre includes referral for non-standardized, and
      primarily instrumental, psychosocial care and palliative care service as needed.

      The design will be an unblinded RPT consisting of two conditions (EASE and UC), with a
      baseline assessment and follow-ups at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. The trial will take place at the
      Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network; a comprehensive cancer center in
      Toronto, Canada. Participants will be newly diagnosed with acute leukemia, within one month
      of diagnosis and/or admission to hospital for treatment with curative intent.
