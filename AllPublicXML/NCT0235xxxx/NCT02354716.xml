      The purpose of this study is to investigate the use of a functional luminal imaging probe to
      characterize benign esophageal luminal strictures before and after dilation and identify
      predictors of response to therapy. Patients will be evaluated during endoscopy using
      functional luminal imaging (EndoFLIP; Crospon Medical Devices, Galway, Ireland) to
      characterize the geometry of benign luminal esophageal narrowing before and after dilation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To date there is no effective way to objectively characterize and predict response to
      endoscopic dilation of luminal strictures of the GI tract. Endoscopic dilation allows
      effective remediation of benign esophageal and upper GI tract strictures. Stricture dilation
      is performed after the stricture diameter is crudely gauged by the endoscopist. Stricture
      characteristics are based on the severity of symptoms and appearance. A stricture may be
      graded as mild, moderate, severe and as to whether or not the endoscope is able to traverse
      the luminal narrowing. By precisely measuring the diameter and length of a stricture, the
      endoscopist can know exactly what type of dilation is necessary. Benign esophageal strictures
      may also be refractory to dilation and thus require multiple sessions, prior to achieving
      successful remediation. The purpose of this study is to investigate the use of a functional
      luminal imaging probe to characterize benign esophageal luminal strictures before and after
      dilation and identify predictors of response to therapy. Patients will be evaluated during
      endoscopy using functional luminal imaging (EndoFLIP; Crospon Medical Devices, Galway,
      Ireland) to characterize the geometry of benign luminal esophageal narrowing before and after
      dilation. The study will include patients with strictures referred for endoscopic dilation
      for the following indications: radiation induced strictures, peptic strictures, RFA induced
      strictures, EMR induced strictures, eosinophilic esophagitis, Zenkers diverticulum, and
      strictures related to surgical anastomoses. In patients with benign refractory esophageal
      strictures referred for endoluminal prostheses EndoFLIP will be used to characterize the
      stricture prior to stent placement.

    <description>Patients will undergo the clinically indicated procedure for benign esophageal luminal narrowing remediation. Before undergoing clinically indicated esophageal therapy, measurements of the luminal narrowing using EndoFLIP will be obtained to identify potential predictors of response to endoscopic therapy. These measurements will included luminal diameter, length of narrowing and narrowing distensibility and will be obtained before and after delivery of the clinically indicated endoscopic therapy.</description>

    <description>To define the role of a functional luminal imaging probe (EndoFLIP) in benign upper GI luminal narrowing. EndoFlip measurement of the cross sectional area of the narrowing will be obtained prior to and after endoscopic dilation. Patients will follow up for repeat endoscopy and dilation if indicated. EndoFLIP measurements will be made again before and after dilation. The use of EndoFlip may offer insight in to the clinical and endoscopic predictors of successful stricture dilation.</description>

    <description>The Endolumenal Functional Lumenal Imaging Probe Imaging System is a technology developed to measure the dimensions &amp; function of a variety of hollow organs throughout the body. Since receiving FDA clearance for sale in the United States EndoFLIP has been used in a variety of clinical applications. We intend to investigate the potential clinical applications of EndoFLIP in the upper GI tract in patients with esophageal stenoses who require endoscopic therapy for benign esophageal strictures. The use of EndoFLIP to characterize a stricture pre- &amp; post- dilation may offer insight in to the clinical and endoscopic predictors of successful stricture dilation, &amp; what characteristics determine &amp; predict refractory &amp; recurrent strictures.</description>
