    <textblock>
      Many Service members (SM) experience executive dysfunction associated with mild traumatic
      brain injury symptom complex (mTBI-sc), for which they receive cognitive rehabilitation.
      Cognitive rehabilitation (CR) for executive dysfunction often involves metacognitive strategy
      instruction (MSI) to help patients self-regulate their behavior though a goal management
      process - identifying a goal, anticipating performance problems, generating possible
      solutions, self-monitoring performance during the activity, recognizing maladaptive task
      strategies, stopping and then modifying real-time task behavior by choosing an alternate
      strategy. MSI alone often does not result in improved daily functioning because it requires
      conscious cognitive oversight to employ (which is difficult for people with executive
      dysfunction) and it presumes that simply establishing goals propels goal-directed action,
      when for many people, this is not so. Social psychologists report that people who set
      implementation intentions (if-then statements that link specific situational cues with
      specific goal actions) are more likely to perform goal actions than those who only set goal
      intentions. Implementation intentions are believed to be effective because they enable people
      to switch from conscious-effortful reflective action control to automatic, reflexive action
      control associated with selected situational cues. A team of researchers from the Courage
      Kenny Research Center (CKRC), Traumatic Brain Injury Center at Fort Campbell, KY (TBIC-FC),
      and Neurofunctional Research and Consulting has developed a brief CR intervention to teach SM
      with mTBI-sc to set implementation intentions called ACTION (AutomatiC iniTiation of
      IntentiONs) sequence training. The purpose of this pilot study to evaluate: 1) the
      practicality of instructional methods used to teach SM with mTBI-sc to perform the ACTION
      sequence and 2) the efficacy of ACTION sequence training in achieving personal goals and
      performance on a task that challenges executive function using a small randomized controlled
      trial. If the results are positive, a larger study would be conducted to determine the impact
      of ACTION sequence training on SM performance on military-relevant tasks and goals.

      The primary aims of this feasibility study are as follows:

      Aim 1: Finalize ACTION training curriculum; develop manuals; field test .

        -  Work with implementation intentions research expert and a military consultant to develop
           a training task gradation schema which informs the identification and modification of
           existing implementation intentions training tasks so that they have military face
           validity.

        -  Finalize the adherence support methods and other training worksheets and materials.

        -  Field test training tasks and adherence support methods on small cohort of civilians
           with mTBI-sc from CKRC to assure feasibility.

        -  Finalize ACTION sequence training manuals; assure intra-rater and inter-rater
           reliability for scoring quality of implementation intentions statements.

      Aim 2: Evaluate ACTION sequence training instructional methods (the extent to which SM with
      mTBI-sc are able to learn to establish IF-THEN statements that have the potential to trigger
      automatic enactment of goal-actions and the extent to which SM with mTBI-sc report the
      training experience as satisfactory and beneficial).

        -  Enroll up to 28 participants in the study (SM with mTBI-sc who are referred to MSI at
           TBIC-FC).

        -  Evaluate whether or not participants can correctly craft implementation intentions by
           using a rubric to score implementation intentions developed by participants during
           clinic sessions and during home practice; administer participation satisfaction survey
           at posttest.

      Aim 3: Test the efficacy of ACTION sequence training by evaluating the extent to which
      training 1) improves SM's with mTBI-sc ability to perform a complex test of executive
      function (e.g. Hotel Test) and 2) advances progress towards self-identified goals in daily
      life (via Canadian Occupational Performance measure [COPM] and Goal Attainment Scaling [GAS])
      as compared to a control condition. Additionally, determine level of adherence to completing
      daily homework practice ans assigned prospective memory tasks.

        -  Collect pre-post data on the Hotel Test, COPM, GAS on all participants.

        -  Collect data on completion of homework assignments

        -  Collect data on completion of prospective memory tasks

    <description>Implementation Intention training will include:
Demonstration and practice using examples and personal goals identified at first session. Worksheets will be provided to practice IF-THEN statements to set Implementation Intentions. Additionally, at the end of each session, the participant will be instructed to perform and event based or time based task. The objective is to see if those receiving II training are more likely to carry out the assigned task than those who do not receive II training. They will also be expected to practice II at least 5 days/week using personal goals.</description>
