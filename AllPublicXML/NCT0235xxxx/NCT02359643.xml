  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute multi-system vasculitis syndrome of unknown etiology
      occurring mostly in infants and children younger than 5 years of age. In developed countries,
      it is the leading cause of acquired heart disease in children. However, KD remains a
      mysterious disease.

      Single high dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG, 2gm/kg) and aspirin are standard treatment
      for KD. Aspirin have been prescribed in treatment of KD for decade even earlier than usage of
      IVIG. High dose aspirin mainly act as anti-inflammation, while low dose aspirin as
      anti-platelet. IVIG may play most of the role of anti-inflammation in acute stage of KD.
      Hsieh et al. reported that KD without high dose aspirin had the same treatment response after
      IVIG. Therefore it is still unclear about the necessarily of high dose aspirin in acute stage
      of KD.

      This study was conduct to investigate the role of high dose aspirin in acute stage of KD via
      a multi-center randomized control trail, and we plan to achieve the followings till year
      2017:

        1. Enroll 300 KD patients from multiple medical centers . Randomize group patients as group
           1: with high dose aspirin (more than 30/mg/kd/day) until fever subsided and shift to low
           dose aspirin (3-5mg/kg/day, N=150); and group 2: without high dose aspirin during acute
           febrile stage, only use low dose aspirin (N=150).

        2. Compare data including fever days, admission duration, laboratory data (CBC/DC, GOT/GPT,
           BUN/Cr, Alb, ESR, CRP, 2D echo), IVIG treatment response and CAL formation rate
           (followed at least 1 year).

      All subjects are children who fulfilled the criteria for KD and who are treated with IVIG at
      each hospital after informed contents are obtained. The patients are initially treated with a
      single dose of IVIG (2 g/kg) during a 12-hour period.

      Principal clinical features of KD that occur in the acute stage within 5 days of the onset of
      fever will be recorded. After the informed content from the parents, PB samples will be
      obtained before IVIG treatment (pre-IVIG, KD1), within 3 days after complete initial IVIG
      treatment (post-IVIG, KD2) as the acute stage samples and then 1 month, 6 month and 12 month
      followed-up as subacute/convalescent stage samples. CAL was defined as the internal diameter
      being at least 3 mm of the coronary artery (4 mm if the subject was over the age of 5 years)
      or the internal diameter of a segment at least 1.5 times as large as that of an adjacent
      segment by echocardiogram.

      High dose aspirin will be given (&gt; 30 mg/kg/day) until the fever subsided at group 1
      randomly. After fever subside (&lt;38C, for 48 hours) low-dose aspirin (3-5 mg/kg/day) will be
      prescribed for all patients until all signs of inflammation resolved in both group 1 and 2.
