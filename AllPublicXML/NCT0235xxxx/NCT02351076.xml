      The aim of the study is to compare correlation for right to left shunts (mainly patent
      foramen ovale) detection for three methods-transesophageal echo as a gold standard,
      transcranial doppler with contrast agent (microbubbles) and new method- Flow detection system
      ( Cardiox TM) in young stoke patients ( age under 55 years).

      The aim of the study is to compare correlation for right to left shunts (mainly patent
      foramen ovale) detection for three methods-transesophageal echo as a gold standard,
      transcranial doppler with contrast agent (microbubbles) and new method- Flow detection system
      ( Cardiox TM) in young stoke patients ( age under 55 years). Flow detection syst√©m is a new
      method for right to left shunt detection comfortable for patients, not dependent on
      experienced examinator and only one method with exact valsalve maneuver measurement. Right to
      left shunt could be important etiology of cardioembolization in young stroke patient
      population, therefore screening for this condition is recommended in all young patient after
      ischemic stroke especially with unclear etiology. Flow detection systes seams to be ideal
      screening method for this patients.
