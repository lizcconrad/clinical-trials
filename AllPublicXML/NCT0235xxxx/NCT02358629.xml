      Trial is to evaluate the safety and performance of the NovaCross™micro-catheter in respect to
      providing additional guidewire support that is expected to allow easier crossing of
      femoropopliteal and infra-popliteal Chronic Total Occlusion (CTO) lesion. The procedure will
      be conducted on a patient diagnosed with a CTO in a peripheral vessel that requires
      revascularization.

      This is an open label, single center, prospective, first in man pilot study in which the
      investigational device, NitiLoop micro-catheter, will be tested in up to 15 patients with
      symptomatic peripheral arterial occlusive disease scheduled to undergo CTO in an anterograde
      approach.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adult aged 25-80

          2. Patient understands and has signed the study informed consent form.

          3. Patient has symptomatic peripheral artery disease (PAD) requiring endovascular
             revascularization of a CTO, evidenced by angiography, computed tomography or magnetic
             resonance angiography.

          4. Patient has an occluded femoropopliteal or infra popliteal artery

          5. Target femoropopliteal or infra-popliteal vessel is ≥ 2.5 mm and ≤5 mm in diameter.

          6. Patient has Rutherford-Becker Classification of 2-5.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient unable to give informed consent.

          2. Current participation in another study with any investigational drug or device.

          3. Patient has a known sensitivity or allergy to contrast materials that cannot be
             adequately pre-treated.

          4. Patient has a known sensitivity or allergy to anti-platelet medications.

          5. Patient is pregnant or lactating.

          6. Patient has a co-existing disease or medical condition contraindicating percutaneous
             intervention.

          7. Target lesion is in a bypass graft.

          8. Target lesion is in a stent (i.e., in-stent restenosis).

          9. Patient has had a procedure on the target limb within 7 days.

         10. Patient had undergone attempted treatment of the CTO within the prior 3 months (to
             prevent a guidewire from entering dissection planes created by prior recanalization
             attempts.

         11. Vasculitis and Buerger disease (thrombendarteritis obliterans)

         12. Evidence of embolism
