  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the GOOD initiative was to determine which spatio-temporal gait
      parameters and/or combination(s) of spatio-temporal gait parameters best differentiate
      between cognitively healthy individuals (CHI), patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
      and those with mild and moderate dementia.

      Gait disorders are frequent in individuals with cognitive disorders. However, the profile of
      spatio-temporal gait parameters in the different cognitive status in aging (from normal
      cognition to dementia) has been poorly studied. Determining this profile associated with the
      severity of cognitive disorders may be helpful to understand the complex interplay between
      gait and cognitive disorders and, thus, may have important implication for the diagnosis
      process of patients with and without dementia. For instance, defining a motor phenotype of
      the severity of cognitive disorders by using quantitative gait measurements could be used to
      improve the prediction and the diagnosis of dementia.

      The investigators hypothesized that, compared to CHI, people with MCI and mild dementia could
      be characterized by specific phenotypes of spatio-temporal gait parameters measured with the
      GAITRite® system, and that these profiles could be explained by declines in domain-specific
      cognitive performance.
