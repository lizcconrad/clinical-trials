  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims to examine the effects of a 4 month, family focused therapy (FFT)
      intervention on the 1 year course of mood symptoms in offspring of parents with bipolar
      disorder (BD). The study will also examine the level of expressed emotion among families and
      how this impacts on FFT treatment outcomes. This study seeks to replicate a previous study by
      Miklowitz, Schneck, Singh, Taylor, George and colleagues (2013), which demonstrated the
      efficacy of FFT among BD offspring. Importantly, the present study will introduce biological
      measures that predict and reflect improvement in symptoms and expressed emotion. These
      markers reflect stress-related biological systems and include saliva samples to ascertain
      cortisol, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and salivary alpha amylase (sAA).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children of parents with bipolar disorder (BD) have increased risk of developing BD
      themselves. BD in youth is associated with increased risk for suicidality, psychosis,
      substance abuse and compromised psychosocial functioning. In addition, offspring of parents
      with BD have an increased vulnerability for developing other psychopathology (e.g. major
      depression). At present, research examining early intervention and treatment for this high
      risk population is limited. However, a recent study in symptomatic youth at risk for BD
      indicated that participation in a family focused therapy (FFT) intervention led to positive
      treatment outcomes. The present study aims to examine the effects of FFT in BD offspring in
      comparison to a brief educational treatment. Specifically, this study will examine whether
      FFT can have protective effects on individuals' mood symptoms and functioning by targeting
      the family environment. We will expand upon previous research by also measuring biological
      markers of stress (i.e., cortisol levels) and changes in family functioning over time. With
      this knowledge, the results of this study may help to shed light on the importance of early
      intervention and improve preventative treatment options for youth at high-risk for bipolar
      disorder.

    <description>Family Focused Therapy is a manual-based, psycho-educational intervention which is designed to reduce intra-familial stress, conflict, and affective arousal by enhancing communication and problem solving skills among families who are affected by bipolar disorder (Miklowitz et al., 2013). It concentrates on skills relevant to managing the prodromal stages of bipolar disorder, such as mood monitoring, reducing family conflict, improving problem solving, stabilizing daily routines and regulating sleep/wake cycles (Miklowitz, 2012).</description>
