    <textblock>
      Renal Insufficiency is a priority disease in health system, which may require renal
      replacement therapy based on renal transplantation, which is considered as therapy of choice.
      During the procedure of renal transplantation, the graft could be damaged by
      ischemia-reperfusion which generates complications in its function.

      Recently the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of statins have been emphasized,
      which could be beneficial in renal transplantation.

      Objective: Evaluate anti-inflammatory effect of atorvastatin on renal graft in living donor
      transplantation.

      Material and methods: Controlled, double-blind clinical trial with posterior following for 12
      months. Composed by 48 patients, randomized manner, realized at the Transplant Department of
      Western Medical Center, Mexican Institute of Social Security. Universe was patients accepted
      as kidney donors. Patients were randomized in two groups (study or control) the intervention
      was implemented 4 weeks before kidney transplant. Previous surgical procedure, in a blood
      sample, C-Reactive Protein (C-RP) and laboratory control were measured. During surgical
      procedure, a biopsy was obtained to measure IL-6 and tumoral necrosis factor alpha by
      immunohistochemistry. 24 hours after surgical procedure, 3 and 12 months of following, kidney
      function, complications and graft survival were registered. During surgical procedure, 3
      months and 12 months of following, biopsies were obtain to performed histopathological
      analysis of scale of Banff

      The statistical analysis was performed according to the nature of variables, for continuous
      data using measures of central tendency and dispersion and for the qualitative data with
      frequencies and percentages.
