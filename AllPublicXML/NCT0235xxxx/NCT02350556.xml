  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For several years, the postural disorders assessment in hemiplegic patients was conducted
      through force plate, using the center of plantar pressure displacement in a static position.

      These are widely used in physical therapy both for assessment and rehabilitation of patients
      with balance disorders.

      For hemiplegic patients, an asymmetric distribution support on each foot and an increased
      surface area of postural sways (more marked on the medio lateral axis) are observed.

      These studies, based on the study of plantar pressure ,are not enough to providea full
      description of the spatio-temporal organization of postural components in hemiplegic
      patients.

      Indeed, postural stabilometric evaluation is based on a simplification of the human skeleton
      by considering it as a simple inverted pendulum swinging on his ankles.

      This simplified model can't be used in dynamic assessment because of the simultaneous
      contributions of several joints during movement. This restricts its clinical interest because
      patients are more exposed to imbalances and falls in dynamic situations. Thus, the hip
      angular movement results in a center plantar pressure displacementwhich is impossible to
      discriminate from the ankle axis movement using stabilometric signal only.

      Thus, it seemed interesting to study another variable valid in dynamic conditions : the
      displacement of center of mass during a dynamic balancing task. This variable is obtained
      through 3D motion capture of the different segments of the human body. The dynamic test is a
      dynamic postural assessment following ball avoidance from three different directions. The
      center of mass displacement will be compared with a functional test known to be
      representative of dynamic balance of the individual capacities: The Timed Up and Go test
      (TUG).

      All of this data aims to improve the hemiplegic postural assessment for physical therapy and
      to help develop new rehabilitative approaches.
