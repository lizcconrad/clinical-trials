  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In current practice, management of coagulation during liver transplantation is performed
      either through standard coagulation status or with ROTEM® depending on practitioner choice
      and availability of materials. In this context, the ROTEM® is used since over 2 years by
      anesthesiologists in the digestive surgery department of the Croix Rousse hospital in Lyon,
      France.

      Indeed liver transplantation surgery is at high risk of bleeding due to coagulopathy
      developed by patients who are eligible, due to coagulation factor synthesis deficiencies in
      the cirrhotic liver. On the other hand the standard coagulation profile is a poor reflection
      of coagulopathy in such patients because the imbalance between pro- and anti-coagulant
      factors are not taken into account by PT and aPTT measures. Management of intraoperative
      hemorrhage may be facilitated by the ROTEM® which is performed from whole blood and which
      allows the detection of abnormalities in the balance between pro- and anti-coagulant factors.

      This technique was already evaluated in liver, cardiac, and obstetric surgery but also in
      traumatology. Randomized trials in liver transplantation surgery have shown changes in
      transfusion practices but did not focus on the consequences of such changes.
