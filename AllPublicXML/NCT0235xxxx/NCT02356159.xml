  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - In allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT), stem cells are taken from a donor and given
      to a recipient. Sometimes the recipient s immune system destroys the donor s cells. Or donor
      immune cells attack the recipient s tissues, called graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). This is
      less likely when the recipient and donor have similar human leukocyte antigens (HLA).
      Researchers want to see if the drug palifermin improves the results of allogeneic SCT from
      HLA-matched unrelated donors.

      Objective:

      - To see if high doses of palifermin before chemotherapy are safe, prevent chronic GVHD, and
      improve immune function after transplant.

      Eligibility:

      - Adults 18 70 with blood or bone marrow cancer with no HLA-matched sibling, but with a
      possible HLA-matched donor.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and blood and urine
           tests. They will have scans and heart and lung exams.

        -  Before transplant, participants will:

        -  Have many tests and exams. These include blood tests throughout the study and bone
           marrow biopsy.

        -  Get a central line catheter if they do not have one.

        -  Have 1 3 rounds of chemotherapy.

        -  Take more tests to make sure they can have the transplant, including medical history,
           physical exam, and CT scan.

        -  Get palifermin by IV and more chemotherapy. They will get other drugs, some they will
           take for 6 months.

        -  Participants will get the SCT.

        -  After transplant, participants will:

        -  Be hospitalized at least 3 4 weeks.

        -  Have tests for GVHD at 60 days and 6 months. These include mouth and skin photos and
           biopsies.

        -  Stay near D.C. for 3 months.

        -  Visit NIH 5 times the first 2 years, then yearly. They may have scans and biopsies.

      Background:

        -  Graft versus host disease (GVHD) and impaired immune reconstitution are major transplant
           complications and barriers to improving outcomes after allogeneic hematopoietic stem
           cell transplantation (alloHSCT) for hematologic malignancies. GVHD is initiated when
           donor T-cells become alloreactive against recipient major or minor histocompatibility
           antigens. This process may be exacerbated during the transplantation process by exposure
           of tissue antigens to donor T-lymphocytes after chemotherapy-induced injury.

        -  Palifermin, a recombinant keratinocyte growth factor-1 (KGF-1), imitates the actions of
           intrinsic KGF and binds to the FGF receptor 2b, which is expressed in the epidermis,
           oral mucosa, GI mucosa and urothelium, thereby increasing the regenerative capacity of
           these tissues. Palifermin has been shown to reduce the duration and severity of oral
           mucositis after intensive chemo-radiotherapy and autologous HSCT for hematologic cancers
           and is FDA approved. In pre-clinical studies, palifermin has been shown to have an
           effect on control of acute or chronic GVHD and immune reconstitution after alloHSCT.
           However, subsequent clinical studies in alloHSCT indicate that the dose and schedule of
           palifermin as currently

      used in humans does not optimize its activity in terms of prevention of GVHD or thymus
      recovery following alloHSCT.

      - We hypothesize that higher doses of palifermin in the immediate pre alloHSCT conditioning
      setting will lead to enhanced thymopoiesis, decreased chronic GVHD, and improved immune
      reconstitution. A dose escalation study is necessary to determine safe dosing levels in
      persons undergoing alloHSCT.

      Objectives:

        -  The primary objective of the phase I portion is to assess the safety and tolerability of
           the administration of the recombinant keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) palifermin in
           alloHSCT using unrelated donor peripheral blood stem cells.

        -  The primary objective of the phase II portion is to determine the incidence of chronic
           GVHD after the addition of palifermin to TMS (tacrolimus, methotrexate and sirolimus)
           based GVHD prophylaxis delivered in the identical fashion to the NCI 07-C-0195 study.

      Eligibility:

        -  Adults (18 - 70 years) with advanced or high risk hematologic malignancies (including
           AML, ALL, MDS, CLL, NHL, HL, CML, multiple myeloma, and MPN)who lack a suitable
           HLA-matched sibling donor.

        -  An unrelated donor matched at a minimum of 8 alleles (HLA-A,-B,-C, and DRB1) by
           high-resolution typing, identified through the National Marrow Donor Program.

        -  Karnofsky greater than or equal to 60 and acceptable organ functions.

      Design:

        -  Patients will receive disease-specific induction chemotherapy (EPOCH-F/R or FLAG) prior
           to transplant as needed for disease control and immune depletion.

        -  All patients will receive an identical conditioning regimen consisting of
           cyclophosphamide 1200 mg/m^2/day IV for 4 days and fludarabine 30 mg/m^2/day for 4 days
           (transplant days -6 to -3).

        -  All patients will receive a peripheral blood stem cell product from an unrelated donor
           matched at HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1 (8/8) by high-resolution typing.

        -  Palifermin will be administered in a phase 1, open label design with the following
           proposed schedule:

             -  Dose level 1: 180 mcg/kg on day -7

             -  Dose level 2: 360 mcg/kg on day -7

             -  Dose level 3: 540 mcg/kg on day -7

             -  Dose level 4: 720 mcg/kg on day -7

        -  The phase I portion will be conducted in a standard 3+3 design; the maximum possible
           number of patients accrued to this portion will be 24.

        -  The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) from the phase I portion of the study will be used to
           conduct a phase II study. Total accrual on the phase II study will be 27 patients,
           including 3-6 patients treated at the MTD in the phase I portion of the study

             arm. For enrollment on the research phase arm, the patient must have at lease stable
             disease which is defined as:

          -  Absence of disease progression for at least 8 weeks after previous therapy or 12 weeks
             after autologous transplantation.

          -  Patients who are less than 8 weeks from previous therapy or 12 weeks from autologous
             transplantation may participate in the study at the discretion of the PI or LAI as
             long as they do not have progressive disease.

          -  Negative immunofixation on the serum and urine and disappearance of any soft tissue
             plasmacytomas and &lt;=5% plasma cells in the bone marrow. CR requires two consecutive
             assessments by serum and urine immunofixation made at any time prior to enrollment. CR
             also requires no known evidence of progressive or new bone lesions if radiographic
             studies are performed. Confirmation with repeat bone marrow is not needed.

          -  The recipient has acceptable end organ function as defined by:

          -  DLCO &gt; 50% of the expected value (using USA-ITS-NIH equation) when corrected for Hgb
             (DLCO Adj.)

          -  24hr creatinine clearance or calculated (using the Cockcroft-Gault formula) creatinine
             clearance &gt; 60 ml/min/1.73 (induction phase only)

          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction &gt; 45%

          -  Serum total bilirubin less than 2.5 mg/dl, and serum ALT and AST values less than or
             equal to 2.5 times the upper limit of normal. Patients with elevations of serum total
             bilirubin up to 10 mg/dl and/or ALT or AST up to 10 times the upper limit of normal
             may be considered for participation if such elevations are thought to be due to liver
             involvement by malignancy. However, in these latter patients, if the BR level does not
             decrease to less than or equal to 2.5 mg/dl, or AST/ALT do not decrease to less than
             or equal to 2.5 times the upper limit of normal after induction chemotherapy,
             eligibility for the transplant (research) phase will be atthe discretion of the PI.

          -  Patients who are hepatitis B core antibody positive and or have positive hepatitis B
             surface antigen will require hepatology consultation. The risk/benefit profile of
             transplant and hepatitis B will be discussed with the patient and eligibility
             determined by the PI or the LAI.

          -  Patient may have a hepatitis C infection. However, each patient will require a
             hepatology consultation. The risk/benefit profile of transplant and hepatitis C will
             be discussed with the patient and eligibility determined by the PI or the LAI.

          -  Palifermin has had embryotoxic and fetotoxic effects in animal studies. For this
             reason and because the other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be
             teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study
             entry and for the duration of active study therapy. Should a woman become pregnant or
             suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she
             should inform her treating physician immediately.

        Research Phase Inclusion Criteria:

        Verification of donor eligibility (clearance must be received from the NMDP)

          -  Donors are evaluated by NMDP affiliated donor centers per NMDP Standards .

               -  Donors who are medically suitable, but ineligible by FDA guidelines may still
                  donate PBSC with documentation of urgent medical need by the PI.

               -  Patients who receive stem cell products from ineligible donors will be informed
                  of any increase in risk of transfusion-related diseases prior to initiation of
                  conditioning chemotherapy.

          -  Donors who are ineligible or unwilling to donate bone marrow will not be eligible to
             donate to study recipients. However, in the event that the patient has already begun
             conditioning chemotherapy and a donor PBSC collection is terminated early for
             donor-related medical concerns, a bone marrow graft may be infused. Should this occur,
             the recipient will be removed from the study, but will continue to be managed on this
             protocol for all transplant-related care and complications.

          -  Inadequate stem cell collection from the selected donor is defined as less than or
             equal to 2 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg. In most cases, donor cell collections are infused
             fresh. If a fresh collection is found to have an inadequate cell count, the cells will
             still be infused, but the recipient will be removed from the study, and managed
             clinically for all transplantrelated care and complications on this protocol. If the
             patient fails to engraft, the donor may be requested for a second collection or an
             emergency bone marrow harvest at the discretion of the PI and NMDP Medical Director.
             In the event of an inadequate collection obtained prior to patient conditioning, the
             donor may be asked to donate a second time, or another eligible donor may be
             requested.

          -  Renal and hepatic function continues to meet eligibility criteria, reassessed as
             follows:

          -  24 hour creatinine clearance or calculated (using the Cockcroft-Gault formula)
             creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (induction phase only)

          -  In patients with suspected liver disease, bilirubin must be less than or equal to 2.5
             mg/dL, AST and ALT must be less than or equal to 2.5 times institutional ULN

          -  The malignancy must be restaged prior to research phase and must not have progressed
             during induction chemotherapy (stable disease or better). Persons with acute leukemia,
             MDS/RAEB-I or II or CML with previous accelerated or blast phase must have &lt;5% blasts
             in the bone marrow. Persons with chronic phase CML may have up to 10% blasts in the
             bone marrow.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA (applies to all phases of this protocol) :

          -  Active infection that is not responding to antimicrobial therapy.

          -  Active CNS involvement by malignancy (patients with known positive CSF cytology or
             parenchymal lesions visible by CT or MRI).

          -  Previous other malignancies unless they have undergone curative intent therapy for
             that malignancy and (1) have had no evidence of that disease for 5 years, and/or (2)
             be deemed at low risk for recurrence (less than or equal to 20% at 5 years).

          -  HIV positive patients are ineligible as allogeneic stem cell transplant is not yet a
             proven approach in this patient population, and patients are at increased risk of
             lethal infections when treated with marrow suppressive therapy.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because palifermin has been shown to be
             embrytoxic and fetotoxic in animal studies. Because there is an unknown but potential
             risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with
             palifermin, breastfeeding should be discontinued for the duration of active study
             therapy. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.

          -  History of psychiatric disorder or any other condition which may compromise compliance
             with transplant protocol or expose patient to unnecessary risk as determined by
             principal investigator or lead associate investigator.
