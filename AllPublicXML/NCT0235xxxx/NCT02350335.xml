  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All patients with acute aneurysmal hemorrhage are treated in accordance with our
      institutional protocol. After securing of the aneurysm, some smokers with acute aneurysmal
      hemorrhage are randomly assigned to transdermal nicotine replacement (NRT). The short- and
      long-term effect of NRT will be studied comparing non-smokers, smokers without NRT and
      smokers with NRT.

      Various aspects of the study:

        -  Study cerebral circulation with transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) prior to and
           after NRT.

        -  Study cardiac output and peripheral vessel resistance minimally invasive (LiDCO) prior
           to and after NRT in patients that already have established LiDCO.

        -  Monitor intracranial pressure prior to and after NRT in patients that have established
           an intracranial pressure sensor.

        -  Register the frequency of cerebral vasospasm and complications in non-smokers, smokers
           without NRT, and smokers with NRT.

        -  Register the use of opioids, opioidanesthetics, propofol og psycholeptics in
           non-smokers, smokers without NRT, and smokers with NRT.

    <time_frame>21 days</time_frame>
    <description>Frequency of cerebral vasospasm within 21 days after the ictus. The institutional protocol for management of aneurysmal hemorrhage is followed in diagnosing cerebral vasospasm. This includes monitoring for cerebral vasospasm with transcranial Doppler ultrasonography and a cerebral computed tomography angiogram on day 7 after the ictus. Digital subtraction angiography is performed when necessary. All patients are monitored in the intensive care or intermediate care unit for clinical signs of cerebral vasospasm.</description>
