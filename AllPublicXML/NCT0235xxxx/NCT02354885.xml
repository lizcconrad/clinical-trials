    <textblock>
      Coagulopathy in trauma increases mortality and morbidity. Early administration of tranexamic
      acid (TXA) seems to improve survival and outcome. Thus this study evaluates the
      administration of TXA on scene by the emergency medical services (EMS) or by the crew of a
      rescue helicopter in multiple trauma patients or isolated traumatic brain injury (TBI).
      Coagulopathy will be assessed by standard laboratory tests as well as thromboelastometry.

      Coagulopathy in trauma increases mortality and morbidity. Early administration of tranexamic
      acid (TXA) seems to improve survival and outcome; this was shown partially by the CRASH2
      study, where patients received TXA in the emergency room. Thus this study evaluates the
      administration of TXA on scene by the EMS or by the crew of a rescue helicopter in multiple
      trauma patients or isolated TBI. Coagulopathy will be assessed by standard laboratory tests
      as well as thromboelastometry in 50 patients. The results will be compared to a study
      published by Theusinger et al. (Changes in Coagulation in Standard Laboratory Tests and ROTEM
      in Trauma Patients Between On-Scene and Arrival in the Emergency Department.Theusinger OM et
      al. Anesth Analg. 2014 Dec 24. [Epub ahead of print] PMID: 25545751) where no TXA was
      administered on scene and only changes in coagulation between on scene and in the emergency
      department were assessed.

    <time_frame>12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>TXA will be given to multiple trauma patients or patients with isolated TBI in the preclinical setting (n=50). Before tranexamic acid is given, one tube of citrated blood is drawn. Once patients arrive in the emergency room as second tube of citrated blood is drawn. The two tubes will be used to perform rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) measurements and standard coagulation measurements (aPTT, PT, INR, Ouick's value, fibrinogen). The coagulation parameters on scene will be compared to those in the emergency department to find out if coagulation is improved by this. In a previously performed study, 50 patients got blood taken on scene and in the emergency room without receiving TXA. In this study by Theusinger et al. it was shown that coagulation is impaired during this time period.(Theusinger OM et al. Anesth Analg. 2014 Dec 24.PMID: 25545751). The population of this study will serve as control group for the actually performed study.</description>
