    <textblock>
      This pilot study evaluates the effect of theory menu-based mini-videos on vitamin D adherence
      in older adult with osteoporosis. Half of participants will watch the videos while the other
      half will receive usual care (treating physician advice).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis is a common disease around the world. The morbidity and mortality attributed to
      osteoporosis is due to fracture. The evidence shows that vitamin D is effective in preventing
      osteoporotic fracture, however, adherence to vitamin D is low among people with osteoporosis
      (20%-60%). The Health Action Process Approach (HAPA) has been found useful to describe,
      explain, and predict changes in health behaviours in a variety of setting. Based on HAPA,
      mini-videos will be developed aiming to increase vitamin D adherence in people with
      osteoporosis. Mini-videos will address self-efficacy, outcome expectancy, risk perception and
      action and coping plan. This pilot study aims to evaluate the recruitment and participants'
      feedback about the mini-videos.
