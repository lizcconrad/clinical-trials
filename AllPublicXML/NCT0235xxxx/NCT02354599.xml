    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of
      single subcutaneous injection of MT203 in healthy adult Japanese and Caucasian male
      participants.

      The drug being tested in this study is called MT203 (Namilumab), which is a human
      immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) mAb potently and specifically neutralizing human and macaque
      granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). This study will consist of Cohorts
      1 to 3 for healthy Japanese participants and Cohort 4 for healthy Caucasian participants.
      Each cohort will be comprised of 8 participants, of whom 6 participants will be randomized to
      receive MT203 and 2 participants will be randomized to receive matched placebo.

      The study population for the study will consist of 24 Japanese and 8 Caucasian healthy
      participants. Participants will be assigned to 4 cohorts which will remain undisclosed to the
      patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need)::

      Cohort 1:- MT203 80 mg (6 healthy Japanese participants); Matching Placebo (2 healthy
      Japanese participants) Cohort 2:- MT203 150 mg (6 healthy Japanese participants); Matching
      Placebo (2 healthy Japanese participants) Cohort 3:- MT203 300 mg (6 healthy Japanese
      participants); Matching Placebo (2 healthy Japanese participants) Cohort 4:- MT203 150 mg (6
      healthy Caucasian participants); Matching Placebo (2 healthy Caucasian participants).

      Dosing of the Caucasian participants (Cohort 4) may occur in parallel with dosing in Japanese
      participants (Cohorts 1 to 3). Dose escalation will occur in Japanese Cohorts, independent
      from Cohort 4. The dose escalation will only occur following a review of the blinded
      safety/tolerability data up to Day 15 from the previous cohort. All participants will receive
      a single dose on Day 1, admitted from Day -1 to Day 15. Participants will return to the study
      unit for the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and safety assessment on Days 22, 29, 43, 57,
      71 and 85.

      This trial will be conducted in Japan.Overall time to participate in this trial is 85 days.
