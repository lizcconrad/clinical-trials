      This study compared efficacy and safety of basic triple therapy including Noltec(Ilaprazole)
      10mg, Cravit(Levofloxacin) 500mg and Chongkundang Amoxicillin Cap(Amoxicillin) 1000mg BID on
      the first line eradication treatment of H.pylori.

      Participants are defined as persons who have endoscopically confirmed on gastric or duodenal
      ulcer(including scar stage) and gastritis confirmed to be H.pylori positive patients in the
      biopsy and UBT test. For 10 days, Participants treated as basic triple therapy including
      Noltec(Ilaprazole) 10mg, Cravit(Levofloxacin) 500mg and Chongkundang Amoxicillin
      Cap(Amoxicillin) 1000mg BID. After treatment, The healing rate was evaluated in the UBT test
      and Biopsy at 49±5days from the first day dosing.
