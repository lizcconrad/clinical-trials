  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate the safety and the function of the collagen
      Matrix 10808 in humans and to compare it versus the standard therapy, the transplantation of
      the autologous connective tissue graft. The Collagen Matrix was developed for soft tissue
      augmentation. It is a three dimensional porous Matrix and consists mainly of Collagen I and
      III.

      Study patients must have a single tooth gap with insufficient soft tissue volume after
      implant placement. Therefore a soft tissue augmentation will be necessary.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of soft tissue volume
      augmentation procedures using the autogenous soft tissue graft or the Collagen Matrix 10808
      to gain mucosal thickness. Second the safety of the two procedures will be investigated.

    <description>At the day of the Intervention (day 0) sulcular incisions will be made around the neighbouring teeth and a straight incision from the lingual/palatal line angle of the distal tooth to the lingual/palatal line angle of the mesial tooth. A full thickness flap will be elevated on the lingual side, whereas a split flap will be made at the buccal aspect preparing a soft tissue pouch without the preparation of horizontal release incisions. The Collagen Matrix 10808 will then be positioned in the pouch under the elevated buccal flap. A horizontal mattress suture will be made to immobilize graft to the flap followed by four to five single sutures to close the wound.</description>
