  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to compare the acceptability and feasibility and explore outcomes
      related to two different formats of a parenting program for mothers with postpartum
      depressive symptoms. One version will be a traditional, in-person group format, while the
      other will be a social media group format. The investigators will also explore the
      differences in outcomes of both formats, looking at depressive symptoms, parenting sense of
      competency, and parenting interactions with children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postpartum depressive symptoms are common among women following the birth of a child and can
      adversely impact a mother's ability to care for her child. Evidence-based parent coaching
      programs have been developed to guide mothers with caring for their infants but do not
      address the effects of depression on parenting, can be expensive to administer, and are not
      available in a format that facilitates participation by women with depressive symptoms. We
      have adapted a previously validated parent coaching intervention, the Parents Interacting
      with Infants (PIWI) program, for use with depressed parents by inclusion of educational
      material based on Beardslee's cognitive psycho-educational family model. The program spans 8
      weeks, each week focusing on a specific topic. The topics covered are: psychoeducation
      regarding depression and behavioral activation for coping with high levels of stress, sleep,
      play, laughter, feeding, temperament, safety, and reading with infants.

      We will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial comparing two versions of the parent
      coaching program: social media and traditional in-person group formats. We've modified the
      PIWI program to address barriers to participation through social media format using secret
      Facebook user groups. We will assess the feasibility and acceptability of the social media
      program compared to a traditional group format by examining the proportion of subjects who
      attend group sessions or &quot;like&quot; Facebook sessions. Women who consent to participate in the
      study will be assigned by randomization to one format or the other in blocks of 20.

      Women will complete measures of feasibility and acceptability and measures of depressive
      symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory-II [BDI-II - Appendix 2] Scale) and parenting competence
      (Parenting Sense of Competency [PSOC - Appendix 3] scales) prior to (time 0) and after the
      intervention (time 8-12 weeks post enrollment). In addition, mothers and infants in phase III
      will be videotaped during a 16-minute free play using a standardized measure of parenting
      interaction (PICCOLO) following completion of the intervention. The measures will provide
      important information on the effects of parent coaching formats on a new mother's depressive
      symptoms, her sense of parenting confidence, and her parenting interactions with her infant.

    <description>The BDI-II is a 21-item self-report tool that measures the severity of depression and includes two subscales: cognitive and somatic. It has been well validated, with scores 14-19 indicating mild depression, 20-28 moderate depression, and 29-63 severe depression.</description>

    <measure>Parenting Sense of Competency (PSOC) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Parenting Sense of Competence scale measures parental competence on two dimensions: Satisfaction and Efficacy. It is a 16 item Likert-scale questionnaire (on a 6 point scale ranging from strongly agree [1] to strongly disagree [6]), with nine questions under Satisfaction and seven under Efficacy. Satisfaction section examines the parents' anxiety, motivation and frustration, while the Efficacy section looks at the parents' competence, capability levels, and problem-solving abilities in their parental role.</description>

    <measure>Parenting Interactions with Children: Checklist of Observations Linked to Outcomes (PICCOLO)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Parenting Interactions with Children: Checklist of Observations Linked to Outcomes is a checklist of 29 observable developmentally supportive parenting behaviors with children ages 10-47 months in four domains: affection, responsiveness, encouragement, and teaching. It is a positive, practical, versatile, culturally sensitive, valid, and reliable tool for practitioners that shows what parents can do to support their children's development. Currently, the PICCOLO is being validated for infants down to 6 months of age.</description>
