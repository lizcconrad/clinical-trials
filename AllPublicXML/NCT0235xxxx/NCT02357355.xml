  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Charcot Marie Tooth 1A (CMT 1A) is a common inherited disorder of the nerves in the body. The
      disease can result in difficulties with strength and balance as well as in foot deformities
      such as high arches, hammer toes, and tight ankles. Because of these difficulties, the
      disease may affect driving, especially because driving requires quick responses at times such
      as slamming on the brakes or turning the steering wheel quickly. The following study
      determines driving performance in individuals who have CMT 1A.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with CMT 1A will drive in a driving simulator, which involves a car located in a
      room in the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics (UIHC). Individuals will drive in the
      car as if they are driving in real life and the whole experience is like playing a car video
      game with a big animated screen. The driving results will be compared to similar aged
      patients who don't have CMT 1A and have also taken the driving test. If patients with CMT 1A
      do have driving difficulties compared to those who do not have CMT 1A, the results of the
      study will try to help patients with CMT1A drive better by ultimately creating devices that
      might help them use the steering wheel or brake pedal in a safer way.
