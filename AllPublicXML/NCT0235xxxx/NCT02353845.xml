      One purpose of this study is to construct the diagnosis system for early Alzheimer's
      disease(AD), which is also called amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and then further
      construct the predictable classifier from aMCI to AD based on Multi-Modality MRI
      characteristics of aMCI patients.

    <textblock>
      The cognition of aMCI is between normal aging and dementia, which is thought the transitional
      stage of dementia. Patients with aMCI have heavy risk to convert to AD, so in this study, the
      investigators focus on the construction of the diagnosis system for early AD based on
      multi-modality MRI characteristics of aMCI patients. Every patient underwent β-Amyloid PET,
      fluorodeoxyglucose-PET(FDG-PET), structural MRI, diffusion tensor imaging and functional MRI.
      Then investigators further study the patients who convert to AD and explore their MRI and
      metabolism characteristics on baseline, in order to construct the predictable classifier from
      aMCI to AD. The investigators want to achieve the early diagnosis of AD and help clinicians
      interfere with the progress of this disease.

    <measure>number of participants correctly classified by the support vector machine (SVM) classifier for the aMCI diagnosis</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>two-hundred aMCI subjects and 100 normal controls recruited will undergo structure,resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging. An SVM classifier for diagnosis will be trained based on these neuroimaging data.Then leave-one-out cross validation will be used to estimate the performance of the classifier including accuracy，sensitivity，specificity.The classification accuracy will be measured by the proportion of observations that are correctly classified into the aMCI or control groups.The sensitivity is defined as TP/(TP+FN), and specificity is defined as TN/(TN+FP). The TP (true positive) is the number of aMCI images correctly classified,whereas the TN (true negative) is the number of control images correctly classified. The FP (false positive) is the number of control images classified as the aMCI, whereas the FN (false negative) is the number of aMCI images classified as controls.</description>

    <description>During 2-year follow-up, the group of aMCI will be divided into progressive aMCI (aMCIp) and stable aMCI（aMCIs）.According to the baseline neuroimaging data, an SVM classifier for predicting conversion from aMCI to AD will be trained. Then leave-one-out cross validation will be used to validate the performance of the classifier including accuracy，sensitivity，specificity.The classification accuracy will be measured by the proportion of aMCI that are correctly classified into the aMCIp or aMCIs groups.The sensitivity is defined as TP/(TP+FN), and specificity is defined as TN/(TN+FP). The TP (true positive) is the number of aMCIp images correctly classified,whereas the TN (true negative) is the number of aMCIs correctly classified.

        aMCI is a group of patients whose memory are impaired to a greater degree than expected
        given the individual's age, sex, and educational background, while the individual's ability
        to perform the activities of daily living is preserved and the criteria for dementia are
        not met.
