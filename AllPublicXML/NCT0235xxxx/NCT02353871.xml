      The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the safety and the efficacy of a single
      treatment of an injectable liquid form of Clostridium botulinum toxin type A haemagglutinin
      complex (BTX-A-HAC; hereafter referred to as BTX-A-HAC Next Generation (BTX-A-HAC NG)), used
      for the improvement in the appearance of moderate to severe glabellar lines (the lines
      between the eyebrows).

    <textblock>
      At the Baseline Visit (Day 1), subjects were randomised in a ratio of 2:1 to receive either
      BTX-A-HAC NG solution (50 U) or placebo. Randomisation was stratified according to gender and
      severity of glabellar lines at maximum frown (moderate to severe) at Baseline. A single dose
      of BTX-A-HAC NG solution 50 U or placebo was injected on Day 1. Subjects were then monitored
      at the study centre for 30 minutes. On Day 4, subjects were contacted by telephone for
      adverse event monitoring and to record concomitant medications and treatments.

      Subjects attended follow-up visits at the study centre on Days 8, 15, 29, 57, 85, 113, 148
      and 183. The Day 183 follow-up visit was the end of study visit; all subjects who had
      completed the Day 183 Visit were considered to have completed the study.

             photorejuvenation or skin/vascular laser intervention within the past 12 months.

          4. Any planned facial cosmetic surgery during the study.

          5. A history of eyelid blepharoplasty or brow lift within the past 5 years.

             lines area (e.g. acute acne lesions or ulcers).

          8. Use of concomitant therapy which, in the Investigator's opinion, would have interfered
             with the evaluation of the safety or efficacy of the study treatment, including
             medications affecting bleeding disorders (antiplatelet agents and/or anticoagulants

             NG.

         13. Clinically diagnosed significant anxiety disorder, or any other significant
             psychiatric disorder (e.g. depression) that might interfere with the subject's
             participation in the study.

         14. Use of medications that affect neuromuscular transmission, such as curare like
             nondepolarising agents, lincosamides, polymyxins, anticholinesterases and
             aminoglycoside antibiotics, within the past 30 days.

         15. A history of facial nerve palsy.

         16. Marked facial asymmetry, ptosis, excessive dermatochalasis, deep dermal scarring, or
             thick sebaceous skin.

         17. The presence of any other condition (e.g. neuromuscular disorder or other disorder
             that could interfere with neuromuscular function), laboratory finding or circumstance
             that, in the judgement of the Investigator, might increase the risk to the subject or
             decrease the chance of obtaining satisfactory data to achieve the objectives of the
             study.

        <description>ILA
4-point photographic scale: None - Grade 0; mild - Grade 1; moderate - Grade 2; severe - Grade 3.
A responder at maximum frown was defined as having a severity grade of none (Grade 0) or mild (Grade 1) at maximum frown at a given visit and a severity grade of moderate (Grade 2) or severe (Grade 3) at Baseline (Day 1). Subjects who were not responders at Day 29 were excluded from the analysis.
The adjusted proportion of responders in each treatment group was provided using a multivariate logistic regression model.</description>

4-point photographic scale: None - Grade 0; mild - Grade 1; moderate - Grade 2; severe - Grade 3.
A responder at rest was defined as having a severity grade of none (Grade 0) or mild (Grade 1) at rest at a given visit and a severity grade of moderate (Grade 2) or severe (Grade 3) at Baseline (Day 1).
The adjusted proportion of responders in each treatment group was provided using a multivariate logistic regression model.</description>

        <description>SSA
4-point photographic scale: No wrinkles - 0; Mild wrinkles - 1; Moderate wrinkles - 2; Severe wrinkles – 3.
A responder at maximum frown was defined as having a severity grade of no wrinkles (Grade 0) or mild wrinkles (Grade 1) at maximum frown at a given visit and a severity grade of moderate wrinkles (Grade 2) or severe wrinkles (Grade 3) at Baseline (Day 1).
The adjusted proportion of responders in each treatment group was provided using a multivariate logistic regression model.</description>

        <description>Adjusted proportion of responders at each post-treatment visit (measured by the subject's level of satisfaction with the appearance of their glabellar lines).
4-point categorical scale: Grade 0 - very satisfied; Grade 1 - satisfied; Grade 2 - dissatisfied; Grade 3 - very dissatisfied.
A responder was defined as having a satisfaction rating of very satisfied (Grade 0) or satisfied (Grade 1) at a given visit and a satisfaction rating of dissatisfied (Grade 2) or very dissatisfied (Grade 3) at Baseline (Day 1).
The adjusted proportion of responders in each treatment group was provided using a multivariate logistic regression model.</description>
