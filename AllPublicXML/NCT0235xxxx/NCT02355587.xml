  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The EXPAND Registry Study follows patients with cutaneous melanoma who have had the
      DecisionDx-Melanoma gene expression assay performed as part of their clinical care. Data will
      be collected through review of medical records from clinical visits with physician.

      The purpose is to document the clinical application of results obtained from the DecisionDx-
      Melanoma multi-gene assay and to track outcomes of patients for whom DecisionDx-Melanoma
      testing has been completed. Additionally the study will assess the health economic impact of
      DecisionDx-Melanoma testing as it relates to the Melanoma population.
