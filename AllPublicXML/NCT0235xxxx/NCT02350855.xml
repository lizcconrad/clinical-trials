  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of the study is to assess the effectiveness of tailored nutritional intervention
      in delaying the progression of cachexia to refractory cachexia in adult female cancer
      patients.

      The tested hypothesis stated that intake of nutrient rich bread mix (along with dietary and
      physical activity counselling) for six months, improved the anthropometric and biochemical
      indices in free-living patients suffering from cancer cachexia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients were randomly distributed into two groups i.e. control and intervention group. 30
      patients were allocated in intervention group and received nutrient rich bread mix i.e. IAtta
      (100 g) along with dietary and physical activity counseling and 33 patients were allocated in
      the control group who received only dietary and physical activity counseling. Patients in the
      intervention group collected 14 packets of 100 g of IAtta every fortnight during their
      clinician appointments while the control patients were advised regarding their dietary habits
      at every clinician visit for 6 months.

      Dietary counseling for 30 minutes was imparted to all patients on each visit by the
      researcher. Depending on the physical status of the patients, low level of physical activity
      (walking and/or stairs), was encouraged daily during counseling sessions.

      Nutritional, biochemical, quality of life and anthropometric estimations were assessed at
      baseline, after 3 months and at 6 months of intervention for all patients.

      Patients' daily energy, carbohydrate, protein and fat intake were calculated using food
      frequency (Indian Migrant study food frequency questionnaire- IMS-FFQ) questionnaire and two
      day 24 hour recall data. PG-SGA questionnaire was used to monitor patient nutritional status
      throughout the study.

      EORTC-QLQ- C30 questionnaire was used to analyse patients' quality of life and asked
      personally by the researcher.

      Haemoglobin and serum albumin levels were assessed at the start of the study, after 3 months
      and at 6 months of intervention for all patients.

      Indian Migrant Study Physical Activity questionnaire (IMS-PAQ) was used to assess patients'
      physical activity throughout the day.

      Anthropometric estimations included body weight, mid upper arm circumference and four site
      skin fold thickness (SFT) measurement (i.e. triceps, biceps, subscapular and suprailiac).

    <description>Four site skin fold thickness (SFT) measurement (i.e. triceps, biceps, subscapular and suprailiac) by the help of scientific Harpenden Skinfold Caliper was noted to the nearest 0.2mm reading, to calculate percentage body density. Body fat percentage was calculated using body density value in Siri equation. SFT was measured at baseline, mid-intervention (3 months) and end of intervention (6 months) to determine the BF%.</description>

    <measure>Nutritional status assessment (Indian Migrant study food frequency questionnaire (IMS-FFQ), two day 24 hour dietary recall and patient generated subjective global assessment)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Indian Migrant study food frequency questionnaire (IMS-FFQ), two day 24 hour dietary recall and patient generated subjective global assessment were used to assess patient nutritional status at baseline, mid-intervention and end of intervention (6 months).
Food frequency questionnaire and 24 hour dietary recall is an accurate method to record the frequency of consumption of individual foods and can help provide information on patients' eating patterns.IMS-FFQ consists of 184 commonly consumed food items and was validated among the rural and urban Indian population. PG-SGA is most effective and sensitive tool for assessing and evaluating cancer patients' nutritional status and validated on Indian cancer patients.</description>

    <description>Indian Migrant Study Physical Activity questionnaire (IMS-PAQ) was used to assess patients' physical activity throughout the day. We assessed physical activity at three time points during the study: baseline, at 3 months of intervention and at 6 months end of intervention.
IMS-PAQ is a validated questionnaire on both Indian rural and urban population.</description>
