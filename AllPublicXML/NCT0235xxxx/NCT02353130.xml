      Specific Aim 1: Obtain proof of concept evidence that cortical metrics will change in
      response to treatment with Memantine extended release (XR)®, an agent that modulates n-methyl
      d-asptartate (NMDA) receptor activation, in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) who
      clinically demonstrate treatment response.

      Hypothesis1: Children with ASD who have dramatic clinical response to Memantine XR® will
      exhibit changes in their cortical metrics, which will differ less from neurotypical children.
      Subjective ratings of improvement will be correlated with the change in cortical metrics.

      The completion of these aims will be essential to design a larger federally funded trial to
      validate cortical metrics as an outcome measure in a more heterogeneous pediatric ASD sample.
      Specifically, the feasibility data obtained may demonstrate the potential for detecting
      changes in cortical metrics over time, so that a larger grant could focus on determining how
      sensitive and clinically relevant changes in cortical metrics are or may indicate the need to
      explore different interventions to use in a validation study. We have chosen to use Memantine
      XR® because of its impact on NMDA neurotransmission, its current evaluation in a large
      multi-site randomized ASD clinical trial whose initial results are expected shortly, and our
      own observations of clinical improvements and good tolerability in the ongoing trial.

      Youth with ASD ages 8-12 years will undergo cortical metrics testing (testing of ability to
      discriminate the vibration of small brushes on the tops of the hand under various conditions)
      prior to treatment with memantine XR. They will then be treated with memantine XR target dose
      of 14milligrams daily for 8 weeks. At the end of 8 weeks, cortical metrics testing will be
      repeated. Within-subject changes in the cortical metrics testing between baseline and
      endpoint will be examined and described. Potential relationships between changes in clinical
      rating scales and cortical metrics will be examined. Data will be utilized to inform a
      decision about continuing to explore the utility of cortical metrics to detect changes in
      brain function in youth with ASD in response to therapeutic interventions.

    <description>Participants will begin with 7mg Memantine XR® daily for a minimum of one week before increasing to an optimal dose of 14 mg daily. It is suggested that participants be titrated to the optimal dose by week 2 so that they may remain on 14mg for at least 6 weeks. Morning dosing is suggested, but can be flexible.</description>
