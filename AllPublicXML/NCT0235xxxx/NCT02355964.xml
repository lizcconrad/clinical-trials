  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to study the effects of lifestyle changes on asthma and systemic
      inflammation in a randomized clinical trial of diet and exercise. The project is a
      multidisciplinary collaboration in the areas of medicine, physiology and nutrition, centred
      on improving asthma control in non-obese sedentary asthmatics via simple means.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After screening and enrollment, a total of 200 Danish sedentary, non-obese asthma patients
      will be randomized to one of four groups: 1) control group (no intervention), 2) physical
      exercise intervention, 3) diet intervention (a diet with an overall high content of protein
      and a low glycemic index) or 4) exercise plus diet intervention.

      Asthma is defined as respiratory symptoms and at least one positive asthma test. Patients
      will continue their regular doses of anti-asthma treatment unchanged throughout the study
      period. Type of anti-inflammatory medicine will be recorded and the adherence to the therapy
      will be assessed before the intervention period and at follow-up using questionnaires
