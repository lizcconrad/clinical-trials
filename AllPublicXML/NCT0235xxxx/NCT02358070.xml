      The purpose of this study is:

        -  to investigate the risk factors of HCC among Americans with focus on lifestyle factors
           and energy balance.

        -  to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes that are associated
           with HCC risk through a genome-wide search.

        -  to assess if genetic susceptibility differs by hepatitis virus infection or lifestyle
           factors, and to explore if there are interplays or effect modifications between genetic
           factors and viral infection or lifestyle factors.

    <description>Lifetime physical activity will be measured by collecting data on major types of physical activity separately and by determining frequency, intensity, and duration of each activity using a combined modification of Friedenreich's lifetime physical activity questionnaire and Kriska's past year physical activity questionnaires.</description>

    <time_frame>20 years</time_frame>
    <description>A modified Food Frequency questionnaire based on one developed by Dr. Alan Kristal from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC) in Seattle will capture energy intake by differentiating low-fat food options from higher-fat counterparts.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Lifestyle factors</measure>
    <time_frame>20 years</time_frame>
    <description>Structured questionnaires will be used to elicit information on demographic, anthropometric, and socioeconomic factors, long-term use of medications, medical history, and family history of cancer, cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption, physical activity, and dietary habits. Additional information unrelated to liver cancer will be included in the questionnaire to help assess possible recall bias.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria for HCC cases:

          -  a diagnosis of primary liver cancer (excluding secondary tumors)

          -  a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma if histology is available (excluding those
             diagnosed in intrahepatic bile duct, bile canals, biliary passages, canaliculi, gall
             duct and gallbladder)

          -  a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma with or without microscopic evaluation
             (including those diagnosed with clinical evidence, lab tests and direct visualization
             or radiographic and other imaging evidence)

          -  a histology of primary hepatocellular carcinoma when the patients had a prior
             diagnosis of other forms of cancer (excluding those who had no histological diagnosis
             of hepatocellular carcinoma while having a prior history of other cancer;

          -  age at diagnosis between 35 and 84 years

          -  living in Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, or Hawaii for at least a year as regular
             residents.

          -  uncertain diagnoses or classification of malignancy, such as unknown origin

          -  a diagnosis of primary tumors in other organs, not in the liver

          -  unable to communicate well enough in English or Spanish

          -  having medical conditions, such as mental disorders, that prevent the subject from

          -  able to communicate well in English or Spanish

          -  having no medical conditions, such as mental disorders, that prevent them from
             providing adequately comprehensible information

          -  potential subjects with a previous history of cancer are eligible.

        Exclusion Criteria for control subjects:

          -  age &lt; 35 years or &gt; 84 years

          -  temporary residents of New Jersey or Connecticut
