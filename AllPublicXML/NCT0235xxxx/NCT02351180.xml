  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the use of inhaled beclomethasone after a
      community-acquired respiratory viral infection in a lung transplant recipient decreases the
      risk of the subsequent development of chronic lung allograft dysfunction.

    <textblock>
      Community-acquired respiratory viral (CARV) infections after lung transplantation are
      associated with an increased risk for the development of chronic lung allograft dysfunction
      (CLAD) after lung transplantation. The exact mechanisms whereby CARV infections increase this
      risk are unknown. We propose that viral infection results in airway epithelial cell injury
      and the expression of injury-response genes that provide signals that initiate immunologic
      and non-immunologic pathways that result in the airway remodeling characteristic of
      obliterative bronchiolitis, the predominant pathology of CLAD. Systemic and inhaled
      corticosteroids are frequently used as anti-inflammatory agents to treat the peribronchiolar
      inflammation seen in viral bronchiolitis. Beneficial effects from corticosteroids have been
      reported, but this has not been demonstrated in lung transplant recipients. The aim of this
      single center, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study is to evaluate the short
      and long term effects of a 6 month course of inhaled beclomethasone on adult lung transplant
      recipients with CARV infection.
