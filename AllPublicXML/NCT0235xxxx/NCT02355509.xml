  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine the behavior of
      hyperglycemia and postprandial lipemia after a standard mixed meal load in patients with
      carbohydrate intolerance treated with acarbose.

      To gather our patients, we invite the relatives of diabetic patients seen at the
      endocrinology consultation to participate in the study.

        -  Patients are placed into an isocaloric diet for 4 weeks before the study and are advised
           not to change their baseline physical activity.

        -  Patients are randomized to receive acarbose or placebo for 3 months blinded to
           investigators and patients.

        -  Acarbose dose is progressively titrated (50 mg/day per week up to 150 mg/day) to reduce
           the known adverse effects of acarbose such as flatulence, bloating, diarrhea, abdominal
           pain.

        -  In each subject, a 5-hr-postprandial mixed meal test is performed at baseline and after
           assigned treatment was completed. Glucose, insulin, triglycerides and total cholesterol
           were measured at 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, 120, 180, 240 and 300 minutes after the mixed
           meal load. Apo B was measured by nephelometry and oxLDL using a monoclonal antibody 4E6
           based competition (ELISA assay, Mercodia) at 0 and 300 minutes.

        -  The standard mixed meal load, a 470 kcal breakfast, (47.76% carbohydrate, 22.66%
           proteins, 29.58% fat), consisted of: 1 sandwich (prepared with 50 g of Savory´s™ turkey
           breast ham, 30 g of Savory´s™ panela cheese, 2 tablespoons of Hellmann's™ mayonnaise and
           2 slices of Bimbo´s™ white bread), 100 g of Red DeliciousTM apple and 250 mL of
           Alpura´s™ lactose-free, light milk.

        -  During the 3-month treatment, patients have 3 follow-up monthly consultations to
           evaluate weight gain and treatment compliance.
