      The purpose of this study was to determine the clinical and radiographic long - term results
      in geriatric patients who had undergone surgical or non - operative treatment of odontoid non
      - unions, with particular regards to late bony fusion, cervical spine motion, neurological
      sequela, and patient's quality of life.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients aged 65 years or older who had undergone surgical or non - operative management of
        odontoid non-unions were sorted and their dataset of follow - up monitoring was examined
        for completeness and accuracy. According to our inclusion criteria, patients with complete
        sets of collected data and a follow-up examination of at least five years after treatment
        of the non - union were finally enrolled in this study. Collected data included variables,
        such as age, gender, mechanism of injury, fracture type, associated injuries, presence and
        severity of primary neurological deficits, primary treatment, clinical and neurological
        outcome after primary treatment, methods of treatment, clinical and radiographic outcome
        after treatment of the non-union, as well as morbidity and mortality of the patients.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Exclusion criteria for this study contain patients with previous or subsequent surgery at
        the cervical spine level, patients with incomplete data sets, as well as patients with
        penetrating mechanism of injury or congenital cervical spine anomalies. Incomplete data set
        was determined, if pertinent clinical or radiographic data of follow - up monitoring (e.g.
        documents of clinical findings or functional results, radiographs, CT-scanning, e.g.) were
        missing.
