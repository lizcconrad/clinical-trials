  <brief_title>Dose-Ranging Study of the Bimatoprost Ocular Insert</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Phase 2 Prospective, Multicenter, Randomized, Double-masked, Controlled Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety and Dose-response of the Bimatoprost Ocular Insert (2.2mg, 13mg) With and Without Concomitant Artificial Tears Compared to a Placebo Ocular Insert With and Without Concomitant Timolol (0.5%) Ophthalmic Solution in Patients With Open-angle Glaucoma or Ocular Hypertension.</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Bimatoprost Ocular Insert is intended to provide sustained delivery of bimatoprost to the
      ocular surface to lower the intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open-angle glaucoma
      or ocular hypertension.

      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of two different doses of the Bimatoprost
      Ocular Insert, compared to an active control arm with timolol ophthalmic solution (0.5%).
