    <description>Imatinib will be taken orally once daily with a meal and a large glass of water. For patients having difficulty swallowing, imatinib can be dissolved in water or apple juice for intake. The dose of imatinib is 400 mg for CML patients in the chronic phase and 600 mg for CML patients in the accelerated phase or in blast crisis. A minimum of 2 hours should separate a dose of imatinib from a dose of BBI608.</description>
