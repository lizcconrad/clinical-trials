    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the recommended phase II dose, and to assess the
      safety of acelarin in combination with cisplatin in patients with locally advanced/
      metastatic biliary tract cancers.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Active chemotherapy drugs for the treatment of advanced biliary tract cancers (ABC) include
      gemcitabine, fluoropyrimidines and platinum agents. The United Kingdom (UK) National Cancer
      Research Network (NCRN) ABC-02 study established cisplatin and gemcitabine as the standard of
      care for the first-line treatment of patients with ABC and this regimen has been widely
      adopted in the UK and internationally. However, inherent and acquired tumour resistance
      limits the efficacy of gemcitabine and it is necessary to explore alternative treatments.

      The study will explore the combination of acelarin, a drug designed to specifically overcome
      the key cancer resistance mechanisms associated with gemcitabine, with cisplatin. As this is
      the first time the combination of acelarin and cisplatin will be given to patients the aim of
      the study is to investigate the safety of the combination and to establish the recommended
      phase II dose of acelarin.

      This is a phase Ib, single-arm, multi-centre, open-label trial. The trial design is a classic
      3+3 design where patients are recruited into cohorts of 3 to 6 patients at different dose
      levels until the dose level for phase II is determined. Patients in each cohort will be
      monitored closely for safety and drug toxicity.

      Secondary trial objectives will involve assessing the activity of acelarin in combination
      with cisplatin in terms of; progression-free survival, overall survival and response rate, as
      well as exploring the pharmacokinetic profile of the combination.

    <description>The MTD will be defined as the maximum dose level at which 0/3 patients or 1/6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). At any dose level, DLT in 1/3 patients will lead to expansion to 6 patients. If 2/6 patients experience DLT the preceding dose level will be declared the MTD. At the MTD up to 6 additional patients may be enrolled. If this level is well tolerated, it will be declared the recommended phase II dose (RP2D).</description>

    <description>The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Acelarin in combination with 25mg/m2 Cisplatin will be determined.
The starting dose will be 625mg/m2 Acelarin which will be escalated to 725mg/m2 if the criteria for dose escalation is met (i.e. the proportion of dose limiting toxicities is acceptable as detailed in the protocol). Escalation will continue in accordance with the protocol up to a maximum of 925mg/m2. Only if the MTD is exceeded at the starting dose level (at least 2 of 3 participants or at least 2 of 6 participants have DLT at the first dose level) will there be a de-escalation to 500mg.</description>
