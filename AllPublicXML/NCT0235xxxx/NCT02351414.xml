      MPO is conducting this PMCF study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of its EVOLUTION® Total
      Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) components marketed in the EU. These types of studies are required by
      regulatory authorities for all devices that do not have medium to long-term clinical evidence
      available at the time of gaining approval to market in the EU. This study has been designed
      in accordance with MEDDEV 2.12/2 rev 2.

    <textblock>
      MicroPort Orthopedics Inc. (MPO) currently markets the EVOLUTION® TKA System globally,
      including in the European Union (EU). As part of the process for gaining approval to market
      in the EU, MicroPort is conducting this post market clinical follow-up (PMCF) study to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of this system. These types of studies are required by
      regulatory authorities for all TKA devices that do not have medium to long-term clinical
      evidence available at the time of gaining approval to market in the EU. The objectives of
      this study are to evaluate component survivorship, cumulative revision rate, functional
      outcome scores, and subject satisfaction at early, midterm, and long-term follow-up.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        To be included in the study, subjects must meet all of the following criteria:

          -  Has previously undergone primary TKA for any of the following:

          -  non-inflammatory degenerative joint disease including osteoarthritis, traumatic
             arthritis, or avascular necrosis;

          -  inflammatory degenerative joint disease including rheumatoid arthritis

          -  correction of functional deformity.

          -  Subject was implanted with the specified combination of components

          -  Subject is willing and able to complete required study visits and assessments

          -  Subject plans to be available through the 10 year postoperative follow-up visit

          -  Subject is willing to sign the approved Informed Consent document

          -  Subject must be at least 2 years post TKA prior to informed consent.

        Previously implanted bilateral subjects can have both TKAs enrolled in the study provided:
        1) the specified combination of components were implanted in both, 2) all other aspects of
        the Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria are satisfied, 3) enrollment does not exceed the subject
        count specified in the Clinical Trial Agreement, and 4) the subject agrees to a second
        Informed Consent document specific to the second TKA. Prospective enrollment of a
        previously unimplanted knee is not permitted in this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects will be excluded if they meet any of the following criteria:

          -  Subject was skeletally immature (less than 21 years of age) at time of implantation

          -  Subject is currently enrolled in another clinical investigation

          -  Subject is unwilling or unable to sign the Informed Consent document

          -  Subject has documented substance abuse issues

          -  Subject has an emotional or neurological condition that would pre-empt their ability
             or willingness to participate in the study
