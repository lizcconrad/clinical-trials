  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this 14-day, two phase clinical study is to test the tolerance of a new
      over-the-counter moisturizing balm on subjects with eczema.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At least 60 subjects will be enrolled to ensure 40 (10 adults and 30 babies) completed
      subjects. The tolerability of this formulation will be monitored in a small group of ten
      adult subjects with mild to moderate eczema prior to testing in babies. In Group A, adults
      will be asked to give their informed consent and an evaluation of inclusion/exclusion
      criteria will be performed at the site. After screening, all subjects will be asked not to
      use any skin treatments until the next clinic visit. Subjects will use the investigational
      product as indicated at least twice per day on the face - cheeks only, arms, legs and torso
      for 14 days. For both adults and babies, only the baseline measurements are collected at 5-10
      minutes after first application, but not at Day 1, Day 7 and Day 14 visits. Babies from 6 to
      36 months of age with mild to moderate eczema, who meet the eligibility criteria, will follow
      a similar testing directions in Group B of the study.
