  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to assess the safety and toxicity/adverse events associated with the
      use of low dose fractionated whole brain irradiation in those patients who have been
      diagnosed with probable Alzheimer's disease according to the National Institute of
      Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related
      Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria. As a secondary goal it will establish whether
      or not the intervention with low dose whole brain irradiation might change the recognized
      progression of Alzheimer's Disease. The investigators will also collect information from the
      AMYVID Â® (florbetaben F 18 Injection) positron emission tomography (PET) Scans to determine
      if there is any correlation between neurocognitive/quality of life scores and changes in
      amyloid plaque size, number and location.

      An initial 15 patients will be enrolled in the first treatment scheme (5 daily fractions of 2
      Gy) and will be followed for 12 months after completion of treatment to assess safety and any
      toxicity/adverse events associated with treatment. In Arm 1 the 15 study participants will be
      enrolled in total at Botsford Radiation Oncology Center and William Beaumont Hospital (Royal
      Oak Campus). Once a total combined 15 patients are entered this Arm will be closed.

      The second treatment arm will not be used until the last patient in the first dose arm has
      completed all follow up. At that point patients #16-30 will be enrolled in the second dose
      arm (10 daily fractions of 2 Gy). In Arm 2 the 15 study participants will be enrolled in
      total at both Botsford Hospital Radiation Oncology Center and William Beaumont Hospital
      (Royal Oak Campus). Once a total combined 15 patients are entered this Arm will be closed.

      A total of 30 patients will be enrolled and each will be followed for 12 months to assess
      safety and toxicity/adverse events.
