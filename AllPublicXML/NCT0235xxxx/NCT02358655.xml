  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common heart condition, and increases the risk of stroke by six
      times. There are several medications (blood thinners) that can prevent strokes in AF
      patients. Many AF patients present to the emergency department, but about half of AF patients
      leave without prescription of a blood thinner. The study aims to evaluate if adding options
      like giving a patient education kit, encouraging emergency room physicians to prescribe a
      blood thinner and providing a specialized AF clinic to patients will increase the number
      patients receiving blood thinners to prevent strokes.

      This is a knowledge translation study will occur in three consecutive phases: Phase 1 is a
      retrospective chart review of all patients who presented to the emergency department (ED)
      with ECG documented AF during 1 year prior to study commencement. The main purpose of Phase 1
      is to determine if oral anticoagulants (OACs) were prescribed for eligible AF patients at ED
      discharge. In Phase 2 a low-intensity intervention will be applied in the ED during 6 months,
      involving physician education, distribution of an AF patient education package, short-term
      OAC prescription, and a follow-up letter to the patient's family physician. After a one month
      transition phase, a high intensity intervention will be applied during 6 months in Phase 3.
      Phase 3 incorporates the Phase 2 intervention, and adds immediate follow-up (within 48-72
      hours) in a community AF clinic run by a nurse/pharmacist who is supervised by a specialist
      in AF.

    <description>This outcome measure is meant to determine feasibility for a larger community cluster RCT. This will be measured by the uptake of the interventions described in this study, including: patient use of the AF educational kit, patient use of AF clinic, attendance at educational presentations for patients, family doctors and emergency physicians, patient use of automated text or email reminders for OACs.</description>
