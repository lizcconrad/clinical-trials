      The objective of this study is to determine the effect of preoperative duloxetine on
      postoperative quality of recovery after ambulatory surgery, specifically laparoscopic
      gynecological surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been demonstrated that female patients have poor quality of surgical recovery compared
      to male patients.1 Increased sensitivity to pain and increased susceptibility to
      postoperative nausea and vomiting have been attributed as causal factors.2, 3 Currently, few
      strategies have been shown to improve quality of recovery in female patients undergoing
      laparoscopic hysterectomy.4 A better recovery in female patients undergoing outpatient
      laparoscopy is particularly desirable since those patients do not have access to potent
      intravenous medications and nursing support after hospital discharge.

      In addition, pain after ambulatory surgery remains an unsolved problem in The United States
      and Europe.5,6 It is associated with delayed hospital discharge and it can result to an
      increased opioid consumption with adverse side effects. The concept of multimodal analgesic
      technique was introduced more than 15 years ago and several techniques have been studied over
      the years including NSAIDs, acetaminophen, membrane stabilizers, ketamine, and local and
      regional anesthetic techniques.7,8 Both serotonin and norepinephrine have involvement in
      modulation of pain mechanisms in the central nervous system. Duloxetine is a selective
      serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that has been used for mitigation of pain in
      such conditions as chronic musculoskeletal pain, diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain,
      post-herpetic neuralgia, and fibromyalgia.9,10 Duloxetine was also found to reduce
      postoperative morphine requirements in patients undergoing knee replacement surgery.11 The
      MQOR 40 is a validated instrument that was specifically design to evaluate patient recovery
      after anesthesia and surgery.12 This instrument can be particularly valid to examine
      interventions which affect different spheres of patient recovery as is the case of
      duloxetine.

      A suicidal behavior questionnaire (SBQ-R) will be used to screen for suicidal risk among
      potential subjects. If any subject exhibits suicidal ideation as a result of scoring high on
      the questionnaire, there surgeon and/or primary care provider will be notified by the
      principal investigator.

      The objective of this study is to determine the effect of preoperative duloxetine on
      postoperative quality of recovery after ambulatory surgery.

      Significance: Use of preoperative duloxetine may improve patient's quality of recovery,
      decrease postoperative pain, opioid consumption and opioid related side effects after
      ambulatory surgery.
