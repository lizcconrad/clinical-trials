      A randomised controlled trial comparing volume-targeted ventilation to pressure-limited
      ventilation in infants born at or near term.

      Aims: There is increasing evidence that volume-targeted ventilation (VTV) holds benefits for
      preterm infants in comparison to pressure-limited ventilation. It is not known whether the
      same is true in the case of infants born at term. This study aims to compare pressure-limited
      to VTV in term-born infants.

      Hypothesis: Volume-targeted will be associated with significantly earlier extubation compared
      to pressure-limited ventilation Primary outcome: Time to extubation. Methods: Ventilated
      infants 34 weeks or more gestational age at birth were recruited and randomly allocated to
      receive either pressure-limited or VTV. Adjustments to ventilator settings were made
      according to the trial protocol. Infants were deemed to have met failure criteria if they
      required HFOV or peak pressures of more than 30 cm of water. Analysis will be by
      intention-to-treat.

    <description>In pressure-limited ventilation arm, ventilator settings as required to maintain appropriate oxygenation and carbon-dioxide elimination.
In volume-targeted ventilation arm, set target volume at 5ml/kg and wean rate. In both arms, aim to keep blood gases within normal limits.</description>
