    <textblock>
      Stressors impair optimum function of an individual physiologically and psychologically.
      Overcoming stress is possible when one knows which aspects of life are the most troublesome
      to manage for individuals. There are certain tools available in Pakistan that can measures
      stress in selected populations but there are no validated tools that may quantify stress
      which results from events occurring in different aspects of life.

      Recent Life Changes Questionnaire (RLCQ) is a tool that measures stress of individuals
      through life changing events. It has five categories; work, home and family, health, personal
      and social and financial. The objective of the study is to adapt RLCQ and validate it so that
      it may measure stress among people living in Karachi, Pakistan.

      In order to make RLCQ a tool to measure stress within Pakistani context, we would want to
      adapt RLCQ and then validate it. The study design is a validation study where the construct
      of recent life changing events will be validated by comparing it with a gold standard to
      assess the extent of accuracy of measurement by exploring the agreement between them. The
      mode of data collection is cross-sectional by administering the adapted RLCQ and the gold
      standard simultaneously. Since stress is a subjective phenomenon and serves as a root cause
      for many neurodegenerative diseases and mental disorders, a tool for screening mental
      illnesses is selected against which we could compare the adapted RLCQ for validation. The
      Mini international neuropsychiatric Interviews (MINI) is a structured diagnostic interview
      developed and validated by Sheehan in 1997, Florida. It is based on the DSM IV criteria and
      ICD-10. The design of this study incorporates content and criterion validity as we have a
      pre-existing 'gold standard' which is widely accepted and is in current practice of mental
      health screening in Pakistan.

      The study will be conducted in six phases. Phase I includes conducting qualitative interviews
      to explore the phenomenon. In Phase II, adaptation of RLCQ will be done and review of the
      adapted tool will be done with the help of subject experts. Phase III will verify the face
      validity of the tool by translations and back translations. In Phase IV, pre-testing of the
      tool will be done whereas in phase V, we will administer the tool in the community along with
      conducting MINI interviews. Phase VI tests the reliability of the tool.
