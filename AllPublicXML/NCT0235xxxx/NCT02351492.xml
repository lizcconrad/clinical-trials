  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with gallstone disease should be checked whether a common bile duct (CBD) stone
      could be present. In case of a certain suspicion for CBD stones further investigations should
      be performed. This can either be done by magnetic resonance cholangio-pancreaticography
      (MRCP) or by intraoperative cholangiography. The study investigates which pathway would be
      favorable in regard of an early hospital demission.

      Patients with gallstone disease and suspected bile duct obstruction can be investigated
      either with a magnetic resonance cholangio-pancreaticography (MRCP) prior to gallbladder
      removal or with an intraoperative cholangiography during cholecystectomy. When detecting an
      common bile duct (CBD) stone in MRCP, normally endoscopic removal is performed before an
      operation. When the CBD stone is detected during gallbladder removal instead, endoscopic
      retrograde cannulation of the pancreatic duct (ERCP) will follow after the operation.
      Investigators hypothesize that direct operation shortens the length of hospital stay.
      Therefore investigators randomize patients with elevated Bilirubin, elevated liver enzymes
      (two of the following: aspartate transaminase (ASAT), alanine aminotransferase (ALAT),
      gamma-glutamyltransferase (gGT) or AP), suspected CBD stones in ultrasound or dilated common
      bile ducts either in MRCP first or operation first pathway. All data (patient admission to
      discharge, ...) will be entered in an online database

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients presenting as regular admission or at the emergency department (ED) with
             cholecystolithiasis and suspected CBD stones. The indication for CBD investigation
             requires one of the following features:

             i. Elevated bilirubin ii. ASAT/ALAT or gGT or aP above the normal range (two of them)
             iii. Choledocholithiasis in ultrasound iv. Dilated bile ducts in ultrasound

          -  Written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Age under 18 years

          -  Patients with biliary pancreatitis (due to the fact that conservative treatment is
             initiated before gallbladder removal and therefore leads to a prolonged hospital stay)

          -  Septic patients due to cholangitis

          -  Patients unable to consent

          -  Patients with medical conditions preventing surgery

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Radiologically proven CBD stone
