        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  End Stage primary open-angle glaucoma, pseudoexfoliation glaucoma or pigmentary
             glaucoma in the study eye (EGS criteria)

          -  Optic nerve appearance characteristic of glaucoma in the study eye

          -  Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of counting-fingers, hand movements, light
             perception or no light perception due to glaucomatous loss of central vision in the
             study eye

          -  Patient is treated with 1 to 5 hypotensive medications in the study eye

          -  Unsatisfactory medicated IOP (≥ 18 mmHg) at the screening visit in the study eye

          -  Shaffer grade ≥ III in all four angle quadrants in the study eye

          -  Subject is able and willing to attend all scheduled follow-up exams

          -  Subject understands and signs the informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects presenting 1 or more of the following criteria will not be enrolled in the
             trial:

               -  Ocular conditions with a poorer prognosis in the fellow eye than in the study eye

               -  Closed angle forms of glaucoma in either eye

               -  Congenital or developmental glaucoma in either eye

               -  Other secondary glaucoma (such as neovascular, uveitic, lens-induced,
                  trauma-induced, or glaucoma associated with increased episcleral venous pressure)
                  in the study eye

               -  Peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS), rubeosis or other angle abnormalities in the
                  study eye

               -  Subject has history of penetrating keratoplasty (PKP)

               -  Any previous surgery in the study eye (except for clear corneal cataract surgery)
                  where the conjunctiva is not intact and elastic.

               -  Any ocular disease or history in study eye such as severe dry eye, active
                  proliferative retinopathy, ICE syndrome, epithelial or fibrous down growth, and
                  ocular pathology that may interfere with accurate IOP measurements

               -  Prior surgery for an ab-interno or ab-externo device implanted in or through the
                  Schlemm's canal in the study eye.

               -  Use of oral hypotensive medication for glaucoma for treatment of the fellow eye

               -  Less than the minimum visual function required for driving in the fellow eye:
                  best-corrected visual acuity worse than 20/40 (Snellen equivalent) or Esterman
                  visual field score less than 85%.

               -  History of idiopathic or autoimmune uveitis in either eye

               -  Severe trauma in study eye

               -  active iris neovascularization, previous cyclodestructive procedure, prior
                  scleral buckling procedure, presence of silicone oil, need for glaucoma surgery
                  combined with other ocular procedures or anticipated need for additional ocular
                  surgery in study eye within 12 month period

               -  Vitreous present in anterior chamber, prior vitrectomy or virteous hemorrhage in
                  study eye

               -  Aphakia

               -  Prior vitreoretinal surgery in study eye

               -  Clinically significant ocular inflammation or infection within 90 days prior to
                  screening

               -  Unable to discontinue use of blood thinners in accordance with surgeon's standard
                  preoperative instructions

               -  Uncontrolled systemic disease that in the opinion of the investigator would put
                  the subject's health at risk and/or prevent the subject from completing all study
                  visits

               -  Current participation or participation in another investigational drug or device
                  clinical trial within the last 30 days before screening visit
