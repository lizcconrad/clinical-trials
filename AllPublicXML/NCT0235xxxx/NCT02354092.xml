  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical dilators are frequently used for preparation prior to second trimester surgical
      abortion. While their use decreases complications associated with surgical abortion, their
      placement is often uncomfortable for the patient. Currently there are no proven methods for
      reducing pain during osmotic dilator placement. The use of numbing medication around the
      cervix (paracervical block) may decrease this placement pain.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that 1.21 million abortions were performed in 2008. Of these, approximately
      11% occurred in the second trimester and 1.4% occurred after 21 weeks gestation. In the
      United States, dilation and evacuation (D&amp;E) is the most common method of terminating a
      second trimester pregnancy with greater than 98% of second trimester abortions occurring by
      D&amp;E.

      Pre-procedure cervical preparation decreases the incidence of complications associated with
      D&amp;E. Cervical dilators are often used prior to second trimester D&amp;Es to aid in softening and
      dilating the cervix. Typically, dilator placement occurs the day of the D&amp;E or 1-2 days prior
      and oftentimes occurs in an outpatient clinic setting without anesthesia readily available.
      Many women experience moderate to severe discomfort with osmotic dilator insertion. Providers
      use various methods to minimize this discomfort including PCB, non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs), anxiolytics and narcotics. In particular, PCB and
      NSAIDs are readily available in the clinic setting and can be used for this purpose. There
      is, however, no data to support their efficacy in ameliorating the pain of dilator insertion.

      Paracervical blocks are used commonly to decrease pain in abortion procedures and other
      gynecological procedures. The PCB is thought to work primarily by blocking pain conduction
      via Frankenhauser's plexus. As such, their effect may be most important in relieving the pain
      associated with cervical dilation. In a recent randomized control trial, PCB prior to first
      trimester surgical abortion was found to significantly reduce pain with cervical dilation and
      uterine aspiration. Since osmotic dilator placement primarily involves cervical manipulation
      and dilation, PCB may provide some pain relief over placebo. The research team proposes a
      randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of a PCB in decreasing pain associated
      with osmotic dilator placement. This trial will also provide information about the degree of
      pain that women experience during osmotic dilator placement; information not previously
      known.

Drugs:
Dilapan-S is a hygroscopic cervical dilator made of a patented hydrogel called AQUACRYL. It is a rigid hydrophilic stick that increases in volume by absorbing fluids and comfortably dilating the cervix.
Laminaria is an herbal medicine used to induce labor and abortion. The dried stem of Laminaria mechanically dilates the cervical opening by absorbing water and swelling to several times its original diameter.</description>
