  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      : Fibrosis, in general, is a scarring process, which is characterized by fibroblast
      accumulation and excess deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, which leads to
      distorted organ architecture and function. The contribution of fibrogenesis to impaired
      cardiac function is increasingly recognized. The fibrotic ECM causes increased stiffness and
      induces pathological signaling within cardiomyocytes resulting in progressive cardiac
      failure. Also, the excessive ECM impairs mechano-electric coupling of cardiomyocytes and
      increases the risk of arrhythmias. But today patient treatment and prognosis is based on
      ejection fraction quantification, QRS duration, and symptoms.

      Hypothesis: the increased level of fibrosis quantified using T1 mapping technique, compared
      with normal value, is of prognostic value in patient with dilated cardiomyopathies under
      optimal treatment.

      Methods: 330 patients are planned to be included and followed for 2 years
