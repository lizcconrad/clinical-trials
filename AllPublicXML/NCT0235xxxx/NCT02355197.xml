      Fasting and two hours postprandial blood sugar were done to all cases between 28 and 32 weeks
      and high blood sugar levels were found so Cases were controlled by both diet and insulin.

      The 200 pregnant women with Gestational diabetes mellitus were randomized using automated web
      based randomization system into 2 groups, Group1 received 1 gram L-ascorbic acid (vitamin C
      )per day from the time of diagnosis until the time of delivery in addition to routine
      treatment of diabetes (diet &amp; insulin). Group2 received only the treatment of diabetes
