  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a 7-day randomized, double-blind proof-of-concept pilot study of nitrous oxide
      vs. midazolam in 40 adults (20-60 years) with bipolar disorder (BD) (type I or II). Ongoing
      pharmacological and psychosocial treatments may continue, provided that they have not been
      initiated or significantly modified in the preceding 2 weeks. Participants' current treatment
      as prescribed by clinical psychiatrists will not be modified or interfered in this study. The
      study involves 3 visits. During study visit 1, participants will complete screening to ensure
      study eligibility. This will be done using interview measures. During study visit 2,
      participants will complete anthropomorphic measurements, measurement of endothelial function,
      screening blood work, ECGs, and an anaesthesia screener. During study visit 3, participants
      will receive the treatment (nitrous oxide or midazolam), complete an MRI scan, and complete
      interview measures and self-reports. There will be anthropomorphic measurements taken as
      well. The participant will be required to complete phone interviews and self-reports over the
      subsequent 7 days. There are 4 main predictions: 1. Nitrous oxide will significantly reduce
      depression symptoms vs. midazolam. 2. Nitrous oxide will significantly increase frontal
      cortical perfusion vs. midazolam. 3. Lower perfusion in frontal cortical regions at baseline
      will be associated with greater improvement in depression symptoms following nitrous oxide
      treatment. 4. Poorer endothelial function will be associated with greater improvement in
      depression symptoms following nitrous oxide treatment.
