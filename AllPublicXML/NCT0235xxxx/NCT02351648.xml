      To find out if a transitional care model can reduce the rate of unscheduled readmission to
      the Department of Internal Medicine (DIM) in SGH
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hospital with high readmission rate is view as having lower quality of care High readmission
      rate is view as wasteful healthcare spending

      Primary Aim:

      To find out if a transitional care model can reduce the rate of unscheduled readmission to
      the Department of Internal Medicine (DIM) in SGH A readmission episode is defined as an
      episode of readmission to any tertiary hospital within 30 days after index discharge from SGH

      Secondary Aim:

      To find out if a transitional care model can reduce the number of visits to the emergency
      department in SGH To find out the quality of our transitional care model by using a care
      transition measure (CTM-15)

    <description>Intervention extend from transfer of care to the study team from the initial admission medical team through 90 days after discharge
Intervention in hospital includes the following. Comprehensive discharge planning based on the 6 principles. Discharge planning initially within 24 hours of recruitment Daily ward review of patients Weekly multi-disciplinary meeting Consolidation of medication and follow-up appointment before discharge Assessment of needs before discharge Comprehensive discharge summary and medication record at discharge
Intervention after discharge:
Work done mainly by integrated care nurse Review of patients within 48 hours after discharge via home visit or phone call Subsequent home visit as needed based on patient's needs At least weekly contact with pt or caregiver via telephone Telephone availability working weekday 8 AM to 5 PM Multi-disciplinary meeting for problematic cases Use chronic disease pathway for suitable patients</description>
