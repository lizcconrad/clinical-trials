    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of the sublingual Sufentanil
      Tablet (ST) 30 mcg to the sublingual Placebo Tablet (PT) for the short-term management of
      moderate-to-severe acute post-operative pain in patients after abdominal surgery.

    <measure>Time-weighted Summed Pain Intensity Difference (SPID) Over the 12-hour Study Period (SPID12).</measure>
    <time_frame>12 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure is the summed pain intensity difference to baseline over the 12-hour study period (SPID-12). A pain intensity score ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain) is obtained at baseline and throughout the 12 hour study period. The SPID-12 is calculated by summing the difference between baseline pain score and pain score at each assessment time point.
The observed SPID-12 scores ranged from -42.15 to 71.87 in the active group and -34.96 to 64.37 in the placebo group. A negative score indicates an increase in pain intensity and a higher score indicates a greater decrease in pain intensity.</description>

    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure is the summed pain intensity difference to baseline over the 24-hour study period (SPID-24). A pain intensity score ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain) is obtained at baseline and throughout the 24 hour study period. The SPID-24 is calculated by summing the difference between baseline pain score and pain score at each assessment time point. The observed SPID-24 scores ranged from -70.00 to 148.70 in the active group to -58.09 to 160.24 in the placebo group. A negative score indicates an increase in pain intensity and a higher score indicates a greater decrease in pain intensity.</description>

The observed SPRID scores ranged from -38.08 to 106.82 in the active group and -20.10 to 95.72 in the placebo group. A negative score indicates an increase in pain intensity and decrease in pain relief, while a higher score indicates a greater decrease in pain intensity and increase in pain relief.</description>

        <title>Time-weighted Summed Pain Intensity Difference (SPID) Over the 12-hour Study Period (SPID12).</title>
        <description>The primary outcome measure is the summed pain intensity difference to baseline over the 12-hour study period (SPID-12). A pain intensity score ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain) is obtained at baseline and throughout the 12 hour study period. The SPID-12 is calculated by summing the difference between baseline pain score and pain score at each assessment time point.
The observed SPID-12 scores ranged from -42.15 to 71.87 in the active group and -34.96 to 64.37 in the placebo group. A negative score indicates an increase in pain intensity and a higher score indicates a greater decrease in pain intensity.</description>

          <description>Time-weighted summed pain relief intensity difference (SPRID) over the 24 hour study period. The observed SPRID scores ranged from -49.67 to 222.04 in the active group and -24.97 to 237.54 in the placebo group. A negative score indicates an increase in pain intensity and decrease in pain relief, while a higher score indicates a greater decrease in pain intensity and increase in pain relief.</description>
