  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evaluate the benefit of an intervention by a computer program comprising active breaks, in
      the form of a personalized self-program on functional impairment and / or pain, among
      employees with latent or symptomatic upper extremity MSDs and spine (+/- eyestrain) in
      connection with the computer work environment.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The benefit of the intervention will be assessed among four groups of subjects: symptomatic
      and asymptomatic subjects randomized in control or experimental group.

      Subjects of the experimental group will have to follow an intervention for one month,
      consisting in active breaks from computer work. Control group patients had no intervention.

      Symptoms of MSD will be assessed via questionnaire before and after intervention, in all
      groups.
