  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perioperative hemodynamic optimization requires monitoring adapted to the risks of the
      surgery and the patient. The investigators currently use a local hemodynamic protocol based
      on the data of the literature. According to this protocol, specific patients may require
      cardiac index and central venous oxygen saturation monitoring. the investigators chose to
      monitor the cardiac index (CI) with the transpulmonary thermodilution technique (TPTD)
      (PiCCO, Pulsion Medical System, Munich, Allemagne). The technique is based on the injection
      of a cooled bolus of saline into a central vein with a central venous catheter (CVC). The
      variation of temperature is measured with an arterial femoral catheter and allows the
      assessment of the cardiac output according to Stewart-Hamilton's theory. Many studies showed
      the reliability of this technique (Bein J Cardio Thorac Vasc Anesth 2004, Buhre Cardio thorac
      vasc anesth 1999, Felbinger J Clin ANesth 2005, Felbinger TW J Clin Anetsh 2002, Godie O Ann
      Thorac Surg 1999).

      In our institute, most of the patients are fitted with a port for chemotherapy or parenteral
      nutrition. When PiCCO monitoring is necessary, a central venous catheter is inserted on the
      opposite side of the permanent implantable venous port. Indeed, insertion of the CVC can be
      more difficult because of the port. It may be interesting to use the port for TPTD in order
      to avoid the insertion of a new CVC. This would be possible only if the measurement of CI by
      the port was as reliable as the classical measurement with a CVC.

      The aim of this study was to assess whether measurement of the CI by TPTD was possible and
      reliable via the port. The investigators conducted a prospective study comparing the
      measurement of the CI by TPTD before and after fluid challenge via the port versus the CVC.
