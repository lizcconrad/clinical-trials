  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After completing an up to 2-week screening period, subjects entered an open-label run-in
      induction phase with SUBOXONE (buprenorphine/naloxone) sublingual film for 3 days followed by
      a 4- to 11-day SUBOXONE sublingual film open-label run-in dose-adjustment period to achieve
      buprenorphine dosages ranging from 8 to 24 mg according to the SUBOXONE sublingual film
      prescribing information.

      This is a 24-week non-residential study with participants being randomized after meeting
      randomization criteria. On Day 1 and Day 29 (± 2 days) participants will receive subcutaneous
      injections of 300 mg RBP-6000 or placebo. Thereafter, participants will receive 4 injections
      (once every 28 days ± 2 days) of either 300 mg or 100 mg RBP-6000 doses or placebo.

    <measure>Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of the Percentage of Urine Samples Negative for Opioids Combined With Self-Reports Negative for Illicit Opioid Use Collected From Week 5 Through Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Weekly from Weeks 5-24</time_frame>
    <description>Data represent the count of participants at various percentage abstinence levels. Abstinence was defined as urine samples being negative for opioids AND negative self-reports (obtained from Timeline Followback (TLFB) interviews) for illicit opioid use. The primary endpoint was based on visits in which paired urine samples and self-reports were expected for each subject as specified in the schedule of events. Missing urine drug screen(s) (UDS) samples and/or self-reports were considered as non-negative.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Opioid Craving Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Prior to Injections From Week 5 Through Week 24 Analyzed by Mixed Model for Repeated Measures</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline: Day 1 (prior to dosing), Weeks 5-24</time_frame>
    <description>The opioid craving scale was a 100 mm scale with 0= 'no craving' on the left end and 100= 'strongest craving ever' on the right end of the scale. Participants marked where along the scale reflected their craving for opioids. The full range of the change from baseline scale was therefore 100 (no craving at baseline, strongest craving during study) to -100 (strongest craving at baseline, no craving during study).
Baseline was defined as the last non-missing value prior to subcutaneous injection on Day 1. The opioid craving VAS was completed each week; measurements were taken prior to dosing on weeks 5, 9, 13, 17 and 21.
Negative change from baseline values indicate a lessening of craving symptoms.
Change from baseline was analyzed using a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) with terms for treatment, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as factors and baseline value as a covariate. Center was included in the model as a random effect.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Clinical Global Impression - Improvement Scale (CGI-I) Prior to Injections From Week 5 Through Week 24 Analyzed by Mixed Model for Repeated Measures</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline: Day 1 (prior to dosing), Days 29, 57, 85, 113, 141, 169</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-I was used to rate the change in clinical status since the start of the treatment on an ordinal scale ranging from 1 (very much improved; nearly all better; good level of functioning; minimal symptoms; represents a very substantial change) to 7 (very much worse; severe exacerbation of symptoms and loss of functioning). Baseline was defined as the last non-missing value prior to subcutaneous injection on Day 1. Measurements taken during the treatment period were taken at the end of each 28 day treatment and prior to dosing of the next treatment.
Negative change from baseline values indicate an improved clinical global impression.
Change from baseline was analyzed using a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) with terms for treatment, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as factors and baseline value as a covariate. Center was included in the model as a random effect.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Clinical Global Impression - Severity Scale (CGI-S) Prior to Injections From Week 5 Through Week 24 Analyzed by Mixed Model for Repeated Measures</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline: Day 1 (prior to dosing), Days 29, 57, 85, 113, 141, 169</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S was an assessment completed by the clinician to rate the severity of symptoms on an ordinal scale ranging from 1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill subjects; pathology drastically interferes in many life functions). Baseline was defined as the last non-missing value prior to subcutaneous injection on Day 1. Measurements taken during the treatment period were taken at the end of each 28 day treatment and prior to dosing of the next treatment.
Negative change from baseline values indicate an improvement in the severity of symptoms.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) Through Week 24 Analyzed by Mixed Model for Repeated Measures</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline: Day 1 (prior to dosing), Baseline: Day 1 (prior to dosing), Days 2, 8, 5, 22, 29, 30, 36, 43, 50, 57, 58, 64, 71, 78, 85, 86, 92, 99, 106, 113, 114, 120, 127, 134, 141, 142, 148, 155, 162, 169</time_frame>
    <description>COWS is an 11-item instrument used to assess signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal (Wesson et al., 1999). The score is the sum of the responses for a total range of 0-48. The COWS is commonly used by clinicians treating patients with buprenorphine to monitor the severity of withdrawal. COWS scores below 5 are considered not indicative of withdrawal. Scores from 5 to 12 are considered mild withdrawal; from 13 to 24 moderate withdrawal; 25 to 36 moderately severe withdrawal, and 37-48 severe withdrawal. Negative change from baseline values indicate a lessening of withdrawal symptoms.
Baseline was defined as the last non-missing value prior to subcutaneous injection on Day 1. The COWS was completed each week; measurements were taken prior to dosing on weeks 5, 9, 13, 17 and 21.
Change from baseline was analyzed using a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) with terms for treatment, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as factors and baseline value as a covariate.</description>

    <description>The Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scale (SOWS) contains 16 symptoms whose intensity the participant rates on a scale of 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely) for a full scale of 0 (no withdrawal symptoms) to 64 (extreme withdrawal symptoms). Negative change from baseline values indicate a lessening of withdrawal symptoms.
Baseline was defined as the last non-missing value prior to subcutaneous injection on Day 1. The SOWS was completed each week; measurements were taken prior to dosing on weeks 5, 9, 13, 17 and 21.

    <measure>Participants With Adverse Events During the Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 through Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) = any untoward medical occurrence that develops or worsens in severity after dispensation of the study drug and does not necessarily have a causal relationship to the study drug. Severity was rated by the investigator on a scale of mild, moderate and severe, with severe= a marked limitation in activity. Relation of AE to treatment was determined by the investigator. Serious AEs include death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, OR an important medical event that jeopardized the patient and required medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.</description>

    <measure>Worst Injection Site Pain From Injections 1-6 as Measured by Participant-Reported Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1, 29, 57, 85, 113, 141</time_frame>
    <description>Injection site pain as measured by participant-reported VAS The participant-reported VAS for injection site pain was measured on a 100 mm scale with 'no pain' on the left end and 'strongest pain ever' on the right end of the scale (total scale of 0-100). Participants marked where along the scale reflected their localized injection pain.
The injection site pain VAS scores were obtained (after the completion of the injection) within 1 minute and at 5, 10, 15, 30, 60 and 120 minutes (+- 5 minutes). The timing of the injection site pain VAS should have been measured from the end of the injection.
Data represents the worst pain recorded for each participant across all 6 injections and all VAS records. The mean value is presented.</description>

        <title>Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of the Percentage of Urine Samples Negative for Opioids Combined With Self-Reports Negative for Illicit Opioid Use Collected From Week 5 Through Week 24</title>
        <description>Data represent the count of participants at various percentage abstinence levels. Abstinence was defined as urine samples being negative for opioids AND negative self-reports (obtained from Timeline Followback (TLFB) interviews) for illicit opioid use. The primary endpoint was based on visits in which paired urine samples and self-reports were expected for each subject as specified in the schedule of events. Missing urine drug screen(s) (UDS) samples and/or self-reports were considered as non-negative.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Opioid Craving Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Prior to Injections From Week 5 Through Week 24 Analyzed by Mixed Model for Repeated Measures</title>
        <description>The opioid craving scale was a 100 mm scale with 0= 'no craving' on the left end and 100= 'strongest craving ever' on the right end of the scale. Participants marked where along the scale reflected their craving for opioids. The full range of the change from baseline scale was therefore 100 (no craving at baseline, strongest craving during study) to -100 (strongest craving at baseline, no craving during study).
Baseline was defined as the last non-missing value prior to subcutaneous injection on Day 1. The opioid craving VAS was completed each week; measurements were taken prior to dosing on weeks 5, 9, 13, 17 and 21.
Negative change from baseline values indicate a lessening of craving symptoms.
Change from baseline was analyzed using a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) with terms for treatment, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as factors and baseline value as a covariate. Center was included in the model as a random effect.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Clinical Global Impression - Improvement Scale (CGI-I) Prior to Injections From Week 5 Through Week 24 Analyzed by Mixed Model for Repeated Measures</title>
        <description>The CGI-I was used to rate the change in clinical status since the start of the treatment on an ordinal scale ranging from 1 (very much improved; nearly all better; good level of functioning; minimal symptoms; represents a very substantial change) to 7 (very much worse; severe exacerbation of symptoms and loss of functioning). Baseline was defined as the last non-missing value prior to subcutaneous injection on Day 1. Measurements taken during the treatment period were taken at the end of each 28 day treatment and prior to dosing of the next treatment.
Negative change from baseline values indicate an improved clinical global impression.
Change from baseline was analyzed using a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) with terms for treatment, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as factors and baseline value as a covariate. Center was included in the model as a random effect.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Clinical Global Impression - Severity Scale (CGI-S) Prior to Injections From Week 5 Through Week 24 Analyzed by Mixed Model for Repeated Measures</title>
        <description>The CGI-S was an assessment completed by the clinician to rate the severity of symptoms on an ordinal scale ranging from 1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill subjects; pathology drastically interferes in many life functions). Baseline was defined as the last non-missing value prior to subcutaneous injection on Day 1. Measurements taken during the treatment period were taken at the end of each 28 day treatment and prior to dosing of the next treatment.
Negative change from baseline values indicate an improvement in the severity of symptoms.
Change from baseline was analyzed using a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) with terms for treatment, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as factors and baseline value as a covariate. Center was included in the model as a random effect.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in the Clinical Global Impression - Severity Scale (CGI-S) Prior to Injections From Week 5 Through Week 24 Analyzed by Mixed Model for Repeated Measures</title>
          <description>The CGI-S was an assessment completed by the clinician to rate the severity of symptoms on an ordinal scale ranging from 1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill subjects; pathology drastically interferes in many life functions). Baseline was defined as the last non-missing value prior to subcutaneous injection on Day 1. Measurements taken during the treatment period were taken at the end of each 28 day treatment and prior to dosing of the next treatment.
Negative change from baseline values indicate an improvement in the severity of symptoms.
Change from baseline was analyzed using a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) with terms for treatment, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as factors and baseline value as a covariate. Center was included in the model as a random effect.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) Through Week 24 Analyzed by Mixed Model for Repeated Measures</title>
        <description>COWS is an 11-item instrument used to assess signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal (Wesson et al., 1999). The score is the sum of the responses for a total range of 0-48. The COWS is commonly used by clinicians treating patients with buprenorphine to monitor the severity of withdrawal. COWS scores below 5 are considered not indicative of withdrawal. Scores from 5 to 12 are considered mild withdrawal; from 13 to 24 moderate withdrawal; 25 to 36 moderately severe withdrawal, and 37-48 severe withdrawal. Negative change from baseline values indicate a lessening of withdrawal symptoms.
Baseline was defined as the last non-missing value prior to subcutaneous injection on Day 1. The COWS was completed each week; measurements were taken prior to dosing on weeks 5, 9, 13, 17 and 21.
Change from baseline was analyzed using a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) with terms for treatment, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as factors and baseline value as a covariate.</description>

        <title>Worst Injection Site Pain From Injections 1-6 as Measured by Participant-Reported Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</title>
        <description>Injection site pain as measured by participant-reported VAS The participant-reported VAS for injection site pain was measured on a 100 mm scale with 'no pain' on the left end and 'strongest pain ever' on the right end of the scale (total scale of 0-100). Participants marked where along the scale reflected their localized injection pain.
The injection site pain VAS scores were obtained (after the completion of the injection) within 1 minute and at 5, 10, 15, 30, 60 and 120 minutes (+- 5 minutes). The timing of the injection site pain VAS should have been measured from the end of the injection.
Data represents the worst pain recorded for each participant across all 6 injections and all VAS records. The mean value is presented.</description>

          <title>Worst Injection Site Pain From Injections 1-6 as Measured by Participant-Reported Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</title>
          <description>Injection site pain as measured by participant-reported VAS The participant-reported VAS for injection site pain was measured on a 100 mm scale with 'no pain' on the left end and 'strongest pain ever' on the right end of the scale (total scale of 0-100). Participants marked where along the scale reflected their localized injection pain.
The injection site pain VAS scores were obtained (after the completion of the injection) within 1 minute and at 5, 10, 15, 30, 60 and 120 minutes (+- 5 minutes). The timing of the injection site pain VAS should have been measured from the end of the injection.
Data represents the worst pain recorded for each participant across all 6 injections and all VAS records. The mean value is presented.</description>
