    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to study since 1987 all patients diagnosed with CD in Sweden and
      determine their outcomes including mortality. A secondary objective is to focus on patients
      in remission and identify determinants of their different outcomes.

      This study is a retrospective nationwide study of all patients in Sweden with diagnosis CD
      between 1987 and 2013 were baseline data at diagnosis, information about the different
      treatments and follow-up data is going to be obtained by reviewing patients' medical
      journals. This information as well as the exact diagnose criteria for each patient are going
      to be extracted by Endocrinologists in all University Hospitals in Sweden. An expert group at
      the Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg will put together the data.By the use of
      the Swedish Personal Number, the investigators are going to obtain information about both
      patients' and background population co-morbidities which have been collected in the different
      Swedish Registers.

      Primary aim:

      To study mortality of CD in Sweden.

      Secondary aims:

        1. To study the influence of CD on myocardial infarction

        2. To study the influence of CD on stroke

        3. To study the influence of CD on cancer

        4. To study the influence of CD on hip fracture risk

        5. To study incidence and prevalence of CD in Sweden.
