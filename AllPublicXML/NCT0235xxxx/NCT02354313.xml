      A phase III multicenter, randomized study with Lenalidomide (Revlimid®) maintenance versus
      observation after intensified induction regimen containing rituximab followed by high dose
      chemotherapy and Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation as first line treatment in adult
      patients with advanced Mantle Cell Lymphoma: IIL study (MCL0208).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled study to determine the
      efficacy and safety of lenalidomide as maintenance therapy versus observation in patients
      with MCL in complete or partial remission after first line intensified and high-dose
      chemotherapy additioned with rituximab and followed by ASCT. This study will be conducted in
      three phases: a Screening Phase, a Treatment Phase and a Follow-up Phase

             whose tumors are negative for the cyclin D1, evidence of overexpression of cyclin D2
             or D3 by immunohistochemistry will be acceptable.

          3. Age ≥18 years and &lt; 60 with ECOG performance status 0-3, or an age from 60 to 65 years
             with an ECOG performance status 0-2, except when PS impairment is related to NHL.

             alkaline phosphatase&gt;2.5 times the upper normal value (unless these abnormalities are
             due to liver involvement of lymphoma).

          9. Abnormal renal function (serum creatinine &gt;2.0 mg/dL), unless it is disease related

         10. Patients with active opportunistic infections.

         11. Known seropositive for or active viral infection with human immunodeficiency virus
             (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV). Patients who are
             seropositive because of hepatitis B virus vaccine are eligible. Patients with HBcAb
             serology, will not be excluded from the study and be given lamivudine as prophylaxis
             starting one week before chemotherapy. HbsAg and AST/ALT ifHBV DNA is not available,
             will be monitored every three weeks. If HBV DNA is available, it will be monitored
             along with HBsAg
