  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to define the sensitivity and specificity of a novel continuous noninvasive
      blood pressure monitor.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A novel continuous noninvasive blood pressure monitor is compared to invasive arterial
      measurement at postoperative care unit after a planned operation. Monitor captures also
      saturation and ECG, which are compared to traditional monitoring.
