  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological diseases.Approximately 53 million people
      suffering from chronic recurrent epilepsy in 1990 and that number increased about 58 million
      in 2005.

      The annual incidence of epilepsy varies considerably in different epidemiological studies,
      ranging from 11 cases per 100,000 general population to 230 cases per 100,000 people.

      To date there has been discovered the ideal Antiepileptic Drugs. The drug, ie, that are safe
      and effective, it has good daily administration frequency, easily administered from all
      roads, which has high bioavailability, which is not highly bound to proteins, and not holding
      inductive or inhibitory effect.

      There are broad-spectrum anticonvulsant, which means that a drug can be very effective for a
      patient, but may or may not regulate and increase the frequency of another crisis. Thus there
      remains now only to choose one among a number of drugs, the most appropriate.This study
      intends to register within 12 months clinical practice in Greek reality as regards the
      elements of diagnosis and management of patients with epilepsy and those who already are, or
      are part of treatment with levetiracetam.

      The aims of this clinical study is to record data on

        -  the diagnosis

        -  The management of epilepsy in daily clinical practice in a sample of Greek population

        -  The monitoring of patients entering or already undergoing treatment with levetiracetam.

        -  The assessment of quality of life between visits of the study by using quality of life
           QOLIE-31 questionnaire

        -  The economic evaluation of the change in treatment from original to generic
           levetiracetam This is a data recording study and evaluation of treatment with
           levetiracetam. The study will take place in 15 antiepileptic centers throughout Greece.
           Researchers will have to successively record all incidents of patients (30 per center)
           with epilepsy, which are new diagnoses or already diagnosed and are treated with
           levetiracetam.

        The study will recruit outpatients who are new epilepsy diagnoses or diagnosed prior to
        enrollment in the study and treated with levetiracetam for the management of their disease.
        All patients will be included from 15 research centers nationwide. Each center will include
        â‰¥30 patients to be monitored (1: 1 newly diagnosed / older diagnoses).
