    <textblock>
      The proposed research brings together complementary expertise to systematically elucidate the
      longitudinal effects of (1) total and regional body fat and (2) the metabolic impairment that
      accompanies obesity on bone development during growth. The contribution of this research will
      be significant because it will provide a solid foundation for understanding the influence of
      fat (total and regional distribution) on overall bone strength, and whether insulin
      resistance, beta-cell dysfunction, abnormal lipids, and inflammation could be underpinning
      factors in the fat-bone strength relationship via effects on bone modeling activity. This
      knowledge will provide critical information needed to maximize potential therapeutic
      interventions to counter the linked risks of obesity and osteoporosis, both major public
      health concerns.

      The overall goal of this study is to clarify the relationship of adiposity with bone
      development during adolescence, and to explicate the mechanisms that regulate the effect of
      excess adiposity on bone. In this effort, we will conduct a 2-year longitudinal study in 400
      children and adolescents aged 9-15 years. Using the peak adolescent growth period as a model
      for probing determinants of bone health may allow for a clearer picture of the processes that
      regulate bone development, as these processes are highly active at this growth stage. Unlike
      other studies with surrogates for adiposity, we plan to measure total and central adiposity
      directly, using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and magnetic resonance imaging. Both
      bone quantity and bone quality, the two principal determinants of bone strength, will be
      assessed by peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) at weight-bearing (tibia) and
      non-weight-bearing (radius) skeletal sites. Peripheral QCT provides 3-dimensional bone
      measurements that are not confounded by changes in bone size, a significant confounder of
      most past studies, which have relied on 2-dimensional bone imaging techniques. To identify
      mechanistic factors, which may explain the effect of adiposity on bone development, we will
      measure arterial stiffness, endothelial function, and fasting levels of glucose, insulin,
      lipids, and C-reactive protein (CRP) to assess how vascular dysfunction, insulin resistance,
      abnormal lipids, and inflammation are related to bone modeling activity, as measured by serum
      markers of bone formation and resorption. All measurements will be assessed at baseline and
      after 1 and 2 years of follow-up.
