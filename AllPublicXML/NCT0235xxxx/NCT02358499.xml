  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this study is to see how the body breaks down an antifungal drug named
      posaconazole in children with certain cancers, blood disorders, or transplantation of bone
      marrow or similar blood cells. This study will also help us learn whether a child's age,
      genetics, or disease affect how well the body breaks down posaconazole.

      The purpose of this research study is to see how the body breaks down posaconazole, which has
      limited data in children. Posaconazole injection has been approved by the FDA for prevention
      or treatment of certain fungal infections in adult patients. In children, however, we don't
      have data on how best to give posaconazole or whether the dosing should be personalized to
      individual children. This study aims to determine pharmacokinetics of posaconazole aqueous
      solution for injection in children aged 2 through 17 years and explores differences in drug
      exposure by age, genetics, and disease state. Children will receive a single dose of
      posaconazole injection and have their blood levels of posaconazole checked. The study will
      also check for safety after giving the posaconazole.

    <description>Posaconazole concentrations in the plasma will be measured after a single dose of posaconazole injection to estimate the area under the concentration-versus-time curve (AUC).
