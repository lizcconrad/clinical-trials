  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-dose, randomized, placebo-controlled, 3-way crossover study of 2 dosage
      strengths of E2006 (5 mg and 10 mg) in subjects with insomnia disorder.
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will have 2 phases: Prerandomization and Randomization. The Prerandomization Phase
      will consist of 2 periods that taken together, will last up to a maximum of 21 days: a
      Screening Period and a Baseline Period. The Randomization Phase will comprise 4 treatment
      periods (Treatment 1, Treatment 2, Treatment 3, Treatment 4) with intervening washout periods
      between treatment periods (Washout 1, Washout 2, Washout 3). A single dose of study drug will
      be administered in a randomized, 3-way double-blind crossover manner at Treatment Periods
      1-3; flurazepam 30 mg will be administered in an open-label manner at Treatment Period 4.

    <description>The MSLT is a widely used method for objectively quantifying excessive, pathological, or pharmacologically induced residual sleepiness. For this study, MSLT will be modified to have 4 Sleep Latency Tests (SLT)s, with the first starting at 45 minutes after morning wake time, and subsequent SLTs occurring at 30-minute intervals, for a total of 4 SLTs per modified MSLT. The average SOL from the M-MSLT at screening will be used as baseline.</description>

                  intrauterine device, a double-barrier method [such as condom plus diaphragm with
                  spermicide], a contraceptive implant, an oral contraceptive, or have a
                  vasectomized partner with confirmed azoospermia) throughout the entire study
                  period or for 28 days after study drug discontinuation.

               2. Are currently abstinent, and do not agree to use a double barrier method (as
                  described above) or refrain from sexual activity during the study period or for

                  drug discontinuation.

             NOTE: All females will be considered to be of childbearing potential unless they are
             postmenopausal (amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive months, in the appropriate age
             group, and without other known or suspected cause) or have been sterilized surgically

             of certain sleep disorders other than insomnia.

          5. Reports experiencing within the past year confusional arousals, symptoms of REM
             Behavior Disorder, or sleep-related violent behavior on Munich Parasomnia Scale

             ECG at Screening (repeated only if initial ECG indicates a QTc interval greater than
             450 ms).

         10. Any suicidal ideation with intent with or without a plan at Screening or within 6
             months of Screening or any lifetime suicidal behavior.

             gastrointestinal, renal, psychiatric or neurological disease, or chronic pain) that in
             the opinion of the investigator(s) could affect the subject's safety or interfere with
             the study assessments.

         12. Used any prohibited prescription or over-the-counter concomitant medications within 2
             weeks prior to Screening, or between Screening and Randomization.

         13. Used any modality of treatment for insomnia, including cognitive behavioral therapy or
             marijuana within 2 weeks prior to Screening, or between Screening and Randomization.

         14. Scheduled for surgery during the study.

         15. Transmeridian travel across more than 3 time zones in the 2 weeks before Screening, or
             between Screening and Baseline, or plans to travel more than 3 times zones during the
             study.

         16. Hypersensitivity to flurazepam, the study drug, or any of the excipients.

         17. Currently enrolled in another clinical trial or used any investigational drug or
