      The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the effects of Atomoxetine(ATX) and osmotic
      release oral system-methylphenidate (OROS-MPH) therapies on executive functions, activities,
      treatment response time and adverse effects based on discernible clinical effects in children
      with combined type attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

      The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the effects of Atomoxetine(ATX) and osmotic
      release oral system-methylphenidate (OROS-MPH) therapies on executive functions, activities,
      treatment response time and adverse effects based on discernible clinical effects in children
      with combined type attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

      In this study, the functional capabilities of the patients who clinically responded well to
      therapy were assessed simultaneously with clinical response that may appear at different time
      periods and the treatment groups were compared in patients who responded to therapy by
      excluding patients with insufficient clinical response.

    <measure>Effects of Atx and Oros-mph on Executive Functions, measured by Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, Stroop Test TBAG Form and Visual Auditory Digit Span B</measure>
    <time_frame>20 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Wisconsin Card Sorting Test:WCST measures cognitive processes such as administrative control, characterization, perseveration, executive function, conceptualization, abstract thinking and reasoning, and it is mainly linked to frontal lobe .
Stroop Test TBAG Form:Stroop test is closely related to frontal lobe and many other serebral regions. It provides information about several cognitive processes such as selective attention, response inhibition, interference control and input processing speed.
Visual Auditory Digit Span B:VADS B is a test measures short-term memory, sequencing and sensorimotor integration.
The tests were applied to all patients after diagnosis and evaluations.Recovery score decreasing to 2 or 1 according to CGI-I was set as time for repetition of tests. The tests were repeated at any time of day in ATX group while they were repeated within first 60-180 minutes after ingestion of drug in OROS MPH group.</description>
