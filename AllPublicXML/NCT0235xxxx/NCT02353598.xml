  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-arm study will evaluate the
      safety and tolerability of at least two dose levels of intravenous (IV) crenezumab in 24-72
      participants with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease (AD) (mini-mental state examination
      [MMSE] 18 to 28 points, inclusive). An optional open-label extension (OLE) will be offered
      after the completion of initial double-blind stage.
