      The purpose of this research study is to look at participants with solid tumor malignancies
      and specific mutations respond to treatment with everolimus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer is a molecularly heterogeneous disease comprised of complex genomic alterations in
      common and overlapping pathways. Somatic inactivating mutations in tuberous sclerosis complex
      1 (TSC1) gene were recently identified as potential markers of response to mTOR therapy.
      Everolimus is an oral derivative of rapamycin. At the cellular and molecular level,
      everolimus acts as a signal transduction inhibitor, and selectively inhibits mTOR. We
      hypothesize that everolimus will exhibit clinical activity in solid malignancies harboring
      TSC1, TSC2, NF1, NF2, or STK11 mutations.

             previously treated.

          -  A history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or
             biologic composition to everolimus or other agents used in the study.

             throughout the trial and adjusted as necessary.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure of NYHA class III or IV, active
             coronary artery disease, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, myocardia
             infraction ≤ 6 months prior to start of everolimus, uncontrolled hypertension

             chronic hepatitis, known severely impaired lung function (spirometry and DLCO 50% or
             less of normal and 02 saturation 88% or less at rest on room air), active bleeding
             diathesis, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

             pregnancy test within 14 days of study entry.

          -  Known HIV-positivity on combination antiretroviral therapy because of the potential
             for pharmacokinetic interactions with everolimus. In addition, these patients are at
             increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy.
             Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination
             antiretroviral therapy when indicated.
