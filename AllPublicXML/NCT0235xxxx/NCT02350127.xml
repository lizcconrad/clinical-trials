  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nearly 1 in 10 older Veterans have dementia, which is a devastating condition that leads to a
      progressive loss of independence and functional status. Currently available dementia
      medications do not alter the disease course. Therefore, it is critically important to
      identify effective strategies for helping older Veterans living with dementia to enhance
      their functional status and quality of life. The investigators have developed a novel,
      integrative exercise program called Preventing Loss of Independence through Exercise (PLIE)
      that incorporates elements from Eastern and Western exercise modalities and is designed to
      build and maintain the capacity to perform basic functional movements while increasing
      mindful body awareness and enhancing social connection. Pilot study results suggest that PLIE
      is associated with meaningful improvements in physical function, cognitive function and
      quality of life as well as reduced caregiver burden. The goal of the current study is to
      perform a full-scale randomized, controlled trial to test the efficacy of PLIE in older
      Veterans with dementia.

      The goal of the proposed study is to perform a randomized, controlled trial (RCT) to test the
      efficacy of a novel integrative exercise program called Preventing Loss of Independence
      through Exercise (PLIE) on function and quality of life in older Veterans living in the
      community with dementia. Dementia is a devastating condition that affects nearly 1 in 10
      older Veterans (~1 million individuals). Current dementia medications have minimal impact on
      function and quality of life and do not stop or slow the disease course; however, there is
      growing evidence that behavioral interventions such as exercise have a variety of beneficial
      effects in individuals with dementia. PLIE was developed based on recent discoveries in
      neuroscience and experimental psychology that have found that, although explicit memory (the
      ability to consciously recall new information) is impaired in individuals with dementia,
      implicit memory (unconscious learning that typically occurs through repeated exposure) is
      relatively preserved. Therefore, PLIE focuses on training procedural memory (unconscious
      learning of procedures) to build the strength and capacity to perform the movements that are
      most needed for daily function (e.g., transitioning safely from sitting to standing). In
      addition, to maximize the benefits of the training, PLIE integrates elements of Eastern and
      Western exercise modalities to develop mindful body awareness and enhance social connection.
      The investigators have recently completed a pilot study of the PLIE program at an adult day
      center in San Francisco, CA, finding that it was associated with clinically meaningful
      improvements in cognitive function, physical performance and quality of life as well as
      reduced caregiver burden when compared with usual care at the facility. The current study
      will enable the investigators to build on these pilot study results by performing a
      full-scale RCT at adult day centers in Northern California. Most VA Medical Centers currently
      contract with community-based organizations to provide adult day care to eligible Veterans
      with dementia. Therefore, sites for the current study will be adult day centers that have
      current contracts with local VA medical centers. Within each center, study participants will
      be randomly assigned to receive the PLIE intervention program (1 hour, 2-3 days/week, 4
      months) or Usual Care (UC) control (standard center activities, 1 hour, 2-3 days/week, 4
      months) (N=120, 60/group) using a waitlist design. The co-primary outcomes are 4-month change
      in physical function (Short Physical Performance Battery, SPPB), cognitive function
      (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - cognitive subscale, ADAS-cog) and quality of life
      (Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease, QOL-AD). Changes in caregiver feelings (Caregiver
      Burden Inventory, CBI; Positive Aspects of Caregiving, PAC), fear of falling (Falls Efficacy
      Scale, FES), independence (Disability Assessment for Dementia, DAD) and dementia-related
      behaviors (Neuropsychiatric Inventory, NPI) will be examined as secondary outcomes. To
      account for the waitlist design, all outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 4 months and 8
      months. The proposed project will address a critically important Veterans' health problem
      related to optimizing functional status and quality of life in older Veterans with dementia.
      It is directly responsive to Request for Applications (RFA) RX-14-011 (RR&amp;D Merit Review
      Award for Research on Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Parkinson's Disease and Alzheimer's
      Disease), which has identified &quot;pioneering new and innovative rehabilitation methodologies to
      restore function and improve quality of life for Veterans living with [these]
      neurodegenerative diseases&quot; as a &quot;major focus.&quot; Many patients and caregivers currently feel
      that little is being done to help individuals with dementia maintain function and quality of
      life. The current study will utilize rigorous research methods to test the efficacy of an
      innovative and promising new program for older adults with dementia. If the program is
      successful, the investigators will work with VA and community-based organizations to
      implement PLIE more broadly.

    <measure>Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SPPB was developed by the National Institute on Aging to provide an objective tool for measuring physical performance in older adults. Lower body strength is assessed based on time to complete 5 chair stands without using arms. Balance is assessed based on the ability to hold different stands for 10 seconds, including the side-by-side, semi-tandem and full tandem stands. Mobility is assessed based on usual walking speed over a 3-meter walking course. The total SPPB score is the sum of the 3 component scores and may range from 0 to 12. Prior studies have found that the SPPB is valid and reliable and associated with important outcomes including disability and mortality. A recent systematic review concluded that the SPPB was one of the best tools available to measure physical performance in older adults based on reliability, validity and responsiveness.</description>

    <description>The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) is one of the most commonly used outcome measures in dementia drug treatment trials and is one of the measures considered by the Food and Drug Administration for approval of dementia medications. It includes direct assessment of learning (10-word list), naming (objects), following commands, constructional praxis (figure copying), ideational praxis (mailing a letter), orientation (person, time, place), recognition memory and remembering test instructions and is scored on an 80-point scale with higher scores reflecting worse cognitive function. Prior studies have found the ADAS-cog to be valid and reliable with Cronbach's alpha greater than 0.8 and test-retest reliability above 0.9.</description>

    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Quality of Life Scale in Alzheimer's Disease (QOL-AD) is a standard quality of life measure that asks parallel questions of affected individuals and caregivers. Current quality of life is rated as poor (1 point), fair (2 points), good (3 points) or excellent (4 points) in 13 areas: physical health, energy, mood, living situation, memory, family, marriage, friends, self as a whole, ability to do chores around the house, ability to do things for fun, money, and life as a whole. Scores may range from 13 to 52 with higher scores reflecting better quality of life. Prior studies have found that the QOL-AD is a valid and reliable measure, with Cronbach's alpha of 0.84 for patient reports and 0.86 for caregiver reports and interrater reliability based on Cohen's kappa values &gt;0.70.</description>

The DAD has high established validity and high test-retest reliability (ICC, 0.96), inter-rater reliability (ICC, 0.95) and internal consistency (Chronbach's alpha, 0.96).</description>
