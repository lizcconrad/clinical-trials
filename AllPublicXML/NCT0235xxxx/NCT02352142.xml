  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this proposal is to conduct a replication study of Family Nurture Intervention
      (FNI) at CHoNJ. FNI facilitates mother-infant interactions that are vital to early
      development. These include early and repeated mother/infant calming interactions during the
      NICU stay, such as interactive touch with vocal soothing, sustained reciprocal olfactory
      exposure and family practice in comforting, and systematically implemented skin to skin
      holding. This has already been studied at CHONY. Findings reveal that infants who receive FNI
      have significant increases in EEG power, a measure of brain activity, near to term age, when
      compared with those who receive Standard Care.

      There will be two groups; STANDARD CARE (SC) and INTERVENTION (FNI). In addition, 10 pilot
      subjects will be enrolled to train the staff involved in the procedures used in this
      Randomized Control Trial (RCT). The pilot patients will be enrolled identical to study
      patients and will be encouraged to participate fully. They will not be included in the
      analysis of the RCT.

      The STANDARD CARE group will receive current standard of care in NICU. The INTERVENTION
      group, in addition to the standard care, will receive the FNI intervention, which will be
      facilitated by our Nurture Specialists. In addition to the SC and FNI groups, there will be a
      third non-randomized group of infants born at term age who will receive standard care for
      newborns at CHoNJ. Assessments in the NICU will include physiological measures (ECG EEG),
      measures of maternal sensitivity through recorded mother-infant interactions and a variety of
      specimen collections (saliva, blood, and breast milk samples). The investigators will be
      conducting two follow up studies, at 4 months corrected age and at 12 months corrected age.
      The investigators will test the immediate and long-term effects of this approach to the
      development of preterm infants.

      The investigators hypothesize that this intervention will alter a wide range of indices of
      physiological regulatory capacities, and increase brain activity as measured by EEG (power
      and coherence) such that a brain activation pattern in the intervention group will be more
      similar to that of full term infants as opposed to the standard care group. Longer term
      indices of mother psychological and infant neurobehavioral outcomes will also be improved
      when assessed during the first few months of life.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the value of the current approach of encouraging
      contact between mothers and their babies (Standard Care) in the NICU with a more wide ranging
      enhanced approach (Family Nurture Intervention). This approach is based on enhancing aspects
      of maternal nurturing including mother-infant reciprocal calming, which are vital to early
      development. A specific goal is to improve the mother's view of her baby, reduce negative
      emotions about having delivered a baby prematurely, and help her gain confidence in her
      caretaking abilities. Since preterm babies are often easily upset, this study will facilitate
      mothers in comforting and calming their babies. An earlier study at Morgan Stanley Children's
      Hospital of New York (CHONY) has shown positive outcomes in the enhanced treatment group in a
      variety of areas, including EEG brain activity at term age. Assessments in the NICU and in
      secondary follow-up measures at 4, and 12 months of age will test the immediate and long-term
      effects of this new enhanced approach to the nurture of prematurely born infants. We will
      undertake a replication study on patients in the NICU at CHoNJ to confirm and further
      elucidate the positive effects of enhanced nurturing.

      We hypothesize that enhanced nurturing will alter a wide range of physiologic regulatory
      capacities, reduce morbidity, decrease Length of Stay (LOS) and increase brain activity as
      measured by EEG (power and coherence). In addition this approach may influence a brain
      activation pattern (particularly in the area of the anterior cerebral cortex responsible for
      executive decision-making) in the intervention group that is more similar to that of a full
      term infant. Longer term measures of mother's psychological and infant's neurobehavioral
      outcomes will also be improved when assessed during the first few months of life.

      This study aims to replicate and build on an existing study at Morgan Stanley Children's
      Hospital of New York (CHONY) that compares the current protocol for encouraging mother/infant
      interactions (standard care) with a multifaceted intervention to enhance mother and infant
      bonding (Family Nurture Intervention - FNI). The FNI was piloted and studied in a cohort of
      150 mother-infant pairs at CHONY beginning in 2009. While the study is ongoing, significant
      differences in brain activity of these preterm infants was found at term as measured by EEG
      power in the intervention premature infants as compared to the standard care group, with no
      increased risk of morbidity or mortality in the intervention group. The study demonstrated
      that the approach may influence a brain activation pattern (particularly in the area of the
      anterior cerebral cortex responsible for executive decision-making) in the intervention group
      that is more similar to that of a full term infant (38-42 weeks gestation).

      This and other research warrants the investigation of better intervention strategies that can
      reduce morbidity and ameliorate adverse outcomes in these infants.

      The purpose of this current study is to determine whether the findings from CHONY are
      replicable, the efficacy of the FNI protocol in improving developmental outcomes in preterm
      births in a different cohort (at CHoNJ) and to compare the outcomes of patients in two
      different hospital environments.

      The study will again compare the current standard of care in the NICU, which includes
      periodic skin-to-skin holding, to a Family Nurture Intervention (FNI) which adds other
      interventions: interactive touch with vocal soothing, sustained reciprocal olfactory
      exposure, and family modeling and practice in comforting as well as a more systematic
      implementation of skin-to-skin holding. The behavioral, neurobiological and clinical insights
      gained from this project may eventually lead to better prevention of developmental disorders,
      reduced morbidity and more effective clinical intervention strategies both in the neonatal
      intensive care unit (NICU) and after discharge. We hypothesize that the treated babies will
      show better results in the primary outcome measure in the short term and secondary long term
      as compared to infants undergoing standard care.

    <measure>Mother-Infant Interactions Assessments: Evaluating the qualities of the mother's interaction with her infant during diaper change</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 months corrected age</time_frame>
    <description>Videos of infant's diaper change are obtained and coded by research team members unfamiliar with the dyads' group assignment at 4 months corrected age. The mother is instructed to undress her infant, remove the diaper, wipe clean, and re-dress her infant. These familiar caregiving procedures represent a mild, ecologically valid stressor. Maternal behavior is coded, using a 9-point Likert scale for: (a) Acceptance vs. Rejection; (b) Soothing capability; (c) Consideration vs. Intrusiveness; (d) Quality of Physical Contact; and (e) Quality of Vocal Contact.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 12 months corrected age</time_frame>
    <description>A split-screen filming session is conducted following protocols and analyzed by team members 'blind' to the dyads' group assignments at 4, 12, and 24 months corrected age. The videotapes consist of: (1) mother-infant play; (2) stranger-infant play (3) diaper change; (4) the Still Face protocol in which mothers assume an expressionless face for two minutes. Primary measures are: infant gaze aversion, mother-infant gaze coordination, infant distress, maternal interaction style (affectionate vs. intrusive), and responses of mothers and infants to gaze aversion. Additionally, research staff blind to group assignment will assess the quality of the mother-infant interaction with the Biphasic Emotional Connection Scale.</description>
