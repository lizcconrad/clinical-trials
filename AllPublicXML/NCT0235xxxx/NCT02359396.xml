  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized open-label, three-arm, phase 1 clinical study. The investigators aim to
      investigate a Chinese Proprietary Medicine, MZRW on its tolerability, system exposure and
      pharmacokinetics profile.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, three-arm study. The participants will be enrolled and
      randomized in a ratio of 1:1:1 to receive 5.0g, 7.5g, 10g b.i.d. of MZRW at 9 am
      respectively. The study drug, MZRW will be administrated to the participants by site
      personnel after participants have fasted overnight for more than 8 hours and 6 hours after
      administration. Each participant will consume a standardized meal. In addition, the
      participants refrain from Semen Cannabis Sativae, Semen Pruni Armeniacae, Radix Paeoniae,
      Fructus Immaturus Citri Aurantii, Cortex Magnoliae and Radix et Rhizoma Rhei foods for 3 days
      before the study until completion of the study.

      Blood samples (5 ml each) will be collected from the medial cubital vein into evacuated tubes
      containing heparin just before and at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12h after administration and
      were immediately centrifuged (1700g, 10 min). Plasma fractions were stored at -20°C until
      analysis. All study procedures conduct in accordance with the ethical principles of the
      Declaration of Helsinki, consistent with Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and approved by
      Hong Kong Baptist University Ethics Committee on the Use of Human Subjects for Teaching and
      Research. Subjects will be given their written informed consent before participating in the
      study. Urine samples (50 ml each) will be collected the day before the administration and at
      0 to 3h, 3 to 6h, 6 to 9h and 9 to 12h after administration. Plasma and urine fractions will
      be stored at -80°C until analysis.
