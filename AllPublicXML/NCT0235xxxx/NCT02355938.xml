  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to compare the clinical outcomes of cure and recurrence
      of Clostridium difficile infection in spinal cord injured patients who are treated with oral
      Fidaxomicin vs. oral Vancomycin. The secondary aim of this study is to compare the overall
      costs of treatment of Clostridium difficile infection in the two study groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent clinical trials, comparing oral Vancomycin versus oral Fidaxomicin to treat
      Clostridium difficile, oral Fidaxomicin was shown to be the same in effectiveness as oral
      Vancomycin, but showed a decrease in recurrence of Clostridium difficile by ten percentage
      points. Based on experience with patients in our 40-bed spinal cord injury unit at the
      Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center (MEDVAMC), Clostridium difficile infection is more
      problematic in patients with spinal cord injury than in the general hospitalized patient
      population. Compared to the general population of hospitalized patients, patients with spinal
      cord injury are more likely to have: (1) a higher transmission of Clostridium difficile from
      one patient to another often via the health care worker due to their having a neurogenic
      bowel (2) a longer and more complicated course of Clostridium difficile infection-associated
      diarrhea since neurogenic bladder may delay excretion of toxins and predispose to bowel
      accidents; and (3) a higher overall cost of treatment in terms of extended hospitalization
      (most patients with spinal cord injury who suffer from Clostridium difficile infection do not
      get discharged from the hospital until the symptoms of course of Clostridium difficile
      infection are resolved. Fidaxomicin is the first in a new class of narrow spectrum
      macrocyclic antibiotic drugs. It is a non-systemic, meaning it is minimally absorbed into the
      bloodstream, and it is bactericidal, meaning it attacks and kills the bacteria it comes in
      contact with. It has demonstrated selective eradication of pathogenic Clostridium difficile
      with minimal disruption to the numerous species of bacteria that make up the normal, healthy
      intestinal flora. The maintenance of normal physiological conditions in the colon can reduce
      the probability of recurrence of a Clostridium difficile infection. Since clearance of
      Clostridium difficile infections is problematic in the spinal cord injured patients, this
      antimicrobial agent may show a trend for clinical superiority and a reduction in recurrence
      of infection within the spinal cord injury population resulting in a shorter hospital stays
      and reduced costs.
