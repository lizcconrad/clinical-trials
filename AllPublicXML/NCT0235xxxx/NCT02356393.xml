      Association between serum magnesium and clinical outcome in patients with acute MI (AMI) with
      1 year follow-up in 300 patients in regions supplied by desalinated drinking water (DSW)
      (Sheba MC) and 150 patients in regions with non-desalinated drinking water (DW) (Nahariya
      MC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Extensive seawater desalination in Israel may decrease magnesium in drinking water (DW),
      causing hypomagnesemia and adverse health effects. We study the association between
      consumption of desalinated drinking water (DSW) and serum magnesium in acute MI (AMI)
      patients, Subjects 35-75 years of age with the first AMI will be prospectively recruited
      during 1 year from 2 regions; the Departments of Cardiology at the Sheba Medical center (300
      patients, predominantly served by DSW) and the Nahariya Medical Center (150 patients, served
      by non-DSW). Questionnaire will be developed to collect data on demographic variables (at
      home and work), water and beverages consumption habits (tap water, mineral water), dietary
      sources of Mg and Mg supplementations. Mg levels will be measured in DW from the patients'
      homes and in their serum on admission.
