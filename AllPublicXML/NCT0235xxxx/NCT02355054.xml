      The purpose of this study is to provide clinical access to PET/CT and PET/MRI with C-11
      choline for evaluation of men with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer while awaiting
      approval of the Washington University Abbreviated New Drug Application for C-11 choline.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient must have biopsy-proven adenocarcinoma of the prostate initially treated with
             curative intent (surgery and radiation therapy are most common treatments but other
             treatments are also eligible).

          2. Biochemical recurrence defined as any of the following:

               -  PSA ≥ 0.2 ng/mL in at least two sequential tests for patients treated with
                  surgery.

               -  PSA ≥ 2.0 ng/mL above the post therapy nadir for patients treated with radiation
                  therapy, brachytherapy or cryotherapy.

               -  PSA ≥ 2.0 ng/ml above the most recent therapy nadir for patients who have
                  received additional treatment in the recurrent setting.

          3. Patient must have undergone standard-of-care restaging that does not clearly identify
             site(s) of active disease. Standard staging examinations may include one or more of
             the following: CT or MRI, bone imaging (either Tc-99m bisphosphonate scintigraphy or
             F-18 sodium fluoride PET), OR In-111 capromab pendetide scintigraphy.

          4. Age &gt; 18 years.

          5. Patient must be able to tolerate PET/MRI or PET/CT imaging

          6. Patient must be able to understand and willing to sign a written informed consent
             document.

          7. Patient must be able to understand and willing to sign an Advance Beneficiary Notice
             (ABN) (Medicare patient) or a Notice of Non-coverage (NNC) from (non-Medicare patient)
             that addresses the potential cost to the patient of C-11 choline PET/CT or PET/MRI.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. For patients planned to have PET/MRI:

               -  Patient must not have claustrophobia or any other contraindication to MRI as
                  evaluated by a standardized MRI safety questionnaire.

               -  If applicable, patient must not have renal insufficiency (estimated glomerular
                  filtration rate &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 based on measurement within the past 60 days)
                  or be undergoing dialysis as these conditions preclude safe administration of MRI
                  contrast agents. NOTE: At the discretion of principal investigator, a subject may
                  be allowed to enroll/continue on study and undergo imaging without the
                  administration of contrast in the event of renal insufficiency.

               -  If applicable, patient must not have a known prior reaction to gadolinium based
                  MRI contrast agents.

          2. For patients planned to have PET/CT:

               -  Patient must not have claustrophobia that would preclude PET/CT imaging or other
                  contraindications to CT imaging.
