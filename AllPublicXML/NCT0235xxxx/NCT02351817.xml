    <description>Product acceptance was measurement qualitatively by interviews exploring the factors and mechanisms affecting the acceptance. The interview questions were formulated in such a way that was not possible to quantify the number of subjects accepting the test products.
There were problems with test product performance and handling and therefore the acceptance of the products was not high. Product preference was secondary endpoint, where the subjects were asked whether they preffered their own product over the test products. This endpoint is the best measure we have for mimiking product acceptance. However, we are aware subjects could accept a product without preferring it over own product and the preferrence result might therefore not be accurate.
