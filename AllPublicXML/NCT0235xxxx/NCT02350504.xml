  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MRI has been recognized for many years as the safest and the most precise imaging method,
      particularly for children. However, the accuracy of MRI demands from the patient to avoid any
      movement while the examination is in process. This task is accomplished with difficulty by
      children and requires the assistance of an anesthetizing staff. In this research, our main
      goal is to investigate an introductory instruction as an assistive tool in performing MRI
      without the need in anesthesia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized controlled trial in which the level of the child's exposure
      to instruction is controlled according to the group he is attributed to. The children are
      divided randomly, each Sunday (the day there is an available anesthesia staff) we change the
      extent of the instruction. We use two types of instructions: 1) Full interactive instruction-
      which will include an instructional booklet, a movie and a simulator's practice. 2) Partial
      instruction which will include the booklet only.

      Therefore, if it is a full instruction Sunday, all the children in that day receive full
      instruction and vice versa, if it will is a partial instruction Sunday, all the children in
      that day receive partial instruction.

      All participants provide written informed consent after the study aims and procedures are
      fully explained.
