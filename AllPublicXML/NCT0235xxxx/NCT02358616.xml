  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is primarily exploratory and is designed to both identify factors that may have
      affected participant adherence to study product in VOICE, and describe how sexual behaviors,
      such as anal sex, may have had an effect on product efficacy. As such there is no specific
      hypothesis that is being tested.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MTN-003D will use qualitative in-depth interviews and/or focus group discussions with VOICE
      participants to explore study product adherence and/or anal sex behaviors in greater depth
      than was measured quantitatively during trial participation. The study approach is designed
      to encourage honesty and to minimize socially desirable responses, which may have affected
      participants' ability/willingness to accurately report during the trial. An in-depth and
      candid understanding of the various behavioral factors that contribute to the dilution of
      efficacy may assist in the interpretation of VOICE trial results and inform future studies.

      In light of VOICE's divergent results, MTN-003D will explore the potential factors that may
      have contributed to efficacy dilution in the trial. MTN-003D, was initially designed after
      the early closure of the oral and vaginal tenofovir arms, and sought to explore those factors
      contributing to the dilution of efficacy using qualitative methods (Stage 1). Given the
      subsequent release of VOICE results in February of 2013 and the availability of drug PK data,
      Stage 2 of MTN-003D has been designed to explore factors influencing adherence in greater
      depth, including HIV risk perception and motivation to join the trial.
