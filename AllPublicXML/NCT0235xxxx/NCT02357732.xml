      This study evaluates nivolumab in combination drug treatments involving 1) nivolumab and
      dabrafenib 2) nivolumab and trametinib and 3) nivolumab, dabrafenib and trametinib in
      patients with BRAF or NRAS-mutated metastatic melanoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients are being asked to take part in this clinical research study because they have BRAF-
      or NRAS-mutated metastatic melanoma. If they participate they will receive the
      investigational drug nivolumab in combination with dabrafenib and/or trametinib based on
      their medical diagnosis, BRAF V600 test results and/or NRAS-mutated status.

      The research study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the two drugs nivolumab and
      dabrafenib or nivolumab and trametinib. Once this is evaluated, then additional subjects will
      be enrolled for treatment with the triplicate (all 3 drugs) of nivolumab, dabrafenib and
      trametinib together.

      A treatment cycle will be 28 days, coinciding with the administration of nivolumab. The DLT
      evaluation period will be restricted to cycle 1, although toxicities in subsequent cycles
      will be closely evaluated. In trametinib-containing arms, a loading dose will be given on
      days 1 and 2 of cycle 1 to allow steady state concentrations to be achieved within one week
      of administration.

      In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event(s), treatment may continue for 3
      years or until one of the following criteria applies:

        -  Disease progression

        -  Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment

        -  Unacceptable adverse event(s)

        -  Patient decides to withdraw from the study

        -  General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable
           for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator

      Patients will be considered evaluable for toxicity if they receive 1 complete cycle of
      therapy, or if they experience dose limiting toxicities (DLTs). Definition of DLTs include:

        -  Any Grade 2 drug-related uveitis or eye pain or blurred vision that does not respond to
           topical therapy and does not improve to Grade 1 severity within the re-treatment period
           OR requires systemic treatment

        -  Any Grade 3 non-skin, drug-related adverse event lasting &gt; 7 days, with the following
           exceptions for drug-related laboratory abnormalities, uveitis, pneumonitis,
           bronchospasm, diarrhea, colitis, neurologic adverse event, hypersensitivity reactions,
           and infusion reactions

        -  Grade 3 drug-related uveitis, pneumonitis, bronchospasm, diarrhea, colitis, neurologic
           adverse event, hypersensitivity reaction, or infusion reaction of any duration requires
           discontinuation

        -  Grade 3 drug-related laboratory abnormalities do not require treatment discontinuation
           except the following: Grade 3 drug-related thrombocytopenia &gt; 7 days or associated with
           bleeding requires discontinuation; Any drug-related liver function test (LFT)
           abnormality that meets the following criteria require discontinuation - AST or ALT &gt; 8 x
           ULN; Total bilirubin &gt; 5 x ULN; Concurrent AST or ALT &gt; 3 x ULN and total bilirubin &gt; 2
           x ULN;

        -  Any Grade 4 drug-related adverse event or laboratory abnormality, except for the
           following events which do not require discontinuation:

             -  Isolated Grade 4 amylase or lipase abnormalities that are not associated with
                symptoms or clinical manifestations of pancreatitis and decrease to &lt; Grade 4
                within 1 week of onset.

             -  Isolated Grade 4 electrolyte imbalances/abnormalities that are not associated with
                clinical sequelae and are corrected with supplementation/appropriate management
                within 72 hours of their onset

        -  Any dosing interruption lasting &gt; 6 weeks with the following exceptions:

             -  Dosing interruptions to allow for prolonged steroid tapers to manage drug-related
                adverse events are allowed. Prior to re-initiating treatment in a subject with a
                dosing interruption lasting &gt; 6 weeks, the Investigator must be consulted. Tumor
                assessments should continue as per protocol even if dosing is interrupted

             -  Dosing interruptions &gt; 6 weeks that occur for non-drug-related reasons may be
                allowed if approved by the Investigator. Prior to re-initiating treatment in a
                subject with a dosing interruption lasting &gt; 6 weeks, the Investigator must be
                consulted. Tumor assessments should continue as per protocol even if dosing is
                interrupted Any adverse event, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness
                which, in the judgment of the Investigator, presents a substantial clinical risk to
                the subject with continued nivolumab dosing.

      Patients will be followed for 2 years after removal from study or until death, whichever
      occurs first, through standard of care visits or by medical records review. Patients removed
      from study for unacceptable adverse event(s) will be followed until resolution or
      stabilization of the adverse event.

    <description>It is planned to determine the maximum tolerable dose with a modified version of the standard &quot;up and down&quot; (3+3) dose-finding method using cohorts of 3 patients. At the start of the trial, three patients will be placed on dose level 1. The decision rules based on the observed dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) in this and subsequent cohorts are given. Only DLTs observed in a patient during the first cycle (28 days) will be used for the dose escalation decisions. Patients will be considered evaluable for toxicity if they receive 1 complete cycle of therapy, or if they experience DLT; in-evaluable patients will be replaced.</description>

             of systemic corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg/day prednisone equivalents) for at least 2 weeks
             prior to study drug administration, as this could result in immunosuppression.

          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined by the normal
             laboratory ranges. Screening laboratory values must meet the following criteria and
             should be obtained within 28 days prior to registration:

               -  Life expectancy of greater than12 weeks.

               -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be willing to use 2 methods of birth
                  control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the
                  course of the study through 23 weeks (30 days plus the time required for
                  nivolumab to undergo five half-lives) after the last dose of investigational
                  drug. WOCBP are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not been

               -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy
                  test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 72 hours
                  prior to the start of nivolumab.

               -  Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must use any contraceptive method with a
                  failure rate of less than 1% per year. Men receiving nivolumab and who are
                  sexually active with WOCBP will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a
                  period of 31 weeks after the last dose of investigational product. Women who are
                  not of childbearing potential (i.e., who are postmenopausal or surgically

          -  Histologically confirmed metastatic melanoma (Stage IV) with NRAS and BRAF-wild type.

          -  Grade 3/4 immune-related AEs on ipilimumab and required more than 12 weeks of immune
             suppression with corticosteroids.

          -  History of interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis.

          -  History of known glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency.

          -  Active leptomeningeal metastases or untreated symptomatic brain metastases.

          -  Active, known or suspected autoimmune disease. Subjects are permitted to enroll if
             they have vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to
             autoimmune condition only requiring hormone replacement, psoriasis not requiring
             systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external
             trigger.

          -  Require systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg daily prednisone
             equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug
             administration. Inhaled or topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses &gt; 10 mg
             daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune
             disease.

          -  Known history of a positive test for hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus indicating
             acute or chronic infection.

          -  Known history of testing positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or known
             acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). HIV-positive patients on combination
             antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic
             interactions with dabrafenib and trametinib. In addition, these patients are at
             increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy.
             Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination
             antiretroviral therapy when indicated.

          -  History of allergy or adverse drug reaction to the study drug components (nivolumab,
             dabrafenib, or trametinib) or drugs of similar chemical or biologic composition.
             Patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to any monoclonal antibody
             should also be excluded.

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant and/or breastfeeding women are excluded from this study. Because there is an
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with dabrafenib and trametinib, breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is treated with dabrafenib and trametinib. These potential
             risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.
