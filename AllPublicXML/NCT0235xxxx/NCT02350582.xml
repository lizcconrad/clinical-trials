      Patients with breast cancer undergo a series of psiclofisicas alterations during cancer
      treatment, chemotherapy phase being one of the more aggressive ete effect. These changes
      reduce the quality of life and result in a loss of physical health-related condition. Studies
      have shown that the practice of physical exercise and rehabilitation strategies enhance or
      attenuate the impact of chemotherapy on quality of life of patients. At present,
      technological development from telerehabilitación systems is a promising strategy that
      enables fast and efficient communication between health professionals and patients,
      especially at this stage of the disease where the patient may encounter difficulties in
      matching measures improving their lifestyle with aggressive medical treatment.

      To carry out this study a controlled study masked, parallel-group done were conducted usual
      care control group and an intervention based on a web system telerehabilitación to improve
      the physical condition associated with health and performed quality of life.

      The CUIDATE group will identify impairments of participants at baseline assessment. The aims
      based on weekly improvements will be set to facilitate the final goal. After each training
      session there will be feedback between the participant and the CUIDATE group to change or
      improve any exercise or activity. This feedback will allow to us to select adequate exercises
      and levels of difficulty. As a result, a modifiable personal training will be assigned to
      each one focusing on cardio-respiratory, mobility, and endurance performance through online
      system rehabilitation (using written instructions, HD videos, and audio files).
