  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if high-flow oxygen, low-flow oxygen,
      high-flow air, or low-flow air, when given during structured exercise sessions, can help
      reduce difficulty breathing in cancer patients. Researchers also want to learn if these
      therapies can help to improve lung function and quality of life.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, about 3 days after you complete
      the baseline cycle tests (described below), you will be randomly assigned (as in a roll of
      dice) to receive 1 of the following 4 treatments during a second cycle test. Your study group
      assignment will also be based on your breathing symptoms at screening.

        -  High-flow oxygen

        -  Low-flow oxygen

        -  High-flow air

        -  Low-flow air

      You will have an equal chance of being assigned to each group. Neither you nor the study
      staff will know which treatment you are assigned to. However, if needed for your safety, the
      study staff will be able to find out what you are receiving.

      Study Visits:

      Baseline Cycle Tests:

      At a time that is convenient for you after screening, you will perform a cycle test using a
      stationary bicycle. You will pedal with no resistance for 60 seconds, then you will warm up
      for 2 minutes. You will perform the cycle test while receiving low-flow air for as long as
      you can.

      Every 2 minutes during the cycle test your blood pressure, heart rate, and blood oxygen
      levels will be checked.

      After a 2-hour rest, you will perform the cycle test again using low-flow air for as long as
      you can.

      Before each cycle test, you will have an electrocardiogram (EKG) to check your heart
      function.

      Second Cycle Test:

      About 3 days after the baseline cycle test (Â± 2 days), you will take part in a second cycle
      test. Before this test, you will have an EKG. During the test, you will receive the type of
      study treatment you were assigned to after your screening tests.

      After the cycle test, you will fill out the same questionnaires you completed at screening.

      Length of Study:

      You may be taken off study if you have problems completing either cycle test. Your
      participation on the study will be over when you have completed the second cycle test and
      filled out the questionnaires.

      This is an investigational study. The use of high-flow air, low-flow air, high-flow oxygen,
      or low-flow oxygen during exercise to treat breathing symptoms is considered investigational.

      Up to 50 patients will be enrolled in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
