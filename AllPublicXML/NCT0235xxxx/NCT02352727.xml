  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To quantitative measurement of nocturnal hypokinesia of Parkinson's disease patients compares
      with their spouses by using multisite accelerometers for 1 night at their home. To determine
      whether the nocturnal movement of Parkinson's disease patients less than normal elderly
      people or not.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To quantify the severity of nocturnal akinesia, the nocturnal akinesia dystonia and cramp
      score (NADCS) and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) were recorded in the
      patient group and also details of demographic data, history and physical examinations were
      included. The patients and spouses wore the 3-axis (x,y,z) accelerometers at bilateral
      wrists, bilateral ankles, and trunk for 1 night at their home. The 5-minute periods after
      going to bed and before waking up in the morning were excluded from the analysis. The
      definition of movement of the trunk is a change of 15 degrees from the previous position and
      sustained for 5 minutes in any axis. The movement of limbs is defined as a change of 15
      degrees from the previous position and sustained for 2 minutes.
