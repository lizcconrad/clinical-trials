      In an urban gynecology practice serving patients with publicly and privately funded
      insurance, female sexual dysfunction was associated with low income, depression, urinary
      incontinence, and sexual inactivity.

      Introduction: Female sexual dysfunction is common, and the effect of socioeconomic status in
      an urban population is unknown. The objective is to determine socioeconomic and clinical
      factors associated with female sexual dysfunction for patients with publicly and privately
      funded health insurance in an urban outpatient gynecology clinic.

      Methods: We performed an observational, IRB approved, cross-sectional study of 238
      sexually-active, non-pregnant women reporting to two urban gynecology clinics, representing
      patients with publicly funded (n=70) or privately funded health insurance (n=168). The
      participants completed validated questionnaires measuring sexual function (Female Sexual
      Function Index or FSFI), depression (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale),
      urinary incontinence (Questionnaire for Urinary Incontinence Diagnosis), and demographic
      variables. Data was analyzed with non-parametric t-tests, chi-squared tests, and linear
      regression models.
