  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effects of enhanced geriatric input on elderly patients undergoing
      colorectal cancer surgery. Half of the participants will received additional pre, peri and
      post-operative care from the geriatric team, while the other half will receive standard
      surgical care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Additional geriatric care involves appropriate assessments and interventions by a
      multidisciplinary team involving geriatricians, physiotherapist, occupational therapist,
      surgical team, dietician and social worker. It is divided into three stages of care: 1)
      preoperative assessment, 2) perioperative care and 3) discharge or rehabilitation. In
      preoperative assessment, a comprehensive geriatric assessment will be carried out which
      encompasses patients medical and social backgrounds, cognitive status, nutritional assessment
      and risk factors identification. Perioperative care includes a joint care by surgical and
      geriatric teams aiming to prevent and treat any postoperative complications. Discharge and
      rehabilitation aim to identifies and facilities any potential discharge problem or
      accelerates patients for rehabilitation to the appropriate locations.

      Standard surgical care will be given to patients who are undergoing colorectal cancer surgery
      but without the additional input mentioned above.
