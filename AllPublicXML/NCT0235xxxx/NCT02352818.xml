      The aim of this CTO registry is to gather data including patient demographic date, cardiac
      risk factors, procedural technical data and procedural success/outcome rates. Furthermore, we
      aim to evaluate the safety and performance of various CTO specific guidewires, devices (such
      as the CrossBoss/Stingray dissection ren-entry device) and other recognised and approved
      techniques (retrograde wire escalation, retrograde dissection re-etry techniques). The
      incidence of recognized complications (dissections, perforations, cardiac tamponade, vascular
      complications, radiation injury, acute kidney injury) will also evaluated. We will assess
      clinical outcome at 1 year after succesful CTO procedures.

      This objectives of this single-center CTO registry are to:

        1. Gather prospective clinical data on all consecutive patients undergoing complex
           difficult CTO PCI procedures including including patient demographic date, cardiac risk
           factors, procedural technical data (contrast volume, radiation exposure, procedure time
           and procedural success/outcome rates.

        2. Evaluate the safety and performance of various CTO dedicated guidewires, devices (such
           as the CrossBoss/Stingray anterior dissection re-entry device) and other recognised and
           approved techniques (retrograde wire escalation, retrograde dissection re-etry
           techniques).

        3. Evaluate the incidence and severity of recognized complications such as coronary
           dissections, coronary perforations (+/- need for emergency pericardiocentesis), acute
           kidney injury, radiation injury, access site vascular complications.

        4. Evaluate the medium-term outcome (recurrence of symptoms, major cardiovascular events
           (cardiac death, myocardial infarction, target lesion revascularization, target vessel
           revascularization) during a routine out-patient consultation (planned as part of normal
           standard care) at 1 year post successful CTO PCI. After this consultation, the patient
           may choose to have cardiology follow-up at the UZ Leuven or with his/her referring
           cardiologist.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All consecutive patients undergoing an elective attempt at percutaneous
             revascularization of a chronic total occlusion are eligible for inclusion in the CTO
             registry. A chronic total occlusion is defined as an occluded coronary artery with
             TIMI 0 flow that has been occluded for 3 months or more. By definition all patients
             will have been judged to be acceptable candidates for an attempt at revascularization
             before consenting to be part of the CTO registry.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  There are no specific exclusion criteria. If the patient does not wish to consent to
             having his personal data kept in a registry the patient will not be included in the
             CTO registry.
