  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung ultrasound offers a novel, reliable and radiation-free tool for diagnosing perioperative
      atelectasis and evaluating its severity in adult patients undergoing general anesthesia in
      the operating room.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atelectases occur in up to 90% of patients undergoing general anesthesia and intubation. The
      aim of the present observational study was designed to further to evaluate the diagnostic
      performance of lung ultrasound (LUS) in detection of postoperative atelectasis in adult
      patients undergoing general anesthesia. Results of LUS as the experimental method will be
      compared to the results of computed tomography (CT) as the reference technique for the
      detection of atelectasis. The investigators want to confirm former findings of the appearance
      of perioperative atelectases and to prove that ultrasound is a valid tool for detection of
      atelectases.

    <description>Measurements of lung ultrasound are performed before induction of anesthesia and immediately after finishing the surgery. Lung CTs are performed the day before surgery and within 1 hour after surgery. Outcome measure: comparison of atelectases by lung ultrasound (experimental method) versus by computed tomography (standard method)</description>
