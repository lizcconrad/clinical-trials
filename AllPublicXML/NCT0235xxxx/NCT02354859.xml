      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of IV gallium to improve pulmonary
      function as measured by a 5% or greater relative improvement in forced expiratory volume in
      one second (FEV1) from baseline to Day 28.

    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in adults with CF
      chronically infected with P. aeruginosa. The study will evaluate the safety and clinical
      efficacy of a five day infusion of IV gallium nitrate (IV gallium). The purpose of this study
      is to assess the efficacy of IV gallium to improve pulmonary function as measured by a 5% or
      greater relative improvement in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) from baseline
      to Day 28.
