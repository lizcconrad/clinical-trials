  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants with recurrent or metastatic (R/M) squamous cell cancer of the head and neck
      (HNSCC) will be randomly assigned to receive pembrolizumab alone, or pembrolizumab + a
      platinum-based drug (cisplatin or carboplatin) + 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), or cetuximab + a
      platinum-based drug (cisplatin or carboplatin) + 5-FU. The primary study hypothesis is that
      pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy prolongs progression free
      survival and overall survival compared to standard treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically- or cytologically-confirmed recurrent or metastatic head and neck
             squamous cell carcinoma considered incurable by local therapies

          -  No prior systemic therapy administered in the recurrent or metastatic setting (with
             the exception of systemic therapy completed &gt; 6 months prior if given as part of
             multimodal treatment for locally advanced disease)

          -  Primary tumor locations of oropharynx, oral cavity, hypopharynx, or larynx.

             needle aspirate is not sufficient): A newly obtained biopsy (within 90 days prior to

             within 4 weeks of the first dose of study medication

          -  Life expectancy of &lt;3 months and/or has rapidly progressing disease

          -  Diagnosis of immunodeficiency or receiving systemic steroid therapy or any other form

          -  Diagnosed and/or treated additional malignancy within 5 years prior to randomization

          -  Active central nervous system metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis

          -  Active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in past 2 years;
             replacement therapy is not considered a form of systemic treatment

          -  History of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or current pneumonitis

          -  Active infection requiring systemic therapy

          -  Known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation
             with the requirements of the trial

          -  Pregnant, breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the screening visit through 180 days
             after the last dose of study medication

          -  Prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent or previously
             participated in Merck MK-3475 clinical trial
