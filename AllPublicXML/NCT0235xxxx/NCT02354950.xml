  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a Phase 1, open-label, parallel group, two-part, single-dose adaptive study in
      adults with moderate and mild (if needed) hepatic impairment and matched, healthy control
      subjects with normal hepatic function. In Part 1, healthy control subjects (n=8) matched to
      subjects with moderate (n=8) hepatic impairment will be enrolled. If the geometric mean total
      plasma area under the concentration-time curve from time zero (pre-dose) extrapolated to
      infinite time (AUC[0-infinity]) of GSK1265744 is increased by &gt;2-fold in moderately impaired
      subjects relative to matched controls, Part 2 will be conducted to evaluate GSK1265744 PK in
      subjects with mild hepatic impairment (n=8) and matched, control subjects (n=8). All subjects
      will receive a single 30 milligram (mg) oral dose of GSK1265744. The primary objective of the
      study is to compare plasma PK parameters of GSK1265744 in subjects with hepatic impairment to
      healthy controls matched in gender, age, and body mass index (BMI).
