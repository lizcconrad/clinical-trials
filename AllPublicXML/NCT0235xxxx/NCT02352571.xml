  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose(MTD)/Recommended Phase 2
      Dose(RP2D) and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of GC1118 when given by intravenous
      (IV) infusion to patients with stage IV solid tumors.

      The study will also evaluate pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity and antitumor effect of GC1118
      and explore prognostic biomarkers and pharmacodynamic biomarkers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An open-label, single-arm, multi-center, phase 1, dose-escalation study will be conducted to
      define the MTD/RP2D, safety, PK, immunogenicity and antitumor activity of GC1118 in patients
      with refractory disease for whom no standard therapy is available.

      This study is in three parts: a dose escalation segment (Part A), a cohort expansion (Part B)
      and biweekly administration(Part C). In part A, a dose escalation schema will be applied in
      dose level cohorts. GC1118 will be administered weekly on Study Day 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each
      28-day cycle by IV infusion. Dose escalation may occur as described in the study protocol.
      Once the MTD has been established during Part A, the MTD cohort will be expanded in part B.
      And GC1118 will be administered biweekly on Study Day 1, 15 each 28-day cycle by IV infusion
      in part C.

      Study assessments will include AE monitoring including physical examination, vital signs and
      clinical laboratory tests, ECG monitoring, PK analysis of serum GC1118, an assessment of
      potential anti-GC1118 antibody response and an exploration of potential prognostic and
      pharmacodynamic biomarkers.

      Tumor response assessments using Study Day 36 CT/MRI scans will be performed approximately
      five weeks after the first GC1118 dose for each patient (Part A only). Patients with evidence
      of disease regression (partial or complete response or stable disease by RECIST criteria)
      will be allowed to continue therapy at the same dose. Subsequent cycles will consist of
      administration of GC1118 on Day 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each 28-day cycle with tumor evaluation
      every other cycle (approximately every 8 weeks) in part A,B and Day 1, 15 of each 28-day
      cycle with tumor evaluation every other cycle (approximately every 8 weeks) in part C.
