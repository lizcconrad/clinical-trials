      This research study is evaluating bone mineral density in childhood cancer survivors who have
      a history of bone fracture.

  <detailed_description>

      The purpose of this research study is to learn more about the status of bones in children and
      young-adults who have had bone fractures after treatment for childhood cancer. Bone
      complications including fracture can be important issues for some childhood cancer survivors.
      In this study we are measuring bone mineral density in children and young adults who have had
      bone fracture after treatment for childhood cancer. We will measure bone mineral density in
      two ways. We will use: 1) dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (also known as DXA), and 2)
      peripheral quantitative computed tomography (also known as pQCT).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  History of childhood cancer

          -  Age ≥ 8 years and &lt; 20 years at time of enrollment

          -  ≥ 2 years since completion of cancer-directed therapy for first cancer

          -  Received chemotherapy for treatment of childhood cancer

          -  History of bone fracture after the conclusion of chemotherapy*

          -  Not currently receiving cancer-directed therapy

             patient, if he or she is ≥18 years of age)

          -  Patient assent for those ≥10 years of age and &lt; 18 years of age for whom a parent
             provides informed consent (*History of bone fracture will be based on patient/parent
             report of fracture occurrence and will be confirmed in review of the medical record
             whenever feasible.)
