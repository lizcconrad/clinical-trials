  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic stem cell transplantation was developed to cure many patients with hematological
      malignancies. It results in the development of graft versus host disease (GVHD) in 30-70% of
      cases. Chronic GVHD diagnosis currently uses biopsies of affected organs (skin, liver,
      gastrointestinal tract) and / or the observation of typical clinical signs sufficient for
      diagnosis. However, the anatomical sites for biopsy including the digestive tract are not
      clearly identified (high or low biopsy) and may present risks in their realization in
      particular in patients weakened by blood disease or immunosuppression.

      PET-CT with 18F-FDG has already been evaluated in chronic inflammatory diseases such as
      Crohns disease with good sensitivity and specificity. It interest in the graft against the
      host was studied in acute forms of digestive and allows lesion mapping and monitoring the
      effectiveness of treatment.

      Among patients with chronic GVHD scleroderma form, PET with 18F-FDG enabled to view
      musculoskeletal uptakes localized to the affected areas identified with MRI.

      The investigators propose a study evaluating the sensitivity and specificity of the
      examination by PET-CT with 18F-FDG in the diagnosis of chronic GVHD compared to conventional
      diagnostic tools.

Patient with positive PET-CT without GVHD signs are considered as false positive. Patient with clinical GVHD and negative PET-CT are considered as falsse negative and patients with clinical GVHD and positive PET-CT are true positive. The follow-up will determine if PET-CT is positive before the onset of clinical signs of GVHD.</description>
