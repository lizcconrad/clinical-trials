      The study seeks to evaluate a novel treatment approach for performing continuous real-time
      glucose sensing and insulin delivery at the same subcutaneous tissue site.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of type 1 diabetes usually comprises the measurement of glucose in blood
      obtained by finger pricking and the administration of insulin via subcutaneous bolus
      injection or continuous subcutaneous infusion.

      This study seeks to test a new treatment approach where glucose sensing and insulin
      administration are combined and performed at a single subcutaneous tissue site (single-port
      treatment approach). A single-port device consisting of a continuous glucose sensor and an
      insulin infusion cannula is inserted into the subcutaneous tissue of 10 type-1 diabetes
      patients and used for insulin infusion and simultaneous glucose sensing over a 7-day period.
      The performance of the single-port device is assessed by comparing the obtained glucose
      readings with those of a blood glucose meter and an additionally worn control sensor.
