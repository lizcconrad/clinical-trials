    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy is the &quot;gold standard&quot; technique for diagnosis and treatment of colonic lesions.
      Moreover, high definition colonoscopes (HD) associated to digital chromoendoscopy had shown
      better results regarding adenoma and polyps detection when compared to standard non HD
      scopes. However, evidence shows that during standard colonoscopy many lesions could be
      missed, including polyps, cancer and other kind of lesions. This could be correlated to many
      factors and recently reports show evidence that lesions behind the folds could be missed
      because the limitation of a forward view examination. Until know, a new auxiliary imaging
      device called &quot;Third Eye Retroscope&quot; had demonstrated more lesions detection during
      colonoscopy using a retro view, but with some limitations as absence of HD vision, the need
      of additional equipment and the fact the device occupies the accessory channel, limiting
      therapeutic efficiency. Recently a new HD colonoscope called &quot;RETROVIEW&quot; (PENTAX Medical) has
      been developed. It permits visualization of colonic mucosa in forward view, in retroflex view
      and allows for performance of diagnostic and therapeutics in a single colonoscope.

      Primary outcome:

      To determine the safety and feasibility of the retro view during colonoscopy using RETROVIEW
      colonoscope. Safety was measured by the number of bleeding or perforation rates as adverse
      event during the procedure. Feasibility was measured by the number of cases that is possible
      to achieve a retroflexion in the colon Secondary outcome: withdrawal phase time and total
      procedure time.
