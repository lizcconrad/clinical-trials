    <textblock>
      50 pregnant females were divided in two groups, twenty five as a control group and twenty
      five as high risk group; they were subjected to uterine artery Doppler, measurement of
      maternal serum and detection of (MTHFR) gene polymorphisms in first trimester at 11 to 14
      weeks of gestation, all pregnancies were followed until 40 weeks for development of
      pre-eclampsia
