  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dizziness and vertigo account for roughly 4% of chief symptoms in the emergency department
      (ED). Pharmacological therapy is often solicited for these symptoms, such as vestibular
      suppressants, anti-emetics and benzodiazepines. However, every medication is accompanied with
      unavoidable side-effects. To the best of the investigators knowledge, no papers surveyed
      assess the feasibility of applying acupuncture as an emergent intervention means to the
      treatment of dizziness and vertigo. The investigators study targeted on filling in this gap
      by performing a clinical control trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of traditional
      Chinese medicine - acupuncture - in treating patients with dizziness and vertigo in ED.
