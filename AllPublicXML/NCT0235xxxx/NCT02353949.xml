    <textblock>
      The study examines subjects where there might be an indication for Amyloid-PET according to
      the Criteria defined by the Amyloid Imaging Task Force. In these subjects the impact of a
      Flutemetamol-Positron-Emission-Tomography -Scan (PET) on clinical management and disease
      course will be studied over 6 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Dementia expert considers an Amyloid-scan appropriate according to Amyloid-imaging
             task force criteria (AIT) after counseling by an Amyloid-PET expert

               1. Patients with persistent or progressive unexplained MCI

               2. Patients satisfying core clinical criteria for possible AD because of unclear
                  clinical presentation, either an atypical clinical course or an etiologically
                  mixed presentation

               3. Patients with progressive dementia and atypically early age of onset (65 years or
                  less in age)

               4. other situations where preambles of AIT-Criteria are fulfilled

          -  Preambles of the AIT-Criteria are fulfilled

               1. A cognitive complaint with objectively confirmed impairment

               2. AD as a possible diagnosis, but when the diagnosis is uncertain after a
                  comprehensive evaluation by a dementia expert

               3. When knowledge of the presence or absence of Abeta pathology is expected to
                  increase diagnostic certainty and alter management

          -  Diagnosis was established in a memory clinic or by an experienced physician in
             dementia diagnostics

          -  The diagnostic procedures comprise in minimum MRI, neuropsychology, routine blood test
             for exclusion of symptomatic causes

          -  MMSE &gt;15

          -  Competency to consent

          -  Trial partner willing to support study physician

          -  Written informed consent by both patient and trial partner

          -  Understanding of German language allowing performing neuropsychological testing

          -  Treating physician willing to collaborate with the study team

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence for cognitive impairment mainly attributed to another underlying medical
             condition (e.g. medication, substance abuse, brain tumor, severe heart insufficiency,
             hepatic encephalopathy)

          -  Clinically significant depression

          -  MRI exclusion criteria

          -  PET exclusion criteria

               1. Allergy to Flutemetamol or any of its constituents

               2. History of severe allergic reactions to drugs or allergens

               3. Pregnancy or lactation
