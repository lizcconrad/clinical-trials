  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research is currently underway to develop new HIV prevention strategies. Intravaginal rings
      (IVRs) are one drug delivery method that is currently being studied. This study will evaluate
      the safety and pharmacokinetics of IVRs containing vicriviroc, MK-2048, and a combination of
      vicriviroc/MK-2048, in healthy, HIV-uninfected women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The development of safe and effective HIV prevention strategies is an important global health
      priority. IVRs have previously been approved as a delivery method for various medications,
      and this study will evaluate IVRs containing HIV antiretroviral medications. The purpose of
      this study is to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of a combination IVR called MK-2048A
      that contains vicriviroc (MK-4176) and MK-2048, compared to IVRs containing vicriviroc alone
      and MK-2048 alone.

      This study will enroll healthy, HIV-uninfected women, 18 to 45 years old. Participants will
      be randomly assigned to receive an IVR containing either vicriviroc, MK-2048, MK-2048A (which
      contains vicriviroc and MK-2048), or placebo. Participants will receive their assigned IVR at
      the enrollment visit, and the IVR will be removed on Day 28. Participants will attend study
      visits at screening, enrollment (Day 0), and Days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 29, 30, 31, and 35.
      Study visits may include behavioral assessments, adherence counseling and assessments,
      medical history reviews, physical examinations, urine collection, blood collection, pelvic
      specimen collection, and rectal specimen collection (optional).

             results

          -  In general good health at Screening and Enrollment, as determined by the site
             Investigator of Record (IoR) or designee

          -  At Screening, participant states willingness to abstain from receptive sexual activity
             (including penile-vaginal intercourse, anal intercourse, receptive oral intercourse,
             finger stimulation, and the use of sex toys) for the 5 days prior to the Enrollment
             Visit and for the duration of study participation

          -  Per participant report, using an effective method of contraception at Enrollment, and
             intending to continue the use of an effective method for the duration of study
             participation. Effective methods for MTN-027 include: hormonal methods (except
             contraceptive IVRs), intrauterine device (IUD) inserted at least 28 days prior to
             enrollment, engages in sex exclusively with women, sterilized (self or partner),
             and/or sexually abstinent for the past 90 days.

          -  Women over the age of 21 (inclusive) must have documentation of a satisfactory Pap
             within the past 3 years prior to Enrollment consistent with Grade 0 according to the

             levonorgestrel-releasing IUD nor to participants using continuous combination oral
             contraceptive pills, as the absence of regular menstrual cycles is an expected, normal

          -  Has any of the following laboratory abnormalities at Screening:

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine transaminase (ALT) Grade 1 or higher

               -  Calculated creatinine clearance less than 60 mL/min by the Cockcroft-Gault
                  formula, where creatinine clearance (female) in mL/min = (140 - age in years) x

                  limit of normal (ULN)

               -  Note: Otherwise eligible participants with an exclusionary test result (other
                  than HIV, hepatitis B virus [HBV], or HCV) can be re-tested during the screening
                  process. If a participant is re-tested and a non-exclusionary result is
                  documented within 45 days of providing informed consent for screening, the
                  participant may be enrolled.

          -  Pregnant at either Screening or Enrollment. Note: A documented negative pregnancy test
             performed by study staff is required for inclusion; however a self-reported pregnancy
             is adequate for exclusion from screening/enrollment into the study.

          -  Diagnosed with urinary tract infection (UTI) at Screening or Enrollment. Note:
             Otherwise eligible participants diagnosed with UTI during screening will be offered
             treatment. If within the 45 day screening window treatment is complete and symptoms
             have resolved the participant may be enrolled.

          -  Diagnosed with pelvic inflammatory disease, reproductive tract infection (RTI) or a
             sexually transmitted infection (STI) requiring treatment per current Centers for
             Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines (http://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/) at
             Screening or Enrollment. Note: With the exception of gonorrhea, chlamydia, and/or
             syphilis, otherwise eligible participants diagnosed with a RTI during screening will
             be offered treatment. If within the 45 day screening window treatment is complete and
             symptoms have resolved the participant may be enrolled.

          -  At Enrollment, has a clinically apparent Grade 1 or higher pelvic exam finding
             (observed by study clinician or designee) per the Division of AIDS Table for Grading
             the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events, Version 1.0, December 2004
             (Clarification dated August 2009), Addendum 1, Female Genital Grading Table for Use in
             Microbicide Studies. Note: Cervical friability bleeding associated with speculum
             insertion and/or specimen collection judged to be within the range of normal according
             to the clinical judgment of the IoR/designee is considered expected non-menstrual
             bleeding and is not exclusionary.

          -  At Screening, severe pelvic relaxation such that either the vaginal walls or the
             uterine cervix descend beyond the vaginal introitus with valsalva maneuver or has
             pelvic anatomy that compromises the ability to adequately assess vaginal safety

          -  Has any other condition that, in the opinion of the IoR/designee, would preclude
             informed consent, make study participation unsafe, complicate interpretation of study
             outcome data, or otherwise interfere with achieving study objectives
