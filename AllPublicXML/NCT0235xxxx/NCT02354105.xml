    <measure>Change from Baseline to Week 52 in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) in the overall axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) population, and the ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and nonradiographic axSpA (nr-axSpA) subpopulations</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The BASDAI is a validated self-reported instrument, which consists of six 10 unit horizontal Numeric Rating Scales to measure the disease activity of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) from the subject's perspective. It measures the severity of fatigue, spinal and peripheral joint pain and swelling, enthesitis, and morning stiffness (both severity and duration) over the last week. The final BASDAI scores ranges from 0 to 10, with lower scores indicating lower disease activity.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient personally signed and dated a Patient Data Consent Form (PDCF) prior to
             Visit 2. No data can be entered into the electronic Documentation form (eDF) prior to
             signature of the PDCF.

          -  The patient must have a clinical diagnosis of active axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA),
             [ankylosing spondylitis (AS) or nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA)]
             according to the diagnostic criteria used by the physician in routine clinical
             practice.

          -  The decision to prescribe Certolizumab Pegol (CZP) is made by the physician
             independent of the patient's participation in the NIS.

          -  The patient must be newly prescribed CZP according to local regulations or guidelines
             (eg, Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) &gt;=4).

          -  Treatment is according to instructions in the Summary of Product Characteristics
             (SmPC) for patients considered by the treating physician to be reliable and capable of
             adhering to the observational plan (eg, able to understand and complete
             questionnaires).

          -  If a patient is participating in an ongoing investigational study, then he/she will
             not be able to take part in this study.
