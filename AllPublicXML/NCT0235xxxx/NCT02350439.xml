  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fractional flow reserve (FFR) is an established invasive method for assessing the
      physiological significance of coronary artery stenosis. However, in recent studies it has
      been observed and reported some degree of variation in the fraction of the coronary artery to
      the aortic pressure (Pd / Pa) during the infusion of standard adenosine dose (140mg/kg/min).
      The observed variation may be attributed to a failure to achieve maximal hyperemia with the
      normal dose. The administration of adenosine at a higher dose (200μg/kg /min) may influence
      coronary flow reserve (FFR) eliminating Pd / Pa variation during adenosine infusion.

      This is a prospective study which will be conducted in patients after coronary angiography
      with at least one angiographic lesion ≥50% in coronary vessels.

      Patients after written consent will undergo assessment of lesion severity with FFR under a
      three-minute infusion of adenosine 140mg/kg/min. In patients during steady state hyperaemia
      (determined by visual assessment) exhibiting variation in Pd / Pa ratio ≥ 0.05 (e.g.
      difference of max Pd/Pa minus min Pd/Pa) the examination will be repeated after 5 min with
      three-minute infusion under high dose adenosine (200mg/kg/min). The minimum ratio Pd/Pa per 3
      beats will be offline analyzed. The FFR during steady hyperemia state is defined as the
      average of the minimum ratio Pd / Pa per three beats.
