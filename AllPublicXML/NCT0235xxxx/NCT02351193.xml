    <textblock>
      While practicing the different assisted reproductive techniques, the investigators are faced
      daily by the problem of poor responder females, and the debate about predicting its results
      based on the outcome of the different ORTs used. Due to the cost of AMH as an indicator for
      ovarian response, the need to re-assess its role was essential in our community, which led us
      to conduct this prospective multi-center IVF study.
