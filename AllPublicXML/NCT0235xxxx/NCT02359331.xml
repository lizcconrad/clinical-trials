  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As increasing the antibiotics resistance, the effectiveness of traditional Helicobacter
      pylori (H. pylori) therapies has been declined coincidentally.

      In this study, the investigators evaluated the efficacy of H. pylori eradication between a 7
      days personalized therapy for H. pylori infection based on the results of antibiotics
      resistance by using H. pylori culture and minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the 14
      days bismuth contained quadruple 2nd rescue regimens, and the investigators analyzed the
      prevalence of the antibiotic resistance after 1st eradication of H. pylori in the tailored
      therapy group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patients who had shown the evidence of persistent H. pylori infection after the 1st
      eradication were enrolled for this study.

      After giving the informed consent about the method and efficacy (ITT and PP analysis) of the
      14 days bismuth quadruple 2nd rescue therapy and the 7 days tailored therapy for H. pylori
      infection based on culture and MIC, the patients were randomly classified into the two
      regimen group under the patient's agreement and underwent 2nd eradication [14 days
      bismuth-based quadruple therapy (Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) regular dose b.i.d.,
      tripotassium dicitrate bismuthate 300 mg q.i.d. (three tablets at 30 min before meals and one
      tablet at 2 hours after dinner), metronidazole 500 mg t.i.d., and tetracycline 500 mg
      q.i.d.), or 7 days tailored therapy based on H. pylori culture and MIC (select the 2nd rescue
      regimen between 7 days of bismuth-based quadruple therapy or 7 days moxifloxacin-containing
      triple therapy (PPI regular dose b.i.d., moxifloxacin 400 mg q.d., and amoxicillin 1g b.i.d.)
      according to antibiotics susceptibility.

      This study was designed to evaluate the success of eradication for enrolled participants by
      methods of an open labelled randomized prospectively.
