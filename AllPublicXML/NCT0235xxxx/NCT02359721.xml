    <textblock>
      The present study was done to evaluate the effect of clarithromycin as an adjunct to scaling
      and root planning at baseline, three months and six months intervals . Clinical,
      microbiological and immunological parameters were taken. Clinical parameters include gingival
      index , probing depth and clinical attachment level. In the present study, improved clinical
      and microbiological outcomes were attained using adjunctive clarithromycin, including GI, PD
      reduction, CAL gain and reductions in the frequency of detection of C-reactive protein, Pg,
      Aa. These results together with the recommended easy dosage and limited side effects make the
      use of this antibiotic in the treatment of periodontitis patients but only for a shorter
      period of time.

      Background &amp; Objectives: Along with conventional non-surgical periodontal therapy (NSPT)
      systemic antimicrobials may provide more effective treatment for chronic periodontitis by
      targeting tissue-invasive bacteria. The aim of this study was to evaluate the adjunctive
      effects of oral clarithromycin (CLM) to nonsurgical periodontal therapy for chronic
      periodontitis.

      Materials and Methods: 30 patients were categorized into two groups: test group - Base line
      scaling and root planing(SRP) was done. Clarithromycin tablet 500 mg( Clarino-500) was given
      for a period of 7 days orally two times per day. control group -only SRP done . Clinical
      parameters were recorded at baseline , 3 months, and six months interval .They included
      gingival index (GI), probing depth (PD), and clinical attachment level (CAL). Also microbial
      analysis of subgingival plaque samples was done at baseline, 3months and six months interval
      to estimate the levels of Pg and Aa bacteria using culture methods. Immunological parameter
      like estimation of C-Reactive protein was done in both groups at baseline 3 months and 6
      months period. tests were used for statistical analysis.
