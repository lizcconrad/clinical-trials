    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of ibrutinib
      alone or in combination with either cytarabine or azacitidine in the treatment of subjects
      with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) who have failed standard treatment, or subjects without
      prior therapy who refuse standard chemotherapy.
