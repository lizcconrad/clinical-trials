  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      From a rehabilitation point of view, while several approaches exist to retrain runners with
      PFPS, it is not clear which one is most effective, or why. The goals of this
      randomised-controlled trial are: 1) to compare the effectiveness of three rehabilitation
      programs on pain and functional limitations of runners with PFPS and 2) to explain why the
      programs are effective or not based on laboratory analyses. After baseline evaluation,
      runners will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups, each with a specific
      8-week rehabilitation program aimed at addressing the efficiency of a specific type of
      retraining. These groups are: 1) Control; 2) muscle recruitment; 3) reducing knee loading
      during running.

      The investigators hypothesis is that the intervention targeting a reduction in knee loading
      will be significantly more effective in reducing symptoms and improving function of runners
      with patellofemoral pain syndrome.

      Hypothesis will be tested using symptoms and functional status questionnaires. In addition,
      mechanistic analyses will be conducted using a running assessment using an instrumented
      treadmill and kinematics analyses.

    <time_frame>After 4 weeks and 8 weeks of rehabilitation; 3 months after the end of the rehabilitation program</time_frame>
    <description>A validated self-reported questionnaire (found to have the best psychometric properties in this population by a systematic review; Esculier et al., Disabil Rehabil 2013;35(26):2181-90) will be used to assess the severity of symptoms and functional limitations during the activities of daily living because of knee impairment. Changes in scores to this questionnaire will allow to compare the efficacy of rehabilitation protocols.</description>

    <time_frame>After 4 weeks and 8 weeks of rehabilitation; 3 months after the end of the rehabilitation program</time_frame>
    <description>Visual analog scales will be used to assess levels of usual pain, worst pain and pain during running. Changes in scores to these scales will allow to compare the efficacy of rehabilitation protocols. These pain scales have been validated in this population.</description>

    <description>Vertical ground reaction forces and vertical loading rate during running on a Bertec instrumented treadmill. The average and instantaneous rise in vertical ground reaction forces will be considered between initial contact and initial peak in vertical forces.
