  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep apnea is a common disease in the general population and more particularly in elderly
      subjects in whom prevalence can reach 30 % after 70 years old. In adults (&lt;55 years old)
      cardiovascular consequences are well known and make sleep apnea treatment necessary. However
      elderly (&gt;70 years old) apneic subjects are less symptomatic in terms of sleepiness, they
      usually present a lower index of respiratory events and cardiovascular consequences in this
      population are still discussed, driving some authors to consider sleep apnea in the elderly
      as a specific disease and making the need for a treatment questionable.

      In this study the investigators will focus on the comparison between adult and elderly apneic
      subjects in terms of cognitive and cardiovascular consequences. Adult apneic patients suffer
      from a decrease of cognitive performance as well as grey matter local atrophy, particularly
      in the hippocampus and in the frontal lobes. According to fewer studies, white matter can
      also be affected by a demyelinisation process. These structural modifications are sometimes
      associated with disorders of executive and memory functions. In the elderly, no clear
      association can be drawn between cognitive decline and sleep apnea. Moreover, to our
      knowledge, the cerebral state of elderly symptomatic apneic subjects has mostly not be
      investigated.

      The goal of this project is to evaluate the impact of sleep apnea on the brain according to
      age. Our hypothesis is that adult apneic subjects would present local cerebral modification
      in the areas implied in cognition and memory, such as the hippocampus or the frontal areas,
      whereas elderly patients would present focal affects related to a deficit in the ventilatory
      and autonomic control without any major cognitive consequences.

      Understanding the consequences of sleep apnea according to age could permit to refine the
      indications of sleep apnea treatment, mainly in elderly patients.

    <description>The acquisition of the image will last 45 minutes with 6 sequences.
Before any examination, the manipulator will check the absence of contraindication to MRI.
During the fifth sequence, Gadolinium (Gadovist®) will be injected intravenously to the concentration 0.1 mmol / kg. For this, a venous catheter will be placed before the first sequence and then removed after the examination. This injection will be carried out according to the usual practice of MRI.
Throughout the examination, a physician will always be present.</description>
