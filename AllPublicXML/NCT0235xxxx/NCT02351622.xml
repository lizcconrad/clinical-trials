  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are undertaking a multicentre, randomised controlled trial of 120 adults
      with newly diagnosed ITP from 5 medical centers in China. Part of the participants are
      randomly selected to receive caffeic acid tablets combining dexamethasone and the other part
      are selected to receive high-dose dexamethasone treatment. Platelet count, bleeding and other
      symptoms were evaluated before and after treatment. Adverse events are also recorded
      throughout the study.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants' platelet count will be monitored weekly. Response will be evaluated after
      3, 6 and 12 months after treatment. If the participant did not get complete response or
      response after 3 months, he would quit the trail.

    <description>Complete response (CR)： A platelet count ≥ 100 * 10^9/L measured on two occasions &gt; 7 days apart and the absence of bleeding.
Response (R)： A platelet count ≥ 30 * 10^9/L and a greater than two fold increase in platelet count from baseline measured on two occasions &gt; 7 days apart and the absence of bleeding.
No response (NR)： A platelet count &lt; 30 * 10^9/L or a less than two fold increase in platelet count from baseline or the presence of bleeding. Platelet count must be measured on two occasions more than a day apart.
Relapses: platelet count falls below 30×10^9/L or bleeding accrues after achieving R or CR.</description>
