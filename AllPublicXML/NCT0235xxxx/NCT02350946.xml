  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to shed light on the basic neurobiological mechanisms which
      underlie social information processing in healthy men. More specifically, we intend to
      examine whether a person's social competence level is related to the patterns of neural
      activity and his visual search strategies during evaluation of social scenes. Furthermore, it
      will be assessed whether an oxytocin-driven increase in activity in brain areas relevant to
      the task will facilitate social information processing and thus enhance task performance.
      Additionally it will be examined whether oxytocin can facilitate response inhibition in an
      emotional context.

    <description>In the Social Detection Task, subjects' brain activity when viewing social scenes will be compared to corresponding control scenes in which no people are shown.
In the GoNoGo Task several emotional conditions will be compared to a neutral control condition.</description>
