  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Concurrent with the rising prevalence of childhood obesity, the co-morbid condition of
      non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become the leading cause of chronic liver
      disease among children. NAFLD is characterized by accrual of excess triglycerides (TG) in the
      liver that leads to inflammation, fibrosis, and cirrhosis. One-third of the pediatric
      population has NAFLD, a disease strongly associated with insulin-resistance and
      metabolic-syndrome (Met-S). NAFLD is predicted to become the leading cause of liver
      transplantation in adults by 2030.

      Current understanding of NAFLD indicates that presence of excess TG in liver is an absolute
      requirement for disease progression. First-line therapy for NAFLD is focused on decreasing
      adiposity and improving insulin sensitivity through diet and exercise. Recent adult data
      indicate that dietary carbohydrate-restriction is more effective at reducing hepatic
      TG-content than traditional calorie-restriction. Few studies have been conducted to establish
      resolution of hepatic steatosis by any intervention. Such studies in pediatrics are primarily
      limited by a need for liver biopsy. However, hepatic proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy
      (H-MRS) is a new innovative tool used to quantitatively measure hepatic TG content in a
      non-invasive manner.

      The primary aim is to compare the impact of dietary weight loss via carbohydrate-restriction
      and calorie-restriction on hepatic TG-content quantified by H-MRS in obese children with
      biopsy-proven NAFLD and Met-S.

      This IRB approved protocol is a randomized control study. The investigators will recruit
      subjects from the Center for Obesity and its Consequences in Health and the pediatric
      gastroenterology clinics between the ages of 11-17 years who meet criteria for NAFLD and
      Met-S. A H-MRS will be obtained in each subject prior to the start of dietary intervention.
      Fifty-four subjects will be randomized to either a carbohydrate-restricted or
      calorie-restricted diet for 6 months with no change in baseline activity. A repeat H-MRS will
      be compared to baseline to determine the whether dietary carbohydrate-restriction is superior
      to calorie-restriction for reducing hepatic TG content. The investigators believe that
      subjects on the carbohydrate-restricted diet will have marked decrease in hepatic TG content
      compared to those in the calorie-restricted diet given the same degree of reduction in body
      mass index.

      Specific Aims and Hypothesis:

      The Primary aim is:

      To compare the impact of dietary weight loss via carbohydrate-restriction and
      calorie-restriction on hepatic TG content quantified by H-MRS in obese children with
      biopsy-proven NAFLD and Met-S.

      Our Secondary aims are:

      To compare BMI z-score, ALT (analine transaminase) and cytokeratin 18 in obese patients with
      NAFLD and Met-S after a 6 month dietary weight loss via either carbohydrate or calorie
      restriction.

      Hypothesis: Obese children with biopsy-proven NAFLD and Met-S will experience a reduction in
      liver TG content, assessed by H-MRS, concurrent with 6 months of dietary weight loss;
      however, we anticipate that subjects undergoing carbohydrate restriction will experience a
      greater reduction in hepatic fat than those undergoing calorie restriction due to the
      limiting of precursors for lipid synthesis inherent to the diet (CHO) and the expected
      increase in hepatic oxidative metabolism (TG accrual is attenuated while disposal is
      enhanced).

      Methodology:

      Design:

      Our study is a 6 month prospective randomized controlled trial with outcomes assessment
      monthly for the first 6 months and a follow up visit at 10- 12 months after randomization.

      Setting:

      Recruitment and data collection will be completed at University of Texas Southwestern Medical
      Center and Children's Health, Dallas TX by study personnel. All patients who agree to
      participate will give informed written consent and assent. A study staff member will explain
      the study and review the consent and HIPAA forms with each patient. A copy of each signed
      form will be kept in the patient's study file. Each patient will also receive signed copies.

      Subjects:

      All patients referred (male and female) within the age range of 11 - 17 years who are obese
      (BMI &gt;= 95th percentile) and meet criteria for metabolic syndrome (MetS) and non-alcoholic

      Concise Summary of Project:

      This is a 6-month prospective, randomized control trial enrolling patients referred to the
      Children's Medical Center COACH Program. The COACH Program is a medical weight management
      clinic, which serves obese children in order to diagnose and treat associated co-morbid
      conditions.

      Subjects meeting all enrollment criteria will be randomized to either a carbohydrate- or
      calorie-restricted diet. They will be committed to this fixed meal plan for 6 months and
      dietary education by a certified dietician will be provided. This will include the allowed
      caloric intake and content, which is calculated by a bioelectric impedance meter (GE In Body
      520) specific to patient's age, gender, and weight.

      The carbohydrate-restricted diet is composed of 20% carbohydrates, 35% protein and 45% fat.
      The calorie-restricted diet is composed of 50%carbohydrate, 15-20% protein and 30-35% fat.
      Patients will be seen by a psychologist to help with goal setting, self-monitoring and
      problem solving. Dietary compliance will be followed regularly by weekly phone calls for the
      first 3 months and then monthly afterwards by the research personnel. A 72-hour dietary
      recall will be conducted by our dietician every other month. Subjects will be followed in the
      COACH clinic monthly. A detailed schedule will be outlined and provided to the families at
      each visit. Any missed appointments will be rescheduled within 3 to 7 days, and the families
      will be contacted immediately to offer assistance for the next visit. During this study,
      subjects will be monitored with urine tests and blood tests to ensure safety while undergoing
      the prescribed diet.

      The first proton hepatic magnetic spectroscopy (H-MRS) will be done prior to initiating the
      dietary intervention. A second H-MRS will be obtained after 2 months (at visit 3) on the
      assigned dietary therapy. The final H-MRS will be performed after completion of the 6 month
      dietary intervention. At the 6 month completion, the subjects will be seen in clinic and
      blood work with urine testing will be done. Their final visit will be 4 to 6 months post
      dietary intervention to assess weight maintenance.
