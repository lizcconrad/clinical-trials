  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine safety and efficacy of pl-vegf165 (&quot;Neovasculgen&quot;)
      for regeneration of peripheral nerve. Pl-vegf165 (&quot;Neovasculgen&quot;) is the permitted in Russian
      Federation angiogenic medication that induce growth of new vessels and included in a complex
      therapy for patients with peripheral arterial diseases in Russia. It has also been shown to
      enhance nerve regeneration and muscle reinnervation in animals but these properties have not
      previously been studied in patients. Moreover, currently there is no method in clinical use
      to speed the rate of recovery after nerve injury. The objective of this study is to explore
      the ability of pl-vegf165 to benefit the treatment of patients with peripheral nerve injury.
      The investigators hypothesize that treatment with intraneural injections with pl-vegf165
      after peripheral nerve reconstruction will accelerate nerve regeneration, reduce the period
      of denervation and improve muscle reinnervation and recovery in patients with peripheral
      nerve injury.

      All patients enrolled into the study will receive standard surgery procedures indicated in
      accordance with medical care standards for the certain disease. Patients after nerve injury
      classified as neurotmesis will receive surgical repair of injured nerves what will be added
      by intraneural injections of pl-vegf165. Safety and efficacy of gene therapy will be assessed
      by physical examination, comprehensive laboratory tests over next 18 month after surgical
      nerve reconstruction.

    <description>The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) Outcome Measure is a 30-item, self-report questionnaire designed to measure physical function and symptoms in patients with any or several musculoskeletal disorders of the upper limb. The questionnaire was designed to help describe the disability experienced by people with upper-limb disorders and also to monitor changes in symptoms and function over time. Testing has shown that the DASH performs well in both these roles.</description>

    <time_frame>90 days;180 days; 270 days; 360 days; 450 days; 540 days</time_frame>
    <description>In this scale, muscle strength is graded on a scale from 0 to 5 depending on ability to make whole fall active range of motion and presence of muscle resistance</description>

    <time_frame>90 days;180 days; 270 days; 360 days; 450 days; 540 days</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>

    <measure>Nerve conduction velocity</measure>
    <time_frame>180 days; 360 days; 540 days</time_frame>
    <description>For electrodiagnostic assessment, nerve conduction velocity (NCV) was tested as motor and sensory. The results categorized according to the Yale sensory scale and the severity of sensation and function of the nerves was scored as follows: 0, no sensation; 1, decreased or abnormal sensation; 2, normal sensation.</description>

    <description>For an EMG, a needle electrode was inserted through the skin into the muscle which injured nerve supplied. The presence, size and shape of the waveform registered and the ability of the muscle to respond when the nerves were stimulated. Also these results scored as follows: 0, no activity; 1, few or single movement; 2, partial activity; 3, full activity.</description>
