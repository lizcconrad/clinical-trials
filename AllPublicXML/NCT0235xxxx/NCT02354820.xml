  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project seeks to expand an existing computerized decision support system used in
      pediatric primary care. The expanded system will add a module that helps clinicians recognize
      constipated children and then provides evidence-based reminders for constipation management,
      as well as automates patient educational materials. The current system is deployed across
      multiple sites, and the constipation module will be randomized to deployment in different
      sites. The difference in constipation management and patient outcomes will then be compared
      between sites receiving the intervention and sites not receiving the intervention over a 12
      month period.
