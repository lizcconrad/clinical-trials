  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this multicenter randomised controlled trial (RCT) is to investigate if
      exercise can modify the disease course and prevent comorbidity in patient with
      spondyloarthritis (SpA).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      International guidelines recommend exercise as a cornerstone in the management of SpA. Due to
      the typical features of SpA with reduced spinal mobility, the main focus for exercise has
      been flexibility exercise. Exercise trials for this patient group have mainly aimed at
      improving spinal mobility and there is limited evidence of the potential effects of exercise
      on disease pathogenesis and CVD risk factors.

    <description>An exercise program for 40-60 minutes three times a week in 3 months. Twice a week the exercise sessions will be supervised by a physiotherapist and these sessions will consist of endurance and strength training. The endurance training will be high intensity interval training on a treadmill. And strength training with external load for the major muscle groups (individually adapted: six exercises, eight to ten repetitions maximum, two to three sets). Once a week the participants will exercise individually for a minimum of 40 minutes of endurance exercise.</description>
