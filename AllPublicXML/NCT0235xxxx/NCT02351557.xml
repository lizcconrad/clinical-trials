  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examines the effect of blood flow through the lungs and the body on the
      consumption and hence requirement of the anesthetic agent isoflurane.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The effect of cardiac output on the uptake of isoflurane is yet to be quantified. This study
      aims to obtain a quantifiable relationship between isoflurane uptake and cardiac output. The
      study patients will be cardiac patients in whom anesthesia is induced with fentanyl ,
      propofol and maintained on isoflurane . The baseline cardiac index from the pulmonary artery
      catheter as displayed on the continuous cardiac output monitor will be used to classify the
      patients into two groups with cardiac index of 2.1 liters per minute per square meter as the
      differentiating criteria. No change in the anesthesia protocol will be done for the two
      groups.The study is designed such that all vascular catheterisations and the dose of
      isoflurane administered is as per prevailing institutional protocols and that no other
      intervention particular or unique to the study is done. As such the data that the study will
      use is also routinely acquired during the procedure but not systematically stored, which is
      what the study will do. This, we suggest, makes the study an observational study.The
      continuous cardiac output data and the inspired and expired concentration of isoflurane as
      displayed on the monitor will be recorded online. Data will be collected from the start of
      isoflurane till 30 minutes or till the surgeon starts cannulating the great vessels. The data
      so obtained will be analysed in two groups based on the baseline cardiac index using
      Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) for difference in uptake between the
      groups.
