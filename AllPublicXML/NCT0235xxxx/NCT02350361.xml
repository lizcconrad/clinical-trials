  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Here we are going to find a method by using available multiple drugs including angiogenesis
      medicine - Endostar to treat lung cancer patients who acquired resistence from EGFR-TKI but
      have responsed to it before.

      Lung cancer patients who received epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase
      inhibitors(EGFR-TKI) will acquiring resistance to the drug. This is a study of using
      Endostar, an angiogentic medicine, combination with chemotherapy and EGFR-TKI in lung cancer
      rechallenging treatment after resistance of EGFR-TKI and progression disease.
