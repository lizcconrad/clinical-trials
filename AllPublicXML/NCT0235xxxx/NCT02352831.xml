  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are two parts to this study: the goal of the first part of the study is to find the
      best dose of tosedostat when given in combination with capecitabine. The goal of the second
      part of the study is to look at how participants respond to treatment with tosedostat and
      capecitabine.

    <measure>Phase I only: Recommended Phase II dose and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Estimated to be 7 months (completion of cycle 1 of all participants in Phase I portion of study)</time_frame>
    <description>The recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) is defined as the dose level immediately below the dose level at which 2 patients of a cohort (of 2 to 6 patients) experience dose-limiting toxicity during the first cycle. If 0 or 1 of 6 patients in Dose Level 1 experience DLT during the first cycle, Dose Level 1 will be presumed to be the RP2D.
DLTs are followed through completion of the first cycle.</description>

    <measure>Phase II only: Progression-free survival (PFS) rate</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first.
Progressive disease (PD)
Target lesions: At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions).
Non target lesions: Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Unequivocal progression should not normally trump target lesion status. It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall response rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>ORR = Complete response + partial response
Target lesions
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm.
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.
Non target lesions *Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (&lt;10 mm short axis).</description>

          -  Histologically or cytologically proven metastatic or inoperable pancreatic
             adenocarcinoma.

          -  Measurable disease defined as lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one
             dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt;10 mm with CT scan or MRI, as &gt;20 mm
             by chest x-ray, or &gt;10 mm with calipers by clinical exam.

          -  Must have progressed on, been intolerant to, or refused gemcitabine-based therapy.

          -  Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control, abstinence) prior to study entry and for
             the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while participating in this study, she must inform her treating physician
             immediately.

          -  Able to understand and willing to sign an IRB approved written informed consent
             document (or that of legally authorized representative, if applicable).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Chemotherapy &lt; 2 weeks prior to the first planned dose of study treatment.

          -  Radiotherapy &lt; 3 weeks prior to the first planned dose of study treatment.

          -  A history of other malignancy ≤ 2 years previous with the exception of basal cell or

             carcinoma in situ of the cervix.

          -  Currently receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Known brain metastases. Patients with known brain metastases must be excluded from
             this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop
             progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic
             and other adverse events.

          -  A history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or
             biologic composition to tosedostat or capecitabine or other agents used in the study.

          -  Previous treatment with any aminopeptidase inhibitor.

          -  Previous exposure to either 5-FU or capecitabine at a systemic dose except for use in
             concurrent chemoradiation.

          -  Known dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency or severe renal impairment
             (creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/min by Cockcroft-Gault formula), as this would preclude
             use of capecitabine.

          -  Significant cardiovascular disease defined as:

               -  Myocardial infarction within 6 months of screening.

               -  Unstable angina pectoris

               -  Uncontrolled or clinically significant arrhythmia Grade ≥ 2

               -  LVEF ≤ below institutional limits at screening

               -  Congestive heart failure NYHA class III or IV

               -  Presence of clinically significant valvular heart disease

               -  Baseline troponin I or T &gt; IULN and b-type natriuretic peptide &gt; IULN.

          -  Prior exposure to cardiotoxic agent, such as anthracyclines, within 3 months of
             enrollment.

          -  Patient must have a QTc interval on ECG ≤ 0.48 seconds by Bazett's calculation at
             screening.

          -  Patient may not be taking any drugs that prolong the QT/QTc interval. If patient is on
             any of these drugs, patient may enroll in the study if the drugs can be discontinued
             for at least 5 half-lives prior to the first dose of tosedostat and capecitabine.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Patients that are of childbearing age must have a
             negative pregnancy test at screening and agree on using contraception during the
             duration of the study.

          -  Known HIV-positivity on combination antiretroviral therapy because of the potential
             for pharmacokinetic interactions with tosedostat or capecitabine. In addition, these
             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.
