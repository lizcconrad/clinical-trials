      BACKGROUND:

      For patients with liver-limited metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), complete resection of
      liver metastases is the only potentially curative treatment. The current goal of medical
      treatment for colorectal cancer with initially unresectable liver metastases is to maximize
      the rate of secondary resection and prolong overall survival (OS). A strong correlation was
      found between response rate and secondary resection rate of metastases, and the triple drugs
      combination of infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin (5-FU/LV), irinotecan, and oxaliplatin
      (FOLFOXIRI) was recommended can be used in selected patients with potentially resectable
      metastases in order to improve response rate and make resection more possible. The addition
      of a anti-VEGFs monoclonal antibody such as bevacizumab to chemotherapy has been shown to
      increase response rate, resection rate and improve OS in the first-line treatment of mCRC
      patients. The efficacy and safety of bevacizumab in addition to triplet drugs were previously
      tested in OLIVIA trial, the resection rate of liver metastases of 49% was reported, and the
      response rate was 81%; most common grade 3-4 adverse events was neutropenia. On the basis of
      such promising results, we conducted the present randomized study to explore whether
      FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab compared with FOLFOXIRI alone as first-line treatment could
      improve radical resectability in patients with RAS mutation-type, unresectable liver-only
      metastatic colorectal cancer.

      OBJECTIVE:

      The primary objective of the FOBULM study is to evaluate the efficacy of FOLFOXIRI plus
      bevacizumab compared to FOLFOXIRI alone in patients with initially unresectable liver-limited
      RAS mutation-type mCRC.

      Secondary objectives are safety and tolerability of the treatment, efficacy in terms of
      objective response rate (ORR), OS, progression free survival (PFS), quality of life and an
      assessment of biomarkers for predictive response and prognosis.

      OVERVIEW OF TRIAL DESIGN

      This FOCULM trial is a a two-arm, multicenter, open labelled, prospective, randomized phase
