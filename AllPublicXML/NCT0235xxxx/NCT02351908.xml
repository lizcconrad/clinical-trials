  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to observe the safety of Truvada® (TDF/FTC) in relation to its
      impact on kidney function combined with different Integrase Inhibitors (Dolutegravir, or
      Elvitegravir/Cobicistat or Raltegravir), when given to patients who are commencing treatment
      for HIV infection for the first time.

      All three combinations (Raltegravir + Truvada®, Dolutegravir + Truvada® and Stribild®, a
      single pill which contains Elvitegravir/Cobicistat/Truvada®) are currently recommended by the
      national guide-lines and used in standard clinical practice.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will monitor kidney function, and compare the safety and effectiveness of Truvada®
      when taken with Dolutegravir, or Elvitegravir/Cobicistat or Raltegravir, over the first 48
      weeks of treatment in HIV-1 antiretrovirals naïve patients.

      The safety and how well these drug combinations are tolerated will be determined based on
      physical examinations, laboratory tests, and questions about any problems the participant
      might experience during the study. As part of this trial, levels of HIV-1 in the blood and
      urinary markers of kidney function and inflammatory markers will be measured at various times
      during the study.

      The total duration of participant involvement in the trial will be up to 48 weeks, with up to
      45 days between the screening and baseline visits. Participants will need to visit the clinic
      6 times within the 48 weeks.

      Once participants have been confirmed to be eligible to participate in the study,
      participants will attend for a baseline visit (day 1) where they will be randomly assigned to
      receive one of the three treatments listed below:

        -  Treatment Arm 1: Stribild® (EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF) 1 tablet once a day

        -  Treatment Arm 2: Isentress® (Raltegravir 400 mg) 1 tablet twice a day + Truvada® 1
           tablet once a day

        -  Treatment Arm 3: Tivicay® (Dolutegravir 50 mg) 1 tablet once a day + Truvada® 1 tablet
           once a day
