    <textblock>
      Prospective study conducted on 150 women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) were
      randomly divided into 3 groups: group I (50 women) received clomiphene citrate (CC) only 50
      mg orally every 8 hours started from cycle day 3 for 5 days, group II (50 women) received 2mg
      estradiol valerate daily from cycle day 7 - 11 in addition to CC and group III (50 women)
      received phytoestrogen (20mg of cimifuga racemosa from day 1- 12) in addition to CC.
