    <textblock>
      The prognosis of recurrent or metastatic esophageal squamous cell cancer is poor. However,
      there is still no standard chemotherapy regimen recommended for this disease because of the
      lack of trails. Currently, anti-angiogenesis therapy had been proved to improve the survival
      successfully in colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, glioma and
      kidney cancer. Recent studies showed that the high level of VEGF was negative correlated with
      the prognosis of esophageal cancer. Endostar, as a novel endogenous angiogenesis inhibitors,
      was proved to significantly inhibited the proliferation and metastasis in esophageal cell
      lines and animal models. A retrospective study also reported the safety and efficacy of the
      combination therapy of paclitaxel liposome and recombinant human endostatin. Based on the
      basis above, we designed this phase Ⅱ study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of endostar
      combined with paclitaxel and nedaplatin as first-line therapy in treating patients with
      recurrent or metastatic esophageal squamous cell cancer.
