  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) patients have an increased risk of ovarian
      hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) after assisted reproduction techniques (ART). In addition,
      these women have a high risk of develop further metabolic disorders. Rotterdam criteria
      defined by the European Society of Human Reproduction and Endocrinology (ESHRE) are used for
      the diagnosis of PCOS.

      The aim of this study is both to determine the prevalence of PCOS in infertile patients who
      require ART in our Center and to evaluate the usefulness of each specific diagnosis criterium
      within Rotterdam criteria of PCOS as predictor of risk of OHSS. It also seeks to establish a
      cohort of patients identified according to specific Rotterdam criteria of PCOS to assess the
      incidence of long term complications.

    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder in women. It affects
      10 % of patients who undergo assisted reproductive techniques (ART). Rotterdam criteria
      defined by the European Society of Human Reproduction and Endocrinology (ESHRE) are used for
      the diagnosis of PCOS. According to such criteria, PCOS affects 5-10% of women of
      reproductive age.

      Patients with PCOS according to the Rotterdam criteria, as well as those with polycystic
      ovaries by ultrasound, have a high risk of an exaggerated response to ovulation induction
      therapy. Complications of the ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) include
      hemoconcentration, thromboembolic disorders, electrolyte disorders, ascites, hydrothorax,
      ovarian torsion, respiratory failure, liver failure, kidney failure or even death.

      There is a lack of reliable markers that indicate risk of OHSS. It is also unknown whether
      any specific criteria proposed in the Rotterdam consensus is more important than another or
      independently influence on the results of the ARTs.

      The aim of this study is both to determine the prevalence of PCOS in infertile patients who
      require ART in our Center and to evaluate the usefulness of each specific diagnosis criteria
      of PCOS as predictor of risk of OHSS. It also seeks to establish a cohort of patients
      identified according to specific Rotterdam criteria of PCOS to assess the incidence of long
      term complications.

        Patients with primary infertility at risk of developing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome
        during controlled ovarian hyperstimulation. This population was defined according to the
        presence of at least one Rotterdam criterion or the presence of an abnromal luteal phase,
        invesion of the FSH/LH ratio or an increased AMH level (see inclusion and exclusion
        criteria below)

        Inclusion criteria:

        Patients with primary infertility undergoing ovarian stimulation for IVF/ICSI plus one of
        the following criteria:

          1. Ovulation dysfunction.

          2. Androgen excess: clinical and/or biochemical.

          3. Polycystic ovary by transvaginal ultrasound in early follicular phase.

          4. AMH&gt;35 pmol/l

          5. FSH/LH&lt;1

          6. P4 levels on the day of menstrual cycle &lt;10ng/ml and cycle duration &lt;26 days

          7. Patients who undergo a second cycle after a previous one in which they were considered
             high responders (the cycle was canceled due to high risk of OHSS or the patient
             underwent coasting)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Age &lt;18 or &gt;39 years
