  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with multiple metastatic nodules of melanoma, the investigators evaluated whether
      autologous cytokines injected into cutaneous metastases would induce a systemic immune
      response as evidenced by the accumulation of dense lymphocytic infiltrates in metastases that
      had never been injected. Such immune responses were observed, and often the never-injected
      metastasis regressed completely. 20% of patients remained free of disease for greater than 5
      years.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lymphocytic infiltrates were seen in never-injected nodules only after several weeks of
      injections elsewhere. No adverse events were seen. The tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were
      able to kill autologous melanoma ex vivo. Some patients who experienced complete regressions
      of all metastases lived without disease for over 10 years.
