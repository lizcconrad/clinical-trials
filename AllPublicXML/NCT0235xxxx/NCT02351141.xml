      The investigators will apply 129Xenon and/or 3He image acquisition and analysis methods in
      120 asthma patient volunteers in order to characterize and probe the relationship between
      lung structure and function using imaging.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory, longitudinal study with no medication evaluated. 120 asthma patients
      will visit the Clinical Imaging Research Laboratories at Robarts Research Institute two times
      over three years: at baseline, and at three years. For the first 60 subjects there will be 3
      additional visits - two visits within 4 weeks of baseline (BL+2 weeks; BL+4 weeks; BL+78
      weeks) in order to help generate reproducibility data and temporal maps.

      For all subjects, the Baseline visit will include 129Xe and/or 3He MRI, chest CT, sputum
      induction, Pulmonary Function Tests, Airwave Oscillation test, Lung Clearance Index test,
      BORG Dyspnea Scale, and MRC Dyspnea Scale. All procedures will be before, during and after
      methacholine challenge (MCh). For V2, all but CT and MCh will be acquired.

      Visits 1a and 1b will include MRI, Pulmonary Function Tests including Airwave Oscillation and
      Lung Clearance Index, and dyspnea questionnaires; Visit 1c will also include sputum
      induction.

      There will be a telephone call at 52+/- 2 weeks, and 104 +/- 2 weeks. to track exacerbations
      and update medications. Subjects will complete self-assessments in the form of a) the Asthma
      Quality of Life Questionnaire with Standardized Activities (AQLQ(S)) bi-weekly, and the
      Asthma Control Diary (weekly) between visits. Self-reported data (the weekly asthma control
      diary and bi-weekly AQLQ(S)) will be uploaded by each subject monthly to the investigators
      website using a confidential and password protected upload
      (www.imaging.robarts.ca/~gep/ForPatients.htm).

    <intervention_name>Hyperpolarized Noble Gas MRI</intervention_name>
    <description>Hyperpolarized Helium-3 and/or Xenon-129. Noble gas magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has recently emerged as another research approach for the non-invasive measurement of lung structure and function, including conduction of gas through airways and into airspaces.
Noble gas MRI provides a complimentary and alternative method for evaluating lung disease and may be superior to CT because it allows simultaneous visualization of both airway and airspace structure and function.</description>
