  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of acupuncture on functional dyspepsia
      compared with sham control. The study aims to clarify the mechanism of acupuncture by
      assessing functional magnetic resonance imaging and metabolomics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Functional dyspepsia (FD) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder without any structural
      lesion. Due to the lack of satisfactory effect of conventional treatments, many FD patients
      turn to alternative treatments such as acupuncture. Acupuncture, one of the most sought
      therapeutic modalities in traditional Korean Medicine, has been commonly used for treating
      gastrointestinal disorders.

      However, the effect and mechanism of acupuncture on FD has not been rigorously evaluated. In
      the present study, we will investigate whether 10 sessions of acupuncture over 4 weeks, in
      comparison with sham acupuncture, improve symptoms of FD and activate regions of brain area.
      We will also perform metabolomics study to find the mechanism of acupuncture to FD. Outcome
      measures include proportion of responder, Korean version of Nepean Dyspepsia Index,
      Functional Dyspepsia-Related Quality of Life, Ways of Coping Question, Coping Strategy
      Questionnaire, Perception of bodily sensation, The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Center for
      Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, functional magnetic resonance imaging and metabolomic
      study.

    <description>The proportion of patients who answer &quot;Yes&quot; to more than half of adequate relief questions in the treatment period. Patients are expected to report their response to the acupuncture treatment by answering the following question at each visit: &quot;After the last visit, have you had adequate relief of your stomach pain or discomfort?&quot; Questions will be asked at each visit during treatment period (Twice a week for 4 wks, total 10 times - 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5 wks). Responders are defined as patients reporting adequate relief for at least 50% of the study period (more than 5 times of &quot;Yes&quot; to adequate relief question out of total 10 questions). The proportion of responder will be compared statistically between intervention groups.</description>

    <measure>Nepean Dyspepsia Index - Korean version (NDI-K)</measure>
    <time_frame>treatment (0 wks), After treatment (4 wks)</time_frame>
    <description>The Nepean Dyspepsia Index is a reliable and valid measure of quality of life in FD. The Nepean Dyspepsia Index originally contains 42 items designed to measure impairment of a subjective ability engaged in relevant aspects of their life because of dyspepsia. It was subsequently shortened to 25 items, yielding 5 sub-scales. NDI-K, validated in 2003 by Lee at al., made up of 2 sections which are about symptom-based questions and quality of life. In this trial, symptom-based questions, i.e. questions about period, severity and distressful degree of 15 symptoms, will be evaluated.</description>

It has 66-items, each with a 4-point Likert scale indicating the frequency with which the strategy was used. The measure comprises eight scales representing theoretically different coping strategies: confrontative coping, distancing, self-controlling, seeking social support, accepting responsibility, escape-avoidance, problem solving, and positive reappraisal.</description>

    <description>The Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D), originally published by Radloff in 1977, is a 20-item measure that asks caregivers to rate how often over the past week they experienced symptoms associated with depression, such as restless sleep, poor appetite, and feeling lonely. Response options range from 0 to 3 for each item (0 = Rarely or None of the Time, 1 = Some or little of the time, 2 = Moderately or much of the time, 3 = Most or almost all the time). Scores range from 0 to 60, with high scores indicating greater depressive symptoms.</description>

The STAI measures two types of anxiety - state anxiety (anxiety triggered by a specific event), and trait anxiety (anxiety derived from personal characteristic). Higher scores are positively correlated with higher levels of anxiety.</description>
