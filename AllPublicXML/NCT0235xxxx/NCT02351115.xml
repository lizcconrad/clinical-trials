      The purpose of this study is to determine whether people who usually have photosensitive

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether people who usually have photosensitive
      epilepsy will show a reduction in epileptic activity when they take a single dose of Staccato
      Alprazolam as compared to placebo. People with photosensitive epilepsy have changes on their
      electroencephalogram (EEG) when shown flashing lights. Three dose levels of Staccato
      Alprazolam will be compared to placebo.

      This study will also assess the level of sedation of Staccato Alprazolam compared to placebo.

             assessment scale in at least one eye condition

             block, or evidence of prior myocardial infarction (MI) or acute ischemia

          -  Hypotension (systolic blood pressure ≤90 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure ≤50 mm Hg),

             Hg) measured while seated at screening or baseline
