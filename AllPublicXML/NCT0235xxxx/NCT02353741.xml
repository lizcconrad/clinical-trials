    <textblock>
      This single-arm phase II study aims to study the efficacy of a possible first line treatment
      that combines epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKIs) with
      concurrent thoracic radiation therapy for stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with
      active EGFR mutation, as well as assessing PFS, OS, tumor response, etc. to verify that this
      new combinational therapy can benefit short-term and long-term survival of the patients with
      advanced NSCLC.

    <textblock>
      Based on NCCN guideline of the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor
      (EGFR-TKIs) such as erlotinib, gefitinib and icotinib as the first line treatment for
      advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), the efficacy of EGFR-TKIs in combination with
      thoracic radiotherapy as the first line treatment for stage IV NSCLC with active EGFR
      mutation remains unknown. In this single-arm phase II trial, we chose the subjects with stage
      IV harboring active EGFR mutation,who were treated by EGFR-TKIs combined with radiation
      therapy. The primary endpoint is 1-year rate of progression-free survival and the second
      endpoints are overall survival (OS), objective response rate and toxic and side effect. By
      evaluating them, we expect to find out the evidence that the combination therapy can benefit
      the short-term and long-term survival of the patients. Meanwhile, via the stratification
      analysis of tumor biomarker and immune index, we obtain the evidences for the benefits of
      comprehensive and individual treatment for advanced NSCLC.
