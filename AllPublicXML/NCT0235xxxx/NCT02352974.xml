      The objectives of this study is to

        -  Evaluate the safety of giving GAD-Alum (Diamyd) directly into lymph glands in
           combination with an oral vitamin D regimen

        -  Evaluate how the above mentioned treatments influence the immune system and endogenous
           insulin secretion.

      Eligible patients will be treated with 4 µg GAD-Alum into an inguinal lymph gland at three
      occasions, with one month intervals in combination with Vitamin D (14 000 IU/week) for 4
      months, starting 1 month prior to first GAD-Alum injection.
