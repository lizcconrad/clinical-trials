  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this protocol is to expand access for patients who lack a fully HLA (Human
      leukocyte antigen) matched sibling donor and who are candidates for allogeneic hematopoietic
      stem cell transplant (HSCT). These patients have a serious or immediately life-threatening
      disease for which HSCT is indicated. These patients are not eligible for other Children's
      Hospital of Philadelphia IRB approved protocols that utilize CliniMACs technology for T
      depletion.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Only 25-30% of patients who may benefit from HSCT have a matched related donor. There is a
      higher rate of complications using cells from an unrelated or partially matched related
      donor. T cells within the donor cells may cause a complication called graft vs. host disease
      (GVHD). The goal of this study is to use the CliniMACs device to remove the T cells that
      cause GVHD, called T cell depletion.
