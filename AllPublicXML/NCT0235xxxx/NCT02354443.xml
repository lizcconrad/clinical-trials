      The purpose of this study is to describe the safety profile of ProHema-CB as part of a single
      cord blood unit transplant after a myeloablative conditioning regimen in pediatric patients
      with inherited metabolic disorders. The safety profile will primarily be assessed by
      neutrophil engraftment.

      This study is an open-label trial of the safety of a single cord blood transplant using
      ProHema-CB following busulfan/cyclophosphamide/ATG conditioning for pediatric patients with
      inherited metabolic disorders.

      A maximum of 12 eligible male and female subjects (1 to 18 years old, inclusive) will be
      enrolled and treated in the trial at approximately 1 to 3 centers within the U.S.

      All subjects will be admitted to the hospital, per institutional practice and will receive a
      conditioning regimen, after which they will receive a HLA-matched or partially matched
      ProHema -CB unit on Day 0.

      They will receive study follow up assessments weekly following Day 0 through Day 100 and
      study visit Days 180, 270, 365 and 730.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have a confirmed diagnosis of an inherited metabolic disorder (IMD) and
             be amenable to treatment by hematopoietic cell transplantation:

               -  Mucopolysaccharidoses: Hurler Syndrome (MPS IH), MPS I-HS (Hurler-Scheie
                  Syndrome), Hunter Syndrome (MPS II), Sanfilippo Syndrome (MPS III), or MPS VI
                  (Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome) with early neurologic involvement and/or sensitization
                  to enzyme replacement therapy (ERT); or

               -  Leukodystrophies: Krabbe disease (Globoid Leukodystrophy), Metachromatic
                  Leukodystrophy (MLD), Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD and AMN); or

               -  Other IMD with lysosomal storage disorder including glycoproteinoses
                  (Alpha-Mannosidosis, Mucolipidosis II or I-Cell disease), sphingo- and other
                  lipidoses (Sandhoff disease, Tay Sachs disease, Pelizaeus Merzbacher (PMD),
                  Niemann-Pick disease, GM1 gangliosidosis, Wolman's disease.

          2. Male and female subjects aged 1 to 18 years, inclusive.

          3. Lack of 4 6/6 HLA matched non-carrier related UCB or 8/8 HLA A, B, C, DRß1 matched
             non-carrier related or 8/8 unrelated bone marrow donor; or donor not available within
             appropriate timeframe, as determined by the transplant physician.

          4. Availability of suitable primary and secondary umbilical cord blood (UCB) units.

          5. Adequate performance status, defined as:

               -  Subjects ≥ 16 years: Karnofsky score ≥ 70%.

               -  Subjects &lt; 16 years: Lansky score ≥ 70%.

          6. Cardiac: Left ventricular ejection fraction at rest must be &gt; 40%, or shortening
             fraction &gt; 26%.

             x 3 ULN (all elevations beyond the ULN must be secondary to the primary IMD and not a
             comorbid condition).

         10. Signed IRB approved Informed Consent Form (ICF).

          3. Requirement for continuous respiratory supportive therapy (e.g. ventilator). Patients
             on intermittent respiratory support should be discussed with the Sponsor.

          4. Active problems related to chronic aspiration.

          5. Uncontrolled seizures.

          6. Any active malignancy or myelodysplastic syndrome or any history of malignancy.

          7. Inability to give informed consent/assent or to comply with the requirements for care
             after allogeneic stem cell transplantation.
