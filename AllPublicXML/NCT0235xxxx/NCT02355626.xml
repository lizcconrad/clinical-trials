  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety is commonly considered as an epiphenomenon of the cognitive and emotional response to
      a threat. Anxiety is a consequence of the reciprocal interaction between stress and the
      neuroendocrine, autonomic and immune systems. A systematic and circumstantial assessment of
      anxiety in critically ill patients has never been done. Our hypothesis is that high levels of
      anxiety at ICU admission are associated with death or the occurrence of one or more organ
      failure during the first 7 days, and that anxiety should be considered as a &quot;warning sign&quot; in
      critically ill patients.

      Multicentre prospective study. Demographic data, diagnosis, severity scores and vital signs
      will be assessed at admission.

      Within the first 12 hours, and at day 4 and day 7, anxiety will be assessed by the STAI
      scale, Geriatric Anxiety Inventory (GAI) scale, and a specific questionnaire assessing
      anxiety in the intensive care (REAX). Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scoring for anxiety,
      starvation, thirst, pain and dyspnoea will be collected daily. Anxiety and depression will be
      evaluated by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) on day 7. Patients will be
      assessed by psychologists or trained doctors, the team in charge of the patient will not be
      aware of the result of this evaluation.

      Clinical and biological data regarding the hemodynamic, neurological, respiratory and renal
      status will be collected from admission to day 7, as well as parameters required for
      computing the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score.
