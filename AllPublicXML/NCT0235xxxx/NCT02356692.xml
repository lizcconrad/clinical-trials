    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to investigate the overall clinical comfort performance of
      enfilcon A and senofilcon A lenses over 15-minutes of lens wear.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Comparison of the clinical comfort performance of two contact lenses to determine performance
      advantages or disadvantages of enfilcon A compared to senofilcon A. The key variable of
      interest is initial comfort differences.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Based on his/her knowledge, must be in good general health.

          2. Be 18 to 38 years old.

          3. Be able and willing to adhere to the instructions set forth in this protocol and
             complete all specified evaluation.

          4. Read, indicate understanding of, and sign Written Informed Consent.

          5. Be existing or successfully adapted users of soft contact lenses, but not currently
             wearing either of the study lenses (Avaira or Oasys) being evaluated in this trial.

          6. Require a visual correction in both eyes.

          7. Require a prescription between +8.00D and -12.00D and have less than or equal to 0.75D
             of astigmatism in both eyes.

          8. Achieve visual acuity of 20/25 or better in each eye with a spherical contact lens
             prescription.

          9. Have normal eyes with no evidence of abnormality or disease. For the purposes of this
             study a normal eye is defined as one having:

               -  No amblyopia.

               -  No evidence of lid abnormality or infection (e.g. entropion, ectropion, chalazia,
                  recurrent styes).

               -  lamp findings Grade 2 or above: corneal edema, tarsal abnormalities, and
                  conjunctival injection).

               -  No other active ocular disease (e.g. glaucoma, history of recurrent corneal
                  erosions, cornea [infiltrates], conjunctiva, lids, and intraocular infection or
                  inflammation of an allergic, bacterial, or viral etiology).

               -  No aphakia.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. 0.75D or greater of refractive astigmatism in either eye.

          2. Presbyopic or current monovision contact lens wear.

          3. Cannot be currently wearing either lenses (Avaira or Oasys).

          4. Presence of clinically significant (grade 2-4) anterior segment abnormalities;
             inflammation such as iritis; or any infection of the eye, lids, or associated
             structures.

          5. Presence of ocular or systemic disease or need of medication which might interfere
             with contact lens wear.

          6. Slit lamp findings that would contraindicate contact lens wear such as:

               -  Pathological dry eye or associated findings

               -  Pterygium, pinguecula or corneal scars within the visual axis

               -  Neovascularization &gt; 0.75 mm in from the limbus

               -  Giant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC) worse than Grade 1

               -  Anterior uveitis or iritis (past or present)

               -  Seborrheic eczema, seborrheic conjunctivitis

               -  History of corneal ulcer or fungal infections

               -  Poor personal hygiene

               -  A known history of corneal hypoesthesia (reduced corneal sensitivity)

          7. Contact Lens best corrected Snellen visual acuities (VA) worse than 20/30.

          8. Aphakia, Keratoconus or a highly irregular cornea.
