      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety of autologous human Schwann cell (ahSC)
      transplantation in participants with chronic SCI.

      This trial design is phase I, open label, unblinded, non-randomized, and non-placebo
      controlled multiple injury cohorts.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For humans with chronic SCI, we hypothesize that axons might show improved function if myelin
      repair is induced with the implantation of ahSC. In addition spinal cord cavitation may be
      reduced, and neural sprouting and plasticity may be enhanced via neurotrophic effects. In
      this trial, subjects will receive fitness conditioning and rehabilitation prior to
      transplantation in order to validate the stability of their neurological baseline and enhance
      their ability to undergo surgery with few complications. They will also receive fitness
      conditioning and rehabilitation post-transplantation to maintain health and promote neuronal
      activity and potential neuroplasticity.

      Trial enrollment will target 2 cohorts. The first cohort will be thoracic (T) level 2-12 ASIA
      Impairment Scale (AIS) grade A, B, or C (n = up to 4), the second cohort will be cervical (C)
      level 5 through T1 AIS A, B, or C (n = up to 6). Two (2) participants with AIS grade A will
      be enrolled prior to enrolling a participant with AIS B or C, applicable to both cohorts.

      Participants will be monitored throughout a 6 month post-transplantation evaluation period
      for occurrence of AEs (acute, delayed, and/or cumulative), as well as for changes in clinical
      status and neurological status. Safety and efficacy assessments will be performed at weeks 1
      and 2 post-transplantation and months 2 and 6 post-transplantation.
