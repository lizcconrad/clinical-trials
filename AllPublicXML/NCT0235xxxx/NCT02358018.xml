  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use a new type of scan, called 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT scan,
      instead of OctreoScan, the standard scan, to diagnose, monitor and manage your tumor.
      68Ga-DOTATOC is an improved imaging agent being routinely used in many centers outside the
      USA, with better tumor detection than with OctreoScan.

    <description>Study participants will undergo the 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT after informed consent. The nominal injected dose will be up 3-5.5 mCi containing approximately 10 - 50 microgram of 68Ga-DOTATOC and will be injected via IV access lines. CT scans will be performed with our standard oral contrast agent (typically Omnipaque and/or barium) in accordance with our standard FDG practice unless some contraindication is present. Uptake period following injection will be 0.75-1hour. Acquisition time will be approximately ~1 hour. In patients who may not be able to lie still, anesthesia will be provided as per routine standard clinical practice.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients diagnosed or suspected NET requiring 111In-pentetreotide imaging for clinical
             indications.

          -  High risk of NET because of familial predisposition with clinical findings requiring
             radiolabeled somatostatin imaging.

          -  Other somatostatin positive tumor for which 111In-pentetreotide has been used
             successfully (for example adult meningioma).

          -  Ability of subject or Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) (if the patient is
             deemed by the treating physician to be cognitively impaired or questionably impaired
             in such a way that the ability of the patient to give informed consent is
             questionable) to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or lactating women: Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the
             effects of 68Ga-DOTATOC in pregnancy are not known; exceptions may be performed if
             expected risk outweighs the benefit. Pregnancy testing will follow MITS procedure for
             diagnostic reagents. Patients self report pregnancy status. If pregnant the test will
             not be performed unless in the clinical opinion of the attending physician the gain of
             the test is likely to outweigh the risk (this will be rare). If unsure whether
             pregnant or not then a urine or serum pregnancy will be performed.

          -  Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants
             secondary to administration of 68Ga-DOTATOC in the mother, breastfeeding should be
             discontinued for at least one day if the mother receives 68Ga-DOTATOC.

          -  Patients that have contraindications for 111In-pentetreotide.

          -  Known severe allergy or hypersensitivity to oral contrast will preclude administration
             of such contrast (will preclude receiving oral contrast only).

          -  Patients with a body weight of 400 pounds or more or not able to enter the bore of the
             PET/CT scanner due to BMI, because of the compromise in image quality with CT, PET/CT
             and MRI that will result.

          -  Any additional medical condition, serious intercurrent illness, or other extenuating
             circumstance that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may significantly interfere
             with study compliance.
