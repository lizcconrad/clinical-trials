  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to demonstrate an improvement of vascular function, and
      particularly dependent vasodilation flow and micro-vasculature, by STENDO for diabetic
      patients compared to a control period in crossover.

      Action by shear stress causing vasodilation away from the microcirculation, STENDO should
      have a beneficial effect on vascular function in type 2 diabetics. These effects could be
      both treble just after the completion of a session with the device, and chronic with a
      potentiating effect of different sessions.

      The investigators propose to study the different vascular function evaluation parameters we
      have, to highlight these acute and chronic changes. The investigators will also study the
      physical abilities to change topics and behavioral changes (spontaneous physical activity in
      particular) and impact on subject quality of life.

      Patients will be screened during a visit V0. A collection of consent (informed consent form),
      clinical examination and a fasting blood test will be carried out during this visit.
      Laboratory tests run-in will be composed of: Cell Blood Count (CBC) platelets, renal function
      tests (serum electrolytes, urea and creatinine), liver function tests, fasting blood glucose
      levels and Lipid Profile). Measurement of blood Pressure (2 successive measurements at
      intervals of 5 min) and an electrocardiogram will be realized. The different information
      collected at enrollment will allow stratification of cardiovascular risk by reference
      integrators scores (ESC-SCORE (European Society of Cardiology Score) and Framingham Heart
      Study).

      The feasibility of measures for study criteria (functional measurements and assays) will be
      tested fasting during this visit as the blood test.
