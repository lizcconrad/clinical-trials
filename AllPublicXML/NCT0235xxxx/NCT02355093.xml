  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare continuous femoral nerve block with adductor canal block after
      anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction arthroscopically，especially in the effect on
      quadriceps strength; and to evaluate which regional anesthesia is more ideal for the patients
      postoperatively.

    <textblock>
      Forty patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists（ASA） Ⅰ-Ⅲ（no limitation of age and
      gender）are randomized to receive either a continuous adductor canal block(ACB) or a femoral
      nerve block(FNB) via a catheter (a continuous infusion of 0.2% ropivacaine, 5 mL/h for 48
      hours)in the PACU immediately after the anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction
      arthroscopically. Patients were under general anesthesia during the operation and received a
      femoral nerve block with 0.25% ropivacaine 10ml before the surgery.Both groups will receive
      postoperatively IV patient controlled analgesia (PCA) with morphine (bolus 0.8mg,lock-out
      time 15 minutes, background infusion 2ml/h)beside the continuous nerve block. Patients are
      going to be visited for follow-up on the day of surgery and in the following two days.
      Quadriceps strength is assessed with the displacement of patella.VAS at rest time、degree of
      knee flexion、VAS at 45°flexion of the knee、dose of opioids、whether the patient has sleep
      disturbance are also recorded.

    <description>We performed an ultrasound survey at the medial part of the thigh，the needle is introduced in-plane and 2 to 3 mL of saline is used to ensure correct placement of the needle in the vicinity of the saphenous nerve in the adductor canal,the catheter is introduced and advanced 1 to 2 cm beyond the tip of the needle.The study medication is administered as an infusion of 0.2% ropivacaine at a rate of 5mL/h during the next 48 hours.</description>

    <description>the catheter is inserted in-plane with the probe parallel to the inguinal crease, to obtain a short-axis view of the nerve. The correct needle placement is confirmed by injecting 2 to 3 mL of saline to cause tissue expansion below the iliac fascia, lateral to the femoral artery, and in the vicinity of the femoral nerve. The catheter is introduced 1 to 2 cm beyond the tip of the needle，an infusion of 0.2% ropivacaine at a rate of 5mL/h is administered during the next 48 hours.</description>
