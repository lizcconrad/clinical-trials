    <textblock>
      Planned enrollment is approximately twelve subjects with stable chronic heart failure.
      Enrolled subjects will receive up to eight sequential days of continuous, stepwise, dose
      increasing, subcutaneous (SQ) infusions of open-label cenderitide via the Insulet Drug
      Delivery System. Planned infusion rates of cenderitide will be administered to subjects
      continuously during four, 48-hour infusion periods.
