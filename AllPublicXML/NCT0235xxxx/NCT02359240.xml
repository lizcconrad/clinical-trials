    <textblock>
      The current project was designed to examine dynamic changes in muscle wasting during sepsis.
      Researchers will focus the mitochondrial dysfunction of muscle cells and investigate the role
      of HO-1 in it. Researchers interested in identifying factors involved in the pathology of
      muscle wasting during sepsis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rapid muscle atrophy or muscle wasting occured to septic patients.Sepsis induced muscle
      wasting has become a severe, frequent, and persistent complication among critically ill
      patients. Multiple factors including ubiquitin-proteasome system, proinflammatory cytokines
      and oxidative stress contribute muscle proteolysis.

      It is known that heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) possesses a variety of functions like
      anti-inflammatory, antioxidative and anti-apoptosis effects. In order to investigate the
      mechanisms under the condition, researchers are going to examine the role of HO-1 in muscle
      atrophy during sepsis.

    <description>Septic patients will be treated according to the international guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock 2012. Skeletal muscle biopsies, blotted free from blood, are frozen within 30 seconds in liquid nitrogen, and stored in liquid nitrogen until processing.150-300 mg muscle (wet weight) was routinely obtained , which is more than sufficient for the analyses proposed, with some muscle remaining for any additional validation assays that may arise during the course of the research. Muscle will be processed either for isolation of mRNA/microRNA or protein</description>
