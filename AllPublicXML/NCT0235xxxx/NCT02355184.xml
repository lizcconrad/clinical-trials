      This study is a Phase 2b, multi-center, extension study designed to evaluate the long-term
      efficacy, safety, and tolerability of PRO 140 monotherapy for the maintenance of viral
      suppression in patients who were stable on combination antiretroviral therapy and completed
      12 weeks of treatment under PRO140_CD01 Treatment Substitution Study without experiencing
      virologic failure.

      Consenting patients will continue to receive PRO 140 monotherapy for 160 additional weeks.
      Total treatment duration with PRO 140 will be up to 161 weeks with one week overlap of
      existing retroviral regimen and PRO 140 at the end of the treatment extension phase in
      subjects who do not experience virologic failure.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who have completed 12 weeks of treatment in PRO 140_CD01 study without
             experiencing virologic failure.

          2. Both male and female patients and their partners of childbearing potential must agree
             to use appropriate birth control methods (birth control pills, barriers, or
             abstinence) throughout the study duration (excluding women who are not of childbearing
             potential and men who have been sterilized). Females of childbearing potential must
             have a negative urine pregnancy test prior to receiving the first dose of study drug.

          3. Willing and able to participate in all aspects of the study, including use of SC
             medication, completion of subjective evaluations, attendance at scheduled clinic
             visits, and compliance with all protocol requirements as evidenced by providing
             written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Not currently enrolled in PRO140_CD01 Treatment Substitution Study

          2. Any acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining illness according to the 1993
             Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) AIDS surveillance definition

          3. Laboratory test values ≥ grade 4 DAIDS laboratory abnormality.

          4. Females who are pregnant, lactating, or breastfeeding, or who plan to become pregnant
             during the study

          5. Unexplained temperature &gt;38.5C (101.3F) for seven consecutive days within 14 days
             prior to the first study dose

          6. Diagnosed with either substance dependence or substance abuse or any history of a
             concomitant condition (e.g., medical, psychologic, or psychiatric) that in the opinion
             of the primary care provider and/or site investigator would interfere with the
             subject's successful completion of the study requirements

          7. Any other clinical condition that, in the Investigator's judgment, would potentially
             compromise study compliance or the ability to evaluate safety/efficacy
