      The purpose of the current study is to examine whether changes in intraoperative ambient
      temperature has in impact on the clinical performance of the physicians in training which
      include Anesthesiology and Surgical residents, fellows and certified nurse anesthetists
      (CRNA). Reaction times will be measured via a 10-minute psychomotor vigilance test (PVT,
      Ambulatory Monitoring Inc., NY) device.
