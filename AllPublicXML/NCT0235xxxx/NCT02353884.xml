      The purpose of this study is to find the characteristics of mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
      using technology of Multi-Modality MRI , including structural MRI, functional MRI and
      diffusion tensor imaging(DTI). Then analyze the difference between progressive MCI (MCIp) and
      stable MCI (MCIs) and further construct the predictable classifier from MCI to Alzheimer's
      disease (AD) based on Multi-Modality MRI characteristics of MCI patients.

      The cognition of MCI is between normal healthy and AD, which is thought the transitional
      stage of AD. Patients with MCI have heavy risk to convert to AD, so in this study, the
      investigators focus on the exploration of the characteristics of mild cognitive impairment
      (MCI) using technology of Multi-Modality MRI, including structural MRI, functional MRI and
      DTI. Then the investigators further study the patients who convert to AD and explore their
      MRI characteristics on baseline, in order to construct the predictable classifier from MCI to
      AD. The investigators want to achieve the early diagnosis of AD and help clinicians interfere
      with the progress of this disease.

    <description>one-hundred MCI subjects and 50 healthy controls recruited underwent structure,resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging.After 2-year follow-up,the MCI subjects were divided into progressive MCI(MCIp) and stable MCI(MCIs).Based on differences among MCIp，MCIs and healthy controls in baseline neuroimaging data，some suitable indicators were selected，and then a predictable classifier from MCI to AD based on multi-modality MRI was constructed.At last，the leave-one-out cross validation analysis were conducted to estimate the accuracy of the classifier.The classification accuracy was measured by the proportion of MCI subjects that were correctly classified into the MCIp or MCIs groups</description>
