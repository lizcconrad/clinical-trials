  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is intended to assess the vulnerability of plaques seen on CCTA by means of
      TVC Imaging System and to make comparisons between plaques with adverse plaque
      characteristics and ones without adverse plaque characteristics in terms of plaque volume and
      lipid core contents.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is to be conducted in two phases - Phases 1 and 2. In Phase 1, the vulnerability
      of plaques seen on CCTA will be assessed with TVC Imaging System, and the plaque volume and
      lipid core contents of plaques with versus without adverse plaque characteristics will be
      compared. For the purpose of this study, the study of this phase will be a cross-sectional
      study in which the shapes of vulnerable plaques seen on CCTA will be compared to their
      vulnerability visualized by the TVC Imaging System.

      In Phase 2, the patients with multi-vessel (polyvascular) disease of those participating in
      Phase 1 will be included, and the study of this phase will be a longitudinal study in which
      serial TVC imaging will be performed for non-target vessels, and any differences in changes
      of plaque vulnerability when treated with moderate-dose versus high-dose statin will be
      comparatively analyzed. The purpose of the present study is to determine whether there are
      any significant differences in changes of plaque volume and stability when treated with
      high-dose versus moderate-dose statin.
