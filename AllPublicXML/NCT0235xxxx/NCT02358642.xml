  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Older people with neurological dysphagia are at risk of recurrent aspiration
      pneumonia. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) has been shown to improve
      swallowing and cough reflexes which may protect dysphagic patients from aspiration pneumonia.

      Hypotheses: ACEI reduces the risk of pneumonia in older patients who are nasogastric tube fed
      because of dysphagia from cerebrovascular diseases.

      Design: Randomized placebo controlled trial

      Method: 302 older patients who have been tube fed for more than two weeks because of
      dysphagia secondary to cerebrovascular diseases are randomized to take half of lisinopril 5
      mg or placebo tablet once daily for 26 weeks. The subjects will be recruited from medical
      wards in Prince of Wales and Shatin Hospitals, and from outpatients of geriatric or speech
      therapy clinics, who have had hospital stay in previous three months. The subjects are
      followed up at week 12 and 26. The primary outcome is the incidence rate of pneumonia as
      determined by pneumonic change on X ray and clinical criteria. The secondary outcomes are
      mortality rate, total episodes of pneumonia over 26 weeks, and swallowing ability defined by
      the Royal Brisbane Hospital Outcome Measure at week 12. Cost effectiveness analysis of public
      health care and personal health care costs will be performed. Intention to treat and log rank
      will be used to analyzed the group differences in outcomes. 60 subjects (30 in each trial
      group) recruited from medical inpatients at Prince of Wales Hospital will undergo swallowing
      videofluoscopy at baseline and week 12 follow-up.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The interim analysis suggested that low dose lisinopril given to be tube fed older patients
    with neuroligical dysphagia had increased mortality.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Tube fed for more than four weeks for reason of neurological dysphagia as recommended
             by a trained speech therapist;

          -  clinical diagnosis of cerebrovascular diseases, confirmed by CT head scan. The reason
             for restricting the subjects to those with cerebrovascular disease is that previous
             studies which showed beneficial effects of ACEI on dysphagia were mostly based on
             stroke patients.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  life expectancy less than six months;

          -  live outside Shatin area;

          -  systolic blood pressure less than 100 mm Hg;

          -  known intolerance of ACEI;

          -  existing use of ACEI or angiotensin receptor blockers;

          -  symptomatic chronic lung disease or cardiac failure;

          -  frequent withdrawal of enteral tube by patients;

          -  serum creatinine &gt;100 Âµmol/L;

          -  serum potassium &gt; 5.1 mmol/L.
