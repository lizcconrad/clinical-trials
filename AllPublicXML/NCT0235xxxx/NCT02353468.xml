      This phase II trial studies how well giving bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone
      together works in treating patients with multiple myeloma undergoing stem cell transplant.
      Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for
      cell growth. Biological therapies, such as lenalidomide, may stimulate the immune system in
      different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      dexamethasone, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing
      the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving bortezomib, lenalidomide, and
      dexamethasone together may kill more cancer cells.

      CONSOLIDATION: Patients receive bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (VLD) therapy
      comprising bortezomib intravenously (IV) on days 1, 4, 8, and 11, lenalidomide orally (PO)
      once daily (QD) on days 1-14, and dexamethasone PO or IV on days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and
      12. Courses continue for 28 days and repeat every 3 months in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      In between courses of VLD, patients receive Lenalidomide + Dexamethasone (LD) therapy
      comprising lenalidomide PO QD on days 1-21 and dexamethasone PO QD or IV every Monday (x3).
      Courses continue for 28 days.

      MAINTENANCE: Starting in the third year of therapy, patients receive lenalidomide PO QD on
      days 1-14 and dexamethasone PO QD or IV every Monday (x2). Courses repeat every 4 weeks in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
