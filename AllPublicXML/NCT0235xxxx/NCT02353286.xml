  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with either post-cholecystectomy bile leak or benign biliary stricture are recruited
      for endoscopic insertion of a biodegradable biliary stent. A follow-up of 12 months with
      repeated serum samples and magnetic resonance imaging is scheduled. The primary end points
      are feasibility of endoscopic insertion with the novel implantation device and stricture or
      leak resolution as well as clinical treatment success.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Benign biliary strictures (BBS) and post-cholecystectomy bile leaks have traditionally been
      treated endoscopically with plastic stents. In BBS, promising results of covered
      self-expanding metal stent use have been recently published. However, in both BBS and
      post-cholecystectomy bile leak the need of stent therapy is temporary and endoscopic stent
      exchange or removal is unavoidable. These two groups of patients may be the ones that would
      most obviously benefit from biodegradable (BD) biliary stents. Studies of BD stents on animal
      models have shown excellent long term patency and safety both in biliary and pancreatic duct
      as well better outcome compared to plastic stents after post-cholecystectomy bile leak in an
      animal study. Until recently, non-operative insertion of BD polydioxanone stent in human
      biliary tract has been possible only via percutaneous route.

      With the novel implantation device, the BD stents (braided, self-expanding polydioxanone
      stent, 8 x 40-60mm, Ella, Czech republic) may be used endoscopically during endoscopic
      retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP).

      The hypothesis is that larger diameter and radial expansion strength provide at least similar
      treatment success as the current method of endoscopic insertion of plastic or covered
      self-expanding metal stents in bile leak and BBS, respectively. However, later stent exchange
      or removal is not necessary with BD stents.
