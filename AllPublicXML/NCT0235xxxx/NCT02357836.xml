      The purpose of this study is to determine the pharmacodynamics effects of itraconazole in
      early-stage non-small cell lung cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 0 clinical trial. While clinical data including safety will be recorded, the
      principal outcomes are pharmacodynamic endpoints. Specifically, the investigators seek to
      identify: (1) effects of itraconazole on tumor angiogenesis, (2) effects of itraconazole on
      the Hh pathway, (3) biomarker predictors of these effects, (4) the correlation between
      itraconazole pharmacokinetics and these effects, (5) the correlation between different
      biomarkers.

      Up to 15 eligible patients with previously diagnosed or suspected NSCLC planned for resection
      will undergo a study-specific core needle biopsy, imaging (dynamic contrast enhanced [DCE]-,
      diffusion weighted imaging [DWI]-, and arterial spin labeling [ASL] magnetic resonance
      imaging [MRI]), skin punch biopsy, and collection of peripheral blood. Subjects will then
      receive itraconazole 600 mg PO daily for 7-10 days, following which they will undergo repeat
      imaging, skin biopsy, and blood collection. Subsequently they will undergo surgical
      resection. Due to the safety profile of itraconazole when used as an antifungal agent , all
      histologic subtypes of NSCLC will be eligible for the trial. The itraconazole dose of 600 mg,
      higher than an anti-angiogenic dose, has been shown to inhibit the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway.

    <description>Once on study, itraconazole will be taken twice daily for a total of 10-14 days. After being on itraconazole for 7-10 days, &quot;Post-treatment&quot; assessments will include a skin biopsy, blood draw for the PK analyses and the cytokine panel, and also MRI evaluations (anticipated to last 45-50 minutes). Toxicity assessments and laboratory checks will also be conducted during that time. Following these assessments, itraconazole will be continued until the day of surgery. At the time of surgical resection, a tissue sample (with adjacent normal tissue as per standard resection technique) will be obtained to complete the analysis. Following resection, subjects will be followed per standard post-operative procedure.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically or cytologically proven NSCLC planned for surgical resection. All NSCLC
             histologic subtypes are eligible. Alternatively, patients in whom a diagnosis of NSCLC
             is highly suspected based on history and imaging studies and who are, therefore,
             scheduled for diagnostic biopsy and/or surgical resection will also be eligible for
             screening, enrollment, and study treatment if they meet all additional eligibility
             criteria. In the event that biopsies do not confirm NSCLC, such patients will be
             removed from study but monitored for any adverse events resulting from study
             participation.

          2. No prior therapy but planned for surgical resection

          3. Age ≥ 18 years.

          4. ECOG 0-2 performance status

          5. Adequate organ function as defined below:

               -  total bilirubin within normal institutional limits

               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SPGT) ≤ 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal

               -  creatinine ≤ 2 X institutional upper limit of normal

          6. Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for
             the duration of study participation, and for 90 days following completion of therapy.
             Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this
             study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

             6.1 A female of child-bearing potential is any woman (regardless of sexual
             orientation, having undergone a tubal ligation, or remaining celibate by choice) who
             meets the following criteria:

               -  Has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or

               -  Has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (i.e.,
                  has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months).

          7. Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects may not be receiving any investigational agents that would confound
             interpretation of study pharmacodynamic endpoints.

          2. History of allergic reactions attributed to itraconazole or to compounds of similar
             chemical or biologic composition to itraconazole.

          4. Active hepatitis or symptomatic liver disease.

          5. History of or current evidence of uncontrolled cardiac ventricular dysfunction
             (congestive heart failure) or NYHA Class III or IV heart failure.

          6. Current use of medications significantly affecting metabolism of itraconazole (certain
             anti-convulsants, corticosteroids). See 3.5 Drug Interactions in protocol.

          7. Current evidence of hyperthyroidism (which would increase metabolism of itraconazole).

          8. Pregnant or lactating female or any female trying to get pregnant.

          9. Claustrophobia that would interfere with MRI studies anticipated to last 45-50
             minutes.

         10. Metal implants deemed at risk for migration during MRI studies.

         11. CrCl &lt; 45 mL/min (increased risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis [NSF] from MRI
             Gadolinium contrast).

         12. Known allergy to MRI contrast.
