      The proposed study is a retrospective, observational study. A group of 5 subjects with the
      AttuneTM cruciate retaining (CR) fixed bearing total knee arthroplasty (TKA) are analysed
      during level walking, a deep knee bend, sitting down onto a chair, standing up from a chair
      and stair descent at least 12 months post-operatively, in terms of 3D fluoroscopic assessed
      tibio-femoral TKA motion as well as simultaneous skin marker assessed whole leg motion and
      ground reaction forces. The obtained information helps the manufacturer (DePuy) to evaluate,
      bring to market and advance the implant. Furthermore the information will be integrated in a
      model, which will be developed at the Center for Orthopaedic Engineering, University of
      Denver. By means of this model, different conditions such as the use of an advanced
      prosthesis design can be simulated and tested.

      The objective of this study is in a first step to demonstrate the capability of data
      collection and analysis of level gait, deep knee bend, sitting down onto a chair, standing up
      from a chair and stair descent on a limited sample size of five subjects. Secondly to
      quantify and describe the three-dimensional kinematics for the cruciate retaining (CR), fixed
      bearing AttuneTM TKA during daily activities such as those mentioned.

        Prof. Dr. med. Carsten Perka will do the recruitment, since he is the surgeon that worked
        the most with this implant and therefore also has the biggest population of possibly
        eligible patients. Furthermore the patients already know and trust him, which could lead to
        a greater success in the recruitment as well. For these reasons the financial source DePuy
        Synthes, Johnson and Johnson, requires that the clinical collaborator Prof. Dr. med.
        Carsten Perka will do the recruitment. He works in the Charité in Berlin, Germany, where he
        does the recruitment.
