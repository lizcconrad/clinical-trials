    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine the effects of dexmedetomidine on memory and recall of
      children who are receiving dexmedetomidine sedation administered for magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) studies. Dexmedetomidine is currently the standard drug for sedation for
      diagnostic (MRI, computerized tomography (CT) and Nuclear Medicine) radiological studies at
      Boston Children's Hospital (BCH). The effect of dexmedetomidine on memory and recall in
      children has not been studied.

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>During the 10-minute bolus infusion of Dexmedetomidine, children will be presented with pictures at 5-second intervals and asked to name the picture. They will be asked to name each picture (e.g., cat, tree, pencil, etc.). A valid response is naming of the picture within 5 seconds, either correctly or incorrectly.The important response measure is whether the child is awake enough to perform the naming task.</description>

    <measure>Memory Threshold</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>At the presentation of each picture, the child will be asked whether or not he/she remembers having seen it previously. Each response will be coded as correct (true positives and true negatives) or incorrect (false positives and false negatives)</description>

    <description>Children who will undergo sedation for MRI will be given a memory encoding task during dexmedetomidine bolus induction to measure the effects of sedation. The mere task of naming a picture will encode that picture into memory. When the anesthesia has worn off (at approximately 1 hour later), children will be given a memory recognition task to measure the amnesic effects of dexmedetomidine.</description>

        Children between the ages of 4 and 14 years old either requiring sedation or attempting
        without sedation for MRI imaging will be offered inclusion in the study. Sedation will be
        administered per established and approved BCH sedation guidelines: over 10 minutes, a bolus
        of 2 mcg/kg of dexmedetomidine will be administered intravenously. The sedation process
        will not change for this study. During the bolus, pictures will be shown to the child who
        will be encouraged to name the item in the picture.
