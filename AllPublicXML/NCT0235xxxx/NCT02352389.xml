  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed study is to gather critical information that may be useful in
      designing effective prevention and treatment strategies for control of seasonal influenza and
      an influenza pandemic. In particular, the critical questions are related to the virus'
      ability to adapt to efficient replication and spread in humans.

      Influenza is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza A and B viruses. Influenza
      infections result in about 230,000 hospitalizations and 36,000 deaths annually in the United
      States. Children with cancer are more likely to have serious influenza and complications than
      those who have no underlying medical problems. They are also more likely to have prolonged
      influenza illnesses and to shed influenza viruses from their noses for long periods of time
      (sometimes for months). Recent studies suggest that influenza viruses may also be carried and
      shed from the gastrointestinal tract. New types of influenza viruses emerge frequently
      through mutations that occur when the viruses replicate. These mutations allow the virus to
      escape from killing by the immune system and are, in large part, responsible for seasonal
      epidemics of influenza that occur in the fall or winter months. It is possible that viruses
      can mutate when they are carried in the respiratory or gastrointestinal tracts for long
      periods, potentially giving rise to viruses that spread more easily to other persons, cause
      more severe disease, lead to new influenza epidemics or make the viruses resistant to drugs
      used to treat influenza.

      Researchers at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital want to learn about how influenza
      viruses mutate in immunocompromised children. They will investigate how long children with
      cancer carry influenza viruses in their nose, throat and gastrointestinal tract and the
      characteristics of any mutations that are found in these viruses.

      Participants will have nasal, oral and stool specimens obtained at the time they are
      diagnosed with influenza infections, and 7, 14, 21 and 28 days later. The genome of influenza
      viruses that are isolated from these participants will be sequenced and compared to one
      another and to standard influenza strains.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

        -  To determine the proportion of pediatric oncology patients with nasal and oropharyngeal
           shedding of influenza viruses at 7, 14, 21 and 28 days following the diagnosis of
           infection.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine the proportion of gastrointestinal shedding of human influenza viruses.

        -  To determine the frequency and pattern of mutations in influenza viruses isolated from
           pediatric oncology patients.

        -  To explore the biological consequences of mutations in influenza viruses isolated from
           pediatric oncology patients.
