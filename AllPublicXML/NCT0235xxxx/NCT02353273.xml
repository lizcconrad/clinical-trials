  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the systemic exposures of WH-1 ointment which
      includes Salvigenin and Asiaticoside A in subjects with chronic diabetic foot ulcers
      following topical application of WH-1.

      This trial is designed as an open label, non-comparative study to evaluate the
      pharmacokinetic profiles of salvigenin and asiaticoside A in subjects who received the
      treatment of WH-1 ointment for diabetic foot ulcers. A total of 12 subjects will be completed
      in study. Each subject will be applied the one dose of WH-1 ointment on Day 1 following with
      the blood sampling collection, then twice a day of WH-1 application from Day 2 to Day 13, and
      another blood sampling collection scheduled on Day 14 after one dose application.
