  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if INCB039110 in combination with erlotinib is safe
      and effective in the treatment of nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that is
      Stage IIIB/Stage IV or recurrent whose tumors have EGFR activating mutations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of an open-label, safety run-in to confirm the safety of INCB039110 in
      combination with erlotinib in subjects with nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
      that is Stage IIIB, Stage IV, or recurrent whose tumors have EGFR activating mutations.
      Subjects in the safety run-in will receive open-label INCB039110 and erlotinib.

      In the second part of the study, subjects will be enrolled and randomized to receive
      erlotinib (open-label) and either INCB039110 or placebo in a blinded manner. The dose of
      INCB039110 administered will be determined from the data produced in the safety run-in phase.

      Treatment will consist of repeating 21-day cycles. Subjects will take erlotinib tablets daily
      and INCB039110/placebo will be self-administered daily during the entire cycle.
