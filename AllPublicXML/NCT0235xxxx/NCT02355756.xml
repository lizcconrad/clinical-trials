  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single center, open-label study in healthy male subjects between 18 and 45
      years old to determine the dose response profiles of dermal blood flow in response to
      intradermal injections of maxadilan. The study will consist of 2 parts: Part I: dose and time
      finding and Part II: reproducibility over time.

          -  Subject is judged to be in good health on the basis of medical history, physical
             examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram, and routine laboratory data (including
             complete blood count, complete chemistry panel, prothrombin time and activated partial
             thromboplastin time (see Appendix C).

          -  Subjects must agree to practice a highly effective method of birth control during the
             study and for 1 week after dosing. Highly effective method of birth control includes
             sexual abstinence, vasectomy, or a condom in combination with hormonal birth control
             or intrauterine device (female partner).

          -  Subjects must agree not to donate sperm for the duration of the study.

          -  Subject understands the procedures and agrees to participate in the study by giving
             written informed consent.

          -  Subject agrees to refrain from strenuous physical activity 3 days before the screening
             visit, each study period and poststudy visit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has a history of any illness (including migraine) or has had/is expected to
             have surgery within 1 month of the start of the study which, in the investigator's
             opinion, might confound the results of the study.

          -  Subject has eczema, scleroderma, psoriasis, dermatitis, or keloids, tumors, ulcers,
             burns, flaps, or grafts on their forearm or other abnormality of the skin which may
             interfere with the study assessments.

          -  Subject has excessive hair growth on volar surface of the forearm.

          -  Subject cannot avoid excessive tanning (any exposure to sunlight or a tanning bed
             which would cause a sunburn reaction) throughout the study and cannot cover forearms
             for 24 hours prior to each treatment period.

          -  Subject has a history of significant (drug) allergies including adverse experiences of
             a serious nature related to the administration of either a marketed or investigational
             drug or allergic reactions related to insect bites

          -  Subject currently uses any prescription or nonprescription drugs on a regular basis
             which cannot be discontinued for the duration of the study; subject has used any
             prescription or nonprescription medication within 14 days of the start of the study.

             approximately 4 cups of tea, coffee, or cola drinks/day) at the time of the study.
             Subjects who have reduced their consumption to 4 cups of coffee/day at least 1 week
             prior to enrollment may participate. Subjects who cannot restrain from caffeinated
             beverages 12 hours before the study visit.

          -  Subject is unable to refrain from drinking alcohol 24 hours prior to maxadilan dosing,

             negative urinary cotinine tests at screening and predose period 1.

          -  Subject has any of the following vital sign measurements at screening: Heart Rate &lt;40
             or &gt;100 beats/min, Diastolic Blood Pressure &lt;50 or &gt;89 mmHg, Systolic Blood Pressure
             &lt;90 or &gt;139 mmHg, Temperature &lt;35 or &gt;37.4 degrees Celsius, Respiration rate &lt;7 or &gt;25
             R/min.

          -  Subject has any significant ECG abnormality.

          -  The subject has a positive prestudy human immunodeficiency virus-1/2 antibodies
             (HIV-1/2Ab), Positive Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HepBsAg) (indicative of chronic
             Hepatitis B) or detectable Hepatitis C virus Ribonucleic acid (RNA) by Polymerase
             Chain Reaction (PCR) (indicative of active Hepatitis C - screening is generally done
             by Hepatitis C Antibody (HepCAb), followed by Hepatitis C virus RNA by PCR if HepCAb
             is positive) result at screening.

          -  Subject has been involved in testing an investigational drug in another clinical study
             within the last 4 weeks.

          -  Subject is in a situation or has a condition which, in the opinion of the
