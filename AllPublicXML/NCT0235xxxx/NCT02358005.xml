  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, It is known that the efficacy of botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) with extracorporeal
      shock wave therapy (ESWT) is greater than that of BTX-A with electrical stimulation in the
      management of post-stroke spasticity of the upper limb. However, it was not determined which
      dose of ESWT is optimal as a adjuvant therapy after BTX-A injection on the upper limb in
      patients with stroke. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the optimal dose of
      ESWT after botulinum toxin type A injection for post-stroke spasticity
