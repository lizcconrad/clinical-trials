  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to evaluate whether an innovative collaborative connected health
      (CCH) model increases access to specialists and improves patient outcomes. CCH offers
      multiple modalities for patients and primary care providers (PCPs) to access dermatologists
      online directly and asynchronously to maximize effectiveness in a real-world setting. CCH
      also fosters team care and patient engagement through active sharing of management plans and
      multidirectional, informed communication among patients, PCPs, and dermatologists. The
      specific aims of the proposal are to (1) determine whether the CCH model results in
      equivalent improvements in psoriasis disease severity compared to in-person care, (2)
      determine whether the CCH model results in equivalent improvements in quality of life and
      mental health compared to in-person care, and (3) assess whether the CCH model provides
      better access to care than in-person care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to conduct a 12-month, pragmatic, randomized controlled trial to
      evaluate the impact of a collaborative connected health model for psoriasis management
      compared to inperson care. The pragmatic trial will compare psoriasis severity,
      quality-of-life, mental health, and access-to-care between the two models. We will enroll 300
      psoriasis patients from Colorado and California. In addition to recruiting patients from the
      general population, we will place a specific emphasis on recruiting psoriasis patients living
      in rural and underserved communities. We will also recruit from the full disease spectrum of
      mild, moderate, and severe psoriasis patients. We will use an intention-to-treat approach to
      analyze outcomes and perform longitudinal data analysis using repeated measures approach to
      identify potential differences in the trend over time between the two arms. To evaluate the
      utility of CCH for increasing access from patients' and clinicians' perspective, the study
      team will conduct key informant interviews and use qualitative analytical techniques with
      investigator triangulation and member checking to enhance the validity of the conclusions.

    <description>Patients will be asked to complete access-to-care questionnaires derived from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey. The access to care questionnaire will be used to determine wait time, transportation factors and difficulties associated with obtaining specialist care when compared between those participants randomized to the CCH model and those randomized to in-person care.</description>

    <description>In-person care is the control group because it is currently considered the standard of care in delivering dermatologic services. The intervention includes regular visits to a physician, and may include such treatments as ointments, steroids or ultraviolet therapy at the discretion of a physician. In-person care is the major healthcare-delivery model for managing chronic skin diseases and a realistic, primary option that patients face. The patients in the in-person arm can seek psoriasis care from primary care practitioners or dermatologists, just as they would in the real world.</description>
