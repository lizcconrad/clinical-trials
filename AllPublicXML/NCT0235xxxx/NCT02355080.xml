  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled clinical trial in which adults receiving drug abuse treatment
      will be recruited to participate in a HIV and hepatitis C (HCV) testing study. The purpose of
      this study is to test the efficacy of two HIV/HCV testing strategies on increasing receipt of
      test results: (1) on-site bundled rapid HIV/HCV testing (i.e., joint offer of HIV and HCV at
      the point of encounter), and (2) standard of care for HIV and HCV testing.

      This is a randomized controlled clinical trial in which adults receiving drug abuse treatment
      will be recruited to participate in a HIV and hepatitis C (HCV) testing study. The purpose of
      this study is to test the efficacy of two HIV/HCV testing strategies on increasing receipt of
      test results: (1) on-site bundled rapid HIV/HCV testing (i.e., joint offer of HIV and HCV at
      the point of encounter), and (2) standard of care for HIV and HCV testing. Secondary outcomes
      include linkage to care and HIV and HCV risk behaviors. Participants will complete a baseline
      assessment to report their demographics, sexual risk behaviors, drug-using risk behaviors,
      utilization of drug abuse treatment services and will be randomized to one of two groups. At
      one-month post-randomization, participants will complete a follow-up assessment to determine
      whether or not they received their HIV or HCV test results. At three months
      post-randomization, participants will complete a follow-up assessment to assess linkage to
      care and changes, if any, in their HIV and HCV sexual risk behaviors.

    <description>The primary outcome is self-reported receipt of HIV/HCV test results. This will be measured at one-month post-randomization for all participants. We acknowledge that there are several potential HIV/HCV testing behaviors that could be evaluated in this study: acceptance of testing, completion of testing, and receipt of testing results, either HIV or HCV. Acceptance of testing measures whether or not a participant would accept the offer of an HIV or HCV test. Completion of testing measures whether or not a participant completes the HIV or HCV test. Receipt of test results refers to whether or not a participant self-reports having received the results of the HIV or HCV test.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive the on-site bundled rapid HIV/HCV testing intervention. In the intervention group, all patients will receive an offer to participate in rapid HIV/HCV testing. Those who accept this offer will: receive pre-test information about testing procedures and education, be tested, receive results during the same visit as testing, and be provided post-test counseling and support services by trained test counselors. Patients with a preliminary positive (i.e., reactive) HIV and/or HCV test result(s) will be actively linked immediately to a health care provider for further evaluation and confirmatory HIV and/or HCV RNA testing.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Standard of care (SOC)</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants will receive the standard of care (SOC) at the study sites. The SOC entails venipuncture whole blood HIV testing + venipuncture whole blood HCV testing. Blood draws are sent to an external laboratory for processing, and patients must return for test results in another visit. Patients may not receive pre-test information or results and post-test counseling, especially if non-reactive or negative test result(s). Reflex testing is not standard practice, therefore some patients may require another visit and blood draw for confirmatory HIV and/or HCV RNA testing. Linkage to care in the SOC is accomplished by referral to a health care provider, either within the participating substance use disorder treatment organization or passive referral to other health facilities.</description>
