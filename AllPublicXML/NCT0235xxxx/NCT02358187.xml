  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will assess the immunogenicity, safety and preliminary clinical efficacy of the
      GAA/TT-peptide vaccine and poly-ICLC in HLA-A2+ children with unresectable low-grade gliomas
      that have received at least two chemotherapy/biologic regimens. Radiation therapy counts as
      one biologic regimen, but patients may not have received radiation to the index lesion within
      1 year of enrollment.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be treated with subcutaneous injections of GAA/TT-vaccines starting on Week 0
      and every 3 weeks thereafter for up to 8 cycles or until Off-treatment criteria are met
      (Section 4.6). I.m. poly-ICLC will be administered (30ug/kg i.m.) immediately following the
      vaccine. Poly-ICLC should be administered i.m. within 3 cm of the peptide-injection site.

      To allow for flexibility with scheduling, the peptide vaccine and Poly-ICLC dose may be given
      within one week of the date that the vaccine and poly-ICLC administration are due.

      Patients will be evaluated for any possible adverse event, regimen limiting toxicity (RLT) as
      well as clinical/radiological responses by clinical visits and MRI scanning. Follow-up MRIs
      will be performed (Weeks 6, 15 and 24).

    <description>Poly-ICLC is administered intramuscularly (i.m.) using sterile technique, as supplied from the vial, and in the amount prescribed for the participant's weight. Patients should receive a dose of acetaminophen (15 mg/kg up to a max of 1000 mg) 30-60 minutes before each poly-ICLC administration. The poly-ICLC treatments will be administered immediately following the vaccine. Patients/parents will be asked to report any temperature elevations and side effects after each treatment.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Tumor Type

          -  Unresectable low-grade gliomas that have received at least two chemotherapy/biologic
             regimens. Radiation therapy counts as a biologic regimen. Patients may not have
             received radiation therapy to the index lesion within 1 year of enrollment. Patients
             may have tumor spread within the CNS.

          -  HLA-A2 positive based on flow cytometry.

          -  Patients must be clinically stable and off or on low-dose (no more than 0.1 mg/kg/day,
             max 4 mg/day Dexamethasone) corticosteroid for at least one week prior to study
             registration.

          -  Patients must be ≥ 12 months and &lt; 22 years of age at the time of HLA-A2 screening.

          -  Patients must have a performance status of ≥ 70; (Karnofsky if &gt; 16 years and Lansky
             if ≤ 16 years of age.

          -  Documented negative serum beta-HCG for female patients who are post-menarchal. Because
             the effect of the peptide-based vaccine and poly-ICLC on the fetus has not
             sufficiently been investigated, pregnant females will not be included in the study.

          -  Patients must be free of systemic infection requiring IV antibiotics at the time of
             registration. Patients must be off IV antibiotics for at least 7 days prior to
             registration.

          -  Patients with adequate organ function as measured by: Bone marrow: ANC &gt; 1,000/µ;
             Platelets &gt; 100,000/µ (transfusion independent); absolute lymphocyte count of ≥ 500/µ;
             Hemoglobin &gt;8 g/dl (may be transfused). Hepatic: bilirubin &lt; 1.5x institutional normal
             for age; SGPT (ALT) &lt; 3x institutional normal.

          -  Renal: Serum creatinine based on age or Creatinine clearance or radioisotope GFR ≥ 70
             ml/min/ml/min/1.73 m²

          -  Patients must have recovered from the toxic effects of prior therapy to grade 1 or
             better. Patients must be at least 3 weeks from the last dose of standard cytotoxic
             chemotherapy or myelosuppressive biological therapy and at least 1 week from the last
             dose of non-myelosuppressive biologic therapy.

          -  No overt cardiac, gastrointestinal, pulmonary or psychiatric disease.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients living outside of North America are not eligible.

          -  Patients may not have received radiation to the index lesion within 1 year of
             enrollment.

          -  Concurrent treatment or medications (must be off for at least 1 week) including:

               -  Interferon (e.g. Intron-A®)

               -  Allergy desensitization injections

               -  Growth factors (e.g. Procrit®, Aranesp®, Neulasta®)

               -  Interleukins (e.g. Proleukin®)

               -  Any investigational therapeutic medication

          -  Patients must not have a history of, or currently active autoimmune disorders
             requiring cytotoxic or immunosuppressive therapy, or autoimmune disorders with
             visceral involvement.

          -  Use of immunosuppressives within four weeks prior to study entry or anticipated use of
             immunosuppressive agents. Dexamethasone, or other corticosteroid medications, if used
             in the peri-operative period must be tapered to no more than 0.1 mg/kg/day, max 4
             mg/day dexamethasone for at least one week before study registration. Topical
             corticosteroids are acceptable.

          -  Because patients with immune deficiency are not expected to respond to this therapy,
             HIV-positive patients are excluded from the study.

          -  Patients who have received prior immunotherapy.
