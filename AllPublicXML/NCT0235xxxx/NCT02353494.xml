      This is an observational safety and efficacy study on dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine in
      Timika, Indonesia with a 42 day follow up period.

    <textblock>
      Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-Pip) is part of the current national guidelines for the
      treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Indonesia. In order to guarantee safe and efficacious
      treatment for all patients diagnosed with uncomplicated malaria in the area, it is essential
      to monitor the effectiveness of the recommended treatment from a clinical perspective and
      assess whether the provided treatment is safe for recipients. This trial re-evaluates the
      local efficacy and safety of DHA-Pip for P. falciparum and P. vivax infections.

      Patients with uncomplicated malaria attending a public health care facility in Timika, Papua,
      Indonesia, who meet the study inclusion criteria will be enrolled, treated on site with
      DHA-Pip and followed up for 42 days. The follow-up will consist of a fixed schedule of
      check-up visits and corresponding clinical and laboratory examinations. On the basis of the
      results of these assessments, the patients will be classified as having therapeutic failure
      (early or late) or an adequate response. The proportion of patients experiencing therapeutic
      failure and drug related adverse events during the follow-up period will be used to estimate
      the efficacy and safety of the study drug. PCR analysis will be used to distinguish between a
      true recrudescence due to treatment failure and episodes of reinfection.

      The outcome of the proposed project will have a direct impact on the decision making process
      of the Indonesian Ministry of Health on whether there is a need to alter the existing
      antimalarial treatment guidelines.
