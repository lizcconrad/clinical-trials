    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the differences in cardiovascular parameters between women with
      severe preterm preeclampsia and those without preeclampsia using echocardiography and
      maternal blood. The investigators will also look at associations of abnormal cardiovascular
      findings and immediate complications among a high risk cohort of pregnant African American
      women.

      This will be a prospective cohort study. Exposed cases will be admitted to the inpatient
      obstetrical unit (labor &amp; delivery or antepartum unit) at the Hospital of the University of
      Pennsylvania with concern for severe preterm preeclampsia. Unexposed controls will be matched
      by gestational age and other clinical factors and will be obtained from the outpatient
      setting (Helen O Dickens clinic or Penn ObGyn Associates at 3701 Market Street). The
      investigators will compare cardiovascular risk factors between these two groups.

        This study will take place on the obstetrical unit at the Hospital of the University of
        Pennsylvania (HUP) as well as in the outpatient setting. The patient population is primary
        from the surrounding urban region. The majority receive prenatal care at our institution.
        Based on fiscal year 2010 at HUP, the mean age was 24 years old and 85% were African
        American.

        Exposed cases:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  African American women who are admitted to the obstetrical unit with a concern for
             severe preeclampsia. Patients must be preterm (23-36 6/7 weeks) with a live singleton
             gestation and at least 18 years old. Women will baseline chronic hypertension and
             women on magnesium will be included.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Non-African American women, and African women with concern for severe preeclampsia who
             are admitted 23 weeks or 37 weeks. Women in labor will be excluded. Women with
             preexisting cardiovascular disease and women who are current smokers will be excluded.

        Unexposed controls:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  African American women obtaining prenatal care in our outpatient setting who meet
             matching criteria as noted above.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Non-African American women and women who are not receiving care at our institution.

               -  All women who do not speak English and who are unable to be consented will be
