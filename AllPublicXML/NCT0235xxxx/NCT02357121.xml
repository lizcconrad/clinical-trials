  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label pilot, feasibility/exploratory study to evaluate the safety of laser
      interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) using Visualase in the focal ablation of prostate tissue
      and to gather data for the design of future studies. Intra-procedure temperature and
      concurrent rectal wall thermistor monitoring will be performed for internal validation.
      Subjects will be monitored for adverse events, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL)
      questionnaires will be obtained. Post-treatment MRI and biopsies will be obtained to evaluate
      histologic and radiologic changes. Biomarker (PSA, PCA3 and PHI) kinetics will also be
      monitored.
