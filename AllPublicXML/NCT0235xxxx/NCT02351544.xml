    <textblock>
      According to the peripheral trigger theory of migraine headaches, nociceptive inputs from
      irritated or compressed cranial nerve branches can lead to neurovascular changes in the brain
      that cause migraine headaches. Advanced treatments aimed at deactivating the peripheral
      trigger points can be administered to patients who have failed medical management of
      migraines. Those accepted advanced treatments include botulinum toxin A injection in order to
      temporarily paralyze muscles causing nerve compression, and surgery to release those
      compression points permanently. An advantage of surgery is the ability to release
      non-muscular causes of nerve compression, such as fascial bands or intersecting arteries.

      Botulinum toxin A injection into trigger sites has been shown in multiple studies to be
      effective at reducing the frequency and severity of migraine headaches, and is a very
      commonly administered treatment for refractory migraines. It is approved by the FDA for the
      treatment of chronic migraines.

      Similarly, surgical decompression of trigger sites has previously been shown to have superior
      clinical outcomes to medical management, through a randomized, blinded controlled-trial
      performed at Case Western Reserve in 2009. Patients either received actual decompression of
      the trigger sites, or sham surgery (exposure and visualization of the trigger sites, without
      decompression). At one-year follow-up, the group who underwent actual surgery demonstrated a
      statistically higher proportion with significant improvement in their migraines (83.7% vs.
      57.7%, p=0.014), and with complete elimination of their migraines (57.1% vs. 3.8%, p&lt;0.001).
      Several other reports have confirmed the good clinical outcomes of surgery demonstrated in
      this trial, and surgical decompression is now commonly performed by several surgeons around
      the United States.

      Prognostic factors predicting the success of surgical decompression in migraine headache
      treatment include older age of migraine onset, visual symptoms/aura, and 4-site
      decompression. Factors predicting failure of surgery include excessive operative blood loss,
      and surgery on only one or two trigger sites.

      One criticism of the studies on peripheral trigger decompression surgery for migraines has
      been that most of the results have originated from the same institution (Case Western
      Reserve), and from the same author (Guyuron). While several studies at other institutions
      have demonstrated positive outcomes of peripheral trigger decompression, these have only
      included a small number of patients.

      In addition, the sham surgery randomized-controlled trial has been criticized for not
      clarifying any prior treatments that patients had undergone before peripheral trigger
      deactivation, and for not showing how medication use patterns changed after surgery. Another
      criticism of that study was the fact that patients were examined by neurologists before the
      study but not after the study, and that surgery was performed on some patients with episodic
      migraines, who are known to not benefit from botulinum toxin. It is unclear what migraine
      types are most likely to benefit from surgical decompression.

      The investigators' goal is to perform a multi-center, prospective trial to demonstrate the
      effectiveness of peripheral trigger decompression in the treatment of migraine headaches,
      which would address the criticisms mentioned above. The main aim is to demonstrate that the
      positive results demonstrated by Guyuron et al are reproducible at other institutions and by
      other surgeons using similar techniques on different patient populations.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with migraines related to a trigger site at the location of a branch of a
             cranial nerve (frontal, temporal, occipital)

          -  Patients with chronic migraine (≥15 days per month) as dictated by the FDA indication
             for botulinum, and as diagnosed by a board-certified neurologist

          -  Patients with episodic migraines

               -  Those patients are included because there is no consensus whether surgical
                  decompression is effective for chronic migraines only, or for chronic and
                  episodic migraines. One of the goals of this trial is to determine this.

          -  Patients who respond to diagnostic botulinum toxin injection or to a diagnostic
             anesthetic block

          -  Patients who have failed 2 of 3 classes of preventative migraine medications

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients deemed by the authors or the neurologist to not have migraine headaches, but
             an alternative diagnosis

          -  Patients with systemic conditions that make them poor candidates for surgery (coronary
             artery disease, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, etc…)

          -  Patients with migraines related to inferior turbinate hypertrophy or septal deviation

          -  Patients with a frontal, temporal or occipital trigger point who do not respond to a
             diagnostic botulinum toxin injection or to a diagnostic anesthetic block

          -  Hypersensitivity to any botulinum toxin preparation or to any of the components in the
             formulation

          -  Infection at the proposed injection site for botulinum

          -  Patients with trigger points at minor trigger sites (lesser occipital nerve, third
             occipital nerve)
