  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate a comprehensive tailored behavioral intervention aimed to improve
      foot self-care and self-monitoring (combined with dermal thermometry) to prevent recurrent
      ulcers in Veterans at highest risk of amputation. This intervention may be a novel strategy
      for improving self-care and early detection of foot abnormalities in this at-risk population
      using psychological theories to target multiple health behaviors simultaneously. This could
      be an efficient and cost-effective approach to improve diabetes-related foot health behavior,
      and other risk factors in patients who are vulnerable to devastating consequences related to
      amputation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Veterans with diabetes who have had a previous ulcer are at highest risk for new ulcers and
      amputation, particularly if they have neuropathy or vascular disease and have poor foot
      self-care or nonadherence to diet, medication, and exercise recommendations. It is difficult
      to activate at-risk patients to improve self-care and detect foot abnormalities or
      inflammation at an early stage.

      Proposed is a randomized controlled trial testing the effectiveness of a comprehensive
      tailored intervention (TI) aimed to improve self-care and self-monitoring (including dermal
      thermometry) through behavioral counseling. The primary specific aim is to evaluate if TI
      reduces the proportion of recurrent ulcers at 18 months compared to the current practice (CP)
      group. The secondary specific aims are to evaluate the impact of TI on time to ulceration,
      quality of life (QOL), plantar pressure, physical activity and foot care skills compared to
      the CP group.

      The investigators will recruit adults with diabetes who have had a previously healed ulcer.
      The intervention will be standardized and fidelity of the intervention will be maintained.
      Using a blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT), the investigators will test the effect of
      TI in relation to CP. Key outcomes are ulceration, quality of life (QOL), plantar pressure,
      physical activity and foot care skills. Outcomes will be measured at baseline, 6, 12 and 18
      months. All analyses will be intent-to-treat.

      This study will evaluate a comprehensive tailored intervention targeting multiple behaviors
      related to self-care and amputation risk. This study applies advanced behavioral theories to
      intervene to improve care for veterans at risk for amputation combined with dermal
      thermometry. If this promising theory-driven approach can work in a clinical setting where
      improvements in foot care are urgently needed for these vulnerable Veterans with a previous
      ulcer, it will be an important scientific contribution that could lower the risk of recurrent
      ulcers and amputation in Veterans with diabetes.

    <description>High-resolution standard view digital photographs of the feet and footwear will be obtained and reviewed by the investigators blinded to group assignment, and a suspected ulcer or nonulcerative plantar lesion below the malleoli will be referred to a panel of three blinded (as to group assignment) adjudicators, all clinical experts. Lesions will be judged as absent/nonulcerative lesion/ulcer; involving/not involving the plantar surface (defined as involving the weight-bearing surface of the foot); and related to metatarsal head (MTH)/not related to MTH. Adjudicators will not confer with each other or with the study staff, and the majority opinion will be taken as the final judgment. Ulcers will be judged to be present if the integrity of both the epidermis and dermis is broken. When ulcers occur in between study visits, the adjudication committee will review the medical records and make the determination.</description>
