  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase I dose escalation study will evaluate Procaspase Activating Compound-1 (PAC-1), a
      small molecule that activates procaspase -3 to caspase-3, resulting in apoptosis of cancer
      cells, in patients with advanced malignancies. PAC-1 is taken orally on days 1-21 of a 28-day
      cycle. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of PAC-1 (5 dose levels) will be determined using a
      modified-Fibonacci dose-escalation 3+3 design. Treatment continues until disease progression,
      unacceptable toxicity, physician discretion, or patient refusal.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female ≥ 18 years of age

          2. Diagnosis of advanced solid tumor or hematologic malignancy (limited to lymphoma) that
             has failed or become intolerant to standard therapy

          3. Has measurable disease, defined as at least 1 tumor that fulfills the criteria for a
             target lesion according to RECIST 1.1, or lymphoma that fulfills the Deauville PET
             Criteria

          4. Has an ECOG PS of 0, 1, or 2

          5. Has total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dL, serum albumin &gt; 3.0 gm/dL, AST and ALT &lt; 1.5 ULN or &lt;
             3 x ULN for subjects with known hepatic metastases

          6. Has serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 × ULN

          7. Has hemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dL, ANC ≥ 1.5 × 109/L, and platelet count ≥ 100 × 109/L

          8. Must be able to take oral medication and to maintain a fast as required for 2 hours
             before and 1 hour after capsule(s) administration

             arrhythmias) or baseline prolongation of the rate-corrected QT interval (e.g.,
             repeated demonstration of QTc interval &gt; 480 milliseconds)

         15. Presence of any non-healing wound, fracture, or ulcer

         16. Has any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, might jeopardize the
