  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Famitinib is a tyrosin-inhibitor agent targeting at c-Kit, VEGFR2, PDGFR, VEGFR3, Flt1 and
      Flt3. Phase I study has shown that the toxicity is manageable.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of Famitinib in
      patients with Advanced Non-squamous and Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).
