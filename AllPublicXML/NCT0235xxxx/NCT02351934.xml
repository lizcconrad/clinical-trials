  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if giving a medicine called furosemide, which is a
      diuretic or water pill, after colon surgery will safely shorten the patient's length of
      hospital stay.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess if administration of a loop diuretic, specifically furosemide, to
      achieve euvolemia can safely reduce length of stay following colorectal surgery.

    <description>Acute kidney injury (AKI) refers to an abrupt decrease in kidney function, resulting in the retention of urea and other nitrogenous waste products and in the dysregulation of extracellular volume and electrolytes. The term AKI has largely replaced acute renal failure (ARF), reflecting the recognition that smaller decrements in kidney function that do not result in overt organ failure are of substantial clinical relevance and are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The AKI experienced by these patients was not considered an adverse event.</description>

        <description>Acute kidney injury (AKI) refers to an abrupt decrease in kidney function, resulting in the retention of urea and other nitrogenous waste products and in the dysregulation of extracellular volume and electrolytes. The term AKI has largely replaced acute renal failure (ARF), reflecting the recognition that smaller decrements in kidney function that do not result in overt organ failure are of substantial clinical relevance and are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The AKI experienced by these patients was not considered an adverse event.</description>

            <description>ERAS included administration of celecoxib and gabapentin in the pre-operative setting, single-injection intrathecal analgesic administration immediately prior to induction of general anesthesia, post-operative administration of scheduled acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or tramadol, and discontinuation of IV fluids by 0800 on postoperative day (POD) 1. Intraoperative fluid administration was dependent on the individual anesthesia provider with no unified commitment to either zero balance or goal-directed fluid therapy. Fluid status was determined based on patient weight. Patients were weighed preoperatively and daily post-operatively using either a bed scale or a unit-based scale.</description>
