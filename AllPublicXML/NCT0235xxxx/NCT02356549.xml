  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the use of tailored health messages and/or
      involving physicians are effective in increasing African American (AA) patient activation in
      a clinical trial consultation. The proposal will use a composite score for patient activation
      derived from the Street Patient Activation Coding system. This will help to determine the
      effectiveness of our intervention on patient activation and patient centered clinical trial
      decision.

      A randomized clinical trial (using a 2x2 factorial design) to inform our knowledge of the
      efficacy of a tailored health message intervention, using different depths of tailoring and
      involving physicians, on AA cancer patients' active communication in CT consultations as
      measured by the Street Patient Activation measure. In this study 357 AA cancer patients will
      be randomized into one of four experimental groups Group 1 - messages tailored on Electronic
      Medical Record (EMR) data. Group 2 - messages tailored on EMR + physician involvement. Group
      3 - messages tailored on EMR + survey. Group 4 - Messages tailored on EMR + survey +
      physician involvement. We will also measure patient: a) trust in their physician, b) trust in
      medical research, c) preferences that include information and decision involvement, d)
      communication self-efficacy, e) patient-family member communication congruence, f)
      consultation satisfaction and g) decision outcomes that include decisional conflict, decision
      satisfaction and decision regret.
