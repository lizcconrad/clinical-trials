    <textblock>
      The primary study objective is to determine the efficacy of ondansetron (0.33 mg twice daily)
      administered orally for a period of 16 weeks in reducing risky drinking among currently
      drinking subjects with alcohol use disorder who have selected genotypes at the serotonin
      transporter and receptor genes. The secondary objective is to assess the safety and
      tolerability of ondansetron in subjects with alcohol use disorder who have selected genotypes
      at the serotonin transporter and receptor genes.

    <textblock>
      Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a heterogeneous and chronic relapsing disorder that includes
      both acute (binge drinking) and chronic (frequent heavy drinking) dimensions. Perhaps because
      of this heterogeneity, the therapeutic effect size of the approved medicines for the
      treatment of AUD has been small. In an effort to overcome the heterogeneity of response to a
      particular medication, recent studies have instituted a personalized approach to therapy.
      Major breakthroughs in pharmacogenetics have made it possible to identify discrete subgroups
      of the AUD population according to genetic profiles in order to target the subjects who are
      most likely to respond to treatment with a particular agent. In addition, genetic variation
      contributing to the risk of alcohol dependence may be differentially associated with
      treatment response Thus a successful personalized medicinal approach should ensure that
      targeted subgroups achieve an optimal treatment response with high predictability. Such an
      approach holds the potential to identify not only robust responders to treatment but also
      those who might have minimal or modest adverse effects from the putative therapeutic
      medication. From a practical clinical standpoint, a personalized medicine approach starts
      with a genetic screen to identify the &quot;right&quot; subject, who can then be treated with the
      appropriate medication, with a high probability of a positive treatment outcome and,
      therefore, a substantial impact on public health.
