    <textblock>
      The objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety on the tolvaptan for increasing serum Na
      levels in patients with worsening heart failure and hyponatremia.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 4, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group
      interventional study comparing tolvaptan (15 to 60 mg) to placebo in adult patients
      hospitalized (or admission to emergency room) due to worsening of heart failure and
      dilutional hyponatremia. All patients will be on standard therapy for heart failure.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients hospitalized due to heart failure with clinically significant hyponatremia
             (except hypovolemic) (defined as serum Na &lt; 125 mEq/L or less marked hyponatremia that
             is symptomatic and has resisted correction with fluid restriction) prior to
             randomization.

          2. Male and female patients aged ≥ 20 years.

          3. New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III/Ⅳ

          4. Signs of extracellular volume expansion, defined as two or more of the following: JVD,
             peripheral edema, dyspnea or pulmonary congestion.

          5. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) ≥ 150 pg/mL or N terminal (NT)-proBNP ≥ 450 pg/mL.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Women who are pregnant, breast feeding, or of childbearing potential who are not using
             acceptable contraceptive methods

          2. Patients with hyponatremia in hypovolemic states, defined as the presence of clinical
             and historical evidence of extracellular fluid volume depletion

          3. Patients unable to sense or respond to thirst.

          4. Patients who are likely to require prolonged hospitalization for reasons other than
             chronic heart failure (CHF)

          5. Patients with recent prior treatment for hyponatremia

             hypertonic saline

          7. Patients with causes of neurological symptoms, which are attributable to psychological
             (psychoses), structural (dementia of the Alzheimer's type, post-infarct dementia) or
             other metabolic causes

          8. Patients with acute and transient hyponatremia associated with head trauma or severe

             of short-term survival.

         19. Patients whose hyponatremia is the result of any medication that cannot safely be
             withdrawn, such as anti-convulsants and anti psychotics

         20. Patients receiving desmopressin within 2 days of screening.

         21. Patients who have participated in another investigational drug trial within the past
             30 days.

         22. Any patient who, in the opinion of the investigator, would not be able to comply with
             the study drug administration or study procedures, or whose overall medical condition
             would prohibit their participation in the study.

         23. Patients treated and/or to be treated with strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A inhibitors
