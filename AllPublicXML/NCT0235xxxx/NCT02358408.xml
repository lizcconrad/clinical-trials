    <textblock>
      The study consists of 2 parts:

      The objective of part 1 of this study is the performance of a short evaluation of system
      accuracy for 25 subjects in order to familiarize the study personnel with the study BGMS to
      be used during the planned evaluation of system accuracy (see IDT-1416-BL (Part 2)), ensure
      that the Karajishi meters are fully functioning, assure and document the accuracy of the
      comparison method, evaluate and validate the processes and procedures of the study
      methodology. The objective of part 2 of this study is the evaluation of system accuracy
      following ISO 15197:2013 (E), clause 6.3 in which accuracy requirements and applicable test
      procedures for blood glucose monitoring systems intended for self-monitoring of blood glucose
      by patients are stipulated.

      This study will be performed for Karajishi Contour and Karajishi Contour TS (manufacturer:
      Bayer Healthcare Diabetes Care) with 3 reagent system lots for each BGMS.

    <description>System accuracy criteria:
Following ISO 15197:2013 (E), the BGMS shall meet both of the following criteria:
Criterion A: 95 % of the measured glucose values shall fall within either ± 15 mg/dl (0.83 mmol/l) of the average comparison measurement result at glucose concentrations &lt; 100 mg/dl (5.55 mmol/l) or within ± 15 % at glucose concentrations ≥ 100 mg/dl (5.55 mmol/l).
Each lot shall pass acceptability criterion A.
Criterion B: 99 % of individual glucose measured values shall fall within zones A and B of the Consensus Error Grid (CEG) for type 1 diabetes.
Applying ISO 15197:2003 accuracy criteria:
95 % of the measured glucose values shall fall within either ± 15 mg/dl (0.83 mmol/l) of the average comparison measurement result at glucose concentrations &lt; 75 mg/dl (4.2 mmol/l) or within ± 20 % at glucose concentrations ≥ 75 mg/dl (4.2 mmol/l).</description>
