    <textblock>
      Control of postoperative pain is a foremost goal in achieving a satisfactory postoperative
      recovery. Surgical removal of lower third molars is accompanied by postoperative pain that is
      at its peak in the first 12 hours. Our study evaluates if the use of 2% lidocaine
      hydrochloride for the surgical removal of lower third molars with a postoperative 0.5%
      bupivacaine supplementation would result in lesser postoperative pain and a decrease in
      ingestion of oral analgesics to control the pain when compared to a placebo.

      The study intends to enroll 100 patients [ASA 1] with bilateral symmetrical impacted
      mandibular third molars requiring surgical removal under local anesthesia. 2% Lidocaine
      hydrochloride with epinephrine bitartrate 1: 80000 in 3ml quantity will be utilized to
      achieve local anesthesia at the surgical site on both quadrants. Additional supplementation
      postoperative at the surgical site will be provided with either 1.5 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine
      with 1:80000 epinephrine solution or saline based on a split mouth randomized study design
      using a color and number coded envelop. All procedures will be performed by a single surgeon
      using a similar technique, under identical conditions at one month apart intervals. Pain
      scores will be assessed by the patient based on a 10cm Visual Analog Scale at intervals of 2,
      4, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96 and 120 hours. The duration of soft tissue anesthesia
      postoperatively will be recorded by the patient. The number of analgesics ingested over 120
      hours will be recorded by the patient. Results will be evaluated statistically by the
      Wilcoxon test and two tailed test to determine the ratio. Statistical significance will be
      considered at p &lt; 0.05.
