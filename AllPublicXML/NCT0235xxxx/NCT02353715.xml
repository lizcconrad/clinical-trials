      This is a pilot exercise physiology and quality of life study of subjects receiving standard
      of care therapy for their prostate cancer using FDA-approved drugs per their labeling
      (abiraterone, enzalutamide, or sipuleucel-T). Subjects with progressive, asymptomatic or
      minimally symptomatic mCRPC scheduled to be treated with either enzalutamide or abiraterone
      acetate for ≥3 months or a course of sipuleucel-T will be allocated to one of the treatments
      arms, according to the treatment chosen by the treating physician.

          3. Surgically or medically castrated

          4. Starting either enzalutamide or abiraterone for at least 12 weeks OR starting a course
             of sipuleucel-T. Subjects being treated concomitantly with abiraterone or enzalutamide
             plus sipuleucel-T are eligible and should be enrolled on Arm A or Arm B, as
             appropriate.

          5. ECOG performance status 0 or 1

          6. Able to read and understand English, in the opinion of the treating provider, well
             enough to complete the study questionnaires

          7. Able to comply with study requirements

          8. Successful completion of a CPET in the opinion on the investigator

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who have had any surgical procedure (i.e. TURP, etc.) within 4 weeks prior to
             entering the study.

          2. Subjects receiving treatment with BOTH abiraterone and enzalutamide

          3. For Arm C (sipuleucel-T) only:

               1. subjects receiving abiraterone or enzalutamide concomitantly with sipuleucel-T
                  should only be enrolled on Arm A or Arm B, as appropriate.

               2. subjects who have received prior sipuleucel-T

          4. Subjects who are receiving any other investigational agents (i.e. enzalutamide or
             abiraterone plus an investigational drug).

          5. Subjects with any of the following absolute contraindications to maximal exercise
             testing as recommended by the American Thoracic Society and the exercise testing
             guidelines for cancer subjects, in the opinion of the treating provider: (a) acute
             myocardial infarction (3-5 days), (b) unstable angina, (c) uncontrolled arrhythmias
             causing symptoms or hemodynamic compromise, (d) syncope, (e) acute endocarditis, (f)
             acute myocarditis or pericarditis, (g) uncontrolled heart failure, (h) acute pulmonary
             embolus or pulmonary infarction, (i) thrombosis of lower extremities, (j) suspected
             dissecting aneurysm, (k) uncontrolled asthma, (l) pulmonary edema, (m) room air
             desaturation at rest &lt;85%, (n) respiratory failure, (o) acute noncardiopulmonary
             disorder that may affect exercise performance or be aggravated by exercise, (p) mental
             impairment leading to inability to cooperate, and (q) extensive bone metastases.

          6. Significant cardiovascular disease, including:

               1. Symptomatic left ventricular dysfunction or known baseline left ventricular
                  ejection fraction (LVEF) by multigated acquisition scan (MUGA) or echocardiogram
                  (ECHO) of &lt; lower limit of institutional normal (LLN). &quot;Symptomatic&quot; is defined
                  as New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II or greater. Note: MUGA and ECHCO do
                  NOT need to be measured to establish eligibility for this study.

               2. Uncontrolled hypertension

               3. Myocardial infarction, severe angina, or unstable angina within 6 months prior to
                  administration of first dose of study drug

               4. History of serious ventricular arrhythmia (i.e., ventricular tachycardia or
                  ventricular fibrillation) within 12 months of first dose of study drug

               5. Uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmias

               6. Coronary or peripheral artery bypass graft within 6 months of first dose of study
                  drug

               7. History of CVA, TIA, or rest claudication within 6 months of first dose of study
                  drug

          7. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          8. Known or suspected brain metastasis or leptomeningeal disease
