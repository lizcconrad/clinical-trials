      Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) is a disorder where the functions of the ear (outer,
      middle, inner) are normal but the person has difficulty identifying or discriminating sounds
      (Dawes &amp; Bishop, 2009) and experiences listening difficulties in noise. Personal Frequency
      Modulation (FM) systems are wireless listening devices that pick up the speaker's voice and
      transmit it to a receiver in the listener's ear. In this way, the negative effects of ambient
      noise, distance from speaker and reverberation are reduced (Keith &amp; Purdy, 2014).

      The principal research question is whether FM systems improve auditory attention, listening
      in noise performance and listening in spatialised noise in children with Auditory Processing
      Disorder (APD) in relation to just auditory training alone. We hypothesize that the FM system
      will lead to improved attention scores, improved speech in noise perception (aided and
      unaided) and improved ability to listen in spatialised noise that after prolonged FM use (6
      months). Additionally, we hypothesise that these results will correlate with questionnaires
      (filled out by parents, teachers and children).

      Thirty (30) children with a diagnosis of an APD from the Great Ormond Street Hospital
      Audiology clinic will be recruited. The children need to fulfil the following criteria:

        1. Diagnosis of APD (based on routine clinical tests at GOSH):

             1. Abnormal performance on the auditory figure ground test (a speech in noise test) of
                the SCAN-C (i.e. at the 1st percentile score as per UK norms), or in the High-Cue
                or Low-Cue score of the LiSN-S test and

             2. Abnormal performance in one non-speech auditory processing test (frequency pattern,
                duration pattern, gaps in noise or random gap detection pattern tasks), and

             3. Parent reported speech in noise and other listening difficulties.

        2. No neurological disorder, pervasive or attention deficit disorder or developmental
           delay.

        3. Normal IQ.

        4. Age range 8-11 years.

      Background and justification of the study Auditory Processing Disorder Auditory Processing
      Disorder (APD) is a disorder where the functions of the ear (outer, middle, inner) are normal
      but the person has difficulty identifying or discriminating sounds (Dawes &amp; Bishop, 2009).
      For children with APD it is particularly difficult to hear when the listening conditions are
      not ideal. For example, when there is background noise it becomes really challenging to focus
      on the speaker. Two other factors that influence their hearing ability are reverberation and
      the distance from the speaker (Keith &amp; Purdy, 2014).

      Moreover, there are studies which show comorbidity of APD with language and reading disorders
      (Sharma et al., 2009) and it is supported that attention and memory might influence APD
      (Moore et al., 2013). It is also argued that APD could just as well be one dimension in a
      cluster of developmental conditions (Dawes &amp; Bishop, 2009). Nonetheless, the profile of a
      child with APD should be clearly outlined in order not to be confused with other common
      developmental disorders (Bamiou et al., 2001).

      FM systems Personal Frequency Modulation (FM) systems are wireless listening devices that
      pick up the speaker's voice and transmit it to a receiver in the listener's ear. In this way,
      the negative effects of ambient noise, distance from speaker and reverberation are reduced
      (Keith &amp; Purdy, 2014).

      Research suggests that children with APD after a prolonged use of FM systems benefit from
      improved speech perception which is possibly linked to an enhanced auditory system (Johnston
      et al., 2009). Adding to that, children with APD have shown improved speech in noise
      perception when using the FM system, hence emphasizing the advantages of an FM system in
      discriminating speech in background noise (Johnston et al., 2009).

      There are not many studies, though, that focus on the use of FM systems on children with APD.
      Attention and ability to listen in spatialised noise in children with APD after the use of an
      FM system has not been researched yet. As the central point of this study will be the use of
      the FM system by children with APD for 6 months, it is expected that the findings could add
      valuable information on the subject. In addition, possible benefits of the FM system will be
      examined in detail. More particularly, possible improvements in auditory attention, speech in
      noise performance (aided and unaided) and listening in spatialised noise will be looked into.

      Attention Higher-level brain functions (neurocognitive and behavioural) have a major
      influence on the abilities of the listener to decode and interpret the received sounds
      (Bellis, 2011). Attention, in turn, has a central role in shaping the perception of complex
      auditory tasks (Sussman &amp; Steinschneider, 2009). Attention plays an important part in
      &quot;reorganizing passive, low-level acoustic processes during normal development&quot; (Sussman &amp;
      Steinschneider, 2009: 784). Thus, for children with APD, attention deficits can have a
      negative impact on automatic sound organization (Sussman &amp; Steinschneider, 2009). In his
      review, Moore (2011) highlights that poor listening does not mean that children's hearing is
      bad. Rather, results of his studies have suggested that most listening problems are caused by
      poor attention or working memory. Thus, if no other neurological symptoms exist, then poor
      listening is most likely linked with attention and memory deficits (Moore, 2011). However,
      Sharma et al. (2009) conclude from their study that auditory attention and memory do not
      necessarily present together with APD.

      This study will use the Test of Everyday Attention for Children (TEACh) to test children's
      auditory attention. Another test will be administered to assess children's ability to listen
      is spatialised noise is the Listen in Spatialised Noise - Sentences test (LiSN-S). Besides, a
      speech in noise test will be performed in the classroom (with and without the use of the FM
      systems). Therefore, possible links between APD and auditory attention and listening in
      spatialised noise abilities will be identified. This will build on the current knowledge on
      the matter and will help us determine a possible link between FM use and attention
      performance. As stated earlier, this cognitive function has not been tested for in previous
      studies which employed FM use on APD population.

      Listening in noise As already mentioned, APD usually coincides with poor speech in noise
      perception (Keith &amp; Purdy, 2014). Interestingly enough findings from the study of Ferguson et
      al. (2011) indicate that children with APD did not have a difficulty listening in noise.
      Nevertheless, the evidence on this claim is not enough (British Society of Audiology, 2011a).
      In fact, Johnston et al.'s (2009) study indicates improvements in listening in speech noise
      performance in children with APD, following a 5-month personal FM system intervention. In our
      present study, two tests that assess speech in noise perception will be administered; the
      LiSN-S test, which assesses listening performance in spatialised speech noise and the Chear
      Auditory Perception Test (CAPT), which will be administered in the classroom (with and
      without the use of FM) (Vickers et al., 2013) Results might reveal possible links between APD
      and listening in noise performance and thus could shed more light on the issue raised by
      Ferguson et al.'s study.

      Aim and hypotheses

      Principal research questions:

      The principal research question is to examine the effects that FM systems have on auditory
      attention and listening in noise performance in children with Auditory Processing Disorder
      (APD). More specifically, we hypothesize that the prolonged use of the personal FM system
      will lead to improved auditory attention, improved ability to listen in spatialised noise and
      improved listening in noise perception (aided and unaided) and that these improvements will
      be correlated with the questionnaire responses from parents, teachers and children..

      Hypotheses:

      i. Children with APD who use the FM system will show greater improvements in auditory
      attention, listening in spatialised speech noise and listening in noise (aided and unaided)
      after 6 months of FM use in comparison to the APD control group.

      ii. Children with APD who use the FM system will show greater improvements in listening in
      spatialised speech noise after 6 months of FM use in comparison to the APD control group.

      iii. Children with APD who use the FM system will show greater improvements in listening in
      noise (aided and unaided) after 6 months of FM use in comparison to the APD control group.

      iv. All the above outcome measures (auditory attention, listening in spatialised noise,
      listening in noise) will correlate with questionnaire results from the parents (asked about
      their child's improvement), questionnaire results from teachers (reporting on the attention
      of their student) and questionnaire results from the child reporting on their listening and
      hearing aid benefit.

      Secondary research questions:

        -  Is listening in noise (aided) similar with listening in noise (unaided) after 6 months
           of FM use?

        -  What are the characteristics of children with no improvement/lower rates of improvement?

      Summary of main issues Research suggests that children with APD after a prolonged use of FM
      systems benefit from improved speech perception which is possibly linked to an enhanced
      auditory system (Johnston et al., 2009).. Adding to that, children with APD have shown
      improved speech in noise perception when using the FM system (in an uncontrolled study);
      hence emphasizing the advantages of an FM system in discriminating speech in background noise
      (Johnston et al., 2009). There are not many studies, though, that focus on the use of FM
      systems on children with APD.

      This study will assess the effects of FM listening assistive devices use on a range of
      outcome measures. As the central point of this study will be the use of the FM system by
      children with APD for 6 months, it is expected that the findings could add valuable
      information on the matter. In addition, possible benefits of the FM system will be examined
      in detail. More particularly, possible improvements in auditory attention, listening in
      spatialised noise and speech in noise discrimination (aided and unaided) will be looked into.

      Intervention ethical issues:

      We will split the children with APD into (a) children who will only receive the FM system ,
      (b) children who will not receive any intervention for the study period (this group will
      receive the FM system after we complete the study, at 6 months under these conditions: A.
      They show no improvement or decreased scores in their listening-in-noise scores, and B. The
      recommendations by the APD clinic at GOSH include FM system as management strategies. For
      instance, if a child shows decreased scores in their listening-in-noise scores, we look at
      the recommendations and if it suggested that they use FM system in classroom, then we will
      provide the FM system to the child. On the other hand, if a child shows improved scores in
      the listening-in-noise scores, then they will not require to get any form of intervention at
      the end of the study as they exhibited improvements anyway).

      Currently from an audit conducted at GOSH APD Clinic, only 1 in 3 children who are
      recommended to have an FM system obtain this by school funding (or by their parents funding
      the device) and this takes place several months after the recommendation has been made.
      Therefore, provision of this device is not standard practice. As such the FM systems are
      issued as part of this research study.

      We believe that the FM system will be of benefit to all children who will be recruited and
      will be provided to all recruited children but with a delay of 6 months for the third group
      of children due to the need for a non-intervention control group for the study period. An
      inclusion of a control, no intervention group, is essential for any Randomised Control Trial.

      Outcome measures issues:

      This study will use the following outcome measures for the intervention.

      Primary outcome measure:

        1. A validated attention test (Test of Everyday Attention for Children -TEACh) to test
           children's auditory attention.

        2. A validated test on Listening in Spatialised Noise - Sentences test (LiSN-S). This tests
           children's ability to listen through spatialised speech noise.

        3. A validated consonant perception test called Chear Auditory Perception Test (CAPT). This
           tests children's ability to discriminate words through background noise.

      Secondary outcome measures:

        1. Parental questionnaires (The Children's Communication Checklist-2 [CCC-2] and the
           Children's Auditory Performance Scale (CHAPS).

        2. Teacher questionnaire (Screening Instrument For Targeting Educational Risk [SIFTER]).

        3. Children questionnaires (Listening Inventory For Education-Revised [LIFE-R] and the
           Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit [APHAB]).

      There is still not a universal APD test battery (British Society of Audiology, 2011b). The
      comparison of the results from the four groups will help assess whether there are any changes
      in auditory attention and listening in noise performance (aided and unaided) and whether
      changes correlate with the results from the questionnaires.

      Inclusion criteria:

      As previously stated the inclusion criteria of the study are (a) APD diagnosis, (b) Age range
      8-11 years (c) Normal IQ, and (d) No neurological problems. Exclusion criteria are: (i)
      Presence of developmental delay, pervasive learning disorder such as autism or attention
      deficit hyperactivity disorder or non-verbal IQ worse than 85. (ii) Presence of neurological
      disorder such as epilepsy.

      Criterion (b) is used as this is the main age of referrals for APD testing at GOSH. Criteria
      (c), (d), (i) and (ii) are set out in order to minimize the possibility that APD is caused by
      other cognitive or neurological problems or is linked to other pervasive learning disorders
      and developmental delays.

      School and teacher involvement:

      The teachers of the children who receive the FM systems will be provided with a PIS and
      consent form and will be required to wear the FM microphone (which picks up the teacher's
      voice and transmits it wirelessly to the ear receivers in the child's ear) on their clothes
      for the duration of the class. Please note that FM systems are provided (funded by the school
      budget) to some children after clinical recommendations and this is not an unusual situation
      within the school environment.

      We will liaise with the teacher as well as the Special Educational Needs Co-ordinator (SENCO)
      of the school in order to ensure that the school will be aware that the student has been
      issued with the FM system. A general guide for FMs (see attached documents, revised) will be
      made available in addition to information conveyed by the Research Fellow (PhD student) who
      will visit the school once per term.

      In addition, there will be a visit at the beginning and the end of the study (at 0 and 6
      months), where the CAPT test will be administered. There has already been a study on this for
      children with Cochlear Implants which showed that all children in the study were able to use
      the personal handsets with no issues (Vickers et al., 2013). All children in the classroom
      will take part, thus informed consent will be sought from their parents. The purpose of
      including the other children in the classroom is to assess the performance of the APD child
      in the classroom in relation to his/ her classmates. If some parents do not wish their
      children take part then we will not include them in this test. This will not hinder our data
      collection, as our main focus is the APD child, while the number of his/ her non-APD
      classmates could vary.

      Informed consent:

      The child's parents will be given detailed written information and consent forms to sign
      about taking part in the study. They will be given up to a week to study and decide whether
      they wish for their child to participate in the study. They will only be allowed to take part
      once they have understood the purpose and procedures of the study and they have signed the
      consent forms. In addition, children will also be given information sheets adjusted to their
      age. Written assent from the children in the presence of their parents or carers will be
      sought.

      Rights to withdraw from the study:

      This will be outlined on both the information sheet and consent form, and explained verbally
      throughout. This information will state that participants will be allowed to withdraw from
      the study at any point should they wish to do so. Withdrawal from the study will not involve
      any penalty or loss of benefit to them -this information is clearly underlined at the
      information sheet and will be made clear to them verbally.

      Data protection:

      The parents of the participant and the participant will be informed that their information
      will be anonymised and kept confidential. Data will be anonymised prior to analysis by the
      use of participant codes. Storage of the data will be within a secure password protected
      database and locked filing unit within UCL, in accordance with the data protection act 1998.
      If withdrawals take place the participants' data will be deleted.

      Other issues:

      The consonant discrimination test will be performed on all APD children in the study and also
      on non-APD children. The results of the two groups will be compared. In order to facilitate
      the recruitment of the non-APD controls, it will be asked of children with APD to bring one
      of their friends on the day of that test. These children will be aged and gender matched.
      However, it is expected that being friends with the study's participants, could be a
      confounding factor. It could also be that children with APD may not want or may not have a
      friend to bring with them. In such cases it is asked of parents and children to inform the
      researchers to be prepared for a lower attendance of non-APD controls. This will also have an
      impact on the results, as it will reduce the non-APD control group. However, the rationale
      behind this test is that children with APD will also act as their own controls. The test will
      be performed once with the FM system on and once with the FM system off. Thus, the efficacy
      of the FM system can be measured through this comparison. The inclusion of non-APD controls
      is to have an additional comparison of how well children with APD performed with the FM
      system compared to age matched controls. It is this comparison that might be compromised due
      to a reduced control group.

      Research Design and Methodology Participants and Recruitment We will recruit 30 children,
      8-11 years old. All children will have been diagnosed and referred from the Auditory
      Processing Disorders Clinic at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH). The total sample size is
      decided using this power sample: 15 children per group (on a basis of estimated 1 SD effect
      size, n = 15/f2 where n = sample size per group, f=effect size, 80% power at 5%
      significance).

      The inclusion criteria are:

        1. Diagnosis of APD (based on routine clinical tests at GOSH:

           a) Abnormal performance on the auditory figure ground test (a speech in noise test) of
           the SCAN-C (i.e. at the 1st percentile score as per UK norms), and d) Abnormal
           performance in one non-speech auditory processing test (frequency pattern, duration
           pattern, gaps in noise or random gap detection pattern tasks), and e) Parent reported
           speech in noise and other listening difficulties.

        2. No neurological disorder, pervasive or attention deficit disorder or developmental
           delay.

        3. Normal IQ.

        4. Age range 8-11 years.

      Exclusion criteria are:

      A. Presence of developmental delay, pervasive learning disorder such as autism or attention
      deficit hyperactivity disorder or non-verbal IQ worse than 85.

      B. Presence of neurological disorder such as epilepsy Subjects will be semi-randomly assigned
      to each of four intervention arms. The four groups will be stratified for age and balanced
      for sex.

      A prospective case control study will be used. Children will be given an FM system to use at
      school plus auditory training (in three different intervention groups) and these groups will
      be directly compared to each other and also compared to the control (no intervention) group.
      Each child will be enrolled in the study for 6 months. All groups will be tested before the
      start of the FM intervention and at the end of the study (after 6 months of use of the
      interventions).

      Following are the assessments to be performed for both groups at UCL Ear Institute (detailed
      explanation of these tests is given later):

        -  Baseline (before recruitment, 0 months into the study):

             -  Pure Audiometry Test (PTA)

             -  Questionnaires (SIFTER, LIFE-R, APHAB)

             -  Attention test (TEACh).

      Explanation of each test:

        1. A hearing test (Pure Tone Audiometry approx. 10mins). To determine their hearing is
           normal.

        2. An attention test. The Test of Everyday Attention for Children (TEACh). To be conducted
           as play type activities by the PhD student after receiving sufficient training by the
           clinical psychologist. (approx. 45mins possibly cut down to 30mins). To assess their
           attention.

        3. Listening in spatialised noise test (LiSN-S, approx. 15mins). To be administered through
           the use of headphones by the PhD student. To determine their listening in spatialised
           speech noise abilities.

        4. Consonant perception test in noise called Chear Auditory Perception Test (CAPT, approx.
           45mins). This tests children's ability to discriminate words through background noise.
           This test will be performed on all APD children in the study and their results will be
           compared results from non-APD children.

        5. Two questionnaires to be filled by the children's parents.

             1. The Children's Communication Checklist-2 (CCC-2). A 70-item questionnaire which
                screens for communication problems (including language disorders and autism).

             2. The Children's Auditory Performance Scale (CHAPS). It assesses aspects of
                children's listening.

        6. One questionnaire to be completed by the teachers (Screening Instrument For Targeting
           Educational Risk [SIFTER]) to assess their attention, communication, class participation
           and school behaviour.

        7. Two questionnaires to be completed by the children (Listening Inventory For
           Education-Revised [LIFE-R] for assessing their listening difficulty and Abbreviated
           Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit for assessing the benefit of the FM use by the FM group).

        8. Non-verbal IQ test (Weschler test of non-verbal intelligence). To be performed by the
           PhD Student. (approx. 15mins). To assess determine whether their intelligence level is
           above normal.

      1.

      Data analysis The data analysis will be performed on all the outcome measures. i. Looking for
      differences in the scores of each of the aforementioned tests between groups (Groups A, B, C
      and D): We will use a mixed model Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with between subjects factors
      (group - comparing all 4 groups) and within subjects factors (time - pre, mid and post
      intervention).

      ii. We will assess whether behavioural outcome measures correlate with other measures of
      communication (as measured by the CHAPS and CCC2 questionnaires and from the SIFTER and
      LIFE-R and APHAB questionnaires). We will use regression analysis to measure this.

      Other issues None of these tests are invasive or unpleasant, and they are conducted in
      comfortable sound levels (slightly higher than the usual conversational level). Any
      additional information on the children that might emerge during the study will be reported
      back to the clinician at the APD clinic to inform the child's management.

      All children who participate will receive a book voucher of GBP10 at the end of each test
      session. Travel expenses will also be reimbursed (up to GBP10).
