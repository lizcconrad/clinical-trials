  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safest and most effective flushing solution for
      maintaining patency (unobstructed flow) in implanted port catheters. The complication rate in
      patients whose ports are flushed with saline only will be compared to the complication rate
      in patients whose ports are flushed with a combination of saline and heparinized saline.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the safest and most effective flushing solution for
      maintaining patency (unobstructed flow) in implanted port catheters. The complication rate in
      patients whose ports are flushed with saline only will be compared to the complication rate
      in patients whose ports are flushed with a combination of saline and heparinized saline.
      These complications include partial or complete obstruction, infection of the central line,
      and/or the onset of heparin induced thrombocytopenia.
