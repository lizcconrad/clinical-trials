      The primary objective of this study is to correlate the percentage change in apparent
      diffusion coefficient (ADC) between baseline and early therapy (at day 14) with tumor
      regression grade (TRG) measured in the surgical resection specimen.

      This is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm imaging trial. Patients with resectable liver
      metastases from colorectal cancer (CRC) will undergo Diffusion Weighted Imaging- Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging (DWI-MRI) scans at least at three separate occasions: at baseline, at 14
      days (maximum +/- 1 days deviation is acceptable) after first administration of chemotherapy
      and finally after up to 6 cycles of chemotherapy (one week prior to surgery).

      All patients registered in the study may participate to the test-retest analysis. This
      analysis required a double baseline scans (called test-retest) to be done on two separate
      occasions, separated from each other by from one hour to one week but both before start of
      therapy. The repeated scan at baseline (retest) is optional as it will be used only for the
      test-retest repeatability analysis.

      Dedicated in-house developed software will be used to quantify ADC to assess tumor
      characteristics and response to therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically proven CRC with metachronous or synchronous liver metastases considered
             to be completely upfront resectable.

          -  Patients with at least one measurable liver lesion (&gt; 2 cm), measured by contrast CT
             or MRI at baseline. At least one liver metastasis should be clearly identified and
             provide a high likelihood of successful resection in the later surgery.

          -  Patients must be 18 years old or older.

          -  A World Health Organization (WHO) performance status of 0 or 1.

          -  Previous adjuvant chemotherapy for primary CRC is allowed if completed at least 12
             months before inclusion in this study.

          -  All the following tests should be done within 6 weeks prior to registration:

          -  Hematological status: neutrophils (ANC) ≥ 1.5x109/L; platelets ≥ 100x109/L;
             haemoglobin ≥ 9g/dL.

          -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN).

             aminotransferase (ASAT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) ≤ 5x ULN.

          -  No hypercalcemia: ionized calcium ≤1.5 mmol/L.

          -  Patients with a buffer range from the normal values of +/- 5% for hematology and +/-
