      Objective To reduce subsequent falls following Multifactorial Falls Assessment Design:
      Prospective Case Control

      Population: Frail elderly Veteran outpatient population referred for falls assessment

      Methods: Prospective controlled trial of Geriatric Multifactorial Falls Assessment Clinic
      patients followed for 1 year and outcomes compared to Falls e-Consult Clinic (chart review)
      and Acute Geriatric Evaluation and Management (GEM) Inpatient Unit discharge control groups.

  <detailed_description>

      We designed a prospective controlled trial to compare the effectiveness of outpatient falls
      assessment and treatment for community-dwelling frail elderly patients with history of falls
      referred to an active management Geriatric Multifactorial Falls Assessment Clinic with
      control groups of patients discharged from an Acute Geriatric Evaluation and Management (GEM)
      Inpatient Unit during the same time period, but who were not specifically referred for falls
      assessment, and with Falls e-Consult patients (chart review only). We hypothesized that a
      population of frail elderly referred by their primary care physicians and who reported for
      evaluation to a Geriatric Multifactorial Falls Assessment Clinic would show a reduction in
      falls compared to controls, when provided a time-limited consult evaluation with active
      follow-up for 1 year.

    <description>The Geriatric Multifactorial Falls Assessment Clinic is a component of GERIACTRIC-PACT, a frail-elderly primary care patient-centered medical home with care provided by an inter-professional teamlet consisting of a geriatrician, geriatric nurse practitioner, clinical pharmacist, licensed practical nurse, nurse care manager, social worker, and dietitian. GERIATRIC-PACT operates with increased ancillary support compared to Primary Care PACT. Falls assessment patients were referred by primary care providers and were evaluated and treated by the GERIATRIC-PACT teamlet, including ordering of tests and medication adjustment, with an average of two visits and active follow-up for one year.</description>
