  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of pre-implantation genetic screening
      (PGS) for infertility patients of advanced maternal age undergoing assisted reproductive
      treatment. Half of the patients will have their embryos tested by PGS and 1 or 2
      chromosomally normal embryos with the highest morphological grading transplanted back to the
      uterus. The other half of the participants will not have their embryos tested and 1 or 2
      untested embryos with the highest morphological grading transplanted back to the uterus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PGS is an assisted reproductive technology that screens patients embryos, discriminating
      between embryos with a normal set of chromosomes (euploid) and those with an abnormal set of
      chromosomes (aneuploid). In this study, we will apply a novel validated next generation
      sequencing technology called copy number variation sequencing (CNV-Seq) to comprehensively
      screen a trophectoderm biopsy sample from patient's embryos for chromosomal abnormalities
      that commonly arise in human embryos. The hypothesis is that PGS performed using CNV-Seq on
      embryos produced by patients with a poor prognosis for pregnancy (maternal age &gt; 35),
      followed by transfer of chromosomally normal euploid embryos, will result in significantly
      higher implantation, pregnancy and live birth rates and lower miscarriage rates compared to
      patients having no PGS.
