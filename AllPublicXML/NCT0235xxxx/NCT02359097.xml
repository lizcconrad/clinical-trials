      This clinical trial studies steady state blood volume maps using ferumoxytol
      non-stoichiometric magnetite magnetic resonance (MRI) in imaging patients with glioblastoma.
      MRI is a procedure in which radio waves and a powerful magnet linked to a computer are used
      to create detailed pictures of areas inside the body. Contrast agents, such as ferumoxytol
      non-stoichiometric magnetite, may enhance these pictures and increase visibility of tumor
      cells and the blood vessels in and around the tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Testing if steady state (SS)-cerebral blood volume (CBV) maps are superior to dynamic
      susceptibility contrast-(DSC)-CBV maps in visualizing of brain tumor blood volumes.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Development of the SS-CBV mapping for quantitative CBV estimation. II. Assessment of
      therapeutic response. III. Association with survival. IV. Correlation of relative cerebral
      blood volume (rCBV) with histology. V. Assessment of late ferumoxytol (ferumoxytol
      non-stoichiometric magnetite) enhancement at various stages of disease.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive 2 doses (2nd dose optional) of gadoteridol intravenously (IV) and undergo
      MRI including DSC or dynamic contrast enhanced imaging (DCE)-CBV mapping over approximately
      45-60 minutes on day 1. Within 3 days, patients receive 3 doses of ferumoxytol
      non-stoichiometric magnetite IV and undergo MRI including DSC and SS-CBV mapping after each
      dose over approximately 90 minutes. Patients undergo MRI without contrast 24 hours after
      ferumoxytol non-stoichiometric magnetite over approximately 30 minutes. This 3 day series of
      imaging repeats at different stages of disease and may be performed up to 5 times: prior to
      surgery, prior to chemoradiation therapy, 4-6 weeks post-chemoradiation therapy, at time of
      progression on gadolinium MRI per Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria, and
      again at time of progression (if the previous time of progression showed pseudoprogression).

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 2 and 6 weeks.

    <description>For the assessment of therapeutic response and association with survival, the cerebral blood volume (CBV) values will be correlated with survival using a Cox mixed effects regression model while adjusting patient demographical and clinical characteristics and the clustering within institutions. To determine at which stage of the disease the steady state CBV will best predict survival as well as the best cut off points, separate models will be fit for different disease stages and different cutoff points including 1.75, others and the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria.</description>
