    <textblock>
      The study will determine the magnitude and duration (time to resolution i.e., returning to
      normal ranges) of elevations in the following coagulation test results after a single 1200 mg
      dose of oritavancin: Prothrombin Time/International Normalized Ratio (PT/INR), Activated
      clotting time (ACT), Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT), Chromogenic Factor Xa
      Assay, D-dimer, Silica Clot Time and Dilute Russell's Viper Venom Time (DRVVT).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oritavancin has been approved in the United States for the treatment of adult patients with
      acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSIs) caused or suspected to be caused
      by susceptible isolates of designated Gram-positive microorganisms.

      Antibiotics of this class (lipoglycopeptide and lipopeptide antibiotics) artificially prolong
      phospholipid-dependent coagulation tests such as prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial
      thromboplastin time (aPTT) by binding to and preventing the action of the phospholipid
      reagents needed to activate coagulation.

      Because precipitation of oritavancin has been shown to occur in human plasma at
      concentrations as low as 50 μg/mL in vitro, a relevant approach to further elucidate the full
      range of effects of oritavancin plasma concentrations on coagulation testing would be to
      conduct a clinical study in healthy volunteers in which coagulation tests are monitored
      following a single 3 hour infusion of 1200 mg oritavancin. The data from this study will help
      inform physicians about how to manage patients who require coagulation monitoring in the
      setting of treatment with oritavancin.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is able to provide written informed consent before initiation of any
             study-related procedures.

          2. Subject is a healthy male or female adult between 18 and 65 years of age, inclusive.

          3. Subject has a body mass index (BMI) &lt; 45 kg/m2.

          4. Subject is in good health based on medical history and physical examination findings
             and has no clinically meaningful safety laboratory abnormalities (CBC, blood
             chemistry, and urinalysis) or 12-lead ECG results, as assessed by the Principal
             Investigator (PI).

          5. Vital signs (BP, pulse and temperature) measured at screening/baseline must be within
             the following ranges: SBP ≥90 to ≤150 mm Hg, DBP ≥45 to ≤90 mm Hg; Heart Rate ≥ 45 to
             ≤90 bpm (taken after resting in a supine position for at least 5 minutes).

          6. Female subject is surgically sterile, postmenopausal, or, if of childbearing
             potential, agrees to use at least 2 acceptable methods of birth control (e.g.
             prescription oral contraceptives, contraceptive injections, contraceptive patch,
             intrauterine device, barrier methods, abstinence) or male partner sterilization alone
