    <textblock>
      Background:

      Adoptive T cell therapy with tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) has been reported to
      induce durable clinical responses in patients with metastatic melanoma. From patients own
      tumor material T cells are extracted, expanded and activated in vitro in a 4-6 weeks culture
      period. Before TIL infusion patients are preconditioned with a lymphodepleting
      chemotherapeutic regimen. After TIL infusion, patients are treated with IL-2 to support T
      cell activation and expansion in vivo.

      The BRAF inhibitor is an approved treatment of metastatic melanoma and functions by
      selectively inhibiting the BRAF mutated enzyme, consequently halting the proliferation of
      tumor cells. Furthermore, in vitro tests have shown that vemurafenib has immunomodulatory
      effects that are hypothesized to synergize with TIL therapy, which has been confirmed in
      animal studies.

      Objectives:

        -  To evaluate safety and feasibility when combining vemurafenib and ACT with TILs.

        -  To evaluate treatment related immune responses

        -  To evaluate clinical efficacy

      Design:

        -  Patients will be screened with a physical exam, medical history, blood samples and ECG.

        -  Patients will start vemurafenib 960 mg BID and will continue during TIL preparation.

        -  7 days after start of vemurafenib, patients will undergo surgery to harvest tumor
           material for TIL production.

        -  Patient stops vemurafenib and is admitted day -8 in order to undergo lymphodepleting
           chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludara starting day -7.

        -  On day 0 patients receive TIL infusion and shortly after starts IL-2 infusion
           continually following the decrescendo regimen.

        -  The patients will followed until progression or up to 5 years.
