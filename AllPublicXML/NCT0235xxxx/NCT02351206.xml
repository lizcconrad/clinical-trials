  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As low back pain (LBP) imposes a heavy socioeconomic burden, early detection of pathologic
      intervertebral disc change in young adults holds high clinical relevance as a common
      structural cause of LBP. The investigators therefore assessed the feasibility of using X-ray
      disc space height measurements as a predictive evaluation method of lumbar disc herniation
      (LDH) and degeneration in LBP patients in their early 20s.
