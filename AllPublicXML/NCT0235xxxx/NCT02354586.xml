  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, open-label, single arm study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      niraparib in ovarian cancer patients who have received three or four previous chemotherapy
      regimens. Niraparib is an orally active PARP inhibitor. Niraparib will be administered once
      daily continuously during a 28-day cycle. Health-related quality of life will be measured by
      Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG). Safety and tolerability will be
      assessed by clinical review of adverse events (AEs), physical examinations,
      electrocardiograms (ECGs), RECIST tumor assessments and safety laboratory values.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must agree to undergo tumor HRD testing and blood gBRCAmut status testing.

          -  Patients of childbearing potential must have negative pregnancy serum test within 72
             hours of being dosed

          -  Patients must have histologically diagnosed high-grade (Grade 2 or 3) serous
             epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer with recurrent
             disease and must have been previously treated with chemotherapy and experienced a
             response lasting at least 6 months to first-line platinum based therapy.

          -  Patients Must have completed 3 or 4 previous chemotherapy regimens.

          -  Patients must have completed their last chemotherapy regimen &gt; 4 weeks prior to
             treatment initiation.

          -  Patients must have measurable disease according to RECIST (v.1.1).

          -  Patients must have formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor samples available from the
             primary or recurrent cancer or agree to undergo fresh biopsy prior to study treatment
             initiation.

          -  Patients must agree to blood samples during screening and at the end of treatment for
             cytogenetic analysis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must not have any known, persistent (&gt; 4 weeks), ≥Grade 3 hematologic
             toxicity during the last cancer therapy. Patients must not have any known, persistent
             (&gt;4 weeks), ≥ Grade 3 fatigue during the last cancer therapy.

          -  Patients must not have received pelvic radiotherapy as treatment for primary or
             recurrent disease within 1 year of the first dose of study treatment.

          -  Patients must not have symptomatic uncontrolled brain or leptomeningeal metastases.

          -  Patients must not be considered a poor medical risk due to a serious, uncontrolled
             medical disorder, nonmalignant systemic disease or active, uncontrolled infection.

          -  Patients must not have received a transfusion (platelets or red blood cells) within 4
             weeks of the first dose of study treatment.
