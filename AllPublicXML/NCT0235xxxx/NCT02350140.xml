  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early accurate diagnosis is one of the first crucial steps in care for infants born to
      HIV-infected mothers. Early initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) relies upon early
      diagnosis and results in significant reductions in infant morbidity and mortality. The
      investigators recently concluded a successful randomized controlled trial in Kenya entitled,
      &quot;Improving uptake of early infant diagnosis of HIV for prevention of mother-to-child HIV
      transmission (PMTCT): a randomized trial of a text messaging intervention&quot;
      (ClinicalTrials.gov # NCT01433185). In this study, text messages developed using a behavioral
      theoretical framework significantly improved maternal attendance at post-partum clinic
      appointments and rates of testing to facilitate early infant diagnosis of HIV in a selected
      population and controlled setting. Understanding the effectiveness of this intervention (and
      its limitations) in a real-world, routine-care setting represents the next step in the
      translational pathway to public health impact. The investigators therefore now propose a
      cluster randomized, stepped wedge trial in 20 clinics operated by the Kenyan Ministry of
      Health in the Nyanza region of Kenya and use the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption,
      Implementation, and Maintenance (REAIM) framework to understand the effectiveness of the text
      messaging to improve testing (TextIT) intervention. Our specific aims are:

        1. To determine the effect of TextIT on maternal attendance at postpartum clinic visits
           during the randomized stepped-wedge rollout of the intervention.

           Hypothesis 1: A greater proportion of women at health facilities implementing TextIT
           will attend clinic within eight weeks postpartum compared to women at health facilities
           implementing standard care.

        2. To determine the effect of TextIT on virological infant HIV testing within eight weeks
           after birth during the randomized stepped-wedge rollout of the intervention.

           Hypothesis 2: Infants of women at health facilities implementing TextIT will be more
           likely to have virological HIV testing compared to infants of women at health facilities
           implementing standard care.

        3. To determine the costs and cost-effectiveness of TextIT. The investigators will estimate
           the cost per patient and per health gain achieved (disability-adjusted life year, DALY)
           comparing TextIT to current standard care.

      Hypothesis 3: The TextIT intervention will be more cost-effective than current standard care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The 2011 United Nations General Assembly Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS set a target to
      eliminate mother-to-child transmission of HIV by 2015. The continuum of care for women living
      with HIV and their babies includes retention in care and early infant diagnosis of HIV.
      Timely initiation of infant antiretroviral therapy (ART) requires HIV-positive women to be
      retained in care through the postpartum period and to bring their children for HIV testing.
      However, a high proportion of pregnant HIV-positive women in sub-Saharan Africa are lost to
      follow-up after delivery. The World Health Organization recommends infant HIV testing at six
      weeks using DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR). However, the overall proportion of children
      who undergo early infant diagnosis by PCR remains low. In Kenya, the overall proportion of
      eligible children undergoing PCR testing in 2011 was 39%.

      Low rates of infant HIV testing are an indirect indication of a large number of infants who
      may not benefit from early determination of HIV status, antiretroviral prophylaxis for
      HIV-negative breastfeeding infants, and infant feeding counseling and support. For HIV
      positive infants, failure to undergo testing is a critical barrier to receiving life-saving
      ART. There is an urgent need to investigate efficacious, cost-effective, and sustainable
      interventions to improve maternal retention in HIV care and increase the proportion of
      exposed infants tested for HIV.

      With the exponential increase in the number of mobile phones in sub-Saharan Africa, the use
      of mobile technology to support HIV programs has shown promise. The United Nations Children's
      Fund is encouraging HIV programs to take advantage of high levels of mobile phone access
      among enrolled mothers by reminding them to return for critical appointments. Active
      follow-up of pregnant HIV positive women in resource-limited settings using mobile phones is
      feasible, and may be effective in improving postnatal retention and uptake of early infant
      diagnosis across different sub-Saharan African settings.
