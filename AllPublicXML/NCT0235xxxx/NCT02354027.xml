      The purpose of the study is to investigate the potential interaction between multiple oral
      doses of SHR3824 and a single oral dose of metformin in healthy adult volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (volunteers will know the names of treatments they are assigned)
      single-center study of SHR3824 and metformin in healthy adult volunteers. SHR3824(a
      Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2 inhibitor) is currently under development to lower blood sugar
      levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and metformin is an approved
      treatment for patients with T2DM. SHR3824 will be administered orally (by mouth) as 25 mg on
      Days 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 and metformin will be administered orally as two 500mg tablets on Days
      1 and 8. Both SHR3824 and metformin tablets will be taken with 8 ounces (240 mL) of water.
