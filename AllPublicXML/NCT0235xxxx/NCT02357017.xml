    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to test the hypothesis that persistent fluid retention and high
      sympathetic output contributes to the development of refractory hypertension (HTN). The
      investigators will determine, in a cross-over assessment of high and low salt diets, if
      dietary sodium restriction reduces 24-hr ambulatory BP in patients with refractory HTN.
      Moreover, the investigators will determine if dietary sodium restriction lessens the severity
      of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in patients with refractory HTN.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We are proposing a unique phenotype of antihypertensive treatment failure that we refer to as
      refractory HTN. We have come to feel that while resistant (RHTN) represents a broad phenotype
      with multiple and overlapping etiologies of treatment resistance, there is a unique subset of
      patients who never achieve BP control in spite of maximal therapy. In a recently published
      retrospective analysis of our clinic experience, we found that patients with refractory HTN
      comprised about 10% of patients referred to us for RHTN.

      A large number of intervention studies have verified the benefit of dietary salt restriction
      to reduce BP. We made such an assessment in a prospective, randomized, cross-over comparison
      of high- and low salt diets in 12 patients with confirmed RHTN. The average reduction in BP
      going from high to the low salt diet was 23/10 mmHg in the clinic and 20/10 mmHg during 24-hr
      ambulatory BP monitoring. These dramatic results demonstrated that patients with RHTN are
      exquisitely salt-sensitive and highlight the degree of BP reduction that can be accomplished
      with meaningful salt restriction. However, we are proposing the novel hypothesis that
      refractory HTN is mechanistically unique from RHTN in that it is not secondary to
      recalcitrant fluid retention.

      Determining an association between dietary salt restriction and severity of obstructive sleep
      apnea (OSA) would potentially help us to find new therapies guided towards achieving better
      control of BP in patients with refractory HTN. We will investigate the effect of dietary salt
      intake on severity of OSA vascular function in patients with refractory HTN by doing vascular
      studies (pulse wave analysis/velocity, calculating thoracic impedance)).

    <description>The mean change in blood pressure for each group after receiving 4 weeks of either a low salt diet compared to High dietary salt intake. The low-salt meals will be formulated to provide 50 mmol of sodium per day. Two diets with different caloric amounts (2000 or 2500) will be available. High dietary salt intake, NaCl tablets (6 grams/day) will added to the subject's study diet in order to increase dietary sodium intake to &gt;250 mmol/day.</description>
