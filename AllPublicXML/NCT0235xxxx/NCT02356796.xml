      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of a multidisciplinary group based
      treatment compared to standard physiotherapy for women with chronic pelvic pain (CPP). The
      hypothesis is that multidisciplinary group based treatment is more effective than standard
      physiotherapy for women with CPP. The participants will be randomized to one of two treatment
      arms, and the treatment effect will be evaluated 12 months after start of intervention.

      Background: Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is a common source of pain and reduced quality of life
      among women throughout the world. CPP is a complex condition, and the understanding of both
      etiology and effective treatment is limited. The newest/latest clinical guidelines recommend
      a holistic and multidisciplinary treatment approach to this condition.

      In accordance with the guidelines a multidisciplinary group based treatment for women with
      CPP has been started at the University Hospital of North Norway. The treatment is offered to
      patients who are considered to benefit from conservative treatment approach.

      Method: To investigate the effect of a group based treatment compared to standard
      conservative treatment by physiotherapists in primary or secondary health care, a randomized
      controlled trial will be conducted.

      Patients who are found eligible and consent to participate in the trial, will be randomized
      to one of the two treatment options. Data will be registered at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months
      after start of treatment.

    <description>Multidisciplinary group intervention at the University Hospital of North Norway. The group intervention is led by physiotherapists, with contributions from a gynecologist, nutritionist and a peer patient. The treatment consists of active exercises and theory lessons. The focus is to enhance the participants body awareness and to recognize the integration of mental and physical processes. The aim is to create change in patterns that influence the participants health negatively.
The treatment lasts one year. The first meeting has a duration of 10 days, then follow-up after 3, 6 and 12 months.</description>
