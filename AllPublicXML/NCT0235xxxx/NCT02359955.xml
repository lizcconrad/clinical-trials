  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate masticatory efficiency of the zero-degree teeth complete denture
      in treatment of edentulous patients of severely resorbed ridge.Patients will be crossed over
      to be treated with zero-degree teeth complete denture and anatomic teeth complete denture.
      For each patient, the masticatory efficiency and electromyography with different denture will
      be recorded and analysis.

    <description>the masseters EMG are recorded after patient wears complete denture for three months,EMGs of masseters of 20 chewing strokes were recorded in term of value of amp and duration, duration here is reporteds the average value from 20 chewing strokes in units of &quot;millisecond&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Masticatory Efficiency Index</measure>
    <time_frame>three months</time_frame>
    <description>the masticatory efficiency is tested after patient wears complete denture for three months,each patient was given 4 gram dry peanuts, chewed for 20 seconds, then spat in the receptacle and rinsed mouth residue. The peanut particles were diluted to 1000 ml with distilled water, stirred for 1 minutes and standing for 2 minutes to suspension. Absorbance values(av) were measured at the wavelength of 590nm in a spectrophotometer. The higher the masticatory efficiency, the smaller the peanut particles, then the higher the av value, vice versa. Value of av was used to represent masticatory efficiency. For each patient, the test was conducted three times, and the average value of av was taken as the final result. A lower masticatory efficiency index indicates larger peanut particle size observed.</description>
