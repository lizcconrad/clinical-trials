    <textblock>
      Patients can potentially monitor disease activity of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) through
      self-assessed swollen joints (clinical synovitis)joint counts but reliability of joint
      swelling is poor. The objective is to evaluate the use of education by ultrasound feedback on
      the ability of patients to assess for clinical synovitis swollen joints in RA.

  <detailed_description>

      Design: 6-month single centre randomized controlled trial. Patients: established RA.
      Intervention: education on self-assessment of joints that included initial brief patient
      training on tender (TJC) and swollen (SJC) joint counts, followed by US feedback every 3
      months versus standard care without education. Patient and physician independently performed
      28-joint counts at each visit. Outcome variables: (Primary) Percentage of patients with good
      agreement with physician derived swollen joints (prevalence-adjusted bias adjusted kappa,
      PABAK&gt;0.6). Other variables: Agreement in SJC (Bland and Altman 95% limits of agreement),
      feasibility/patient satisfaction survey and disease activity score (DAS28) at 6 months.
