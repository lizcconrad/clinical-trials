  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Flow diverters have been approved since 2012 for the treatment of large, wide neck
      intracranial aneurysms. These devices have been associated with embolic events which cause
      blockage in a blood vessel and can result in long term complications. One possible cause of
      these events is the formation of small emboli during placement of the device.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Flow diverters have been developed to treat intracranial aneurysms. Embolisms have occurred
      in a small percentage of patients which can result in long term complications including
      stroke, hemorrhage, and even death.

      The formation of microemboli during the insertion of the device has not been evaluated.
      During insertion, there is significant disruption of blood flow and this may be a source of
      intracranial microemboli.

      This study will use transcranial doppler ultrasound (TCD) to evaluate the blood flow during
      the placement of flow diverters to try to determine why these embolic events occur.
