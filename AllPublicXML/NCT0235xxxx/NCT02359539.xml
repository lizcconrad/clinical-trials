  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of autogenous graft materials has been recorded to be a gold standard in regenerative
      therapy. This study directed toward evaluation of two autogenous regenerative materials,
      marginal periosteal pedicle graft (MPP) and platelet rich fibrin (PRF) as membrane barriers
      for treating intrabony defects. In spite of its reported significant clinical outcomes, the
      limited availability of the periosteum makes it necessary to evaluate other autogenous
      alternatives such as PRF that could offer predictable outcomes.

      Material and methods: 10 patients with sever chronic periodontitis and at least single ≥4 mm
      intrabony defect had participated in this randomized clinical study. Subjects were randomly
      divided into2 groups, Group 1(MPP) defect coverage with xenograft defect fill(10
      patients),Group 2(PRF) defect coverage with xenograft defect fill(10 patients).Clinical and
      radiographic measurements were carried out at 3,6 and 9 months postoperatively.
