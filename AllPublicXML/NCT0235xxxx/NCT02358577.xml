  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the feasibility of conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the
      efficacy of early in-bed cycling in addition to usual care physiotherapy, compared to usual
      care physiotherapy, on functional recovery in critically ill children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single centre, Pilot RCT that will evaluate in-bed cycling in addition to usual
      care physiotherapy, compared to usual care physiotherapy, on functional recovery in
      critically ill children. We will conduct a qualitative substudy to evaluate caregiver
      impressions of the intervention, and to understand barriers and facilitators to implementing
      early mobilization in critically ill children.

    <description>Feasibility is defined as the ability to screen and enrol eligible patients (75% consent rate target).Protocol adherence will be defined as the ability to apply in-bed cycling intervention within 24 hours of consent, and the ability to apply 30 minutes of in-bed cycling daily during week days.

    <description>In-bed cycling will be applied using a cycle ergometer (RT300 Supine Cycle Ergometer) for 30 minutes per day in addition to Usual Care, until the physiotherapist deems that the patient is mobilizing well, or a maximum of 7 days (whichever comes first). This cycle ergometer is specifically designed for pediatric use, and can be applied to facilitate lower or upper limb cycling. The intervention will be applied by a trained physiotherapist and/or clinician. Pre-defined Safety Criteria for interrupting or aborting the intervention will be observed. Qualitative interviews will be conducted with a health care provider, the patient where possible, and a family caregiver following the intervention period.</description>
