    <textblock>
      This is a randomized prospective clinical study that will evaluate the effects of antenatal
      corticosteroid administration (ACS) vs. placebo in singleton pregnancies who are threatening
      to deliver prematurely between 22 0/7 and 23 6/7 weeks on admission with the goal of
      improving composite neonatal mortality and morbidity.

      The purpose of this study to evaluate the effects of antenatal corticosteroid administration
      (ACS) vs. placebo in patients who are threatening to deliver prematurely with
      well-established gestational ages between 22 0/7 and 23 6/7 weeks at the time of admission.
      If the delivery can be safely delayed at least 3 hours and there is no contraindication to
      steroid administration, the patient is eligible to be randomized. Randomization will be
      blinded to the patient and the staff caring for the patient and will be stratified by
      gestational age: those at 22 0/7 to 22 6/7 weeks and those at 23 0/7 weeks to 23 6/7 weeks.
      Randomized patients will be assignment to either active drug or placebo at the doses and
      frequencies below:

        -  2 doses of Betamethasone, 12 mg intramuscularly (IM), 24 hours apart, or if as in some
           hospitals occasionally occurs and betamethasone is unavailable -

        -  4 doses of Dexamethasone IM 6 mg, 12 hours apart.

      Remainder of care will be at the discretion of the clinician.

      Randomized 22 0/7 - 22 6/7:

      For patients randomized between 22 0/7 and 22 6/7 weeks and who are undelivered &gt; 24 0/7
      weeks, the decision as to whether to administer an additional course or courses of ACS will
      also be at the discretion of the clinician.

      Randomized 23 0/7 to 23 6/7:

      For those patients randomized at 23 0/7 to 23 6/7 weeks and who remain undelivered &gt; 24 0/7
      weeks and &lt; 1 week after study medication was administered, a second blinded set of
      medications/placebos will be provided. For patients who received Betamethasone (or
      dexamethasone) placebo will be provided and for those who received placebo Betamethasone will
      be provided.(for both at the doses described in 3.4.3). In this group, at any time &gt; 24 0/7
      weeks and less than one week of the previous dose, if the clinician feels the patient is
      still at risk for delivering, this second blinded set of study drugs will be administered.
      This will allow the patient to receive at least one actual course of ACS if undelivered at
      24w0d. In this group, if the patient remains undelivered at &gt; 25 weeks, administration of an
      open label course of ACS will be at the discretion of the MD.

      Primary Outcome of this study is composite morbidity and mortality. The N on this study is 68
      (34 in each group)
