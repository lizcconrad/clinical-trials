  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During neurosurgical procedures, patients need to be placed in sitting position for surgical
      access especially in surgeries in the vertex or posterior fossa. Due gravitational effect of
      sitting position the flow in IJV may be reduced. Venous air embolism (VAE) is a common
      complication of sitting position craniotomy and carries high mortality and morbidity. Venous
      pressure decreases as the head of the patient is raised above the heart. Hence, negative
      venous pressure in the cerebral venous system promotes entrapment of air in accidental
      opening of the sinuses.

      Common methods to prevent VAE in sitting position include increasing the venous pressure by
      either jugular venous compression and/or increasing the venous pressure by adding positive
      end expiratory pressure (PEEP). Both these methods can decrease venous return and can lead to
      brain swelling.. In addition, improper neck position can cause the kinking of the IJV which
      may lead to decreased venous drainage and increased ICP. This has been shown to be the
      contributing factor for intraoperative brain swelling and postoperative neck and tongue
      swelling leading to airway obstruction. Optimal brain perfusion is best in the neutral
      position of the head, but surgery cannot always be performed with this.

      Currently, there are no studies that looked into the IJV flow in sitting position and effect
      of venous outflow obstruction on the IJV flow. Valsalva maneuver (forced inspiration with
      closed glottis) and /or compression of internal jugular veins (IJV) are the two commonly used
      physiological methods that can cause venous outflow obstruction. A custom made neck collar
      can be used for compression of internal jugular vein and previous investigations have used a
      similar device in a rat model to demonstrate the protective effects on slosh-mediated brain
      injury by increasing intracranial blood volume . While the collars have not yet been studied
      on people for their effectiveness at preventing concussions, many studies have looked at the
      effect of neck collars on both jugular compression and ICP..

      The purpose of this study is to measure the venous blood flow of healthy volunteers by the
      use of an ultrasound and Doppler velocimetry in sitting position. the investigators will
      measure the IJV flow on both sides in sitting position at rest and at two conditions of
      venous outflow obstruction- 1. Neck compression using a custom made collar and 2. During 30
      seconds Valsalva maneuver. This study will provide information on the cerebral venous
      drainage. This information will be very useful in planning and positioning of patients
      undergoing neurosurgical procedures and to prevent complications from the improper patient
      position.

    <description>All volunteers will be fully awake throughout the study and be kept comfortable. A cross will be marked where the left and right IJV cross the level of C6. This is where all the measurements will be taken in 3 different conditions. The volunteers will be scanned initially in the sitting position at rest followed by the 2 conditions mimicking venous occlusion, one with internal jugular compression using neck collar and Valsalva maneuver.. At each conditions, the left and right IJV will be scanned with an ultrasound measuring the cross sectional area and Doppler velocity of the IJV. The least amount of pressure will be used to press on the ultrasound probe and the measurements will be obtained at end inspiration. The IJV flow is then calculated.</description>
