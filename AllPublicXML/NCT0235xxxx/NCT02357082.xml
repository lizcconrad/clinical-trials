        Patients at Mayo Clinic who have a previously implanted CIED and are scheduled for a
        clinically-indicated MRI will be included in the registry.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Strong clinical indication for MRI; in the clinical setting where MRI is the
             diagnostic modality of choice for a specific disease state without acceptable
             alternative imaging technology

          -  Male or Female

          -  18 years of age or older

          -  Able to provide informed consent

          -  Presence of CIED

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of metallic objects that represent a contraindication to MR imaging,
             including: MRI-unsafe intra-orbital or intra-ocular retained metal fragments, and
             MRI-unsafe intracranial vascular clips and coils, other MRI-unsafe devices

          -  Morbid obesity (abdominal diameter greater than 60 centimeters) which results in
             contact wiht the magnet bore.

          -  Pregnant at time of scanning Pacemaker or Implanted Cardiac Device that is labeled as
             MRI-Conditional (approved by the Food and Drug Administration for exposure to MRI)

          -  Pacemaker dependent and either: 1) device implanted before 2005, or 2) advisory pulse
             generator that may lower outputs in the setting of radiofrequency currents
