      MyBehavior is a mobile application with a suggestion engine that learns a user's physical
      activity and dietary behavior, and provides finely-tuned personalized suggestions. To our
      knowledge, MyBehavior is the first smartphone app to provide personalized health suggestions
      automatically, going beyond commonly used one-size-fits-all prescriptive approaches, or
      tailored interventions from health-care professionals. MyBehavior uses an online multi-armed
      bandit model to automatically generate context-sensitive and personalized activity/food
      suggestions by learning the user's actual behavior. The app continually adapts its
      suggestions by exploiting the most frequent healthy behaviors, while sometimes exploring
      non-frequent behaviors, in order to maximize the user's chance of reaching a health goal
      (e.g. weight loss).

      A dramatic rise in self-tracking applications for smartphones has occurred recently. Rich
      user interfaces make manual logging of users' behavior easier and more pleasant; sensors make
      tracking effortless. To date, however, feedback technologies have been limited to providing
      counts or attractive visualization of tracked data. Human experts (health coaches) have
      needed to interpret the data and tailor make customized recommendations. No automated
      recommendation systems like Pandora, Netflix or personalized search for the web have been
      available to translate self-tracked data into actionable suggestions that promote healthier
      lifestyle without needing to involve a human interventionist.

      MyBehavior aims to fill this gap. It takes a deeper look into physical activity and dietary
      intake data and reveal patterns of both healthy and unhealthy behavior that could be
      leveraged for personalized feedback. Based on common patterns from a user's life, suggestions
      are created that ask users to continue, change or avoid existing behaviors to achieve certain
      fitness goals. Such an approach is different from existing literature in two important
      aspects: (1) suggestions are contextualized to a user's life and are built on existing user
      behaviors. As a result, users can act on these suggestions easily, with minimal effort and
      interruption to daily routines; (2) unique suggestions are created for each individual. This
      personalized approach differs from traditional one-size-fits-all or targeted intervention
      models where identical suggestions are applied for groups of similar people or the entire
      population.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>User intentions to follow automated suggestions and behavior change</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome is to measure efficacy of MyBehavior suggestions. Efficacy will be measured in two dimensions (1) whether users intend to follow the automated suggestions from MyBehavior (2) effectiveness of automated suggestions in actual behavior change.
User intentions towards following MyBehavior suggestions are measured using a 5 point likert scale. The investigators will ask users to rate whether they can follow the suggestions on an average day within a scale of 1-5 (1- I can't follow the suggestion, 5 - I can easily follow the suggestion).
On the other hand, behavior change is measured from food (calories in per meal consumed) and activity (walking, running or exercise durations per day etc.) log collected using their smartphone. Regarding physical activity, how much physical activity users are performing will be compared across experiment conditions. Similarly, calorie consumption change in food will be used to compare dietary behavior change.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Usability improvements of automated suggestions</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>MyBehavior is the first system to provide health suggestions for food and activity automatically. Thus there are scopes of usability improvement on how to effectively present the automatically generated information to the user. Qualitative interviews at the end of study will be conducted to gather user experience of using MyBehavior. This interviews will help to build a better and more usable version of MyBehavior for future larger scale deployments.</description>
