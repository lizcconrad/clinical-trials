      The study aims to address the following aims

        1. To provide an overview of the epidemiology of the patients who are managed in the
           Singapore General Hospital for NTM infections.

        2. To evaluate the medical care of patients in the institution with regards to the type of
           medical and/or surgical treatment received and specifically, the antibiotic regime and
           duration administered.

        3. A longitudinal follow up which will allow an assessment of our care and patient outcome
           in this population cohort

      Nontuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM) is difficult to treat and has no standardised antibiotic
      therapy. There have been increasing recognition of the need for measurements of NTM care
      around the world, as rates of NTM infections have begun to supercede Tuberculosis infections
      for the first time. As health care-associated NTM outbreaks also pose an infection control
      risk for patients undergoing surgery, this study provides a platform for further greater
      uniformity and opportunities for improvement in care. (1,2)

      Singapore General Hospital (SGH) is a tertiary hospital and sees patients of various complex
      medical illnesses. Patients with Nontuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM) infections are also on
      follow up with the infectious diseases specialists SGH. The care of NTM patients can last
      many years, with patients requiring multiple admissions for reinfections/relapses and are
      often on long term suppressive therapy and follow up at the Specialist Outpatient Clinic.
      (3,4)The lack of standardised care for NTM patients, lengthy treatment time for NTM
      infections, as well as increases in macrolide-resistant NTM infections, warrants a need for
      research into the epidemiology and best practice to treat this group of patients. (5,6) We
      seek to better define the epidemiology of this group of patients and hope to objectively
      measure the effectiveness and quality of our NTM care delivery in SGH.

      Currently there is a lack of a systematic database to track our quality of care and support
      services. As there are many Infectious Diseases Specialists in the department, each may have
      slight variation in clinical practice and preference in the face of a lack of proper
      treatment guideline. We believe NTM management can be improved with a consistent care
      delivery pathway and more standardization of therapy and follow up plan. This will lead to
      better desired patient outcome. This prospective observational data collection will allow us
      to evaluate our current standard of care for these patients, which can lead to identification
      for areas of improvement so that we can refine our strategies and implement more effective
      and standardized guidelines in the future.
