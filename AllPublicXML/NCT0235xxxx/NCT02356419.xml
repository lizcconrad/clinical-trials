    <textblock>
      The study is a single center and open test, and the dose of successive incremental method was
      taken. In order to determine the tolerance and safety after a single intravenous injection of
      different doses of rESP in healthy subjects, the investigators had this trial. On the other
      hand, this study is to preliminarily explore the pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects.

      The study is a single center and open test, and the dose of successive incremental method was
      taken. The study included 4 groups that is 0.5 ug/kg, 1.0ug/kg, 2.0ug/kg and 3.0ug/kg,the
      pharmacokinetic data (the screening period, before administration, after administration of
      15, 30, 60 minutes, fourth, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72 hours, seventh, 10, 14, 21, 28 days, 10
      cases in each group) were collected. In order to determine the tolerance and safety after a
      single intravenous injection of different doses of rESP in healthy subjects, the
      investigators had this trial. On the other hand, this study is to preliminarily explore the
      pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects.
