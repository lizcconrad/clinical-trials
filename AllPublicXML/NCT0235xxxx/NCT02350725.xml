    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to investigate the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic

    <description>Statistical summaries with a graphical presentation will show mean and individual diuresis and natriuresis time profiles such as time to first void, volume of first void, diuresis and natriuresis measured at 60 minute intervals up to 480 minutes following furosemide injection solution for subcutaneous administration or oral tablets. The diuretic response will be compared between therapies using t-tests or Wilcoxon test.</description>

    <time_frame>8 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The correlation (Pearson coefficient) between bioimpedance (body water content) and diuresis will be investigated including bioimpedance measurement of fluid overload as a predictor diuretic response.</description>

    <measure>Pharmacokinetic profiles</measure>
    <time_frame>8 hours</time_frame>
    <description>A graphical presentation showing mean and individual plasma furosemide concentration-time profiles for comparison between subcutaneous or oral administration. Plasma furosemide concentration-time data will be analyzed using a non-compartmental method and population PK approach (non-linear mixed-effect model). Furosemide concentrations will be summarized using descriptive statistics (including N, mean, standard deviation (SD), coefficient of variation (CV%), median, minimum and maximum) for each treatment.</description>
