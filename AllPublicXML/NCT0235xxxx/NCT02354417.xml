  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, safety study of a single ProHema-CB product administered following
      myeloablative conditioning regimen in pediatric subjects with hematologic malignancies.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A maximum of 18 eligible male and female subjects (1 to 18 years old, inclusive) will be
      enrolled and treated in the trial at approximately 3 to 5 centers within the U.S. These 18
      subjects will consist of 3 cohorts of 6 subjects each. The cohorts will be defined by age: 1
      to 4 years; &gt; 4 to 12 years; and &gt; 12 to 18 years. These cohorts will be enrolled
      simultaneously.

      All subjects will be admitted to the hospital, per institutional practice, and will receive a
      myeloablative conditioning regimen, after which they will receive an HLA-matched or partially
      matched ProHema-CB unit on study Day 0.

    <description>All subjects will receive treatment with ProHema-CB (ex-vivo modulated human cord blood cells) transplant.
ProHema-CB (the prostaglandin derivative, 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 also referred to as FT1050) will be prepared and administered in one of two formulations, based upon subject weight:
For subjects &gt; 35 kg, ProHema-CB will be administered as 150 mL product in a blood bag via gravity infusion. It will be infused at 10 mL to 15 mL per minute, for a total infusion time of 10 to 15 min.
For subject's ≤ 35 kg, ProHema-CB will be administered as a 50 mL product in a syringe via syringe pump.o It will be infused at 5 mL/kg per hour for a total infusion time of up to ~1 hour.</description>
