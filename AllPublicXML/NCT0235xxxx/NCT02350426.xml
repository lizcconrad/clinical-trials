    <textblock>
      This is an adaptive Positron Emission Tomography/ Computed Tomography (PET/CT) and Dynamic
      Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI) open-label study design for the
      investigation of inflammation in adult rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, not involving
      therapeutic intervention. Each study participant will undergo two half body PET/CT scans from
      the pelvis to the bottom of the feet (including hands and wrists) with an additional bed
      position centred on the shoulders. One scan will be conducted with 18F-FDG and the other with
      18F-GE-180. The first PET/CT scan (PET1) will be performed 4 weeks (28 +/- 2 days) after the
      first screening visit, whereas the second PET/CT scan (PET2) will be carried out within 2
      weeks (7 +/- 7 days) after PET1. The order of PET/CT scans for each subject will be based on
      a computer generated randomisation schedule after the screening visit. A sub-group of study
      participants will be invited to undergo an additional dynamic 18F-GE-180 PET scan of a
      selected joint (knee or wrist) prior to their 18F-GE-180 PET/CT half body scan. The primary
      objective of the study is to quantify inflammation in joints of RA patients by determining
      18F-FDG and 18F-GE-180 uptake using PET, and DCE-MRI parameters.

    <measure>Evaluator's assessment of image quality and potential to define abnormality</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Half body and shoulder images from 18F-FDG and 18F-GE-180 will be visually inspected by two nuclear medicine physicians with respect to the clarity and ease of identifying abnormal high uptake in joints suspected to have inflammation. A subjective scale of abnormality will be applied to each image as follows: 3 = excellent quality; 2 = intermediate quality; 1 = poor quality but still interpretable; 0 = poor quality, not interpretable.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must be aged between 30 and 85 years inclusive at the time of signing the
             consent form.

          -  Stable, moderate to severe RA, based on either the 1987 American College of
             Rheumatology definition or the 2010 American College of Rheumatology/ European league
             Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) classification criteria for RA (functional classes II
             and II).

          -  Disease activity score (DAS)28-erythrocyte sedimentation rate &gt;3.2 at screening.

          -  Patients with at least one painful and swollen wrist or knee joint as assessed by a
             rheumatologist.

          -  Male subjects are eligible for enrolment in the study OR female subjects of
             non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal
             ligation or hysterectomy (for this definition, &quot;documented&quot; refers to the outcome of
             the investigator's/designee's review of the subject's medical history for study
             eligibility, as obtained via a verbal interview with the subject or from the subject's
             medical records) or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea (in
             questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)
             &gt;40 milli international unit per milliliter (MIU/mL) and estradiol &lt;40 picogram/mL
             (pg/mL) (&lt;147 picomole per liter [pmol/L]) is confirmatory). Females on hormone
             replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to
             use two of the contraception methods listed in the protocol if they wish to continue
             their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation
             of post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least
             2-4 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this
             interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their
             post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a
             contraceptive method OR female subjects of child-bearing potential with negative
             pregnancy test as determined by serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) test at
             screening and 4-7 days prior to dosing and agrees to use two different contraception
             methods listed in the protocol. Use must be established a minimum of 1 month prior to
             the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy at that point.
             Female subjects must agree to use contraception from at least one month prior to the
             first dose through to follow up. Contraception requirements do not apply to women with
             only same-sex partners, when this is their preferred and usual lifestyle or for
             subjects who are and will continue to be abstinent from penile-vaginal intercourse on
             a long term and persistent basis.

          -  Subjects must be capable of giving informed consent, which includes compliance with
             the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who meet diagnostic criteria for any other rheumatic disease (e.g., lupus
             erythematosus).

          -  Subjects with current symptoms of severe, progressive, or uncontrolled renal, hepatic,
             hematological, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, cardiac (including ischemic heart
             disease), neurological, or cerebral disease, or other medical conditions that, in the
             opinion of the investigator, might place the subject at unacceptable risk for
             participation in this study.

          -  Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities
             (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones).

          -  Mental condition rendering the patient unable to understand the nature, scope and
             possible consequences of the study and/or evidence of an uncooperative attitude.

          -  Patients not on stable medication for RA for at least 4 weeks prior to screening.

          -  Subjects receiving treatment with biologics will not be eligible for inclusion.

          -  Subjects exceeding 159 kilogram (kg) body weight.

          -  Subjects exceeding 195 centimeter (cm) in height.

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study, defined as an
             average weekly intake of &gt;21 units for males or &gt;14 units for females. One unit is

             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  Subjects with creatinine clearance levels &lt;60 milliliter per minute (mL/min).

          -  A positive pre-study alcohol screen (alcohol breath test).

             background radiation, in the previous 3 years including the dose from this study).

          -  History of, or suffers from, claustrophobia or feel that they will be unable to lie
             still in the PET or MRI scanner for a period of 1-2 hours or fit in the PET or MRI
             scanner due to body size.

          -  Contraindication to MRI scanning (as assessed by local MRI safety questionnaire) which
             includes, but is not limited to, intracranial aneurysm clips or other metallic
             objects, history of intra-orbital metal fragments that have not been removed by a
             medical doctor MD), presence of a cardiac pacemaker, non-magnetic resonance (MR)
