  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to objectively compare various training modalities currently
      available in minimally invasive and robotic surgery to determine the most effective training
      methods specific to robotic cardiac surgery. We hope to recruit medical trainees with minimal
      robotic surgery training experience, randomly assigned to one of three groups (Dry wab, da
      Vinci Simulator and Wet lab). Trainees will be evaluated at baseline for a standardized tasks
      common in robotic cardiac surgery and then divided into one of the three training modalities.
      Trainees will be given sufficient time to become proficient with a variety of predetermined
      tasks unique to each training group. The trainees will then undergo a reevaluation with the
      cardiac surgery specific tasks at the end of a standard training period. We will then be able
      to compare our three groups to show if any have benefits over the others in regards to
      improvement in technical ability, understanding of the robots functions, efficacy of
      training, speed of technical skill development, accuracy and efficiency of movement. We will
      rate each modality on their reproducibility, accuracy of representation, and ease of set up
      and perform a cost analysis for each of the training methods.

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Subjects in the dry lab group will perform exercises form the fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery (FLS) program adapted for the daVinci robot. These exercises included, camera and clutching, peg transfer and intracorporeal knot tying. Participants will repeat these tasks until time proficiency is reached based on the performance of our expert robotic surgeons.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Virtual Reality</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Subjects in the virtual reality group will perform exercises from a 9 task curriculum, on the daVinci Skills Simulator. These exercises included, camera and clutching, energy switching, peg board, energy dissection, matchboard, ringwalk, suture sponge, and vertical defect suturing. Participants will repeat these tasks all metrics are passed and an overall score is reached based on the performance of our expert robotic surgeons.</description>

    <description>The control group will receive no training after they complete the initial assessment and undergo randomization. They will be invited back after several weeks to complete the final assessment to control for any improvement in performance from the initial assessment alone and normal progression through surgical training outside of this project.</description>
