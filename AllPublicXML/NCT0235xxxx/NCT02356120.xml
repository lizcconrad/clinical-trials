      The purpose of this study will be to evaluate the measurement of tricuspid annular plane
      systolic excursion (TAPSE) by emergency physician performed echocardiogram on patients with
      suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) who are scheduled to get a computed tomography of the
      pulmonary arteries (CTPA)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective observational cohort study aimed at determining the utility and
      reproducibility of TAPSE, in patients who present to the emergency department with suspected
      pulmonary embolism (PE). The gold standard diagnostic test for PE is computed tomography of
      the pulmonary arteries (CTPA). Any patient for whom a CTPA is ordered because of suspected PE
      is eligible for study inclusion

        The subject population will consist of a convenience sample, taken when study investigators
        are available, of all those patients for whom suspicion of PE is high enough that their
        attending physician has ordered a CTPA in the ED
