  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Subacromial impingement syndrome (SIS) is a chronic and disabling disease,
      characterized by compression and mechanical abrasion of the tendons of the rotator cuff
      muscles, subacromial bursa and tendon of the long head of the biceps against the anterior
      surface of the acromion, coracoacromial ligament or the acromioclavicular joint during arm
      elevation movement. After the trauma, inflammatory processes initiate and may lead to loss of
      function when untreated. This inflammation leads the release of cytokines (IL-6, IL-10, IL-1β
      and TNF-α) whose acts as inflammatory mediators. Physical therapy works in treating SIS with
      the goal of reducing pain and inflammatory process. Cryotherapy is widely used in physical
      therapy by anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects, low cost, effectiveness and easy
      application. Objective: The aim of the study is to evaluate the effects of a cryotherapy
      protocol, applied on shoulder of subjects with SIS, on serum inflammatory mediators
      (cytokines) and local pressure pain threshold. Possible changes in function and pain will
      also be evaluated. Materials and Methods: 30 subjects will be selected and share in two
      groups, 15 healthy subjects and 15 subjects with SIS. Function assessments and quality of
      life will be held using the DASH and WORC questionnaires. Cryotherapy will be applied for 4
      consecutive days, lasting 20 minutes without interruption through ice pack over the shoulder
      of SIS carriers. For the blood samples, 20ml of blood will be collected at the first and last
      day of the intervention, and then stored at -80 ° C.

             resisted shoulder lateral rotation, pain with active shoulder elevation and pain with
             palpation of rotator cuff tendons.

        Exclusion Criteria:
