      Evaluating the efficacity of a new device phototherapy by comparing it with conventional
      phototherapy. Jaundice occurs in many newborns, and is, in most cases benign, However, owing
      to the potential neurotoxicity of unconjugated bilirubin, newborns must be monitored to
      identify those who might develop severe hyperbilirubinemia an, in rare cases, acute bilirubin
      encephalopathy or kernicterus. Treatment of jaundice in newborn relies on phototherapy,
      exposing their skin to light of a specific wavelength . Fluorescent tubes or halogen lamps
      have been used as light sources for phototherapy for many years. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs)
      are more recent sources which are power efficient, have a longer life and are portable with
      low heat production. Several technologies and devices are developed using LEDs and specially
      a compact system.

      Crigler-Najjar (CN) syndrome is a congenital inborn error of hepatic bilirubin metabolism
      caused by the deficiency of bilirubin uridinediphosphate glucuronosyltransferase activity CN
      patients are at permanent risk of life-threatening bilirubin encephalopathy (kernicterus).
      Treatment of CN disease relies on daily prolonged phototherapy (10-12 h/day). To date, liver
      transplantation is the only curative treatment available. To date, no phototherapy device
      exists for teenagers and adults. CN patients use homemade systems or add several neonatal
      systems together to reach a better efficacy.

      A new device has been designed by weaving optical fibers into a sheet connected to LEDs. This
      new technology, marketed by several manufacturers of phototherapy devices, is used in
      pediatric wards for treating jaundiced newborns. A prototype of 80× 100cm was thus developed,
      which combines numerous advantages : important surface of treatment, easy use and
      transportation, user-friendliness.

      Before going to a therapeutic trial for assessing the benefits of this new device in
      ambulatory current practice, it is essential to make sure of both its feasibility and
      efficiency on the control of bilirubinemia, under medical supervision.

      Hypothesis: the new phototherapy sheet is as effective as, and better tolerated than the
      usual devices used in CN patients.

This new sheet was designed by weaving optical fibers connected to LEDs ( &quot;BROCHIER&quot; Technology). The &quot;LIGHTEX&quot; technology ® is a principle of weaving mill of optical fibres with side lighting connected to LEDs and allowing to realize flexible or stiff bright surfaces with very weak congestions, low consumption and high life cycle. The energy illumination of this device varies between 3 and 4 mW / cm ² ( average 3,6 mW / cm ².)</description>
