  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Different neuromuscular monitors may be available in the same care structure. Two different
      monitors are available in the investigators' institution in the operative room and the
      recovery room. However, these two monitors have not been compared and may not be
      interchangeable. Starting the monitoring with one device and continuing with another device
      may be inaccurate and may lead to inadequate medical decisions. The investigators therefore
      conducted this observational study to compare the two devices available in our institution.
