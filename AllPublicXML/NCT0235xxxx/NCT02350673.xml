  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center, Phase Ib clinical study of cergutuzumab amunaleukin, in
      combination with atezolizumab, to investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and therapeutic
      activity in participants with locally advanced and/or metastatic carcinoembryonic antigen
      (CEA)-positive solid tumors, whose disease has progressed on or who are intolerant to the
      standard of care therapy. Enrolled participants who continue treatment will be treated until
      loss of clinical benefit, unacceptable toxicities, or withdrawal of consent. The study will
      include 2 parts: a dose-escalation Part I and a dose expansion Part II. The anticipated
      treatment period is 24 months for both cergutuzumab amunaleukin and atezolizumab and may be
      modified if emerging data suggest a benefit.
