  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the maximum safe dose of the true human monoclonal antibody, 514G3,
      in the treatment of patients with Staphylococcus Aureus bacteremia. Preliminary evidence of
      efficacy will be evaluated as well. Patients will receive 514G3 plus antibiotics or placebo
      plus antibiotics in approximately a 3 to 1 ratio.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. One or more blood cultures positive for staphylococcus aureus within 2 days of
             initiating treatment with 514G3.

          2. Temperature ≥ 38.0°C

          3. Age ≥18, male or female subjects.

          4. Adequate renal function, defined by serum creatinine ≤ 2 times the upper limit of
             normal (ULN).

          5. Adequate hepatic function

          6. Adequate bone marrow function

          7. For women of childbearing potential (WOCBP), a negative serum pregnancy test result at

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Polymicrobial bacteremia.

          2. Known or suspected osteomyelitis or meningitis.

          3. Patients that are being mechanically ventilated as a result of a pulmonary infection

             acceptable.

          4. Presence of any removable infection source (e.g., intravascular line, abscess, or
             prosthesis) that will not be removed or debrided within 3 days after randomization.

          5. Definite or possible left-sided endocarditis, by Modified Duke Criteria, based on
             screening echocardiogram. Subjects with suspected right-sided endocarditis are
             permitted.

          6. Need for emergent valve surgery at the time of screening, and/or the presence of
             decompensated heart failure or cardiogenic shock.

          7. Dementia or altered mental status that would prohibit the understanding or rendering
             of informed consent.

          8. Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and a CD4 count &lt;200 cells/mm3.
