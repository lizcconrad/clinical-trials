      INTRODUCTION: Dentoalveolar surgeries such as piezocision, have been developed with the aim
      to accelerate the tooth movement and therefore reduce the length of orthodontic treatment.
      Although this surgical technique seems to present several advantages, such as decreased risk
      of decalcification or orthodontic relapse, its use as a routine practice is not yet
      recommended. The main purpose of this study is to determine the duration of orthodontic
      treatment by using the piezocision. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the effect of
      this surgical technique on bone density, root resorption, osteoclast activity, inflammatory
      events and pain assessment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The investigators will conduct a
      prospective study. The experimental group will consist of 14 adults, subjects from 18 to 40
      years-old (10 women, 4 men). The control group will consist of 30 matched patients, who have
      been already treated in the orthodontic clinic of the University of Montreal. The
      reliabilities of Intra and Inter assesors will be measured for each doctor. After completion
      of the surgical guides from CBCT, the Piezocision will be performed the same day of the
      bracket indirect placement. The surgical procedure will be standardized and did it by the
      same surgeon. The appointments will be every 2 weeks for 4 months, then every month. The
      investigators will make an assessment of pain by using a numerical visual scale, during the
      first 7 days after surgery. Analysis of inflammatory markers (IL-1) and osteoclast activity
      (RANKL, OPG) will be evaluated from the gingival sulcus fluid collected at day 0, 1, 3, 5, 8,
      12, 16 and 24 weeks. At the end of the treatment, the overall quality evaluation of treatment
      using the &quot;American Board of Orthodontics' grading system&quot; would be realized by two blind
      external observers to limit bias.

      EXPECTED RESULTS Orthodontic treatment accelerated by piézocicison will be completed within
      one year and will be 50% faster than a traditional treatment. The ratio benefit / risk of
      performing the piezocision will be acceptable for the patient and the orthodontist. We expect
      the following results: low pain, and absence of dental and periodontal deleterious effect (no
      root resorption, no tooth vitality loss and no bone loss). The same cohort can be used in
      future studies to assess the long term stability of the treatment.
