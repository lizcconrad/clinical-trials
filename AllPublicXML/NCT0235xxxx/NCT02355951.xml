      Objectives:

      Primary Objective:

      To identify and preselect patients with chronic HBV mono infection, who are undetectable for
      anti-Ad5 nAb, currently being treated with nucleo(t)sides, for participation in the TG1050.02
      Phase1/1b First in Man (FIM) study.

      Secondary Objectives:

      To assess the prevalence of undetectable anti-Ad5 nAb in chronic HBV mono-infected patients.

      Methodology:

      Patients with chronic HBV mono-infection, who are currently being treated with nucleo(t)sides
      for their HBV infection, will be enrolled in this study to measure Ad5 nAb levels. A single
      peripheral blood collection (4 mL) will be obtained and Ad5 nAb titers will be measured by a
      central laboratory using a newly validated assay.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18 through 65 years of age, inclusive

          -  Patients mono-infected with HBV and currently on HBV treatment for at least 2 years
             with either the nucleos(t)ide tenofovir (TDF) or entecavir (ENT)

          -  HBV DNA &lt; lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) (eg, HBV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) &lt;
             20 IU/mL using the Roche COBAS TaqMan assay) within 6 last months

          -  Signed, written Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)-approved informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with either medical history or evidence of cirrhosis, as documented in the
             medical source, who had: a) any biopsy showing cirrhosis; or b) any transient
             elastography score of ≥ 10.5 kPa or Fibrosure® / FibroTest ® score of ≥ 0.48 with
             either test result within past 2 years.
