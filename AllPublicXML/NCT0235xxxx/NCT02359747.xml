  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      try to find genomic DNA in culture medium after the embryos develop on Day 3 and Day 5 also
      in single step culture media. using direct PCR Polymerase Chain Reaction and also WGA Whole
      Genome Amplification before PCR and sequencing of the samples to find the point mutation

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Human fertilized oocytes were individually cultured from Day 1 to Day 3, and from day 3 to
      days 5/6, in 10 ul medium. A total of 100 samples (50 spent media from Day 3 and 50 from Day
      5/6) will be use in the study.

      Double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) amplifiability will be evaluated in embryos culture media by
      quantitative PCR on a multicopy gene target (TBC1D3). Quantification will be made with a
      standard curve constructed with genomic DNA (with culture media -day 3 and day5-, to take
      into account media inhibitory effects) TSPY1 amplification will be use to assess the presence
      of Y chromosome WGA followed by PCR on a single copy gene (MTHFR gene) will be performed on a
      subset of some samples to monitor the C677T polymorphism (genotyping by sequencing) WGA
      followed by PCR on a single copy gene (MTHFR) will be also performed on blastocoele fluids
