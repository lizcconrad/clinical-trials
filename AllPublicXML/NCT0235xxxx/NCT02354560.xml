    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause for cancer related mortality in the western world
      with a lifetime risk of 6%. Etiology is complex, while genetic background significantly
      affects the risk. Around one third of all genetic disorders as well as most cases of Familial
      Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) and a large proportion of all sporadic CRC cases occur as a
      result of premature nonsense mutations (creating a stop codon) in an individual's adenomatous
      polyposis coli (APC) gene. Nonsense mutations are single-point alterations in the DNA that
      prematurely halt the protein translation process, producing a shortened, nonfunctional
      protein. In many of these cases, if the cell can be 'persuaded' to ignore the premature stop
      codon signal, the resulting protein may be able to ameliorate or stop the disease.

      Recently, members of the aminoglycoside family of antibiotics have been found to induce
      ribosomal read-through of nonsense mutations, leading to expression of a full length,
      functional protein. Investigators have recently shown that members of the aminoglycoside and
      macrolide antibiotic families can induce read-through of the nonsense mutations in the APC
      gene and lead to reduced oncogenic phenotypes in CRC cells and in different mice models.

      The aim of this project is to determine the ability of the macrolide antibiotic-erythromycin
      to induce read-through of the nonsense mutations in the APC gene and to induce expression of
      a full length, functional APC protein in patients suffering from FAP and to tests its effect
      on adenoma number and size and on desmoid tumors in these patients. The future goal is to
      maximize the effect of stop-codon suppressors on APC while minimizing side effects.

      In this study investigators will select FAP patients which carry APC nonsense mutations,
      treat them with erythromycin PO for 4-6 months and examine colonic and duodenal adenomas as
      well as abdominal desmoid tumors, that will be documented before during and after treatment.
      In parallel, investigators will test polyp, adenoma and desmoid tissue samples as well as
      blood samples from these patients for changes in expression levels of the APC protein and
      related oncogenic markers.

      Suppression of nonsense mutations within the APC gene should be of benefit for patients
      suffering from FAP, attenuated FAP or multiple adenomas and for patients with advanced or
      diffuse CRC. Furthermore, given the rapid progress being made in the identification of
      different nonsense mutations in human genes that lead to mostly un-curable disease, the
      identification of clinically approved compounds that suppress nonsense mutations and that can
      be administered long-term without significant side effects would open new venues in the
      treatment of genetic human diseases that arise from pre-mature stop codons in important
      coding sequences.

      Immediate goal: establish the ability of erythromycin to read-through APC nonsense mutation
      in FAP patients. The read-through effect of erythromycin will be clinically tested by
      counting and measuring the number and size of both colonic and duodenal adenomas before and
      over treatment and by measuring the size of known desmoid tumors. Samples of the adenomas and
      desmoid tumors will be tested by western blot, immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry
      for restoration of APC expression and changes in oncogenic markers. These experiments should
      be conducted within 6 month.

      Long term objective:

        1. Determine the lowest dose of erythromycin that can inhibit growth of colonic neoplasia
           and CRC in patients expressing a truncated APC protein due to nonsense mutations.

        2. Examine the ability of a panel of additional macrolide antibiotics to induce APC
           nonsense mutation suppression using in-vitro methods. Investigators will focus on
           macrolide antibiotics that are currently in clinical use and are administrated for long
           terms. These objectives should take around 6 month and will be conducted in parallel.
