      The goal of this study is to determine the incidence and characteristics of Emergence
      Delirium (ED) in children aged 0 - 13 undergoing general anesthesia and being taken care of
      at the paediatric PACU of the Charité Campus Virchow-Clinic. Therefore the &quot;Paediatric
      Anesthesia Emergence Delirium Scale&quot; (PAED) is used. In order to measure the patient's pain
      level, age-appropriate pain scales (CHIPPS or FPS-R) are applied. Risk factors for the
      occurrence of ED are to be determined and therapeutic approaches in case of an occurring ED
      are to be evaluated. Finally the future implementation of ED-monitoring in the PACU is to be
      prepared.

    <textblock>
      Emergence Delirium is a widely known phenomenon during the recovery phase after general
      anesthesia in children. In spite of the existence of a vast number of studies dealing with
      this topic and even after the development of a validated measurement tool for ED (PAED-Scale,
      Sikich et al. 2004), data regarding incidence, risk factors and treatment of ED vary
      considerably.

      This study seeks to determine the actual incidence and characteristics of Emergence Delirium
      (ED) in children at the paediatric PACU of the Charité Campus Virchow-Clinic. Therefore the
      PAED-Scale is applied in a large population of children aged 0 - 13 years undergoing general
      anesthesia. In addition a clinical evaluation regarding the presence of ED is conducted by
      the PACU nurses on the basis of their clinical experience.

      In order to preserve the possibility of minimizing the influence of postoperative pain, which
      has been identified as a confounding variable in the measurement of ED, an age-appropriate
      pain score is measured simultaneously with each PAED-Score. The Children's and Infants
      Postoperative Pain Scale (CHIPPS) (Büttner, 1998) is used for children aged 0 - 4 years. The
      Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R) (Hicks et al. 2001) is used for older children.

      Besides the study aims to identify possible factors that are associated with a higher
      incidence of ED. Therefore perioperative data (anesthetic and analgetic agents, duration of
      anesthesia, premedication, volume therapy etc.) is obtained.

      In case of the occurrence of ED additional data (duration of ED, treatment of ED) is
      collected.

      All data is collected by using a questionnaire that is completed by the anesthesists and the
      PACU staff.
