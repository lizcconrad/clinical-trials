  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oxidative stress has been linked to many diseases associated with aging, including coronary
      heart disease and Alzheimer's disease. Antioxidants and special proteins in the body work
      together to help prevent damage by free radicals. Some studies have indicated that as people
      age, they are less able to fight off oxidative stress and have increased levels of
      inflammation.

      Tart cherries are known to be rich in antioxidants and plant-nutrients. The product we are
      using in this study is an all-natural tart cherry juice, mixed with apple juice concentrate
      and containing no additives and no preservatives.

      We hope to learn whether antioxidant supplementation, such as tart cherry juice, can
      measurably decrease oxidative damage and inflammation associated with aging.

      Objectives

      The primary objective of this pilot study is to investigate whether tart cherry juice
      consumption can reduce oxidative stress in older adults as measured by attenuation of
      F2-isoprostane responses to a forearm ischemia-reperfusion, and a decrease in urinary
      excretion products of oxidative damage. The secondary objective is to examine whether
      age-sensitive markers of inflammation are reduced in response to the cherry juice
      consumption.
