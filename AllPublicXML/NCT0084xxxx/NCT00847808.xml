  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if patients with well-controlled heartburn symptoms
      on twice-daily proton pump inhibitor therapy remain well-controlled after stepping down to
      once-daily (QD) dexlansoprazole modified release (MR) 30 mg.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastroesophageal reflux disease is recognized as a common and persistent medical problem in
      the US adult population. Gastroesophageal reflux disease comprises a spectrum of acid-related
      disorders including symptomatic nonerosive gastroesophageal reflux disease and erosive
      esophagitis. It affects men and women in nearly equal proportions, and the severity and
      intensity of heartburn symptoms may be similar in both types of patients.

      Dexlansoprazole modified release is a dual delayed release formulation that consists of two
      types of granules contained in a single capsule. This dual delayed release formulation is
      designed to extend the duration of drug exposure and maintain pharmacologically active levels
      over a longer time period.

      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that participants with gastroesophageal reflux
      disease whose symptoms are well-controlled on twice daily proton pump inhibitors, remain
      well-controlled when switched to dexlansoprazole MR.

        <description>PAGI-QOL is a 30-item self-reported instrument assessing health-related quality of life impact of upper gastrointestinal disorders. It includes 30 items across five subscales (daily activities, clothing, diet/food habits, relationship, psychological well-being and distress), scored on a 6-point Likert scale with subscale and total score ranging from 0 (none) to 5 (all the time). For reporting purposes, the scores are reversed and higher scores reflect improved quality of life and positive changes from baseline indicate improved quality of life.</description>

        <description>PAGI-SYM is a 20-item self-reported questionnaire that measures symptom severity of upper gastrointestinal disorders across six subscales (nausea/vomiting, fullness/early satiety, bloating, upper abdominal pain, lower abdominal pain, heartburn/regurgitation) which are summarized by individual subscale scores and a total score. The items are rated on a 6-point Likert scale with subscale and total score ranging from 0 (none) to 5 (very severe). Higher scores indicate higher symptom severity and thus negative changes from baseline indicate decrease in symptom severity.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Patient Assessment of Upper Gastrointestinal Disorders - Symptom Severity Index (PAGI-SYM) - Fullness/Early Satiety Subscale in Participants Who Remain Well-controlled.</title>
        <description>PAGI-SYM is a 20-item self-reported questionnaire that measures symptom severity of upper gastrointestinal disorders across six subscales (nausea/vomiting, fullness/early satiety, bloating, upper abdominal pain, lower abdominal pain, heartburn/regurgitation) which are summarized by individual subscale scores and a total score. The items are rated on a 6-point Likert scale with subscale and total score ranging from 0 (none) to 5 (very severe). Higher scores indicate higher symptom severity and thus negative changes from baseline indicate decrease in symptom severity.</description>
