    <textblock>
      This study is conducted in Europe. The aim of this observational study is to investigate the
      incidence of serious adverse drug reactions when using NovoMix® 30 (biphasic insulin aspart
      30) or Levemir® (insulin detemir) for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus under normal
      clinical practice conditions in Macedonia.
