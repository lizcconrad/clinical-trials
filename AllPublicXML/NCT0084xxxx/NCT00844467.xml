    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish retrospectively the incidence rates of invasive
      pneumococcal disease in children aged less than 5 years. The investigators allocate the El
      Hasa region for the study because it has higher incidence of sickle cell anemia. The study
      will include data from 2003 to 2007(before introduction of the vaccine) and then for 2008 and
      2009 (after introduction of the vaccine).

      Data will be collected from patents files or records for 5 years before the introduction of
      the vaccine and for 2 years after the introduction of the vaccine. We assigned 4 doctors in
      each hospital to carry and supervise the work.
