  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the trial is to determine the effect of BI 17444Cl on the lung
      function over a 24-hour period, when it is inhaled using the Respimat inhaler in patients
      with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In the trial four treatments of each 3 weeks of
      duration are included: 2 dosages in a once daily administration and 2 dosages for
      administration twice daily.

         14. Women of childbearing potential not using two effective methods of birth control (one
             barrier, one non-barrier). Female patients will be considered to be of childbearing
             potential unless surgically sterilised by hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation, or
             post-menopausal for at least two years

         15. Patients who have previously been randomized in this study or are currently
             participating in another study
