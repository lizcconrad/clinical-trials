  <detailed_description>

      The specific aim of the study is to test the reliability of the AcuGraph in subjects with
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The hypothesis is that the AcuGraph will be a reliable method
      to identify disorders in subjects.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects will be required to answer a questionnaire evaluating for a percentage of
             digestive disorders &quot;disability&quot; based on the subject's answers. If a participant's
             answers do not qualify as a disability, they will be assigned to the asymptomatic
             group and will still be examined with an AcuGraph to provide normative data.
