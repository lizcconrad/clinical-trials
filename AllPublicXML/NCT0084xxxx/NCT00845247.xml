    <textblock>
      Introduction: Case management (CM) has been proposed as a method for optimizing the course of
      treatment for complicated cancer patients. However evidence of the effect of CM is limited
      and methodologically rigorous research is needed.

      Aim: To analyze effects of Nurse CM in complicated cancer care.

      Methods: The study is designed as a two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) including
      approximately 280 colorectal cancer patients.

      Intervention group patients will be offered usual medical treatment plus supportive
      intervention from a case manager. Control group patients will receive usual medical and
      supportive treatment.

      The intervention: Case managers are registered nurses and possess thorough knowledge of
      cancer treatment and pathways. Core intervention elements: Planned and ad hoc personal and
      telephone contacts, surveillance of care pathways, coordination and dissemination of care
      plan (including transfer of patient-specific information to other departments and general
      practice).

      Primary outcomes: Patient evaluations of care pathways and &quot;Quality of Life&quot;
      (questionnaires).

      Secondary outcomes: Use of health care services and care process measures (The National
      Health Insurance Service Registry and The National Patient Registry; and GPs' evaluations of
      continuity of care (questionnaire).

      Schedule:

        -  &quot;Case management used to optimize cancer care pathways: A systematic Review&quot; has been
           published in BMC Health Services Research.

        -  The CM manual has been written. Questionnaires are under development and pilot testing.

        -  Two case managers have been appointed 1. January 2009.

        -  After training and pilot testing of the intervention the RCT will begin in March 2009.
           Inclusion period is 12 months.
