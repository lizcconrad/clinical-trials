  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) commonly develop non-cancerous tumors called
      plexiform neurofibromas. These tumors can be defined as &quot;high-risk&quot; when they result in
      severe pain, physical disability, organ dysfunction and/or become life-threatening.
      Presently, there is no effective medical therapy to offer patients with &quot;high-risk&quot; plexiform
      neurofibromas, and surgery does not provide lasting help. This study will evaluate the
      effectiveness of two treatment combinations in patients with &quot;high-risk&quot; plexiform
      neurofibromas.

      The study's design involves treating eligible patients with a combination of celecoxib and
      pegylated interferon alpha-2b. If the patients have at least a partial response after six
      months, they may continue on the same treatment for up to two years. If the patient
      experiences less than a partial response, or has progressive disease after six months of
      therapy, then vincristine and temozolomide will be added to the celecoxib and interferon
      alpha-2b backbone. Response to treatment will be assessed after a minimum of six months,
      presuming the patient has not experienced progressive disease. Total duration of therapy on
      study is two years for any individual treatment plan.

    <description>This is a phase II single arm study with sequential treatments available by response where all participants begin therapy with a combination of celecoxib and interferon alpha-2b (CI, treatment-1). Response to CI therapy will be assessed at six months by clinical and radiographic evaluations. Those patients who have achieved a partial response (improvement in pain, improvement in functioning, or ≥50% reduction in tumor size) or complete response (resolution of pain, and normalization of functioning with a ≥ 90% reduction in tumor size) will continue with the same CI therapy for up-to two years on study.</description>
