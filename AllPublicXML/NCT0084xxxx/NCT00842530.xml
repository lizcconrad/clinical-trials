      There is currently no vaccine against dengue and no specific drug treatment against the
      disease. This study is aimed at generating information on the protective effect of the
      vaccine.

      Primary Objective To assess the efficacy of dengue vaccine after three injections in
      children.

      Secondary Objective:

      To evaluate the reactogenicity of dengue vaccine after each injection in a subgroup of
      children.
