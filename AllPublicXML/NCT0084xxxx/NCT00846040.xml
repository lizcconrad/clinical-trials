      Background:

      - Popular weight loss strategies often involve reducing an individual's consumption of
      carbohydrates or fat. However, no controlled study has been carried out to evaluate the
      effects of reducing carbohydrate versus fat consumption while keeping the other nutrients at
      standard levels to maintain an individual's weight. Researchers are interested in
      investigating how different restrictions of carbohydrates or fats affect the many processes
      involved in weight loss, including brain activity and blood and brain chemical composition.

      Objectives:

      - To determine the comparative effects of two controlled fat- or carbohydrate-restricted
      diets and an outpatient weight loss program on blood and brain chemical composition, weight
      loss (fat and lean body mass), and regional brain activity in lean and obese individuals.

      Eligibility:

      - Healthy individuals between 18 and 45 years of age who are either lean (body mass index
      between 18.5 kg/m(2) and 25 kg/m(2)) or obese (body mass index above 30.0 kg/m(2), weight
      less than 350 pounds) and are right-handed.

      Design:

        -  For obese participants, this study consists of four phases: an initial 2-day screening
           visit followed by two separate in-patient visits and one set of 12-week outpatient
           visits. For lean participants, this study consists of a scanning visit and a 2-day
           screening visit that will require an overnight stay.

        -  Lean participants

        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical examination, blood and
           urine tests, and weight maintenance observations (food diaries and physical activity
           monitors).

        -  For the scanning visit, participants will receive balanced meals from the National
           Institutes of Health to consume for 2 days before the visit. During the scanning visit,
           participants will continue to eat the weight maintenance diet, complete questionnaires,
           and have a series of imaging studies (including positron emission tomography and
           magnetic resonance imaging tests) to evaluate brain response to food and other stimuli.

        -  Obese participants

        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical examination, blood and
           urine tests, and weight maintenance observations (food diaries and physical activity
           monitors).

        -  During the first inpatient visit, obese participants will eat a weight-maintenance diet
           for 5 days to establish baseline measurements. Following the baseline diet, participants
           will then be switched to either a reduced-fat or a reduced-carbohydrate diet for the
           next 6 days. After the controlled diet, participants will have 3 days where they will be
           permitted to select food as desired from a computerized vending machine system.
           Participants will have frequent blood and other tests throughout this visit.

        -  After a 10-week washout period, participants will return for a second inpatient visit in
           which they will have the other (reduced-fat or reduced-carbohydrate) diet, with the same
           tests and procedures as before.

        -  After the second in-patient visit, participants will be assigned to a 12-week outpatient
           weight loss program with the goal of achieving at least 5% weight loss. During this
           program, participants will continue to have blood tests and imaging studies to evaluate
           the effects of weight loss on metabolism, brain reward circuitry, and regional brain
           activity.

        -  Participants who are available for long-term followup will have yearly visits for the
           next 5 years following the weight loss intervention.

      Popular weight loss strategies often prescribe a targeted reduction of dietary carbohydrate
      or fat. But surprisingly, no controlled human feeding study has ever investigated the effects
      of a selective reduction of dietary carbohydrate versus fat while keeping the other dietary
      macronutrients at their baseline weight-maintenance values. The present study was designed to
      address this knowledge gap and improve our understanding of how selective reduction of
      dietary fat versus carbohydrate may differentially impact the many feedback control processes
      that act to resist weight loss.

      After several days of eating a weight-maintenance diet, 20 obese adult volunteers (BMI above
      30 kg/m2) will be admitted to the metabolic clinical research unit (MCRU) and, after 5
      additional days of the baseline diet, their diets will be modified to result in either 85%
      reduction of the baseline dietary fat or a 60% reduction of the baseline dietary carbohydrate
      for the next 6 days. These diet modifications produce an equivalent caloric reduction. The
      primary outcome measurements will be changes of metabolism, brain reward circuitry and
      regional brain activity in response to food stimuli measured during the baseline and reduced
      calorie diet phases. Immediately following each controlled diet, we will measure 3 days of
      ad-libitum food intake using a computerized vending machine system. The subjects will return
      to the MCRU after a 2-10 week washout period to receive the opposite reduced calorie diet.
      Twenty control subjects with normal body weight (BMI between 18.5 - 25 kg/m2) will have
      measurements of brain reward circuitry and regional brain activity in response to food
      stimuli while on a balanced, weight-maintenance diet.

      Immediately following the second in-patient visit, all of the obese subjects will be assigned
      to a 12 week out-patient weight loss program with the goal of achieving at least 5% weight
      loss. We will investigate the relationship between short-term fat imbalances measured during
      the in-patient phases, and the body weight and fat changes during the weight loss program. We
      will evaluate the effects of weight loss on metabolism, brain reward circuitry, and regional
      brain activity in response to food stimuli. Finally, if the subjects are available for
      long-term follow-up, then we will investigate their metabolic phenotype, brain reward
      circuitry, and regional brain activity in response to food stimuli yearly over the subsequent
      5 years following the weight loss intervention. This study will result in an improved
      understanding of the physiological mechanisms that sense and respond to negative energy
      balance acutely, after several weeks, and after several years, and may eventually lead to
      increased long-term success of obesity treatment.
