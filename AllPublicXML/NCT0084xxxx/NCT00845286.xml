      The purpose of the study is to determine the myocardial function and vascular adaptation
      after strenuous exercise in association with genotype/polymorphisms. We aim to investigate
      the effects of extreme endurance exercise on the cardiovascular system. Furthermore, the role
      of the inflammatory response and adaptive mechanisms of the vasculature are examined.
      Subclinical injuries to the myocardium and vascular wall are being investigated.

      Regular exercise leads to an improvement of cardiovascular risc factors in patients with
      coronary heart disease, atherosclerosis and metabolic disorders. Aerobic exercise has
      anti-inflammatory effects. In contrast, the exertional exercise of marathon running causes an
      acute pro-inflammatory impulse. This may lead to myocardial injury and, in case of
      preexisting plaques, may result in plaque rupture and acute myocardial infarction.

      We aim to define the critical role of inflammatory markers and cardiovascular risc factors as
      a predictor of an increased risk for myocardial and endothelial dysfunction in marathon
      runners.

      Diagnostic tools include measurements of augmentation index (AIx), arteriolar-venular ratio
      (AVR) and, for the first time, 2D and 3D echocardiographic measurements such as TDI-imaging
      and speckle tracking. Inflammatory markers include c-reactive protein (CRP), interleukins and
      tumor necrosis factor. Additionally, cardiovascular markers are measured. All variations are
      analysed on the basis of genotype characteristics/polymorphisms.
