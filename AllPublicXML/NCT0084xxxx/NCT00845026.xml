  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess time to discontinuation due to lack of tolerability among patients
      with schizophrenia receiving LY2140023, given orally twice daily for 24 weeks, versus those
      on atypical antipsychotic standard-of-care treatment. Lack of tolerability is defined as
      discontinuation due to adverse events (AEs). Patients who complete the active treatment phase
      will be eligible to continue to an optional 28 weeks of treatment extension phase. This
      extension phase will assess key safety and efficacy measures.
