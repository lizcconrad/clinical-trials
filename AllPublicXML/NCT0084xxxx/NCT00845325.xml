  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To objectively and subjectively assess two modes of commonly employed rehabilitation and
      confirm a superior method to treat patients following carpal tunnel release.

      One of the problems following carpal tunnel release (CTR) for carpal tunnel syndrome, and all
      hand surgeries, is the debilitation in the postoperative period. This relates to muscle
      atrophy and joint stiffness due to immobilization or relative inactivity in the postoperative
      period. Specifically, patients suffer increased days off from work, lost wages, and
      difficulties with activities of daily living affecting the patient and society at large. CTR
      is a very common procedure in hand surgery making it easy to study and important to optimize
      the postoperative care.

  <detailed_description>

      The surgical procedure, carpal tunnel release, will be performed in a standard open fashion.
      In a random fashion, the patients will be placed into either of two rehabilitation groups
      following CTR with specifically different postoperative instructions after the procedure.

    <description>The first group (early motion) will have a bulky dressing placed at the time of surgery. They will be instructed to remove the dressing on the first postoperative day and to place a band-aid over the incision. A set of non-weight bearing &quot;stretching&quot; exercises will be explained on the day of surgery and instructions with diagrams sent home with the patient. They will begin these exercises on the day after surgery and perform them three times daily for two weeks. The patients will have no restrictions concerning activity or return to work.</description>

    <description>The second group will have wrist immobilization splints placed at the time surgery. The thumb and fingers will not have limited motion in this splint. Due to the splint placement, the patients will be restricted from using that hand during its implementation. One week following surgery the splint will be removed and the patient will be instructed to begin activity without restriction.</description>
