      The objective of this study is to evaluate the ease of use of the V.A.C® GranuFoam™ Bridge
      dressing on Diabetic Foot Ulcers under ActiV.A.C® negative pressure wound therapy for a
      period of 48-72 hrs (+6hrs). Ease of use will be determined based on the feedback on the
      following characteristics 1) Ease of dressing application 2) Ease of dressing removal and 3)
      Ease of dressing conformability. Additionally patient feedback on comfort during wear will
      also be collected. Patients currently prescribed to V.A.C.® Therapy will be enrolled in the
      trial.
