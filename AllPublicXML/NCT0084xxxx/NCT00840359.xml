  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the project is to determine whether daylight activated photodynamic therapy is
      effective in treating cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by L. major and L. tropical.

      PDT is classically performed as a two-step procedure in which MAL application to the lesion
      constitutes the first step, and PpIX activation by light of appropriate wavelength from an
      artificial light source constitutes the second step. Based on the knowledge that red and blue
      light required to activate PpIX are part of the daylight spectrum, the investigators
      postulated that effective PpIX activation can be obtained by exposure of the MAL treated
      lesions to daylight thus substantially simplifying the PDT procedure by omitting the 3 hour
      incubation period and the subsequent exposure to artificial light. In accord, in a recent
      study the investigators showed that daylight-activated PDT (DA-PDT) was as effective as
      conventional MAL-PDT in treating precancerous actinic keratoses lesion. Furthermore the
      investigators found that DA-PDT is significantly less painful than conventional MAL-PDT.

      The investigators now propose to study the efficacy of DA-PDT in the treatment of cutaneous
      leishmaniasis. DA-PDT has obvious advantages to conventional leishmania treatment forms:

      As opposed to most of the available treatment options, DA-PDT is a self-administered
      procedure that does not require the assistance of medical personnel. Secondly, judged by our
      experience with MAL-PDT, only few treatment sessions are required for effective parasite
      killing as opposed to the prolonged procedures usually required for treatment of
      leishmaniasis. Third, PDT has the far the best safety profile of all available treatment
      options.
