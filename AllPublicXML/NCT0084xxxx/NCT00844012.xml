  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Because ovarian sex steroids fluctuations during the menstrual cycle are implicated in the
      pathogenesis of the endometriosis-related chronic pelvic pain (CPP), the oral contraceptives
      (OCs) are used with non-contraceptive indication for this disorder.

      To date, OCs are widely used as medical treatment in patients with endometriosis, in
      addition, they are recently experimented as post-surgical therapy. Traditional cyclic
      regimen, with 21 days of active pills with 7 days of placebo or suspension, is usually
      adopted. Furthermore, recent studies suggested that long-term continuous OCs use can be
      effective in the postoperative period both as second- and third- line treatments after cyclic
      regimen failure. In these studies a combined treatment with ethinilestradiol (0.02 mg) plus
      desogestrel (0.15 mg) were used and compared with baseline or ciproterone acetate.

      A recent study showed a deeper ovarian and endometrial suppression with continuous OCs in
      comparison with cyclic OCs, providing a physiological rationale for continuous OCs use for
      noncontraceptive indications. Furthermore, to date, no study compared post-operative
      continuous versus cyclic OCs in patients with endometriosis-related CPP.

      Premenopausal women with endometriosis-related CPP scheduled for laparoscopic surgery to our
      Academic Department of Gynecology will be consecutively enrolled. Subjects with
      hystologically confirmed endometriosis at laparoscopy (stage I-IV of the American Society
      Reproductive Medicine), a subjective severity of pelvic pain by using a visual analogue scale
      (VAS 1-100) of at least 70, and without immediate desire of pregnancy will be enrolled.

      Briefly, all patients will undergo conservative laparoscopic surgery for endometriosis.
      Thereafter, a low-dose monophasic OC containing 2.0 mg clormadinone acetate plus 0.03 mg
      ethinil-estradiol (Belara®, Grunenthal, Milan, Italy) will be administered. Patients from the
      experimental group will be treated with a continuous regimen, while patients from the control
      group will receive the OC with a cyclic regimen consisting of 21 days of active pills with 7
      days of placebo. The drug and the placebo will be similar and will be labelled according to
      the subject number. For the overall study-period, operators and patients will be blind to the
      treatment allocation.
