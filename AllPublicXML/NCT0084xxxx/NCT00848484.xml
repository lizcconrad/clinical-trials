    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in the Composite Score From the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) Battery After 2 Weeks of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 2</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) was used to evaluate cognitive impairment, as measured by the mean change from baseline after 2 weeks of treatment in the composite score. The BACS composite score was calculated by averaging scores from the BACS subtests, including Verbal Memory, Digit Sequencing, Token Motor, Symbol Coding, Verbal Fluency (Semantic Fluency and Letter Fluency) and Tower of London. The possible minimum and maximum scores for change from baseline at two weeks of treatment for the endpoint are -111.5 and 111.5, respectively.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline After 2 Weeks of Treatment in the CogState Composite Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 2</time_frame>
    <description>CogState Schizophrenia Battery was used to evaluate cognitive impairment, as measured by the mean change from baseline after 2 weeks of treatment in the composite score. The composite score was comprised of 4 modules from the CogState Schizophrenia Battery: Identification Task, Detection Task, One Card Learning Task and Groton Maze Learning Task. Composite score was calculated by averaging all available standardized tests scores for the specified tests. The possible minimum and maximum scores for change from baseline at 2 weeks of treatment for the endpoint are -347.5 and 347.5, respectively.</description>

    <description>The Executive Functioning Composite Score was comprised of the following tests: Groton Maze Learning Task from the CogState Schizophrenia Battery and Tower of London, Semantic Fluency and Letter Fluency tests from the BACS. The composite score was calculated by averaging all of the available standardized tests scores for the specified tests. The possible minimum and maximum scores for change from baseline at two weeks of treatment for the endpoint are -253.4 and 253.4, respectively.</description>

        <description>The Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) was used to evaluate cognitive impairment, as measured by the mean change from baseline after 2 weeks of treatment in the composite score. The BACS composite score was calculated by averaging scores from the BACS subtests, including Verbal Memory, Digit Sequencing, Token Motor, Symbol Coding, Verbal Fluency (Semantic Fluency and Letter Fluency) and Tower of London. The possible minimum and maximum scores for change from baseline at two weeks of treatment for the endpoint are -111.5 and 111.5, respectively.</description>

        <description>CogState Schizophrenia Battery was used to evaluate cognitive impairment, as measured by the mean change from baseline after 2 weeks of treatment in the composite score. The composite score was comprised of 4 modules from the CogState Schizophrenia Battery: Identification Task, Detection Task, One Card Learning Task and Groton Maze Learning Task. Composite score was calculated by averaging all available standardized tests scores for the specified tests. The possible minimum and maximum scores for change from baseline at 2 weeks of treatment for the endpoint are -347.5 and 347.5, respectively.</description>

        <description>The Episodic Memory Composite Score was comprised of the following tests: Continuous Paired Associate Learning Task and One Card Learning Task from the CogState Schizophrenia Battery and the Verbal Memory test from the BACS. The composite score was calculated by averaging all of the available standardized tests scores for the specified tests. The possible minimum and maximum scores for change from baseline at two weeks of treatment for the endpoint are -207.06 and 207.06, respectively.</description>
