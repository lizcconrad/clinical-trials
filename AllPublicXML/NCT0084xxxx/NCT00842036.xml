      This research compares the benefits of the original treatment, Community Reinforcement and
      Family Training (CRAFT), with the Treatment Entry Training (TEnT) component of CRAFT to
      determine if TEnt alone can produce the primary outcome of CRAFT -- treatment entry of the
      drug user. We also look at the impact on the well-being of the concerned significant other
      and the drug use of their loved one.

      The consequences of drug abuse are not limited to drug users; they also extend to their
      families and concerned significant others (CSOs). Research shows that CSOs of drug users have
      increased prevalence of illness, domestic violence, and problems in mood and functioning.
      Because CSOs are troubled by the negative effects of drug use on the drug user and
      themselves, they may be a social community that is particularly invested in learning ways to
      positively influence the drug user.

      We compare the benefits of the original treatment, Community Reinforcement and Family
      Training (CRAFT), with the Treatment Entry Training (TEnT) component of CRAFT to see if the
      TEnt is sufficient to produce the primary and most consistent outcome of CRAFT -- treatment
      entry of the drug user.

    <description>Community Reinforcement and Family Training (CRAFT) is an intervention designed for the concerned significant other (CSO) of a drug or alcohol using loved one. The CRAFT intervention consists of approximately 12 sessions lasting 45-60 minutes. The goal of the CRAFT intervention is to train the CSO in new ways to interact with the person of concern (PC). There are four components that the CSO is trained on which include awareness training, community reinforcement training, treatment entry training, and CSO mood enhancement.</description>

    <description>Treatment Entry Training (TEnT) is a component of the Community Reinforcement and Family Training intervention and it is currently under investigation to determine if it is sufficient to produce the primary and most consistent outcome of CRAFT- treatment entry of the drug user. The intervention will consist of a minimum of 4 sessions and a maximum of 6 sessions that are each 45-60 minutes long. TEnT will include awareness training, safety training, and the Treatment Entry Training component of CRAFT.</description>

    <intervention_name>12- step Al/Nar- Anon Facilitation</intervention_name>
    <description>The underlying philosophy of the 12- step approach for concerned significant others (CSO) is that the CSO is powerless to control the drinker/drug user and must detach, focusing instead on accepting the situation and on strengthening his or her mental health. Eight content areas are discussed with the CSO over the course of the intervention. There will be a minimum of 8 sessions and a maximum of 12 sessions that are each 45-60 minutes long.</description>

        Exclusion Criteria:
