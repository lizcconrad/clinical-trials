  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac cause of ischemic stroke. Detecting atrial
      fibrillation after a stroke or TIA is critical because highly effective secondary stroke
      prevention therapy is available for individuals who are recognized to have atrial
      fibrillation. However, atrial fibrillation is likely under-diagnosed after stroke and TIA
      because atrial fibrillation is often difficult to detect as it is frequently paroxysmal and
      asymptomatic, and patients do not routinely undergo prolonged screening. The purpose of this
      study is to determine the diagnostic yield of a novel 30-day cardiac event monitor compared
      to a repeat 24-hour Holter monitor for detecting occult paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in
      patients with a recent ischemic stroke or TIA of undetermined etiology after completion of a
      standard clinical stroke work-up (including an initial negative Holter monitor.)

        Inclusion:

          1. Diagnosis of the index event* made by a stroke specialist of an acute ischemic stroke
             or TIA (WHO definition) of undetermined etiology (cryptogenic) occurring within the
             previous 6 months (180 days).The event must be either:

               -  an embolic arterial ischemic stroke confirmed by neuroimaging; or

               -  a transient ischemic attack, defined as involving a focal unilateral motor
                  deficit, speech/language deficit, or hemianopia, with symptom duration &lt;24 hours
                  (note: amaurosis fugax/transient monocular blindness, pure sensory spells,
                  isolated vertigo spells, etc. do not qualify for enrolment given the potential
                  for misdiagnosis of such events).

          2. Patient meets the following:

               -  At least one 12-lead ECG has already been obtained as part of the routine
                  clinical post-stroke/TIA work-up, and no ECGs have shown any episodes of atrial
                  fibrillation or atrial flutter, and;

               -  A Holter monitor has already been obtained as part of the routine clinical
                  post-stroke/TIA work-up, and does not show any episodes of atrial fibrillation or
                  atrial flutter ≥30 seconds.

          3. The patient is being actively investigated for the etiology of the stroke/TIA event
             and additional cardiac monitoring is desired to screen further for the possibility of
             occult paroxysmal atrial fibrillation/flutter, i.e. patients selected for this study
             are those for whom the investigator, in his/her clinical judgment, would consider
             ordering a repeat Holter monitor as part of clinical care.

          4. The following diagnostic tests have already been completed as part of clinical routine
             post-stroke/TIA:

               -  brain imaging with CT or MRI,

               -  vascular imaging of the extracranial and intracranial circulation with either CT
                  angiography or MR angiography to exclude significant large vessel occlusive
                  disease as the most likely mechanism for the index ischemic event (carotid
                  Doppler ultrasound is acceptable for those presenting with anterior circulation
                  ischemic events),

               -  transthoracic (or transesophageal) echocardiography to exclude thrombus or other
                  structural heart disease that in the opinion of the investigator is the most
                  likely cause for the stroke/TIA event. [Note: If a baseline echocardiogram cannot
                  be obtained clinically after the index event and prior to study enrollment, then
                  it is acceptable for study purposes for an echocardiogram to be obtained after
                  patient enrollment into the study but prior to the 90-day follow-up visit.
                  Alternatively, an echocardiogram already performed within one year prior to study
                  enrollment may serve as the baseline echocardiogram for study purposes.]

          5. Age 55 years or older [Note: Participants aged 55-59 years should have imaging
             confirmation of the index stroke/TIA event with an embolic imaging pattern of acute
             cerebral ischemia]

          6. Informed consent from the patient (or from a legally authorized representative if the
             patient is not competent, e.g. due to stroke-related cognitive impairment, aphasia, or
             anosognosia).

          7. The patient is expected to survive at least 6 months.

          8. The patient has a valid provincial health insurance number.

               -  The index event will be defined as the event leading to medical presentation

        Exclusion:

          1. Any previously documented atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, i.e. a past history
             of atrial fibrillation/flutter or atrial fibrillation/flutter detected on ECG, Holter,
             or telemetry following the index stroke/TIA event (a remote history of transient
             perioperative atrial fibrillation is not exclusionary

          2. Exclusively retinal stroke or TIA event.

          3. A most responsible etiological diagnosis for the qualifying stroke/TIA event has
             already been determined, i.e. probable small-vessel (lacunar) disease, probable large
             vessel disease, cervicocephalic artery dissection, venous sinus thrombosis,
             hypercoagulable states, or other known cause.

          4. Planned carotid endarterectomy within 90 days.

          5. Patient is already currently participating in a clinical trial involving an
             investigational medication or device.*

          6. Any finding on echocardiography for which there is already an evidence-based
             indication for long-term anticoagulation (e.g. mechanical heart valve, thrombus,
             etc.).

          7. Endocarditis

          8. Pacemaker or ICD device.

          9. Patients with known skin reactions to synthetic polymers or to silver. (Some people
             who display sensitivity to silver jewellery are sensitive to the impurities present in
             silver alloys and not to the silver itself. These people may participate.)
