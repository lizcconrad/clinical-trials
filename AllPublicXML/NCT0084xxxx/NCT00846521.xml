  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to determine whether treatment with acarbose attenuates
      post-prandial glycemic excursions in non-diabetic/pre-diabetic obese children as determined
      by continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGMS). To this effect the current pilot study
      involves a 6 week intervention with acarbose given to all subjects with either impaired
      glucose tolerance or an area under the curve of &gt;130 mg/dl during the screening oral glucose
      tolerance test. Three consecutive days of CGMS are then compared to before and during the
      intervention. The secondary objective addressed in this protocol is the collection of
      baseline measures of endothelial function in obese and lean children. Even though the
      duration of acarbose treatment may be too short to demonstrate a vascular effect, the pre and
      post intervention data would serve as preliminary data for anticipated future studies that
      assess the vascular effect of reduced post-prandial blood glucose levels.

      We are particularly interested in examining whether acarbose lowered the percentage of
      glucose excursions ≥ 140 mg/dl in a real-life, home environment. At baseline, subjects
      underwent an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and 72 hr of out-patient continuous glucose
      monitoring. They were treated with acarbose (50 mg with meals three times daily) for 6 weeks
      and repeat 72 hr CGMS profiles were obtained at the end of the study.
