      This is a prospective, observational case series to determine the clinical utility of tear
      osmolarity, tear film breakup time, corneal fluorescein staining, conjunctival lissamine
      green staining, Schirmer's test without anesthesia, Bron/Foulks meibomian glan grading and
      the ocular surface disease index to diagnose dry eye disease, as well as to establish
      referent values for objective tests of the disease. Patients were recruited across sites in
      the EU and US from the general clinical population.

    <measure>Diagnostic Test Data for Disease Using Tear Osmolarity Threshold &gt; 308 mOsm/L</measure>
    <time_frame>Single visit</time_frame>
    <description>Tear osmolarity was measured with a laboratory-on-a-chip, to simultaneously collect and analyze the electrical impedance of a 50 nL tear sample from the interior lateral meniscus (TearLab Osmolarity System). A cutoff threshold of more than 308 mOsm/L was used for differentiating normal from mild to moderate subjects.
The clinical tools most commonly used in grading dry eye severity are symptomatology (e.g. questionnaires such as the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) or McMonnies Dry Eye Questionnaire), tear osmolarity, tear film breakup time (TBUT), fluoresceine or lissamine green staining of the cornea and conjunctiva, meibomiam secretion scoring, and the Schirmer test.To convert all the various clinical measurements into a common unit system, based on their breakpoints provided by the Dry Eye Workshop (DEWS), a composite score was created. Its scale being between 0 (representing the least evidence of disease) and 1 (representing the most evidence of disease).</description>

    <measure>Diagnostic Test Data for Disease Using Tear Film Breakup Time Threshold &lt; 5 Seconds</measure>
    <time_frame>Single visit</time_frame>
    <description>Tear film breakup time was measured by instilling 5μL of a 2% sodium fluoresceine solution and calculating the average of three consecutive breakup times, manually determined with a stopwatch.

        <title>Diagnostic Test Data for Disease Using Tear Osmolarity Threshold &gt; 308 mOsm/L</title>
        <description>Tear osmolarity was measured with a laboratory-on-a-chip, to simultaneously collect and analyze the electrical impedance of a 50 nL tear sample from the interior lateral meniscus (TearLab Osmolarity System). A cutoff threshold of more than 308 mOsm/L was used for differentiating normal from mild to moderate subjects.
The clinical tools most commonly used in grading dry eye severity are symptomatology (e.g. questionnaires such as the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) or McMonnies Dry Eye Questionnaire), tear osmolarity, tear film breakup time (TBUT), fluoresceine or lissamine green staining of the cornea and conjunctiva, meibomiam secretion scoring, and the Schirmer test.To convert all the various clinical measurements into a common unit system, based on their breakpoints provided by the Dry Eye Workshop (DEWS), a composite score was created. Its scale being between 0 (representing the least evidence of disease) and 1 (representing the most evidence of disease).</description>

        <description>Tear film breakup time was measured by instilling 5μL of a 2% sodium fluoresceine solution and calculating the average of three consecutive breakup times, manually determined with a stopwatch. The cutoff of &lt;5 seconds was used to differentiate normal from dry eye subjects. The clinical tools most commonly used in grading dry eye severity are symptomatology (e.g. questionnaires such as the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) or McMonnies Dry Eye Questionnaire), tear osmolarity, tear film breakup time (TBUT), fluoresceine or lissamine green staining of the cornea and conjunctiva, Meibomiann secretion scoring, and the Schirmer test.

          <title>Diagnostic Test Data for Disease Using Tear Film Breakup Time Threshold &lt; 5 Seconds</title>
          <description>Tear film breakup time was measured by instilling 5μL of a 2% sodium fluoresceine solution and calculating the average of three consecutive breakup times, manually determined with a stopwatch. The cutoff of &lt;5 seconds was used to differentiate normal from dry eye subjects. The clinical tools most commonly used in grading dry eye severity are symptomatology (e.g. questionnaires such as the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) or McMonnies Dry Eye Questionnaire), tear osmolarity, tear film breakup time (TBUT), fluoresceine or lissamine green staining of the cornea and conjunctiva, Meibomiann secretion scoring, and the Schirmer test. To convert all the various clinical measurements into a common unit system, based on their breakpoints provided by the Dry Eye Workshop (DEWS), a composite score was created. Its scale being between 0 (representing the least evidence of disease) and 1 (representing the most evidence of disease).</description>

        <title>Diagnostic Test Data for Disease Using Ocular Surface Disease Index Threshold &gt; 15/100</title>
        <description>Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) Questionnaire was used for symptoms assessment. A cutoff of 15/100 score was used to differentiate between normal and dry eye subjects. The clinical tools most commonly used in grading dry eye severity are symptomatology (e.g. questionnaires such as the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) or McMonnies Dry Eye Questionnaire), tear osmolarity, tear film breakup time (TBUT), fluoresceine or lissamine green staining of the cornea and conjunctiva, meibomiam secretion scoring, and the Schirmer test.To convert all the various clinical measurements into a common unit system, based on their breakpoints provided by the Dry Eye Workshop (DEWS), a composite score was created. Its scale being between 0 (representing the least evidence of disease) and 1 (representing the most evidence of disease).</description>

        <title>Referent Values for Meibomian Gland Grading</title>
        <description>Meibomian gland dysfunction was assessed to grade the quality, expressibility, and volume of gland secretion, according to Bron/Foulks scoring system. A score of 0 indicates full integrity of these glands while the maximum of 27, is used for severe damage.</description>

        <title>Referent Values for Ocular Surface Disease Index</title>
        <description>Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) Questionnaire was used for symptoms assessment and the index is calculated based on the responses given by the subject. A cutoff of 15/100 score was used to differentiate between normal and dry eye subjects. A score of 0 confirms no dry eye symptoms are present, while a maximum of 100 indicates the maximum severity of symptoms experienced by subjects.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>95/299 subjects were using topical medication at the time of measurement, potentially lowering the diagnostic performance of osmolarity (osmolarity is lowered and responds before the other tests during therapy) and compressing the referent spread.</limitations_and_caveats>
