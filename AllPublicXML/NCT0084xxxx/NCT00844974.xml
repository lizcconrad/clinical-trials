  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to learn more about cognitive deficits in people with
      certain mood disorders. The mood disorders are Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Bipolar
      disorder, depressed type.

      Cognitive deficits are problems with things like thinking and memory. People with cognitive
      deficits may have problems concentrating and paying attention. When talking, they may have
      trouble recalling a word they want to say. They may think slowly and have problems
      remembering things. These deficits can affect an individual's ability to work and function
      socially. Cognitive deficits that occur with depression may increase the risk of a relapse of
      major depressive disorder.

      We want to study the course of cognitive impairment in subjects as they are receiving
      treatment for their depression. We want to find out if their cognitive deficits get better,
      worse, or stay the same.

      We also want to learn more about a stress hormone called cortisol that is produced in the
      body. We want to study the relationship between cortisol and cognitive impairment. Recent
      research has shown that cognitive impairment may be more severe in people who have high
      levels of cortisol in their blood.

      We will also measure the levels of a protein in your blood called brain-derived neurotrophic
      factor (BDNF). BDNF helps the growth of new brain cells. It appears that the growth of new
      brain cells lessens when people are depressed. Treatment with antidepressant medications may
      cause BDNF levels to increase and return to normal. We are interested in studying the
      relationship between BDNF levels and cognitive impairment throughout treatment.
