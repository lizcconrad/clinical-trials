    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Unilateral or bilateral primary open angle glaucoma (POAG), exfoliative glaucoma,
             pigmentary glaucoma or ocular hypertension (glaucoma is defined as either visual
             fields defect or glaucomatous changes of the optic nerve head in association with
             elevated intraocular pressure. Ocular hypertension is defined as IOP ≥ 21 mmHg at
             diagnosis).

          -  Is currently receiving (at the screen visit) or has received topical monotherapy or
             dual therapy (within the past 6 months) for POAG or ocular hypertension.

          -  Required washout periods are 4 weeks for -adrenergic antagonists, prostaglandin
             analogues (including latanoprost, unoprostone, travoprost and bimatoprost) and 2 weeks
             for adrenergic agonists, and 5 days for cholinergic agonists and carbonic anhydrase
             inhibitors, prior to the baseline visit.

          -  Mean 8 AM IOP ≥ 23 mmHg at the baseline visit for all patients. Patients should be
             assigned treatment only after the 8 PM IOP is obtained.

          -  Visual acuity (best corrected) equal to or better than 20/200 (Snellen). ETDRS charts
             may be used and converted to Snellen units.

          -  Informed Consent: Signed Informed Consent is obtained at the screen visit.

          -  Able to adhere to treatment/visit planUnilateral or bilateral primary open angle
             glaucoma, capsular glaucoma, pigmentary glaucoma or ocular hypertension.

          -  Open angle glaucoma appearing more than 6 months after cataract surgery is recognized
             as primary open angle glaucoma. (individuals requiring treatment bilaterally must
             fulfill eligibility criteria for both eyes.)

          -  IOP of 22mmHg or higher obtained during the pre-study period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Ocular conditions

          -  Closed/barely open anterior chamber angle or history of acute angle closure. (Patients
             who are diagnosed with POAG after a successful peripheral iridotomy may be enrolled).

          -  History of ALT (Argon Laser Trabeculoplasty) within 3 months prior to the screen visit
             (the unlasered eye may be enrolled as the study eye).

          -  History of any ocular filtering surgical intervention (the unfiltered eye may be
             enrolled as the study eye).

          -  Ocular surgery (on the globe of the eye only), or inflammation/infection within 3
             months prior to screen visit. (Applies to both fellow and study eyes.)

          -  Hypersensitivity to benzalkonium chloride or to any other component in latanoprost
             (Xalatan), travoprost (Travatan) or bimatoprost (Lumigan).

          -  Other abnormal ocular conditions or symptoms preventing the patient from entering the
             study, in the investigator's clinical judgement.

        Other conditions

          -  Use of systemic medication known to affect IOP (i.e., alpha-adrenergic agonists,
             beta-adrenergic antagonists, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors and/or
             angiotensin II receptor blockers, or corticosteroids), unless the patient and the
             medication dosage have been stable for three months prior to the screen visit and the
             dosage is not expected to change during the study.

        Women

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) who are not using contraceptive methods. Women
             of childbearing potential are defined as women who are not surgically sterile or not
             postmenopausal (at least 12 months without a menstrual period). Contraception is
             defined as abstinence, having a vasectomized partner, or the ongoing use of approved
             oral, injectable or implanted contraceptives, a barrier method, or an IUD.

          -  Pregnancy. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative urine
             pregnancy test at the screen visit and baseline visit.

          -  Nursing mothers General

          -  Use of any investigational medication within 30 days prior to screen visit.
