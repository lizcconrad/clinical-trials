      RATIONALE: Broccoli sprout extract supplements may slow the growth of tumor cells or abnormal
      cells and may be an effective treatment for ductal carcinoma in situ and/or atypical ductal
      hyperplasia.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well broccoli sprout extract works in
      treating women with a diagnosis of breast cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ and/or atypical
      ductal hyperplasia.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine the correlation between supplemental sulforaphane (broccoli sprout extract)
           dose and concentrations of sulforaphane and its metabolites in blood and urine samples
           from women positive for cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ and/or atypical ductal
           hyperplasia.

        -  To determine the effect of this supplement on biomarkers of prognosis in these patients.

        -  To determine the effect of this supplement on HDAC inhibition in peripheral blood cell
           and normal and cancerous breast tissue samples from these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Sulforaphane Supplement: Patients receive oral broccoli sprout extract supplementation
           three times daily for 2-8 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Placebo: Patients receive oral placebo supplementation three times daily for 2-8 weeks
           in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood and urine samples are collected at baseline and after completion of study treatment for
      laboratory biomarker studies. Patients scheduled to undergo surgery (mastectomy or
      lumpectomy) also undergo breast tissue sample collection at baseline and at the time of
      surgery. Samples are analyzed for sulforaphane metabolism (isothiocyanate levels), HDAC
      activity (acetylated histone expression), cell proliferation (Ki-67 index by IHC), and
      apoptosis (TUNEL assay).

      Patients complete questionnaires at baseline and periodically during study about their
      dietary history, family history, cruciferous vegetable intake, adverse events, and dietary
      and medication changes.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at/around 30 days.

    <description>Ki-67 was measured through immunohistochemistry method. A modified H-score was recorded, which involved semi-quantitative assessment of both staining intensity (graded as 1-3 with 1 representing weak staining, 2 moderate staining, and 3 strong staining) and percentage of positive cells. The range of the H-score was 0-300. The maximum score indicates the strongest expression, the minimum score indicates no expression of positive tumor area.</description>

        <description>Ki-67 was measured through immunohistochemistry method. A modified H-score was recorded, which involved semi-quantitative assessment of both staining intensity (graded as 1-3 with 1 representing weak staining, 2 moderate staining, and 3 strong staining) and percentage of positive cells. The range of the H-score was 0-300. The maximum score indicates the strongest expression, the minimum score indicates no expression of positive tumor area.</description>

Linear mixed effect models were used to calculate adjusted least square means (LSMEANS) and 95% confidence intervals,&amp; to test the statistical significance of the difference between pre- and post- treatments within each group, as well as between treatment groups.</population>
