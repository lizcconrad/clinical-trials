      This study is an open-label, randomised, single dose study to determine the pharmacokinetics,
      safety and tolerability of 2 different formulations of orvepitant 60 mg and the effect of

    <textblock>
      Orvepitant is a highly potent and selective neurokinin-1 (NK1) receptor antagonist currently
      in development for the treatment of depression and anxiety.

      This study is an open-label, randomised, single dose study to determine the pharmacokinetics,
      safety and tolerability of 2 different formulations of orvepitant 60 mg and the effect of
      food in 15 Healthy Volunteers. According to a cross over design, in three different
      occasions, each subject will receive the &quot;old&quot; formulation of orvepitant in fasted condition
      and the &quot;new&quot; formulation in fasted condition and after a FDA High-Fat Breakfast. Subjects
      will be screened within 21 days of first treatment. On each dosing occasion, subjects will be
      admitted to the clinic on Day-1 and will remain until Day 2; they will be also asked to
      return to the site 48 and 72 hours after each dosing for the PK blood sample collection. The
      wash-out period between each dosing occasion will be at least 5 days and subjects will be
      asked to return to the site 7-14 days after the administration of the last dose of orvepitant
      for a follow-up visit.

             potential or child-bearing potential and agrees to use one of the contraception
             methods

          -  No co-morbid Psychiatric Disorders as defined using the Mini International
             Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I) scale.

          -  A 12-lead ECG at screening showed no abnormalities that in the opinion of the
             Principal Investigator will compromise safety in this study.

             -- Body weight ≥ 50 kg and BMI within the range 19.0 - 29.9 kg/m2 (inclusive).

          -  Capable of giving written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  As a result of any of the medical interview, physical examination or screening
             investigations the Physician Responsible considers the subject unfit for the study.

          -  The subject has a history of a drug or other allergy which in the opinion of the
             Physician Responsible contraindicates the participation in the study.

          -  Subjects with an unstable medical disorder or a disorder that would likely interfere
             with the action, absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of orvepitant, may
             pose a safety concern, or interfere with accurate assessment of safety.

          -  The subject has a current or recent (within six months) documented gastrointestinal
             disease; a history of malabsorption, oesophageal reflux, or irritable bowel syndrome;
             frequent (more than once a week) occurrence of heartburn, or any surgical intervention
             (e.g. cholecystectomy) which would be expected to influence the absorption of drugs.

          -  History of psychiatric illness

          -  Any history of a clinically significant abnormality of the neurological system
             (including dementia and other cognitive disorders or significant head injury) or any
