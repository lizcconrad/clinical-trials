      Summary of Study Rationale Near-infrared light (NIR) via light-emitting diodes (LED)
      treatment promotes retinal healing and improve visual function following high intensity laser
      retinal injury by augmenting cellular energy metabolism, enhances mitochondrial function,
      increases cytochrome C oxidase activity, stimulates antioxidant protective pathways, and
      promotes cell survival. LED directly benefits injured neurons in the retina, the lateral
      geniculate nucleus, and the visual cortex, where perception occurs. From a public health
      perspective, a Light-Emitting Diode (LED) Array study is important to conduct because it has
      been approved as a non-significant risk (NSR) device for treatment of eye disorders, it has a
      low cost of treatment, and it may serve as an effective, non-invasive alternative or
      adjunctive treatment to laser photocoagulation, the current standard of care for DME.

      Study Objectives and Hypotheses

        1. To determine the effects of short term (3 month) near-infrared light (NIR) therapy on
           anatomic and functional abnormalities of diabetic macular edema as assessed by visual
           acuity, optical coherence tomography, multifocal electroretinography (mERG) and fundus
           bimicroscopy.

        2. To assess safety of short term near-infrared light therapy in eyes with diabetic macular
           edema.

    <description>The study will require 20 subjects.
Each subject will have one &quot;study eye&quot; that will be designated for treatment.
Subjects will be exposed to light emitted from Warp 10 LED's (Quantum Devices, Barneveld, WI) at wavelengths of 670 nm (+/-15nm) with a minimum exposure of 4 J/cm2 (4.0 - 7.68J/cm2). This is accomplished by applying the 50 mW/cm2 (50 - 80 mw/cm2) LED-generated light to the study eye.
Treatments involve application of the LED-generated light for 80 seconds, twice daily.
Primary efficacy and toxicity outcomes are determined by measuring excess retinal thickness via Ocular Coherence Tomography at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months, prior to conclusion of the study.
• This protocol will be stopped if, at any point in the study, a 50% increase in excess retinal thickness is demonstrated via OCT in 25% of subjects in the experimental group.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age &gt;= 18 years Subjects &lt;18 years old are not being included because DME is so rare
             in this age group that the diagnosis of DME may be questionable.

          2. Diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (type 1 or type 2)

             • Any one of the following will be considered to be sufficient evidence that diabetes
             is present: Current regular use of insulin for the treatment of diabetes Current
             regular use of oral anti-hyperglycemia agents for the treatment of diabetes Documented
             diabetes by ADA and/or WHO criteria (see Procedures Manual for definitions)

             needle biopsy/aspiration, placement of a central venous access device, removal/biopsy
