  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previously the investigators have found that adolescent elite swimmers, who have been
      involved in competitive swimming for only a few years, have not developed respiratory
      symptoms, signs of airway inflammation or airway hyperresponsiveness exept for a slight
      increase in airway responsiveness to eucapnic voluntary hyperpnea. In the current study, the
      investigators will be doing a 3-year follow-up study on the swimmers studied previously.

      Even though studies suggest that elite sport can cause AHR and airway inflammation, more
      studies are needed to elucidate how and when AHR and airway inflammation develop; and there
      is a lack of follow-up studies. The present study will give us a chance to do a follow-up
      study to register changes in AHR and airway inflammation in athletes without any significant
      airway changes at baseline.
