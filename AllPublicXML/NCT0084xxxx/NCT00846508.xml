      This phase III study is designed to examine if low-risk, as defined by clinical and
      radiological parameters, stage IB-IIB cervical cancer patients treated by cisplatin-based
      chemoradiation, which is a recommended method by today's standard, have greater toxicities
      but similar survival rate as those treated by radiotherapy (RT) alone. Patients will be
      primarily treated with radiotherapy with same protocol, but without concurrent chemotherapy
      in the control arm, and with weekly cisplatin (40 mg/M2) for 6 courses in the study arm. This
      study will be conducted at all branches of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital except Chia-I.

      Patients will be randomized to either arm after stratification of risk factors. Each arm will
      recruit 104 patients who have no LN and systemic metastasis as defined by CT/MRI and FDG-PET.
      The primary end point is grade 3-5 late toxicities, and secondary end points are 1)
      recurrence free survival; 2) acute toxicity of treatments; 3) sites of recurrence; 4) quality
      of life; 5) total treatment time. It is expected to take 5 years to recruit enough case
      number.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary Objectives:

      •To examine if low-risk, as defined by clinical and radiological parameters, stage IB-IIB
      cervical cancer patients treated by cisplatin-based CCRT have greater toxicities but similar
      survival rate as those treated by RT alone.

      Secondary Objectives:

      •To conduct a translational research to find out the molecular markers associated with
      radiosensitivity and distant metastasis in cervical cancer patients.

      104 cases for each arm.(total 208 cases)

      Radiotherapy will start within 3 weeks of randomization.

      Chemotherapy:

      Cisplatin 40mg/M2 IV infusion weekly concurrently with radiotherapy, up to 6 courses.

      Investigation during treatment (for patients on both arms)

        1. . Hematology: A complete blood count is required at weekly intervals.

        2. . Renal function: Serum creatinine is required before each course of CT.

        3. . Body weight and performance status: will be evaluated on the day of weekly visit on
           radiotherapy clinics. Performance status is graded by ECOG scale.

        4. . Quality of life assessment: assess by EORTC-C30 &amp; CX28 scales at pre-RT, 3-4 weeks and
           6-7 weeks during RT.

      Investigation during follow-up:

      When radiotherapy (RT) treatment is completed, patients will be followed up as out-patients
      basis. The first visit will be within 2 months after last RT. For patients whose tumor does
      not regress completely at the end of RT, monthly follow-up for at least 3 months or to the
      time of complete regression is recommended. After first follow-up or time of compete
      regression of tumor, patients will be followed up at 3-monthly intervals for 2 years,
      4-monthly for one year, then 6-monthly.

      Quality of life assessment: assess by EORTC-C30 &amp; CX28 scales at 2 months, 4-5 months after
      RT, then q 6 months x 2 and yearly for another 2 years.

      Dosage modification and toxicity Toxicity must be recorded at each attendance for
      chemotherapy and monthly during radiotherapy on the &quot;on study form&quot;.

        1. . Hematological toxicity: ANC &lt; 1500 /mm3 and/or platelet &lt; 100,000 /mm3 prior to
           chemotherapy will require one week delay in treatment until these levels have been
           reached. If the parameters are still below requirements 1 week later, administration of
           chemotherapy could still be proceeded if 1000 &lt;ANC &lt; 1500 /mm3, platelet &gt; 50,000 /mm3
           at reduced dose (25% off).

           Radiotherapy will not be delayed unless severe infection or a white count less than
           1000/mm3

        2. . Renal toxicity:

           a). Cisplatin: Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg% (creatinine clearance &gt; 70 ml/min): full dose;
           1.6-1.9 mg% (or 0.6-0.8 mg% above base line, or Ccr 50-70 ml/min): 25% off; &gt; 2.0 mg%
           (or &gt; 1.2 mg% over baseline or 50% decrease of Ccr): no cisplatin

        3. . Neurotoxicity: Cisplatin discontinued on Grade 3 neuropathy. 30% dose decrease for
           Grade 2 neurotoxicity or ototoxicity

        4. . Ototoxicity: Ototoxicity is rare within 4 -6 courses or cisplatin, but if clinical
           significant deterioration of hearing loss (grade 3) was noted, cisplatin will be
           discontinued. The aged are more susceptible to ototoxicity.

        5. . Genitourinary complications Urinary tract infection or radiation cystitis may be noted
           during the course of treatment, CT or CT+RT will be withheld in case of grade 3 toxicity

        6. Gastroenterological toxicity:

      Acute radiation enteritis may prelude continuation or delay either CT or CT+RT

    <description>Cisplatin is available commercially as a sterile lyophilized white power in single-dose amber vials containing 10 mg or 50 mg of cisplatin for administration by IV infusion. Every effort should be made to obtain and record the lot numbers of the batches of cisplatin used. Unopened vials of cisplatin are stable for the shelf-life indicated on the package when stored in accordance with the manufacturers' instructions.</description>
