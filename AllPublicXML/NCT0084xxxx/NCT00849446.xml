      Background:Accelerometry has only recently been introduced in clinical stroke research.
      However, whether accelerometry is a valid and reliable tool in stroke needs to be
      established. From literature becomes clear that existing accelerometers show shortages at
      patients with stroke because of the specific deficits that these patients have.

      Purpose: The aim of this study is to investigate the validity and test-retest reliability of
      the SenseWear Pro armband as an objective measurement of physical activity in chronic stroke
      patients.

      Patients and Methods Subjects: Fifteen patients and fifteen healthy subjects will be included
      in the study following written informed consent. The following demographic and clinical data
      were recorded: age, gender, height, length, medication use, self-reported handedness,
      Edinburgh Handedness Inventory, Rivermead Gross Function, Functional Ambulation Categories,
      medical and surgical history.

      Methods: During one test session the subjects had to carry out an amount of activities
      according to a standardised protocol existing of lying down, sitting, standing, walking, step
      exercise and cycling. These activities are presenting activities of daily living.

      Measures:Subjects wear on both arms a SenseWear Pro Armband. De data from these measuring
      devices will be compared with the data retrieved from 2 Yamax pedometers and the
      ergospirometry device. The outcome measures are: counts, heartbeat, oxygen used, energy
      expenditure, METabolic equivalent, time lying down.
