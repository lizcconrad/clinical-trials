    <textblock>
      This study will characterize the effect of elevated gastric pH mediated by the proton-pump
      inhibitor, esomeprazole, on the relative bioavailability of lapatinib in subjects with
      metastatic ErbB2 positive breast cancer.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Metastatic, histologically confirmed breast cancer that overexpresses ErbB2 (3+ by
             IHC, FISH, or CISH positive).

          -  18 years to 65 years of age.

          -  Is male or female (of non childbearing potential or willing to use contraception as
             specified in the protocol).

          -  Is able to swallow and retain oral medication.

          -  ECOG performance status 0 to 2.

          -  Provided written informed consent.

          -  Adequate bone marrow function (as specified in the protocol).

          -  Calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) greater than or equal to 50 ml/min based on
             Cockcroft and Gault.

          -  Total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 X upper limit of normal of institutional
             values.

          -  Alanine transaminase (ALT) less than or equal to 3 times the upper limit of the
             institutional values or less than or equal to 5 times ULN with documented liver
             metastases

          -  Has a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) within the normal institutional range
             based on ECHO or MUGA.

          -  Life expectancy of greater than or equal to 12 weeks

          -  Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             resection of the stomach or small bowel.

          -  Has current active hepatic or biliary disease (with exception of patients with
             Gilbert's syndrome, asymptomatic gallstones, liver metastases or stable chronic liver
             disease per investigator assessment)

          -  Has evidence of symptomatic or uncontrolled brain metastases or leptomeningeal
             disease. Subjects with brain metastases treated by surgery and/or radiotherapy are
             eligible if neurologically stable and do not require steroids or anticonvulsants.

          -  Is considered medically unfit for the study by the investigator.

          -  Has a known immediate or delayed benzimidazole hypersensitivity reaction or
             idiosyncrasy to drugs chemically related to the investigational product such as
             gefitinib [Iressa] and erlotinib [Tarceva].

          -  Has received treatment with any investigational drug in the previous four weeks. (with
             the exception of lapatinib).

          -  Has received chemotherapy, immunotherapy, biologic therapy or hormonal therapy for the
             treatment of cancer within the past 14 days, with the exception of mitomycin C which
             is restricted for the past six weeks, and lapatinib. Subjects receiving lapatinib
             prior to study entry are eligible to participate in the study.

             prohibited medication list in the protocol.

          -  Has physiological, familial, sociological, or geographical conditions that do not
             permit compliance with the protocol.

          -  Has inadequate venous access for protocol-related blood draws.

          -  Clinically significant electrocardiogram abnormality.

          -  History of sensitivity to heparin or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

          -  Consumption of red wine, seville oranges, grapefruit or grapefruit juice and/or
             kumquats, pummelos, exotic citrus fruit (i.e. star fruit, bitter melon), grapefruit
             hybrids or fruit juices from seven days prior to the first dose of study medication.
