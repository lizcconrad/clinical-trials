      The study induces an immune response towards the stem-cell like part of glioblastomas in
      combination with standard therapy. The aim is to define and characterize the feasibility,
      potential adverse effects of such therapy and measure time to progression and survival.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Accessible volume and quality of tumor tissue for vaccine production

          -  MRI after surgery with minimal tumor remnant.

          -  Between 18 and 70 years of age.

          -  Must have histologically confirmed glioma grade IV, and a candidate for combined
             radiation therapy and chemotherapy (&quot;Stupps regimen&quot;).

          -  Must be ambulatory with a ECOG performance status 0 or 1.

          -  A minimum 4 weeks must have elapsed between the end of glucocorticoid treatment and
             beginning of vaccination.

          -  Signed informed consent and expected cooperation of the patients for the treatment and
             follow up must be obtained and documented.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Tumor in a localization where a modest increase in size due to reactive oedema may
             have a large impact on patients neurological condition.

          -  Large tumor remnant after surgery.

          -  History of prior malignancy other than glioma, with the exception of curatively
             treated basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and ca. cervicis stage IB.

          -  Chronic active infection requiring antibiotic therapy.

          -  Significant cardiac or other medical illness that would limit activity or survival,
             such as severe congestive heart failure, unstable angina, or serious cardiac
             arrhythmia.

          -  Prior splenectomy.

          -  Glucocorticoid treatment not possible to terminate due to autoimmune disease or
             increased intracranial pressure.

          -  Adverse reactions to vaccines such as asthma, anaphylaxis or other serious reactions.

          -  History of immunodeficiency or autoimmune disease such as rheumatoid arthritis,
             systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, polymyositis- dermatomyositis, juvenile
             onset insulin dependent diabetes, or a vasculitic syndrome.

          -  Chemotherapy or other potentially immune-suppressive therapy that has been
             administered within 4 weeks prior to vaccination.

          -  Pregnancy or lactation.

          -  Any reason why, in the opinion of the investigator, the patient should not
             participate.
