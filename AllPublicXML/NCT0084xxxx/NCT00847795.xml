    <textblock>
      An exploratory Phase-II trial with intradermal RN1001 (Avotermin) to investigate scar
      prevention and reduction and acceleration of healing. The trial has an additional objective
      to evaluate several different scar assessment techniques that can be used in future clinical
      trials in the prevention and reduction of scarring.

    <textblock>
      Double blind, randomised, Placebo and Standard Care controlled, single centre study. Each
      subject receives a total of 6 wounds, two incisions and four punch biopsies. Each subject
      serves as their own control, i.e. Arm 1 incisions/biopsies randomly received one of two
      treatments and Arm 2 incisions/biopsies received the same treatments as for Arm 1 but in
      reverse. The randomisation of the treatment allowed for control of possible positional
      effects on healing/scarring. Healed scars from incisional wounds excised from Arm 1 and Arm 2
      after 6 months for histological analysis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically healthy, male and female subjects aged 60 years and over. All females will
             be at least 2 years post menopausal.

          -  Weight between 50 and 150kg or a body mass index within the permitted range for their
             height using Quetelet's index-weight (kg)/heightÂ²(m). The permitted index is between
             15 - 35 kg/m2.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who on direct questioning and physical examination have a history or evidence
             of hypertrophic or keloid scarring or with tattoos or previous scars in the area to be
             biopsied.

          -  Subjects with a personal history of a bleeding disorder.

          -  Subjects with a skin disorder that is chronic or currently active and which the
             investigator considers will adversely affect the healing the acute wounds or involves
             the areas to be examined in this trial.

          -  Subjects with any clinically significant medical condition that would impair wound
             healing including renal, hepatic, haematological, neurological or immune disease.

          -  Subjects with a history of clinically significant drug hypersensitivity to lignocaine
             or allergy to surgical dressings to be used in this trial.

          -  Subjects with any clinically significant abnormality following review of pre trial
             laboratory data and physical examination (see above).

          -  Subjects who are taking, or have taken, any investigational drugs, long term oral,
             topical or inhaled corticosteroid therapy, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or
             anti-coagulant drugs in the thirty days prior to Day 0.

          -  Subjects who have evidence of drug abuse.

          -  Subjects who are known to have or had serum hepatitis or who are carriers of the
             hepatitis B surface antigen or hepatitis C antibody. Subjects with previous
             vaccination against Hepatitis B are not excluded per se.

          -  Subjects who are known to have or had serum hepatitis or who are carriers of the
             hepatitis B core antibody and who show less than 10 units per litre of Anti-HBs.

          -  Subjects who have previously had a positive result to the test for HIV antibodies, or
             who admit to belonging to a high-risk group.

          -  In the opinion of the investigator, a subject who is not likely to complete the trial
             for what ever reason.
