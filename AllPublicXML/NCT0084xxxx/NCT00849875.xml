    <measure>Number of Patients Reported With Unsolicited Adverse Events (AEs) That Were Causally Related to Treatment Administration by Maximum Grade.</measure>
    <time_frame>Within the 31-day (Days 0-30) post-administration period.</time_frame>
    <description>The assessed AEs were ASCI-related grade 3/4 adverse events according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0. An unsolicited AE covers any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation patient temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product and reported in addition to those solicited during the clinical study and any solicited symptom with onset outside the specified period of follow-up for solicited symptoms. Related = AE assessed by the investigator as related to the treatment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Patients Reported With Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>During the entire study period, up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Serious adverse events (SAEs) assessed include medical occurrences that result in death, are life threatening, require hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization or result in disability/incapacity. Events which were part of the natural course of the disease under study (i.e., disease progression, recurrence) were captured as part of the clinical activity outcome variables in this study; therefore these did not need to be reported as SAEs. Progression/recurrence of the tumor in a patient was recorded as part of the clinical assessment data collection, and deaths due to progressive disease was recorded on a specific form, but not as an SAE. However, if the investigator considered that there was a causal relationship between treatment or protocol design/procedures and the disease progression/recurrence, then the event was reported as an SAE. Any new primary cancer (non-related to the cancer under study) was reported as an SAE.</description>

    <measure>Number of Patients With Objective Tumor Response (OR) to MAGE-A3 ASCI Study Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>During the entire study, up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Response assessment was done based on a set of measurable lesions (MLs) identified at baseline as target lesions (TLs), and followed up until disease progression. Up to 5 MLs per organ &amp; 10 in total were identified as TLs and measured at baseline, selected based on size (those with the longest diameter [LD]) and measurability; a sum of LDs for all TLs was calculated and reported as baseline sum LD, which was used to characterize objective tumor response (OR), OR being defined as either complete response (CR) and/or partial response (PR) post MAGE-A3 ASCI treatment. After identification, MLs and TLs were assessed as regards CR and PR definitions per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria: CR = Disappearance of all extranodal target lesions. All pathological lymph nodes must have decreased to &lt;10 mm in short axis; PR = At least a 30% decrease in the SLD of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</description>

    <measure>Duration of Stable Disease (SD) Response to MAGE-A3 ASCI Study Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>During the entire study, up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment was done based on a set of MLs identified at baseline as TLs and NTLs followed up until disease progression. Stable disease was defined as follows: 1) In case of target lesions (TL) greater than or equal to (≥) 20 mm: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for Partial Response nor sufficient increase to qualify for Progressive Disease, taking as references the sum of Longest Diameter (LD) of TL recorded previously but not necessarily at baseline; 2) In case of TL both less than 20 mm and ≥ 20 mm: Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify as a PR nor sufficient increase to qualify as PD, taking as references the smallest sum LD since the start of the treatment. The minimal time interval required between 2 measurements for determination of SD was at least 12 weeks.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Patients With Mixed Response (MxR) to MAGE-A3 ASCI Study Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>During the entire study, up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment was done based on a set of MLs identified at baseline as TLs and NTLs followed up until disease progression. MLs were assessed as regards matching below MxR definitions. In case of evaluability per RECIST: a) MxR Type 1= at least (a.l.) 30% decrease in LD in a.l. one TL measured at baseline. Such response occurring in SD/PD status of LD of TL and without appearance of one or more new lesions = SD/PD with TL regression; b) MxR Type 2: appearance of one or more new lesions occurring in SD/PR status of LD of TL, and = SD/PR with new lesion. In case of non-evaluability per RECIST: a) MxR Type 1 = a clear decrease in diameters occurring in a.l. one TL measured at baseline. Such response occurring in SD/PD status of LD of (baseline) TL and without appearance of one or more new lesions = SD/PD with TL regression; b) MxR Type 2 = appearance of one or more new lesions occurring in SD/PR status of LD of TL = SD/PR with new lesion.</description>

    <measure>Progression-free Survival (PFS) for the Overall Population</measure>
    <time_frame>During the entire study, up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined and calculated as the time from first treatment to either the first progression of the disease or the date of death, whichever occurred first. In case a patient went off protocol treatment, the date of first documented progression (if applicable) was to be used as date of progression. Patients still alive with no evidence of disease progression at the time of their last visit or for whom date of first documented progression was not applicable, were censored at the time of the last examination. PFS analysis was performed using the non-parametric Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female patient with histologically proven, measurable metastatic cutaneous
             melanoma

          2. Written informed consent has been obtained from the patient before the performance of
             any protocol-specific procedure.

          3. Patient is &gt;= 18 years of age at the time of signature of the Informed Consent.

          4. The patient's tumor shows expression of MAGE-A3 antigen, detected by
             Reverse-Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR).

          5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.

          6. The patient has normal organ functions.

          7. If the patient is female, she must be of non-childbearing potential, or, if she is of
             childbearing potential, she must practice adequate contraception for 30 days prior to
             administration of study treatment, have a negative pregnancy test and continue such
             precautions during all the study treatment period and for 2 months after completion of
             the treatment administration series.

          8. In the view of the investigator, the patient can and will comply with the requirements
             of the protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient has at any time received systemic (bio)-chemotherapy.

          2. The patient is scheduled to receive any other anticancer treatments than those
             specified in the protocol, including but not limited to (bio)-chemotherapy,
             immunomodulating agents and radiotherapy.

          3. The patient requires concomitant treatment with systemic corticosteroids, or any other
             immunosuppressive agents.

          4. The patient received any cancer immunotherapeutic containing a MAGE-A3 antigen or any
             cancer immunotherapeutic for his/her metastatic disease.

          5. The patient has received any investigational or non-registered drug or vaccine other
             than the study medication within the 30 days preceding the first dose of study
             treatment, or plans to receive such a drug during the study period.

          6. The patient has (or has had) previous or concomitant malignancies at other sites,
             except effectively treated malignancy that is considered by the investigator highly
             likely to have been cured.

          7. History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of
             the study investigational product.

          8. The patient has an autoimmune disease such as, but not limited to, multiple sclerosis,
             lupus, and inflammatory bowel disease. Patients with vitiligo are not excluded.

          9. The patient has a family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency.

         10. The patient is known to be positive for the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).

        <description>Serious adverse events (SAEs) assessed include medical occurrences that result in death, are life threatening, require hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization or result in disability/incapacity. Events which were part of the natural course of the disease under study (i.e., disease progression, recurrence) were captured as part of the clinical activity outcome variables in this study; therefore these did not need to be reported as SAEs. Progression/recurrence of the tumor in a patient was recorded as part of the clinical assessment data collection, and deaths due to progressive disease was recorded on a specific form, but not as an SAE. However, if the investigator considered that there was a causal relationship between treatment or protocol design/procedures and the disease progression/recurrence, then the event was reported as an SAE. Any new primary cancer (non-related to the cancer under study) was reported as an SAE.</description>

        <description>Response assessment was done based on a set of measurable lesions (MLs) identified at baseline as target lesions (TLs), and followed up until disease progression. Up to 5 MLs per organ &amp; 10 in total were identified as TLs and measured at baseline, selected based on size (those with the longest diameter [LD]) and measurability; a sum of LDs for all TLs was calculated and reported as baseline sum LD, which was used to characterize objective tumor response (OR), OR being defined as either complete response (CR) and/or partial response (PR) post MAGE-A3 ASCI treatment. After identification, MLs and TLs were assessed as regards CR and PR definitions per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria: CR = Disappearance of all extranodal target lesions. All pathological lymph nodes must have decreased to &lt;10 mm in short axis; PR = At least a 30% decrease in the SLD of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</description>

Such response occurring in SD/PD status of LD of TL and without appearance of one or more new lesions = SD/PD with TL regression; b) MxR Type 2: appearance of one or more new lesions occurring in SD/PR status of LD of TL, and = SD/PR with new lesion. In case of non-evaluability per RECIST: a) MxR Type 1 = a clear decrease in diameters occurring in a.l. one TL measured at baseline. Such response occurring in SD/PD status of LD of (baseline) TL and without appearance of one or more new lesions = SD/PD with TL regression; b) MxR Type 2 = appearance of one or more new lesions occurring in SD/PR status of LD of TL = SD/PR with new lesion.</description>
