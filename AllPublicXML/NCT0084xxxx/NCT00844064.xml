    <textblock>
      In this national Phase I dose-escalation study the safety and tolerability of AP 12009 is
      evaluated in adult patients with advanced tumors known to overproduce TGF-β2, who are not or
      no longer amenable to established therapies.

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this dose-finding study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AP
      12009. Two fixed dose-escalation schemes with predefined steps and increasing increments have
      been selected to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) as well as the dose-limiting
      toxicity (DLT). At least two cycles of AP 12009 are administered intravenously in adult
      patients with no further acknowledged treatment options.

      AP 12009 (trabedersen) is a phosphorothioate antisense oligodeoxynucleotide specific for the
      mRNA of human Transforming Growth Factor beta 2 (TGF-beta-2). The growth factor TGF-beta
      plays a key role in malignant progression of various tumors by inducing proliferation,
      invasion, metastasis, angiogenesis, and escape from immunosurveillance. In patients with
      pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer, and metastatic melanoma the TGF-beta-2 overexpression
      is associated with disease stage, clinical prognosis, and the immunodeficient state of the
      patients.
