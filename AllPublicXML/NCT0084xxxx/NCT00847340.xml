  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HPV infection has been recognized as the most prevalent sexual transmitted infection
      worldwide. Burden of many HPV related diseases is well known particularly regarding the
      different associated cancers (cervical, anal, vaginal, vulvar, oro-pharyngeal) (3) ; however,
      there is much less available information on the general burden of genital warts, the
      associated HPV types, the costs of related medical treatments and the knowledge and
      perceptions towards the disease and its prevention.

      Objectives:

        1. To determine the HPV genotypes distribution in genital warts in the study population.

        2. To assess the knowledge about transmission &amp; prevention of HPV infection related
           diseases

        3. To determine the direct medical costs of genital warts attention.

      Study population

      Female and male between 18 - 45 years of age living in Bogota, Colombia

      Sample frame

      Patients attending to gynecologic or STD consult in a mayor out patient clinic in Bogot치
      (PROFAMILIA)

      Analysis

      Analysis of the information will be exhaustive. We will calculate prevalence of HPV genotypes
      in the GW in both sexes separately. Analyses of the survey will include simple frequencies,
      percentages, and comparison of results related to HPV knowledge with sociodemographic and
      clinical information. Explorative analysis using parametric or non parametric statistics of
      the items included in the questionnaire and clinical forms will be done as appropriate. We
      will calculate the medical cost of patients enrolled in the study. The treatment protocols
      used for this protocol will reflect the current clinical practice accepted for the treatment
      of genital warts. We will use national reference cost list (SOAT) to determine the cost of
      procedures included.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age between 18-45 years.

          -  Lesions suspicious of being HPV related.

          -  The main manifestations of anogenital warts include:

               -  Cauliflower-like condylomata acuminata lesions that usually involve moist
                  surfaces

               -  keratotic and smooth papular warts, usually on dry surfaces

               -  subclinical &quot;flat&quot; warts, that can be found on any mucosal or cutaneous surface
                  and, which are probably overseen in the majority of cases.

          -  Lesions other than the described above, are not to be biopsied, according to the
             investigator criteria.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Not willing to participate

          -  To be a participant in any HPV vaccine clinical trial study

          -  Known immune suppressive disease.
