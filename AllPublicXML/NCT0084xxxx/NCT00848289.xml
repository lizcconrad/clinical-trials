  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical research study will identify biologic and lifestyle factors which increase a
      person's risk of developing specific cancer. Researchers propose to conduct a case-control
      study examining interindividual differences in susceptibility to tobacco carcinogenesis as
      predictors of bladder cancer risk. We will measure susceptibility to tobacco carcinogenesis
      and this will include studies of the genetic modulation of carcinogen activation and
      detoxification and of chromosome sensitivity to tobacco mutagens.
