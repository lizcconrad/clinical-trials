        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who the investigator believes that they can and will comply with the
             requirements of the protocol should be enrolled in the study

          -  A subject previously enrolled in the primary study (NCT00122681), who received the
             active control hepatitis A vaccine, and who cannot receive commercially available
             HPV-16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine because the vaccine has not yet been granted licensure
             in the subject's country or because the subject is above the age for which the vaccine
             is licensed.

          -  Written informed consent must be obtained from the subject prior to enrolment.

          -  A woman aged 26 years or older at the time of the first vaccination in this study.

          -  Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination before
             entering into the study.

          -  Subjects must not be pregnant. Absence of pregnancy should be verified with a urine
             pregnancy test.

          -  Subject must be of non-childbearing potential, or if she is of childbearing potential,
             she must practice adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, have a

             the vaccination series.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             discontinue contraceptive prevention during the study period and up to two months
             after the last vaccine dose.

          -  Use of any investigational or non-registered product (drug or vaccine) other than the
             study vaccine within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or planned use
             during the study period and the extended safety follow-up period.

          -  Concurrently participating in another clinical study at any time during the study
             period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or
             non-investigational product (pharmaceutical product or device).

          -  Previous vaccination against HPV or planned administration of another HPV vaccine
             during the study other than that foreseen by protocol.

          -  Planned administration/ administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol
             within 30 days (i.e. Day 0-29) of each dose of vaccine. Administration of routine
             meningococcal, hepatitis B, hepatitis A, inactivated influenza, diphtheria/tetanus
             and/or diphtheria/tetanus-containing vaccine up to 8 days before each dose of study
             vaccine is allowed. Enrolment will be deferred until the subject is outside of
             specified window.

          -  Previous administration of components of the investigational vaccine.

          -  History of allergic disease, suspected allergy or reactions likely to be exacerbated
             by any component of the study vaccine.

          -  Hypersensitivity to latex.

          -  Acute or chronic, clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, neurologic,
             haematological, hepatic or renal functional abnormality, as determined by previous
             physical examination or laboratory tests, which in the opinion of the investigator
             precludes administration of the study vaccine.

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on
             medical history and physical examination.

          -  Cancer or autoimmune disease under treatment.

          -  Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immunosuppressants or other
