      This is a pilot study to investigate the safety and efficacy of intravitreally administered
      ranibizumab (Lucentis) compared to steroid injection for the treatment of macular edema due
      to chronic non-infectious uveitis. There is currently no FDA-approved therapy for this
      condition, however intravitreal injection of corticosteroids, in conjunction with oral
      steroids and/or immunomodulatory drug agents, has become the mainstay of therapy. Ranibizumab
      is a recombinant monoclonal antibody antigen-binding fragment that neutralizes the active
      forms of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which is believed to contribute to the
      etiology of inflammation and neovascularization. Ranibizumab is FDA-approved for the
      treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration.

      This is a proof of concept study to assess the safety and potential efficacy of ranibizumab
      in this patient population. Since it is common clinical practice to perform regional
      periocular injections of steroids in patients with uveitic macular edema, only patients who
      are refractory to periocular steroids will be enrolled in the study. The 0.5 mg dose of
      ranibizumab will be given intravitreally since this dose and route has been found to be safe
      and efficacious in prior studies. A dosing regimen has not been established for ranibizumab
      in patients with uveitis, so patients will be assessed and treated monthly as needed.
      Triamcinolone 4mg intravitreal injection will be the steroid treatment, and patients will
      also be assessed monthly and retreated every three months as needed.
