      Background: The occurrence of medical errors and their deleterious effects on quality of care
      delivered are widely recognized phenomena in healthcare today. This has spurned an aggressive
      nationwide campaign to improve the quality of care all hospitals throughout the country.
      Currently, there are numerous reports of quality improvement initiatives across medical
      centers in the United States. However, a review of the literature failed to identify any
      publications regarding targeted resident/housestaff involvement in hospital quality
      improvement and safety related activities.

      Purpose: To investigate and track housestaff attitudes on patient care, patient safety,
      communication and overall quality within the institution.

      Objective: To investigate, analyze and publish the results of this prospective study. The
      information obtained will help us and others understand whether proactive attempts to change
      housestaff culture can indeed change attitudes towards the better with regards to patient
      care and safety. It is assumed that improved attitudes ultimately translates into improved
      care and safety.

      Methods: Each residency coordinator in each clinical department will be asked to distribute a
      survey, which has already been validated for this type of investigation, to each resident in
      the respective program (see attachment).

      The Vice-President of Medical Affairs will provide a cover letter to help with the process.
      After a week, a reminder will be distributed by the coordinators to each resident asking them
      to fill out the survey. The surveys will be filled out anonymously. However, each participant
      will be asked to note their sex, department and year of postgraduate training. This process
      will be repeated every eight months until June of 2010. The Housestaff Quality council (HQC)
      has already distributed and collected this survey. The results of those surveys will be used
      in a retrospective part of this study. The results of (HQC) survey will be used to establish
      a baseline of the housestaff attitudes at the New York Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Cornell.

      Data will be stored on a password protected computer. The Institutional Review Board (IRB),
      Office of Human Research Protection and Food and Drug Administration and all appropriate
      federal oversight agencies may have access to those files.
