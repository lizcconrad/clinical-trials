  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intimate partner violence is a significant societal problem. However, treatment of IPV
      perpetrators is far from effective, which may be partly due to the fact that the role of
      substance abuse is not taken into account. There is considerable evidence that a strong
      relationship between the use of alcohol and other drugs and intimate partner violence exists.
      Besides, a few studies indicate that reducing substance use may have a positive impact on
      IPV. Therefore, in this study, perpetrators of intimate partner violence with substance use
      disorders enrolled in domestic violence treatment will be randomly assigned to either
      standard treatment for offenders of domestic violence or a combination of the latter
      treatment with cognitive-behavioral therapy addressing substance abuse (combined treatment).
