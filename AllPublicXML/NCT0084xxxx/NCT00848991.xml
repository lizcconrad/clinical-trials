      Primary Hypothesis: The use of a Precedex infusion, in addition to propofol during surgery,
      will improve patient management through the anesthesia postoperative recovery period
      determined by improvement in patients? tolerance of the endotracheal tube.

      Secondary hypothesis: The use of a Precedex infusion, in addition to propofol during surgery
      will provide improved hemodynamic stability.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the addition of Precedex to a propofol intravenous
      anesthetic for emergence from anesthesia in patients having craniotomy surgery for brain
      tumors.

    <description>In the operating room routine anesthesia monitors will be placed and vital signs will be recorded continuously using data collection software. A routine propofol anesthetic will be administered to subjects randomized to the control group or a Precedex infusion with propofol for subjects randomized to the treatment group. Precedex infusion will be started after induction of general anesthesia. Vital signs (SBP, DBP, MAP) will be recorded continuously throughout the surgery. At the end of the case subjects will be extubated and the blinded observer will assess emergence from anesthesia based on hemodynamic stability and tolerance of the endotracheal tube. Videotaping of emergence will be used to assist in the evaluation of emergence of anesthesia and extubation.</description>

    <description>Subjects randomized to the comparison group will receive a standardized general anesthetic. Anesthesia will be induced with propofol 1.5 ? 2.5 mg/kg, rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg, and sufentanil 0.1 ? 1mcg/kg. Anesthesia will be maintained with an infusion with propofol 25 -200 mcg/kg/min, sufentanil 0.0025 - 0.03 mcg/kg/min, and zemuron as needed. For the Precedex group the drug will be infused at 0.3-0.7 mcg/kg/hr. Blood pressure will be maintained within 10% of baseline prior to opening of the dura, subsequently to be maintained between a systolic of 100 ? 130 mmHg. Hypertension will be managed with standardized amounts of labetalol and nicardipine. Morphine will be titrated as needed to a maximum of 0.05mcg/kg at the conclusion of case. Hemodynamic data and emergence evaluations will be collected in the operating room, pre-induction until the end of anesthesia and discharge from the operating room. There will be no further follow up.</description>
