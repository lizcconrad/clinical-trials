      The aim is to document viral etiologies of isolated fevers and inlfuenza-like syndromes
      during summertime in South of France in order to better understand the role of known
      vector-borne viruses such as Toscana virus, West Nile virus during seasonal activity of the
      arthropod vector. In each of the four cities, a network of general practitioners will be
      associated in the project to recruit patients who are not hospitalized. The combined
      involvement of infectious disease specialists and general practitioner will augment the range
      of patients (mild disease and sever cases) in the study.
