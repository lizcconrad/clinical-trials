  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety of performing fractional flow reserve (FFR)
      of the myocardium without using anticoagulation by performing a retrospective review of 100
      consecutive patients who have undergone this procedure during diagnostic catheterization.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An experienced interventional cardiologist can perform FFR in a brief period of time. This
      procedure can safely be performed without anticoagulation, thereby lowering the associated
      procedural risks by avoiding the bleeding and groin complications that may occur with
      anticoagulation. Performing FFR without anticoagulation may also decrease facility costs as
      femoral artery closure can be performed using standard protocols for a diagnostic procedure,
      instead of standard protocols for an interventional procedure when a patient has been
      anticoagulated. Performing FFR without anticoagulation does not increase risk of injury to
      the coronary artery or thrombus in the coronary artery.
