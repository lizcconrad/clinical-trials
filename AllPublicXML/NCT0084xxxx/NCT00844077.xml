  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Barrett's esophagus can progress to esophageal cancer, but it doesn't always. Current
      treatment is frequent surveillance via upper endoscopy with multiple biopsies to look for
      changes (dysplasia). Pathologists vary dramatically in their interpretation of Barrett's
      Metaplasia versus dysplasia and consensus is very difficult to achieve. The investigators
      propose a longitudinal study of subjects with confirmed Barrett's intestinal metaplasia
      without dysplasia to look for predictive factors for transformation to dysplasia or cancer.
      Potential biomarkers can be found in serum, plasma, urine, frozen or fixed Barrett's and
      Normal esophageal mucosa. In addition, the investigators are testing a brushing technique
      from CDx, Inc. for predictive factors. Subjects must have pathologically confirmed Barrett's
      intestinal metaplasia without history of dysplasia to be on this longitudinal study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults (&gt; 18 years old)

          -  Subjects with pathologically confirmed Barrett's esophagus, including:

          -  Intestinal metaplasia without dysplasia, long and short segments (&gt;1 cm)

          -  Intestinal metaplasia without dysplasia, long and short segments (&gt;1 cm), previously
             in GLNE 003

          -  Subjects with a pathologically confirmed history of Barrett's, HGD or EAC

          -  Subjects with pathologically confirmed history of Barrett's LGD within the last 12
             months.

          -  Subjects in whom esophageal biopsy would be contraindicated (eq. varices)

          -  Subjects with serious infections requiring IV antibiotics
