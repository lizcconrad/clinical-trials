    <textblock>
      The study group of Adults with ADHD who will receive cognitive (executive attention)
      computerized training will show significant improvement in ADHD
      symptomatology,neuropsychological measures,daily functioning and quality of life.

      A significant difference will be found between the study group and the control group (adults
      with ADHD that will receive a simplified cognitive training program that does not challenge
      their executive functions)on the above measures.
