      In this study, 26 patients were selected and included for full-face photodynamic therapy
      sessions. All patients presented signs of photoaging skin and multiple actinic keratosis.
      Photographs and Biopsies were taken before and after the procedure. Clinical and histological
      aspects as well as immunohistochemical aspects regarding neocollagen induction and tumor
      expression were evaluated.
