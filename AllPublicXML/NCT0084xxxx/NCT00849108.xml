    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to get more information on using BMS747158 (the study
      drug),a drug with small amounts of radioactivity to allow for heart imaging, during a PET
      scan which can then be compared to other images such as SPECT. The safety and quality of
      images will be studied.

      The primary objectives of this study are:

        -  To acquire data for the development of one-day rest/stress cardiac PET perfusion imaging
           protocols for BMS747158 with comparable diagnostic image quality to a two-day
           rest/stress PET protocol

        -  To assess the safety of multiple doses of BMS747158

      The secondary objectives of this study are:

        -  To assess PET imaging parameters and image quality following administration of BMS747158
           at rest and at stress (pharmacologic or exercise) same day (at different time intervals)
           and 16-48 hours after the rest injection

        -  To assess feasibility of gated cardiac PET imaging with BMS747158 for left ventricular
           function assessment

        -  To assess agreement of one and two day rest/stress PET imaging with BMS747158 in
           patients with reversible ischemia with rest/stress single photon emission computed
           tomography (SPECT) imaging

        -  To perform a preliminary assessment of the diagnostic accuracy of one-day and two-day
           rest/stress PET perfusion imaging with BMS747158 as compared with invasive coronary
           angiography or computed tomography angiography (CTA) for detection of

    <measure>Cohort 1: Determination of Rest Dose: Dose Acquistion Time Product</measure>
    <time_frame>Dosing visit</time_frame>
    <description>The rest flurpiridaz dose to be used for subsequent efficacy studies was determined by a modeling method that simulated a range of injected doses using a single fixed injected dose at rest in each subject and a range of acquisition durations. From this, a dose acquisition time product (DATP was determined for each subject that specified the minimal dose for a given acquisition duration that yielded an image in that subject that was negligibly affected by photon counting statistics. Descriptive statistics were used to identify an appropriate rest dose for the population. No other statistical tests were performed</description>

    <time_frame>Dosing visit</time_frame>
    <description>Diagnostic efficacy of one-day rest/stress BMS747158 PET MPI is measured by sensitivity as compared to single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)MPI in the detection of coronary artery disease (CAD)using angiography or three-month cardiac events as the truth standard.</description>

    <measure>Cohort 1: Determination of Ratio of Stress Dose to Rest Dose</measure>
    <time_frame>Dosing visit</time_frame>
    <description>The stress flurpiridaz dose for subsequent same-day rest-stress efficacy studies was determined as a multiple of the rest dose by computer modeling. Images derived only from rest flurpiridaz administration were blended using image analysis with images derived only from administration of flurpiridaz following exercise or adenosine stress. The blending fraction that resulted in negligible change in reader interpretation of defect severity was determined for each subject. The minimum value that met this criterion for all subjects was used to calculate the ratio of the stress dose to the rest dose as a function of the delay between administration of the two doses for both adenosine stress and exercise stress separately. No statistical analysis was performed.</description>

        <title>Cohort 1: Determination of Ratio of Stress Dose to Rest Dose</title>
        <description>The stress flurpiridaz dose for subsequent same-day rest-stress efficacy studies was determined as a multiple of the rest dose by computer modeling. Images derived only from rest flurpiridaz administration were blended using image analysis with images derived only from administration of flurpiridaz following exercise or adenosine stress. The blending fraction that resulted in negligible change in reader interpretation of defect severity was determined for each subject. The minimum value that met this criterion for all subjects was used to calculate the ratio of the stress dose to the rest dose as a function of the delay between administration of the two doses for both adenosine stress and exercise stress separately. No statistical analysis was performed.</description>
