  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Conivaptan, a vasopressin
      antagonist, in the treatment of hyponatremic subjects having symptomatic acute decompensated
      heart failure (ADHF).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be recruited from the Emergency Department. It is expected that subjects will
      be treated according to the institution's accepted conventional therapy protocol for the
      treatment of ADHF. Therapy may also include the use of loop diuretics for the relief of
      pulmonary congestion and maintenance of adequate urine output.

    <description>Dyspnea is defined as the sensation of uncomfortable or difficult breathing.
Changes in Dyspnea were assessed using the following 7-point Likert scale:

    <description>Dyspnea is defined as the sensation of uncomfortable or difficult breathing.
The Provocative Dyspnea Assessment assesses dyspnea and changes in dyspnea from Baseline on a 5-point Likert scale at 5 different positions and assigns a Dyspnea Severity Score that ranges from 1 (worst severity) to 25 (least severity).
