  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of the study is a comparison of serum and plasma concentration of VEGF (Vascular
      Endothelial Growth Factor), HGF (Hepatocyte Growth Factor) and PDGF (Platelet Derived Growth
      Factor) with markers of myocardial injury as troponin I, hsCRP, CK-MB and NT-proBNP assessed
      in patients with first episode of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in their lives and the
      estimation of assumed value of VEGF, HGF and PDGF in prognosis of cardiovascular
      complications at 3 months follow up especially with respect to myocardial infarction (MI),
      exacerbation of angina, reintervention (PTCA,CABG), symptoms of heart failure, stroke,
      rehospitalization due to cardiovascular reasons and death. The dynamics of changes in serum
      and plasma concentration of growth factors in comparison with values of myocardial injury
      markers will be checked. For the realization of the purpose of the study biochemical
      measurements will be performed twice i.e. just after admission to hospital and 24h later.
      Area of a myocardial injury will be estimated by echocardiography examination.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the recent years several biomarkers have been investigated to be used for diagnostic and
      risk stratification in patients with symptoms of acute coronary syndrome. Troponins are
      preferred markers for myocardial injury due to its high specificity and sensitivity what
      makes them superior than traditional cardiac enzymes as CK or CK-MB. Elevated level of
      NT-proBNP is a marker of heart failure strongly associated with increased mortality rate.
      This study is invented for searching new sensitive indicators of myocardial injury and
      predictors of bad outcome in patients with symptoms of ACS especially useful in difficult
      diagnostic and therapeutic situations.

      The study is performed in patients with first episode of ACS in their life who are eligible
      for coronary angiography and eventually for PCI. All subjects who agree to participate in the
      study are informed of its nature and purpose. Patients, only due to the symptoms and
      according to ESC guidelines are referred for coronary angiography, primary PCI, surgery
      revascularisation and pharmacological treatment. Inclusion into the study does not influence
      on the type of the treatment. The measurements of VEGF, HGF, PDGF, troponin I, hsCRP, CK-MB
      and NT-proBNP are assessed twice i.e. as soon as possible after admission to hospital and 24h
      after the first measurements. For estimation of changes in concentration of growth factors in
      time in some patients the multiple assessments will be performed (9 measurements during first
      24h and 1 before discharge from hospital). In healthy volunteers (10 to 20 subjects) one,
      control measurement of HGF will be performed. Three days after ACS symptoms appeared, left
      ventricular function is determined by echocardiography. Scheduled control visits are
      performed after 3 months follow up. The demographic and clinical data, duration of chest
      pain, results of 12 leads ECG, angiographic findings, haemodynamic description of cardiac
      function (parameters from echocardiography and ventriculography), type of invasive
      revascularisation and results of performed measurements and examinations will undergo single
      and multivariable statistical analysis. Additionally, according to a few clinical and
      angiographic findings for statistic analysis will be specified either:

      subgroup of patients with &quot;major myocardial injury&quot; which will comprise patients with
      anterior or antero-lateral myocardial infarction (MI) with occlusion or significant left
      anterior descending (LAD) branch stenosis and/or multivessel disease,

      subgroup of patients with &quot;moderate myocardial injury&quot; which will consist of patients with
      inferior and/or posterior MI and with singlevessel disease but not LAD,

      subgroup of patients with &quot;minor myocardial injury&quot; which will include patients with NSTE-ACS
      (Non-ST-Segment Elevation ACS) and without a significant increase of myocardial injury
      markers.
