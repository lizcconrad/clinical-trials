  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to adapt a computerized Screening and Brief Advice (SBA) protocol
      that has demonstrated efficacy in reducing underage drinking among adolescent primary care
      patients and then to test it in a multi-site randomized controlled trial (RCT).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The specific aims of the proposed multisite RCT are:

        1. To establish the efficacy of the computerized SBA protocol on alcohol use, on DWI/RWID,
           and other alcohol-related health risk behaviors;

        2. To test the effect of Technological Extenders (TE) on prolonging the beneficial effects
           of the SBA protocol;

        3. To identify moderators, mediators, and optimal responders to the SBA/TE interventions;

        4. To examine the association between cessation of underage drinking and other health-risk
           behaviors in an adolescent primary care sample.
