    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this randomized clinical trial (RCT) is to test the efficacy of a
      culturally- and literacy-tailored cognitive-behavioral intervention designed to enhance
      adherence to diabetes self-management behaviors and improve glycemic control among low-income
      Hispanic individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

    <textblock>
      Patients are randomly assigned to a Usual Care condition or to the Cognitive Behavioral
      Intervention condition. The unit of randomization and analysis is the patient. The
      intervention is implemented by a nutritionist, a nurse diabetes educator and an assistant,
      and patients are encouraged to bring a family member or friend living in the same household
      to facilitate home-based support for the intervention. The intervention emphasizes patients'
      ethnic preferences and traditions (e.g., adapting ethnic recipes to meet dietary goals) and
      the use of available community resources (e.g., available areas for exercise), and is
      delivered utilizing strategies and materials appropriate for low-literate/illiterate pts.
