      RATIONALE: Placing the gene for interleukin-12 into breast cancer cells may help the body
      build an immune response to kill tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of gene therapy in
      treating women with metastatic breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of intratumoral injection of
           adenovirus-mediated human interleukin-12 gene in women with metastatic breast cancer.

        -  Determine the tumor response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the immune response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive a single dose of adenovirus-mediated human interleukin-12
      intratumorally via percutaneous needle placement under ultrasound guidance.

      Blood and tumor tissue samples are collected periodically for immunological laboratory
      studies. Samples are analyzed for serum cytokine levels by ELISA; qualitative analysis of
      immune biomarkers by IHC staining; and immune cell biomarker analysis by FACS.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.
