    <textblock>
      Depression in cardiac patients is common, persistent, and deadly. However, the vast majority
      of cardiac patients with depression go unrecognized and untreated, despite the existence of
      treatments that clearly improve depressive symptoms and may favorably impact survival. Our
      research group and others have found that depression recognition and treatment appears
      particularly limited among patients with acute cardiac illness, though this population may be
      the most vulnerable to the deleterious effects of depression. We propose a project, building
      on successful collaborative care depression management programs in outpatient settings, to
      address this important issue.

      The specific hypotheses behind the proposed research are that a collaborative care depression
      management program can be successfully adapted to inpatient cardiac units, and that such a
      program will lead to greater rates of adequate depression treatment and improvements in
      secondary outcomes.

      The following specific aims capture the stepwise goals of this program:

        1. To determine whether a collaborative care depression management program ('Enhanced
           Care') leads to significantly increased rates of adequate depression treatment compared
           to usual care (screening and feedback) (Primary Aim).

        2. To assess whether this Enhanced Care program has a lasting impact on adequate depression
           treatment, depressive symptoms, health-related quality of life, and adherence to medical
           recommendations at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months, compared to usual care.

    <time_frame>5 days after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Adequate treatment was defined a priori as either: (1) discharge prescription of an antidepressant at a clinically effective dose based on manufacturers' package labeling and treatment guidelines for the treatment of depression or (2) referral to a mental health treatment provider for psychotherapy (unless pre-planned as less than six sessions).
Timeframe of &quot;5 days after enrollment&quot; was determined by calculating the median length of hospitalization for all subjects.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Depression Symptoms From Baseline to 6 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Depression symptoms measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). The PHQ-9 is a 9-item scale that measures depression severity. Each question asks how often the subject experiences symptoms of depression and offers four answers: 0 = Not at all, 1 = Several days, 2 = More than half the days, 3 = Nearly every day. Scores are totaled and range from 0-27. To be considered depressed, subjects had to (a) have a total score of 10 or more, (b) answer five questions with a score of 2 or 3, and (c) one of the five questions had to be question 1 or question 2 (or both). Anyone who did not meet these criteria were not considered depressed.</description>

          <description>The SF-12 Mental Component Score is a 6-item scale that assesses mental health-related quality of life. Each question provides the option of 2-6 answers. Some questions are Yes/No (2 options), while others ask how often something occurs (6 options, etc.). Scores are calculated using a formula and can range from 0 to 100. A score of 50 indicates average mental health-related quality of life. Higher scores represent higher than average mental health-related quality of life, and lower scores represent lower mental health-related quality of life.</description>

          <title>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale—Anxiety Subscale (HADS-A)</title>
          <description>The HADS-A is a 7-item scale used to measure anxiety severity. Each question asks about a specific symptom of anxiety and offers four answers: 0 = Never / Not at all, 1 = A little / Time to time, 2 = Quite often / Usually, 3 = Most of the time / Very often. Scores are totaled and range from 0-21. A higher score means more anxiety.</description>

          <description>The MGH CPFQ is a 7-item scale that assesses cognitive and executive function in mood and anxiety disorders. The MGH CPFQ asks about patients' abilities in different areas of cognition and executive function. Each question includes the following response options: 1 = greater than normal ability, 2 = normal ability, 3 = minimally diminished ability, 4 = moderately diminished ability, 5 = markedly diminished ability, 6 = totally absent ability. Scores are added and range from 7 to 42. Higher scores mean lower functioning abilities.</description>

          <description>The WISE is a 10-item scale that assesses the number and severity of cardiac symptoms. Each question offers 4 responses: 0 = None (no symptom), 1 = Mild, 2 = Moderate, 3 = Severe.
The &quot;Severity&quot; score represents the severity of cardiac illness. It's derived by adding all scores together. The Severity score can range from 0-30. A lower score means less severity of symptoms.
The &quot;Number&quot; score represents the number of symptoms of cardiac illness. It's derived by counting the number of symptoms that scored 1 or more. The Number score can range from 0-10. A lower score means fewer symptoms.</description>

          <description>The SF-12 Physical Component Score is a 6-item scale that assesses physical health-related quality of life. Each question provides the option of 2-6 answers. Some questions are Yes/No (2 options), while others ask how often something occurs (6 options, etc.). Scores are calculated using a formula and can range from 0 to 100. A score of 50 indicates average physical health-related quality of life. Higher scores represent higher than average physical health-related quality of life, and lower scores represent lower physical health-related quality of life.</description>

Each question asks how often the subject experiences symptoms of depression and offers four answers: 0 = Not at all, 1 = Several days, 2 = More than half the days, 3 = Nearly every day. Scores are totaled and range from 0-27. To be considered depressed, subjects had to (a) have a total score of 10 or more, (b) answer five questions with a score of 2 or 3, and (c) one of the five questions had to be question 1 or question 2 (or both). Anyone who did not meet these criteria were not considered depressed.</description>
