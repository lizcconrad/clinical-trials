  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, large oral doses of phosphate and 1,25(OH)2D (calcitriol) are the standard
      treatment of patients with familial hypophosphatemic rickets (XLH). While this therapy is
      effective in healing the rickets, it is often limited by development of complications due to
      the high dose of medications required to achieve cure. Among them are the development of
      calcifications in the kidneys and secondary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) which in some patients
      may cause complications like high blood calcium level, high blood pressure and damage to the
      kidney. A drug to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism was just developed. In a short term
      study we found that it might help the treatment of XLH, by allowing the use of lower doses of
      the both phosphate and calcitriol. In the present study we will learn if indeed the addition
      of this new medicine (Cinacalcet) to the long-term treatment will allow the use of lower
      doses of both phosphate and calcitriol and consequently lower the risk of complications.
