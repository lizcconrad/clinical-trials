  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare groin complication rates in low and high risk
      patients post percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) closed by either a 6 French Perclose
      vascular closure device (VCD) or manual compression.

      It is commonly accepted that that there exists a learning curve in performing successful
      groin closure with Vascular Closure Devices (VCD). Manual compression continues to be
      'standard of care' at most institutions for closure of 5 - 8 French femoral arteriotomies, as
      previous studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of vascular closure devices have failed
      to show a statistically significant decrease in groin complication rates when compared to
      manual compression. Importantly, no studies to date have been performed to specifically
      assess the potential decrease in vascular complication rates by highly experienced VCD
      operators, when their safety results are compared to manual compression. This retrospective,
      multi-center study will demonstrate a lower vascular complication rate in PCI patients post
      deployment of a 6 Fr Perclose VCD by a single, experienced operator, when compared to manual
      compression in two comparable, high volume, hospital cardiac catheterization laboratories.
