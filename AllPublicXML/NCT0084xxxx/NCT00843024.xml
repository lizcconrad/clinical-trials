  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the combination product, sumatriptan and
      naproxen sodium, is effective compared to placebo in the treatment of acute migraine in
      adolescent subjects 12-17 years old. Subjects will treat two migraine attacks over a ~25 week
      period.

Participants with pain-free response were considered as those who had a reduction in migraine headache pain from moderate (score=2) or severe (score=3) at baseline to none (score=0) post-treatment, without the use of rescue medication (additional medication taken by participants for the treatment of migraine pain or associated symptoms) prior to or at 2 hours post-dose.</description>
