    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare different forms of treatment for substance abuse.
      This study will involve a type of treatment called contingency management, in which patients
      receive incentives (prizes) for attending outpatient treatment. This study will compare
      contingency management to standard treatment that does not involve incentives. This study
      will also compare contingency management treatment that lasts 6 weeks to contingency
      management that lasts 12 weeks. Finally, this study will compare contingency management
      treatment delivered at the beginning of outpatient treatment to contingency management
      treatment delivered later during outpatient treatment. The investigators hypothesize that (1)
      a 12-week attendance-based contingency management intervention will improve retention and
      enhance drug abstinence versus standard treatment, (2) initial short-term exposure to
      attendance-based contingency management (in weeks 1-6 only) will improve substance abuse
      treatment outcomes compared to standard treatment alone, and (3) contingency management in
      weeks 7-12 will be particularly useful for those with sporadic attendance or continued drug
      use during initial stages of treatment.
