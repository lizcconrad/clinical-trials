  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two heparin brands have been in the market in Canada for several years. Heparin Leo from Leo
      Pharma and Hepalean from Organon. The former is standardized by B.P (British pharmacopeia)
      while the latter is standardized by U.S.P (United states pharmacopeia). Previous studies have
      shown Heparin Leo to have roughly a 10% less efficacy then Hepalean. It has also been
      demonstrated that more protamine is required to reverse Heparin Leo. It is the investigators'
      intention to study the post-operative effects of the two brands of heparin and whether one of
      the two causes less bleeding after bypass surgery.

      The study protocol attempts not to change the normal protocol for cardiac surgery too much.

      The two different brands of heparin-Heparin Leo (Leo pharma) and Hepalean (Organon) are
      randomized by the float perfusionist using the program research randomizer.A 50 ml syringe is
      loaded with heparin for the Anesthesiologist and labelled. A 20 ml syringe is loaded with
      heparin and thenn labelled. It is a double blinded trial with the surgeon and anesthetist not
      knowing which brand heparin is being used. All cases are isolated Coronary Artery Bypass
      Grafting (C.A.B.G) with no concomittant conditions. The following are the patients excluded
      from the trial

        1. RE-DO

        2. COMBINATION PROCEDURE

        3. VALVE REPAIR/REPLACEMENT

        4. IABP-PRE/INTRA//POST-OP

        5. CELL SAVER INTRA-OP

        6. ANEMIA (70 g/L)/BLEEDING DISORDER eg:Jehovah's witness,hemophilia etc.

        7. USE OF APROTININ

        8. SMALL ADULT &lt; 50 KG

        9. AORTIC SURGERY WITH/WITHOUT CIRC ARREST

       10. EMERGENT PATIENT WITH HEART FAILURE

      Heparin will be administered in the trial to elevate the A.C.T-Activated clotting time to 480
      s and above and the heparin level to 300u/Kg to intiate cardio-pulmonary bypass (C.P.B).
      Additional heparin will be given to maintain the above-mentioned levels.

      The following data will be studied

        -  BSA

        -  Height

        -  Weight

        -  Diagnosis

        -  Procedure

        -  Surgeon

        -  Anesthetist

      PTT

      ADDITIONS Packed cells Cryo Platelets Other blood product / factors

      Chest reopening Yes No The reason if yes Patient transfer date- Time

      Overall we are going to look at whether their is any impact on post-operative
      bleeding,hospital and ICU stay.
