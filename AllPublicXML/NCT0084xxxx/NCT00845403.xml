      This study aims to gain an understanding of the key components of the immune response to
      hepatitis B present in cord blood of HBV infected mothers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the development of an effective preventive HBV vaccine, the spread of HBV virus
      continue, particularly in Asia, where the majority of HBV infection is acquired at birth by
      vertical transmission from mother to baby. HBV vertical transmission has been hypothesized to
      cause immune tolerance to HBV and thus promoting the subsequent HBV chronicity. Such
      hypothesis has never been tested and nothing is known about HBV-specific adaptive immune
      response occurring before birth in baby born form HBV chronically infected mothers. This
      study aims to gain an understanding of the key components of the immune response to hepatitis
      B present in cord blood of HBV infected mothers. The characterization of the HBV immune
      response in utero will provide informations about the cause of HBV chronicity in Asian
      patients in the management of baby born from HBsAg+ mothers.

      Cord Blood of HBsAg+ mothers will be collected at delivery after seeking informed consent.
      Mononuclear cells (T cells and monocytes) will be isolated.Purified populations of T cells
      will be stimulated with different mixtures of HBV peptides covering HBV proteins and
      experiments of ELISPOT or intracellular cytokine staining will be carried out to detect the
      specificty of the responsive T cell population. In addition, T cells willbe stained with
      HLA-tetramers specific for different HBV epitopes to directly analyze the frequency and
      phenotype of HBV-specific CD8+Tcells present in cord blood.

        HBsAg+ mothers are the source of possible in utero infection.Thus, the cord blood collected
        from these mothers after delivery would provide information about the cause of HBV
        chronicity in Asian patients and about the management of baby born from HBsAg+ mothers.
