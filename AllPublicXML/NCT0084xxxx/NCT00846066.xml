      Objectives:

      To compare the addition of Hands on Training (HOT) to Web Based Training (WBT)on residents'
      skills, confidence, opinions and practice .

      Methods: Pediatric residents participated in WBT on preventive oral health. Then the WBT
      subjects were randomly assigned to receive HOT by a dentist, or WBT alone. All subjects were
      assessed on skills in the performance of an oral exam, by direct observation. Residents'
      confidence regarding oral health counseling, and their opinions about the importance of the
      incorporation of oral health into the well child visit, was measured by surveys utilizing a
      Likert scale. Residents' change in practice was assessed by a retrospective chart audit.

    <time_frame>3 months after Hands-on Training (HOT)</time_frame>
    <description>Skills were observed by pediatric dentists for each resident utilizing a six item checklist 3 months after the intervention (HOT) was completed.Each correct skill demonstrated was scored as 1 (16.67%) with a maximum of 6 representing 100%.The mean pecentage of correct skills were measured by direct observation by a pediatric dentist among the WBT alone and WBT+HOT groups</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Confidence at 4 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Confidence was measured by self-administered surveys regarding knowledge and practice of oral health. The surveys used a 4 point Likert scale (1=not confident, 4=very confident).The mean percent of change in the responses of &quot;very confident&quot; was compared between both groups. The percentage change equals {(mean score at 4 months-mean score at baseline)/ mean score at baseline} *100%</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Opinions Regarding Incorporating Oral Health Into a Well Child Visit at 4 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Opinions regarding incorporating oral health into a well child visit was measured by self administered surveys. The surveys used a 4 point Likert scale from 1 for (strongly disagree) to 4 for (strongly agree). Mean percentage change in the &quot;agree&quot; and &quot;strongly agree&quot; responses by the residents was compared between both groups. The percentage change equals {(mean score at 4 months-mean score at baseline)/ mean score at baseline} *100%</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Practice of Oral Health Based on Pre and Post Study Chart Audit at 6 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The mean percent change in the documentation of oral health components at a well child visit. This was done by an audit of a random selection of 5 charts of patients who came in for well child visits, completed by each resident at baseline and at 6 months later.We scored this utilizing a 4 item checklist each correct item was scored as 1 (25%), with a maximum of 4(100%). The percentage change used the following formula {(mean score at 6 months-mean score at baseline)/mean score at baseline}*100%</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Confidence at 4 Months</title>
        <description>Confidence was measured by self-administered surveys regarding knowledge and practice of oral health. The surveys used a 4 point Likert scale (1=not confident, 4=very confident).The mean percent of change in the responses of &quot;very confident&quot; was compared between both groups. The percentage change equals {(mean score at 4 months-mean score at baseline)/ mean score at baseline} *100%</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Opinions Regarding Incorporating Oral Health Into a Well Child Visit at 4 Months</title>
        <description>Opinions regarding incorporating oral health into a well child visit was measured by self administered surveys. The surveys used a 4 point Likert scale from 1 for (strongly disagree) to 4 for (strongly agree). Mean percentage change in the &quot;agree&quot; and &quot;strongly agree&quot; responses by the residents was compared between both groups. The percentage change equals {(mean score at 4 months-mean score at baseline)/ mean score at baseline} *100%</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Practice of Oral Health Based on Pre and Post Study Chart Audit at 6 Months</title>
        <description>The mean percent change in the documentation of oral health components at a well child visit. This was done by an audit of a random selection of 5 charts of patients who came in for well child visits, completed by each resident at baseline and at 6 months later.We scored this utilizing a 4 item checklist each correct item was scored as 1 (25%), with a maximum of 4(100%). The percentage change used the following formula {(mean score at 6 months-mean score at baseline)/mean score at baseline}*100%</description>
