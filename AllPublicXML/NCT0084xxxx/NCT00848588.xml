  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this pilot study is to design and conduct a survey of 9-1-1 call takers
      in the province of Ontario, Canada to better understand the factors associated with the
      successful identification of cardiac arrest (including victims with agonal breathing) over
      the phone. Specific objectives are:

        1. To conduct iterative semi-structured interviews to identify behavioural factors
           influencing identification of cardiac arrest by 9-1-1 call takers;

        2. To develop a survey instrument about behavioural factors influencing the ability of
           9-1-1 call takers to identify cardiac arrest based on a systematic review of the
           literature, the results of the semi-structured interviews, and theoretical constructs
           from the Theory of Planned Behaviour; and

        3. To conduct a survey among Ontario 9-1-1 call takers using the survey instrument, and to
           identify factors and strategies that might be targeted by Knowledge Translation
           interventions.
