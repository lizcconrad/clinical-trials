      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of 3D (3 dimensional)renal
      ultrasound to check kidney perfusion (to see if the kidney is receiving enough blood flow to
      function as it should) in premature and/or very low birth weight babies.

    <description>Fractional blood volume was determined as a way to measure kidney perfusion. Adequate perfusion indicates that the kidneys are working and might indicate if a baby was responding to a specific treatment or not.</description>
