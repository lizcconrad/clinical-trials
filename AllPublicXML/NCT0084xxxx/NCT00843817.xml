  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Serine proteases belonging to the elastase family are mainly responsible for lung tissue
      destruction as observed during cystic fibrosis. But anti-inflammatory therapies based on
      systemic or aerosolized protease-inhibitors administration, have not given the expected
      results until now. One reason would be the impaired access of therapeutic inhibitors to their
      molecular targets. It was recently shown that neutrophils actively secrete neutrophil
      extracellular traps (NETs) made of DNA that binds cationic proteases among other molecules.
      NETs together with DNA passively released from dead neutrophils contribute to the viscosity
      of CF expectorations which explains that rhDNase treatment fluidifies expectorations and
      improves the patient status. Preliminary experiments in our laboratory have shown that DNA
      degradation was associated with a significant increase of proteolytic activity in the sputum
      soluble fraction. However the efficacy of exogenous inhibitors is also improved in these
      conditions. Using the specific substrates and methodologies that we developed previously to
      measure cell-surface associated proteolytic activities, we will study the effects of DNase on
      the activity of individual proteases, their biodistribution in sputum and their regulation by
      potential therapeutic inhibitors. Enzymatic, immunochemical and microscopic (confocal and
      scanning) techniques will first be used for ex vivo studies on sputa freshly collected at the
      adult and paediatric CRCM in Tours, then on sputa from patients before and after
      administration of aerosolized rhDNase. We hypothesize that a better understanding of the
      biodistribution of neutrophil serine proteases and especially their binding to DNA will help
      designing new therapeutic strategies that facilitate inhibitor access to their protease
      targets.
