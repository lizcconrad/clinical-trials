      This study will evaluate the activity of single agent trastuzumab or lapatinib in patients
      not previously treated for HER-2 positive (FISH positive) metastatic breast cancer. A
      companion biological study will assess factors correlated with sensitivity or resistance to
      either one of the compounds

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women aged 18-75 years

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic disease.

          -  HER2-Overexpression proven by Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization (FISH).

          -  Availability of paraffin-embedded block of either primitive tumor and/or biopsy of
             metastases.

          -  No prior chemotherapy for metastatic or locally advanced disease. Patients with
             hormone receptor (oestrogen and/or progesterone) positive breast cancer can be
             eligible provided that they had received only ONE line of hormonal therapy for
             metastatic disease.

          -  For patients undergoing hormonal therapy for metastatic disease, disease progression
             must be confirmed according to RECIST criteria.

          -  At least 20% increase in the sum of longest diameters, OR

          -  Evidence of new metastatic lesions or progression of pre-existing non-target lesions.

          -  Presence of at least one monodimensionally measurable lesion. Patients without
             clinically or radiologically proven evidence of disease are not eligible.

          -  Patients with exclusively skin disease are eligible, provided that the disease
             evolution under treatment can be photographically documented.

          -  Patients with involvement of NCS, besides presence of measurable lesions, are eligible
             provided that:

               -  Brain lesion/s has/have been radically resected;

               -  Brain lesion/s has/have obtained complete remission following radiation therapy.
                  Complete remission must be documented by TC or RMN.

          -  At least 4-week interval from end of radiotherapy, hormono- or immunotherapy and
             enrollment in this study.

          -  ECOG PS &lt;/= 2 and life expectancy of at least 6 months.

          -  Liver metastases involving &lt; 30% of liver volume.

          -  Adequate hematopoietic, liver and renal function

          -  Written informed consent.

          -  Patients with childbearing potential must have negative pregnancy test and must use
             adequate contraceptive measures during treatment.

          -  Prior treatment with Trastuzumab as adjuvant therapy is permitted provided that it was
             completed at least 12 months prior enrollment in this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease.

          -  Active pregnancy or breastfeeding.

          -  Previous treatment with Lapatinib.

          -  Previous therapy with mono- or policlonal antibodies for metastatic disease.

          -  Patients with bone involvement or pleural effusion/ascites as unique localization of
             disease.

          -  Patients with dyspnea due to presence of disease (lymphangitis) or requiring oxygen
             therapy.

          -  Patients with clinically evident hearth disease and/or active infectious diseases.

          -  Patients with not resected or not irradiated brain and/or leptomeningeal metastases.

          -  Prior or actual concurrent neoplasms, with the exception of adequately treated
             carcinoma della cervice uterina and basal cell or squamocellular carcinoma of the
             skin.

          -  Patients with uncontrolled serious illnesses that may compromise the compliance of the
             patient to the treatment.

          -  Previous allergic reactions towards any excipient in the composition of Trastuzumab or
             Lapatinib.

          -  Use of any experimental drug within 4 weeks prior initiation of study treatment.

          -  Women with childbearing potential who refuse to use adequate contraceptive measures.

          -  Patients unable to give written informed consent or are not compliant with treatment.

          -  Patients with great tumor involvement (&gt; 30% dof hepatic volume, etc).
