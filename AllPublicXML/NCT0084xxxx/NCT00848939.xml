      This study will assess the pharmacokinetic and safety profile of treprostinil following fixed
      and escalating doses of treprostinil diethanolamine SR tablets. Open-label, two-part study
      assessing the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of oral treprostinil diethanolamine
      SR. Cohort 1: single 1 mg treprostinil diethanolamine SR dose. Cohort 2: escalating doses of
      treprostinil diethanolamine SR up to a target dose of 4 mg BID.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject gives voluntary written informed consent to participate in the study.

          -  Subject has been diagnosed with systemic sclerosis (SSc) as defined by American
             College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria.

          -  Males and females age greater than 18 years at time of Screening.

          -  Presence of active digital ulcer OR history of digital ulcer occurring within past 6
             months at time of Screening and poorly controlled Raynaud's phenomenon (as documented
             by patient report of 6-10 episodes per week).

          -  Receipt of parenteral prostanoid treatment (epoprostenol, treprostinil sodium, or
             other prostacyclin analog) within the previous 3 months for conditions including PAH,
             rest pain and / or digital ulcers.

          -  Treatment with gemfibrozil, glitazones, or cyclophosphamide within 1 week prior to
             Baseline.

          -  Treatment with rifampin within 4 weeks prior to Baseline.

          -  Local injection of botulinum toxin in an affected finger within 1 month prior to
             Baseline.

          -  Received systemic antibiotics to treat infection of digital ulcers within 2 weeks
             prior to Baseline.

          -  Treatment with phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as sildenafil, except for
             intermittent treatment of male erectile dysfunction.

          -  Received an investigational product within 1 month preceding Screening.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to oral treprostinil or any of the excipients.
