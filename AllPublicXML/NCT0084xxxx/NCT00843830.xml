  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to determine whether it is possible to use an investigational
      vaccine that consists of dendritic cells in patients with pancreas cancer. Dendritic cells
      are immune cells that are obtained from your blood that are important in the body's immune
      response to foreign substances. The vaccine would be injected directly into a tumor that has
      spread to the liver after a short course of radiation therapy has been given to that tumor.
      The study will try to determine if this treatment would be safe and effective in treating
      this cancer.

      This is a phase 1 pilot study of this treatment. Phase 1 trials test the best way to give a
      treatment where little is known about its possible risks or benefits. Phase 2 studies then
      test the possible benefits of a treatment and may show the specific situations where they are
      seen. Promising treatments are then tested in Phase 3 trials which compare the new treatment
      to standard treatment in a larger group of patients. Phase 4 trials are those conducted on a
      treatment after it has been approved for general use outside of research. A pilot study tests
      a treatment in a small number of patients to learn if and how the treatment could be tested
      in a larger group. Pilot studies can be performed at any phase but are commonly performed in
      the earliest phases of research on a treatment.
