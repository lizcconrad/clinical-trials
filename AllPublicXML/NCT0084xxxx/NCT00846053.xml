  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to determine how a person's lungs will uptake
      [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), as measured with positron emission tomography (PET) scanning
      in young cystic fibrosis patients.

      Our recent study in CF adults, supplemented by recent pre-clinical and clinical studies by
      our group suggests that FDG-PET imaging may be a valuable quantitative biomarker of lung
      inflammation. The proposed study would validate our earlier findings, but in a younger
      patient population. The implications of such a test could be highly significant for both the
      testing of promising new anti-inflammatory agents and for patient management decisions. To
      capitalize on this exciting opportunity, the critical next step is to show that we can
      identify a cohort of young CF patients with both stable lung function and normal (or near
      normal) FDG-PET imaging studies. Similar patients, then, would become the subjects for a
      future prospective cohort study to determine if FDG-PET imaging can in fact serve as a
      predictor of future changes in lung function.

        Our Pediatric Cystic Fibrosis Clinic currently has 124 patients between the ages of 12 and
        21 years. We will need to recruit patients from this clinic population, plus new patients
        that enter the clinic over the 2 to 3 year period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of cystic fibrosis

          -  Age 12 to 21 years old, of either gender, any race or ethnicity

          -  Stable recent pulmonary status (defined as no new pulmonary symptoms, new antibiotic
             use, or hospitalization for pulmonary symptoms for at least 1 month).

          -  We will permit patients treated with the macrolide antibiotic, azithromycin, to
             participate in this study. Azithromycin has recently become a virtual standard of care
             in CF [36], based on small but reproducible improvements in pulmonary function over 4
             months of treatment with this drug. The mechanism of benefit is uncertain, but an
             anti-inflammatory effect has been suggested [36]. The high prevalence of use means
             that a study without azithromycin would likely require a wash-out period, without data
             about the appropriate duration for such a wash-out, or whether inflammatory markers
             would reverse during that time.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Failure to obtain informed consent

          -  Positive pregnancy test or lactation

          -  Currently enrolled in another study involving radioisotopes or an investigational drug

          -  Recent (within 30 days of screening) hospitalization for any reason

          -  New antibiotic use (within 30 days of screening).

          -  Patient incapable of lying still and supine within the PET/CT scanner for 90 minutes.

          -  Patient incapable of completing other testing procedures (e.g., PFT, induced sputum)

          -  Patient with serum glucose greater than 150 mg/dl at time of PET imaging study

          -  Patient incapable of fasting for 4 to 6 hrs prior to PET imaging study
