      The aim of this study is evaluate the effect of three moisturising creams on Stratum corneum
      (SC) hydratation and barrier function.

    <textblock>
      In the present study, 24 subjects with AD will be treated for 3 weeks twice daily by using 3
      different moisturising creams. Duration of the study is based on literature. Various
      moisturising creams containing glycerol have been reported to be beneficial for AD lesions.
      The optimal glycerol content in moisturising creams is not known. The secondary objective is
      the comparison of change in the SC water content and in the TEWL from the skin surface from
      the baseline to the end of study between different moisturizing creams containing different
      amount of glycerol.

      Change in the SC water content and in the TEWL can be demonstrated with noninvasive
      instrumental measurement. The treated skin will be followed up instrumentally, and one
      measurement area will serve as an untreated control. The primary evaluation is the comparison
      of change in the SC water content and in the TEWL on the skin surface from the baseline to
      the end of study between the 4 treatments.
