      RATIONALE: Stereotactic body radiation therapy may be able to send x-rays directly to the
      tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue. It is not yet known which regimen of radiation
      therapy is more effective in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying the side effects of two radiation therapy
      regimens and to see how well they work in treating patients with stage I or stage II
      non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To compare the incidence of toxicity with two established stereotactic body radiotherapy
           (SBRT) regimens in patients with node-negative, peripheral stage I or II non-small cell
           lung cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To compare quality of life, patterns of failure, disease-free survival, and overall
           survival of these patients after treatment with one of two established SBRT regimens.

        -  To correlate outcomes and toxicities with imaging and patient and tumor biomarkers.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to Karnofsky performance status and treatment
      center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo 1 high-dose fraction of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT).

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo 3 high-dose fractions (approximately 1 week apart) of SBRT.

      Quality of life is assessed periodically by the EORTC QLQ-C30 and -LC13 questionnaires

      Blood and tissue samples may be collected periodically and examined for biomarkers via ELISA
      and immunoblotting.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 5 years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed non-small cell lung cancer

          -  T1-T2, N0 disease measuring â‰¤ 5 cm( T3 tumor based on chest wall involvement is
             Excluded)

          -  Surgically resectable primary disease, however patient evaluated by thoracic
             oncologist and deemed medically inoperable OR patient refuses surgical resection

          -  Age &gt;= 18

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior thoracic radiation therapy

          -  T2 or T3 tumor greater than 5 cm or T3 tumor based on chest wall involvement

          -  Node positive or metastatic disease

          -  Tumor location within the zone of the proximal bronchial tree. The proximal bronchial
             tree is defined as the carina, right and left main bronchi, right and left upper lobe
             bronchi, bronchus intermedius, right middle lobe bronchus, lingular bronchus, and
             right and left lower lobe bronchi. The zone of the proximal bronchial tree is defined
             as a volume 2cm in all directions around the proximal bronchial tree.

          -  No other conditions deemed by the PI or associates to make the patient ineligible for
             protocol investigations, procedures, and high-dose external beam radiotherapy (e.g.,
             unable to lie still and breathe reproducibly)

          -  Pregnant or unwilling to use adequate contraception
