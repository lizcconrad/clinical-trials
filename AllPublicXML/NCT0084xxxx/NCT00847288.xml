    <textblock>
      Medtronic, Inc. is sponsoring the OptiVol® Care Pathway Study, a prospective, randomized,
      multi-center, post-market clinical trial in the United States. The purpose of this clinical
      trial is to compare monthly versus quarterly review of Cardiac Compass® Trends with OptiVol
      for initiation of clinical action. It is hypothesized that monthly review of Cardiac Compass
      Trends with OptiVol will shorten time to clinical action as compared to quarterly review.

    <measure>Compare Changes in Subject Self-care Over Time in the Monthly Review Arm vs. Quarterly Review Arm</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>There are 3 summary scale scores for the Self-Care of Heart Failure Index (SCHFI) form: self-care maintenance score (Section A), management score (Section B), and confidence score (Section C). Each scale score is standardized to a 0 to 100 range, with 0 indicating the worst and 100 indicating the best performance for each scale score.
Here, changes in each scale score between 6 month follow-up and baseline and between 12 month follow-up and baseline are the secondary outcome measures. Specifically, change at 6 (or 12) month follow-up is calculated as a scale score at 6 (or 12) month follow-up subtracts that at baseline. These changes range from -100 to 100 with 0 indicating no change at all, -100 indicating maximum decrease and 100 indicating maximum increase that is possible from baseline for a self-care scale score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Identify Patient Groups Who Are More Likely to Have Clinical Actions Triggered by Monthly Rather Than Quarterly Reviews</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The binary outcome of having clinical actions taken (Yes/No) is recorded within one month interval for the monthly review group, and within three months interval for the quarterly review group. To make the endpoints of both groups comparable, data from monthly review group are converted as they were collected quarterly. For example, the month 1, 2 and 3 visits of monthly review group are combined as one visit. If there is at least one action taken in any of these three monthly visits, the action taken variable for the combined visit will be recorded as 'yes'. Unscheduled visits in both groups are lumped to the next quarterly time point.</description>

        <title>Compare Changes in Subject Self-care Over Time in the Monthly Review Arm vs. Quarterly Review Arm</title>
        <description>There are 3 summary scale scores for the Self-Care of Heart Failure Index (SCHFI) form: self-care maintenance score (Section A), management score (Section B), and confidence score (Section C). Each scale score is standardized to a 0 to 100 range, with 0 indicating the worst and 100 indicating the best performance for each scale score.
Here, changes in each scale score between 6 month follow-up and baseline and between 12 month follow-up and baseline are the secondary outcome measures. Specifically, change at 6 (or 12) month follow-up is calculated as a scale score at 6 (or 12) month follow-up subtracts that at baseline. These changes range from -100 to 100 with 0 indicating no change at all, -100 indicating maximum decrease and 100 indicating maximum increase that is possible from baseline for a self-care scale score.</description>

        <population>For each component, the subject needs to have baseline and 6 (or 12) month measurements to calculate the changes. Subjects included for the each component are as following:

        <title>Identify Patient Groups Who Are More Likely to Have Clinical Actions Triggered by Monthly Rather Than Quarterly Reviews</title>
        <description>The binary outcome of having clinical actions taken (Yes/No) is recorded within one month interval for the monthly review group, and within three months interval for the quarterly review group. To make the endpoints of both groups comparable, data from monthly review group are converted as they were collected quarterly. For example, the month 1, 2 and 3 visits of monthly review group are combined as one visit. If there is at least one action taken in any of these three monthly visits, the action taken variable for the combined visit will be recorded as 'yes'. Unscheduled visits in both groups are lumped to the next quarterly time point.</description>

            <groups_desc>The probability of action taken in three months interval is evaluated using the generalized estimating equations (GEE) method under a logistic regression model. Univariate analysis is performed first for potential predictors and only those with a p-value less than 0.10 through univariate analysis are included in the multivariate model. Here we report the odds ratio of monthly arm against quarterly arm, adjusting for OptiVol crossing, new or chronic device, and AF or no AF.</groups_desc>
