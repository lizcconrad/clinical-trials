      The overall aim of this research project is to test the effectiveness of an integrative
      program, using journaling, yoga breathing instruction, and nutritional manipulation and
      supplementation, on quality of life and clinical outcomes in adults with asthma. An
      additional aim is to determine whether an integrative approach to asthma management leads to
      cost savings when compared to standard clinical care.Patients will be randomly assigned to
      either the intervention condition or a waitlist control condition. For the intervention
      group, all measures will be obtained at baseline, immediately after the treatment protocol is
      completed, and then at three month and six month intervals after the completion of the
      intervention. For the control group, data will be collected at the same times as the
      intervention group, with one exception: data collected at the completion of the treatment
      protocol will be replaced with data collection at six weeks post-baseline for the control
      group. Data will be collected using measures of quality of life (Asthma Quality of Life
      Questionnaire and SF-12), pulmonary function and health care utilization and expenditures.

      Participants assigned to the treatment group will begin in groups of ten. The treatment
      protocol will consist of six 1-2 hour sessions over a six-week period as follows:

        1. Subjects will attend a two-session class on healthy eating focused on reducing
           inflammation-promoting foods in the diet. All subjects will also be started on fish oil
           and vitamin C supplements, as well as on a supplement called Kaprex, which is an extract
           from hops and rosemary with anti-inflammatory action. Supplements willl be provided free
           of charge. Subjects will be provided with a take home supply to begin using.

        2. Subjects will attend two classes at CCHH in yoga breathing techniques and will then be
           provided with a CD for home study and practice

        3. Subjects will attend two guided journaling sessions at CCHH in which subjects will be
           asked to write for a 30-minute period about the most traumatic or stressful life
           experience to date.
