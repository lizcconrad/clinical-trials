  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dendritic cells (DC) are the professional antigen presenting cells of the immune system.
      Multiple distinct DC lineage's exist and it is now well appreciated that the DC subset and
      the maturation stage of the DC determines the type of immune response, ranging from a TH1 or
      TH2 response to immune tolerance. The extremely potent capacity of mature DC to initiate
      immune responses can be exploited to fight infectious diseases and cancer. Others and we are
      currently using tumor antigen loaded mature DC in clinical vaccination studies against
      cancer, and clinical as well as immunological responses have been observed.

      Exciting new insights accompany the revival of suppressor T cells, now referred to as
      regulatory T cells (Treg), and implicate that also Treg play a key role in the control of
      immunity. Treg constitute a sub-population of CD4+ T cells constitutively expressing the
      IL-2R alpha-chain (CD25). Treg show remarkably suppressive activities on different components
      of the immune system, including T lymphocytes and dendritic cells, suggesting they act both
      at the initiation phase (DC) and at the effector phase (activated T cells) of the immune
      response. Interestingly, temporal depletion of Treg has been shown to enhance anti-tumor
      immune responses and in case of prolonged absence of Treg even autoimmunity. Furthermore,
      data in mouse tumor models indicate that temporal depletion of Treg also results in improved
      vaccine efficiency in the therapeutic setting, e.g. in mice with a pre-existing tumor. These
      data imply that in tumor bearing patients depletion of Treg prior to vaccination will improve
      vaccine efficacy.

      In this study we investigate the effect of regulatory T cell (Treg) depletion on the efficacy
      of DC-based anti-tumor vaccines in a clinical study using melanoma associated antigens
      tyrosinase and gp100-loaded DC and a depleting anti-CD25 mononuclear antibody (Daclizumab).
      Our primary objective in this study is the induction of an effective anti-tumor immune
      response. Our secondary objective is the induction of a clinical response.
