  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of Hyperpolarized Helium-3 gas in MR
      imaging in COPD, asthmatics, CF and healthy volunteers.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current pulmonary imaging techniques are clinically regulated to machines that produce
      radiation. MR which does not produce radiation was not possible due to the low concentration
      of fluids in the open spaces of the lungs. With hyperpolarized noble gases we can now use the
      safe techniques of MR imaging to view the airways of the lungs, thus limiting human exposure
      to radiation. This technique has already been proven to be possible in human subjects but
      there is insufficient data show its efficacy in a clinical setting. This study is designed to
      image a variety of pulmonary disorders to better find possible clinical uses for
      hyperpolarized gas MRI.

        <title>Hyperpolarized Helium-3 MR Images</title>
        <description>We have applied hyperpolarized 3He MR imaging to a range of subject with various disorders. We have developed our scanning techniques so as to acquire optimized images for each disorder.</description>

            <description>This population is made up of only confirmed COPD patients. Diagnosis must be confirmed through their doctor prior to enrollment.
Participants will inhale Hyperpolarized Helium-3: Participants will be required to breath in individual 1 liter bags of gas while in an MRI to produce lung images. These bags of gas are each made up of 333mL of Helium-3 gas and 667mL of Nitrogen. Three bags will be administered to acquire three different scans.</description>
