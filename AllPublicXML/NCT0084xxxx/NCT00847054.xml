    <textblock>
      MORAb-004 is a monoclonal antibody directed against endosialin, a cell surface glycoprotein,
      which is expressed on cells involved in tumor vasculature. Studies have found endosialin to
      play a key role in tumor growth and neovessel formation in numerous cancer types including
      (but not limited to) renal, breast, colon, pancreatic, lung, endometrial, ovarian, melanoma,
      sarcoma, and neuroectodermal tumors. Preclinical pharmacological studies have shown that
      MORAb-004 is a potentially useful anti-cancer agent. This clinical trial is being performed
      to determine the safety of MORAb-004 in subjects with solid tumors, as well as to establish
      serum pharmacokinetics of the antibody, and to assess tumor antigens that may serve as
      predictors of a response to MORAb-004. Study Part 2 was added to enroll subjects with
      specific histological diagnoses (colorectal cancer and soft tissue sarcoma) to further
      characterize the safety and tolerability of 5 dose levels of MORAb-004 previously tested
      during the dose escalation in Part 1.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects ≥18 years of age.

          -  Subjects with any malignant solid tumor without intracranial involvement or metastases
             diagnosed by standard pathology criteria that has failed standard chemotherapy.

          -  Subject must have disease, as defined by RECIST or evaluable by clinical
             signs/symptoms (e.g., ascites, pleural effusion, or lesions of less than 2 cm)
             supported by biomarker, radiologic, or pathologic studies conducted within 4 weeks
             prior to study entry.

          -  Karnofsky performance status ≥70%.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential and all male subjects must consent to use a
             medically acceptable method of contraception throughout the study period and for 30
             days after MORAb-004 administration. A barrier method of contraception must be
             included.

          -  Laboratory and clinical results within the 2 weeks prior to Study Day 1 as follows:
             Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1.5 x 109/L; Platelet count ≥100 x 109/L; Hemoglobin
