      The purpose of this study is to monitor safety outcomes of patients who have taken Cimzia® as
      compared to a non- Cimzia® control population. The SECURE Registry's target enrollment is
      3045 patients and it's objective is to monitor patients for approximately 8 years.

Incidence rate is defined as the number of patients experiencing the event of interest divided by the number person-years without an event (time up to the event for patients experiencing an event, and the full study time for those without an event of interest).</description>

      <textblock>
        Patients of selected gastroenterologists and internal medicine physicians from both
        community-based and academic practice settings (75% and 25% respectively) Each physician
        should be able to recruit a minimum of 5 patients prescribed Cimzia® and/or 5 patients
        prescribed other treatments.

        Recruitment into both cohorts will be monitored and controlled as needed in order to ensure
        balanced enrollment over time. In order to ensure reasonable balance between both cohorts,
        retrospective frequency matching will be applied for disease severity
        (mild/moderate/severe), age categories and gender.
