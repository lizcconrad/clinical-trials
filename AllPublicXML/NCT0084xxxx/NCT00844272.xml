      Study objective: Feasibility and efficacy of a standardised psychosocial intervention
      (psychoeducation) in substituted opioid dependent patients
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary objective:

        -  Retention in antiviral treatment (feasibility)

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Mental Health Mental health is monitored by means of the Symptom Checklist 90-R
           (SCL-90-R). Its sum score, the Global Severity Index (GSI), serves as indicator. Mental
           health will be regarded as stable in case of a change of less than 6 GSI-points,
           otherwise mental health will be regarded as improved (GSI - 6 points) or decreased (GSI
           + 6 points).

        -  Course of Addiction Course of addiction under antiviral treatment will be monitored
           according to retention in substitution treatment, compliance with scheduled visits, and
           co-consumption of illicit drugs (patients record, urinalysis).

        -  Sustained viral response (SVR) SVR as measured by polymerase chain reaction 6 months
           after per protocol antiviral treatment (ITT-analysis).

    <description>PE group sessions lasted 60 minutes and were carried out under continuous supervision. The manualised program was especially tailored to (former) IDUs in HCV treatment, containing the following aspects:
Module 1: HCV infection and symptoms, course of illness, interaction with opioid dependence, further problems and risk factors
Module 2: HCV treatment, side effects, psychiatric and somatic comorbidities, reinfection and drug use, risk behaviour
Module 3: Coping strategies, resources and self-help, effective use of health-care support, the role of social environment, healthy living &amp; nutrition</description>

    <description>Group-therapeutic intervention with 12 sessions plus 5 update sessions with 24-week therapy duration and/or 12 sessions plus 10 update sessions with 48-week therapy duration Module I: Create understanding, resources, problems and solutions Module II: Information on hepatitis C infection Module III: Information on treatment Module IV: Specific information on depression and withdrawal symptoms under interferon The meetings take a minimum of 60 min. time, should be once weekly. The group size should lie between 6 and 12 participants.
The group leaders are trained in performance of the psycho-education.</description>
