  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The size of a heart attack will be decreased by the use of timed balloon inflations to open
      the blocked blood vessel.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention of &quot;post conditioning&quot; at the time of reperfusion, in patients with acute
      myocardial infarction (AMI), will attenuate the degree of ischemia-reperfusion injury, as
      manifested by infarct size. This intervention is hypothesized to be safe in humans.

    <description>After 30 seconds of re-established coronary flow following the therapeutic balloon dilatation and deflation, the same balloon will be re-inflated for 30 seconds and then again deflated for 30 seconds. The balloon should be inflated to only occlude the coronary artery. This procedure of balloon inflation/deflation will be performed a total of 3 to 4 times.</description>
