      The objective of this study was to compare the single-dose relative bioavailability of
      Ranbaxy and Schering (Claritin-D® 24 hour) 10 mg Loratadine/240 mg Pseudoephedrine Sulfate
      Extended-Release Tablets, in a fully replicated design, under fed conditions.

      The study was conducted as an open-label, randomized, Single-Dose, Fully replicated, 4-way
      Crossover Study to compare the single-dose relative bioavailability of Ranbaxy and Schering
      (Claritin_D® 24 hour) 10 mg Loratadine/240 mg Pseudoephedrine Sulfate Extended-Release
      Tablets, in Healthy adult Volunteers Under Fed Conditions In each period, subjects were
      housed from the evenings before the dosing until after the 36 hour blood draw and were to
      return for subsequent blood draws at 48, 72, 96 and 120 hours post dose. Single oral 10 mg
      Loratadine/ 240 mg Pseudoephedrine Sulfate doses were separated by a washout period of 21
      days.

      A total of 40 subjects and 1 alternate (34 males and 7 females) were included in this study,
      of which 37 (32 males and 5 females) finished the study according to the protocol.
