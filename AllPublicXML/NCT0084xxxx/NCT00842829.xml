  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breakthrough cancer pain (BTcP) is a common problem in patients with cancer. Fentanyl Buccal
      Tablet (FBT) is used for the treatment of BTP in adults with cancer who are already receiving
      maintenance opioid therapy for chronic cancer pain. FBT treatment should be individually
      titrated to an effective dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes undesirable
      effects. To reach the safest effective dose for the individual patient as soon as possible,
      the dose titration process is critical. The aim of this study, conducted under pragmatic
      conditions in a large-scale population of cancer patients is to compare the proportion of
      patients reaching an effective FBT dose after titration starting with either a 100 mcg dose
      or a 200 mcg dose.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Reaching an Effective Fentanyl Buccal Tablet (FBT) Dose As Assessed by the Participant During the Titration Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 up to Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>The effective dose was the dose that, for 2 consecutive break-through pain (BTP) episodes, provided adequate analgesia within the first 30 minutes after administration of study drug and that minimized undesirable effects. The assessment was performed by the participant and was reported in the titration-period diary. The next BTP episode was used to confirm the effective dose, and if confirmed, the effective dose was used for all following BTP episodes.</description>

    <measure>Kaplan-Meier Estimates for Time to Meaningful Pain Relief As Assessed by Participants During the Treatment Period For Overall Breakthrough Pain (BTP) Episodes</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately Day 8-15</time_frame>
    <description>Overall episode data analyzed all values of time to meaningful pain relief taken over all BTP episodes during the treatment period. If meaningful pain relief was not achieved within 60 minutes of FBT intake, or if rescue medication was taken, the event was censored. Meaningful pain relief was left to the judgment of participants, who used a stopwatch and recorded the time from treatment until pain relief in a patient diary.</description>

The effective dose was the dose that, for 2 consecutive break-through pain (BTP) episodes, provided adequate analgesia within the first 30 minutes after administration of study drug and that minimized undesirable effects. The assessment was performed by the participant and was reported in the titration-period diary.

    <description>Participants assessed the performance of FBT at 30 minutes and 60 minutes after dosing each episode during the treatment period. For each episode, the participant answered the question 'How well did your study medication perform in controlling the breakthrough pain episode?' on a 5-point Likert-type scale (poor=0, fair=1, good=2, very good=3, and excellent=4).</description>

    <description>During the Titration Period, participants took fentanyl buccal tables (FBT) with a starting dose of 100 mcg until they reached an effective dose, with a maximum dose of 800 mcg and a maximum timeframe of 7 days. Participants who reached an effective dose entered the Open-label Treatment Period, whose length depended on how long was needed to treat up to 8 episodes of breakthrough pain (BTP) with FBT (maximum of 8 days). The length of the Continuation Period (when applicable) varied from country to country, up to until FBT was commercially available in that country.</description>

    <description>FBTs were self-administered by participants via the oral mucosa. During the open-label dose titration period, participants used 1 to 4 tablets of the 100 mcg or 200 mcg strength to individually titrate upwards to an effective dose through the range of available strengths (i.e. 100, 200, 400, 600, or 800 mcg). For the open-label treatment and continuation periods, single dose tablets at the effective dose identified during the titration period were used. The maximum dose allowed per breakthrough pain (BTP) episode was 800 mcg. On any single day, participants were not to use FBT for more than 4 BTP episodes.</description>
