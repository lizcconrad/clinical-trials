  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine efficacy of MR imaging with hyperpolarized helium-3
      gas in COPD patients both before and after treatment.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hyperpolarized Helium Lung imaging has already been tested and proven to be scientifically
      possible in patients with a number of pulmonary disorders. However there is limited data on
      the sensitivity of this imaging technique, which would be essential for clinical use. This
      study is a double blinded study with two cohorts, each cohort being made up of patients with
      confirmed diagnosis of COPD. One group will receive a placebo while the other will receive
      treatment. A comparison of the data will resume once twenty patients have been consented and
      completed the study procedures.

    <description>Subjects had hyperpolarized helium-3 MR scans completed before administration of an intervention and 2 hours after administration. These images were compared as described:
The change in the total ventilation volume (Litres) measured in the hyperpolarized helium-3 MR image from pre-nebulizer inhalation to post-nebulizer inhalation.</description>

    <description>Spirometry was taken which measures FEV1 (in Litres), before administration of an intervention and again 2 hours after administration of an intervention. The change in FEV1 (Litres) from pre-nebulizer inhalation to post-nebulizer inhalation was compared.</description>

    <description>Patients will be required to breath in individual 1 liter bags of gas while in an MRI to produce lung images. These bags of gas are each made up of 333mL of Helium-3 gas and 667mL of Nitrogen. The first three bags will be administered with a break between each of five to ten minutes. Then the drug aformoterol will be administered and an hour will pass. BROVANA (arformoterol tartrate) Inhalation Solution is supplied as 2 mL of arformoterol tartrate solution packaged in 2.1 mL unit-dose, low-density polyethylene (LDPE) unit-dose vials. Each unit-dose vial contains 15 mcg of arformoterol (equivalent to 22 mcg of arformoterol tartrate) in a sterile, isotonic saline solution, pH-adjusted to 5.0 with citric acid and sodium citrate. After administration of the drug, three additional bags of hyperpolarized helium-3 will be administered, again with five to ten minutes between each bag.</description>

            <description>Subjects will be required to breath in individual 1 liter bags of gas while in an MRI to produce lung images. These bags of gas are each made up of 333mL of hyperpolarized Helium-3 gas and 667mL of Nitrogen. The first three bags will be administered with a break between each of five to ten minutes. Then the placebo will be administered and an hour will pass. The placebo consists of a nebulized saline solution (2.1 mL).

These bags of gas are each made up of 333mL of hyperpolarized Helium-3 gas and 667mL of Nitrogen. The first three bags will be administered with a break between each of five to ten minutes. Then the drug aformoterol will be administered and an hour will pass. BROVANA (arformoterol tartrate) Inhalation Solution is supplied as 2 mL of arformoterol tartrate solution packaged in 2.1 mL unit-dose, low-density polyethylene (LDPE) unit-dose vials. Each unit-dose vial contains 15 mcg of arformoterol (equivalent to 22 mcg of arformoterol tartrate) in a sterile, isotonic saline solution, pH-adjusted to 5.0 with citric acid and sodium citrate. After administration of the drug, three additional bags of hyperpolarized helium-3 will be administered, again with five to ten minutes between each bag.</description>
