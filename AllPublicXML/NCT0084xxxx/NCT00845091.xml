      The current research study proposes to examine participants with implantable cardioverter
      defibrillators (ICD) who are randomly assigned to either an exercise training program
      intervention or a heart healthy education program intervention. We will look at changes in
      the functioning of the autonomic nervous system over time and between intervention groups. We
      are also going to be looking at changes in frequencies of the ICD participants' heart
      arrhythmias and ICD therapies (e.g., pacing, shock).; as well as, changes in exercise
      tolerance, psychological well-being, and quality of life.
