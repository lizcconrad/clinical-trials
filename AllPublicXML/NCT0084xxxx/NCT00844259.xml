      The aim of this study was to verify the use of communicative functions by children with DS in
      two interaction conditions: interaction with therapist and interaction with parent.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parents and caregivers' engagement on therapeutic process of children with Down syndrome (DS)
      is important for language and communication development. The identification of the
      communicative skills presented by these children as well as the context influence in their
      performance as interlocutors, will contribute to the design of therapeutic interventions.

      Pragmatics theories are helpful to language use studies, since it takes into account social
      and environmental aspects and considers adult-child interaction as a determinant factor for
      its occurrence.
