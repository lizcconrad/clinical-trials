    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Japan. The aim of this clinical trial is to investigate the safety
      (with emphasis on hypoglycaemia) after switching from long-acting insulin analogue or
      intermediate-acting insulin to insulin degludec (NN1250, SIBA) on a basal-bolus regimen in
      subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus.

    <description>Observed rate of major and minor hypoglycaemic episodes per patient year (1year=365.25days) of exposure (PYE). Major if unable to treat her/himself. Minor if able to treat her/himself and plasma glucose ≤ 55 mg/dL.</description>

    <description>Observed rate of nocturnal major and minor hypoglycaemic episodes per patient year (1year=365.25days) of exposure (PYE). Major if unable to treat her/himself. Minor if able to treat her/himself and plasma glucose ≤ 55 mg/dL. Episodes were defined as nocturnal if the time of onset was between 23:00−05:59 (both inclusive).</description>

    <description>Corresponds to number of adverse events. Severity assessed by investigator. Mild: no or transient symptoms, no interference with subject's daily activities. Moderate: marked symptoms, moderate interference with subject's daily activities. Severe: considerable interference with subject's daily activities, unacceptable. Serious AE: AE that at any dose results in any of the following: death, a life-threatening experience, in-subject hospitalization/prolongation of existing hospitalisation, persistent/significant disability/incapacity/congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>

    <description>The number of subjects having a electrocardiogram (ECG) that changed from 'Normal' or 'Abnormal, not clinically significant' to 'Abnormal, clinically significant'. 'Abnormal, Clinically significant' is an abnormality that suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity and is of a severity, which requires active management.</description>
