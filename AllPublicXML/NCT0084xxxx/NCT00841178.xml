  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Varicose veins are a common problem, affecting up to a third of the western adult population.
      Most suffer with aching, discomfort, pruritis, and muscle cramps, whilst complications
      include oedema, eczema, lipodermatosclerosis, ulceration, phlebitis, and bleeding. This is
      known to have a significant negative effect on patient's quality of life (QoL).

      Surgery has been used for many years, but it is known that there is a temporary decline in
      QoL post-op. This was demonstrated in our pilot study. Surgery leads to painful and prolonged
      recovery in some patients and has the risks of infection, haematoma and nerve injury.

      Recurrence rates are known to be significant. Duplex of veins post surgery has demonstrated
      persistent reflux in 9-29% of cases at 1 year, 13-40% at 2 years, 40% at 5 years and 60% at
      34 years.

      26% of NHS patients were 'very dissatisfied' with their varicose vein surgery.

      Newer, less invasive treatments are being developed. It would be advantageous to find a
      treatment that avoided the morbidity of surgery, one that could be performed as a day-case
      procedure under a local anaesthetic, a treatment that could offer lower recurrence rates and
      allow an early return to work. These should be the aims of any new treatment for varicose
      veins.

      Endovenous Laser Treatment (EVLT) is performed under a local anaesthetic and uses laser
      energy delivered into the vein to obliterate it. The vein therefore need not be tied off
      surgically and stripped out.

      The aim of this study is to compare the clinical, cost effectiveness and safety of Surgery
      and EVLT.
