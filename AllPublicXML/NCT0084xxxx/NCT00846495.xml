  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects enrolled at 2 investigative sites will complete 3 visits. Following Visit 1, during
      a 1-month Baseline Period, subjects will treat with their usual medication and document any
      warning signs (Prodrome pre-headache) that a migraine will occur. Following randomization
      (like a flip of the coin) at Visit 2, subjects will treat daily with topiramate or during
      Prodrome with frovatriptan. Subjects complete a 2-month Treatment Period before exit at Visit
      3.This study will compare the effectiveness of daily treatment vs. treatment during the
      pre-headache phase for prevention of migraine.

    <time_frame>Randomization, End of Treatment Month 1, End of Treatment Month 2</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of Life is measured by the Migraine Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (MSQ), which includes 3 dimensions: Role Function Restrictive (degree to which performance of daily activities is limited), Role Function Preventive (degree to which performance of daily activities is interrupted), and Emotional Function (frustration and helplessness due to migraine). Scores range from 0 to 100. For each dimension, a higher score indicates a better health status. Participants completed the MSQ at Randomization, and after Treatment Months 1 and 2.</description>

    <measure>Participant Satisfaction With Study Medications</measure>
    <time_frame>Treatment Month 2</time_frame>
    <description>Participant satisfaction is measured by the Patient Perception of Migraine Questionnaire (PPMQ). Questions were categorized within 6 dimensions: Efficacy, Functionality, Ease of Use, Cost, Bothersomeness of Side Effects, and Total Score. Scores range from 0 to 100. Higher scores represent better satisfaction.
Participants completed the PPMQ 24 hours following each first dose of frovatriptan.</description>

             International Headache Society criteria (see Appendix)

          2. Subject has a 3-month history of averaging 3-6 migraines per month

          3. Subject reports premonitory symptoms and the ability to predict at least 50% of high

        <title>Quality of Life in Subjects Utilizing Each Treatment Paradigm</title>
        <description>Quality of Life is measured by the Migraine Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (MSQ), which includes 3 dimensions: Role Function Restrictive (degree to which performance of daily activities is limited), Role Function Preventive (degree to which performance of daily activities is interrupted), and Emotional Function (frustration and helplessness due to migraine). Scores range from 0 to 100. For each dimension, a higher score indicates a better health status. Participants completed the MSQ at Randomization, and after Treatment Months 1 and 2.</description>
