      The overall goal of this study was to implement and evaluate the effects of a systems-based
      and pharmacist-mediated program designed to improve adherence for patients with known
      coronary heart disease (CHD) to lipid-lowering pharmacologic therapy and of their
      physicians/nurse practitioners to the National Cholesterol Education Program Guidelines.

      Patients were randomly assigned to a usual care condition which consisted of patients
      provided with usual care only, or to the Special Intervention (SI) condition. The
      intervention was implemented and coordinated by pharmacists, who utilized for tracking and
      communication the Lotus NotesÂ®-based system that was developed for the project.

    <description>Patients in the SI were seen by a study pharmacists prior to discharge to establish a relationship with the patient, explain the pharmacist's role in the study, provide education about all discharge medications and a medication card listing all medications and their manner of use, and set the framework for the follow-up telephone calls. Patients received pharmacist-delivered adherence counseling telephone contacts that took place at two weeks following discharge, and at months 1, 3, 6, and 9 oriented towards assisting patients to remain adherent to prescribed lipid-lowering and other medications, and also towards ensuring that all patients were either documented to be at the LDL-C goal, or were assisted to reach the goal by facilitating the scheduling of repeat lipid measurement as needed and providing information, guidelines and prompts to the patient's physician or nurse practitioner.</description>
