  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is our purpose in this study to compare the kidney structure and function of older
      patients to that of young patients before and after removal of a single kidney for transplant
      donation and to examine the remaining kidney's ability to adapt and maintain function over
      time. More specifically, we aim to examine the effect of uninephrectomy on adaptive
      hyperfiltration in the remaining kidney. A secondary aim is to investigate whether subjects
      in the aging population undergo compensation to the same extent as younger subjects. We will
      also examine the compensatory rise in GFR (glomerular filtration rate) that follows
      uninephrectomy in both groups, and, again, compare the results in the aged versus young
      subjects. This will help in delineating the extent to which the aging population can be a
      potential source of living kidney donors for kidney transplantation.

      It is also our purpose with this study to refine the tests to be used in the donor evaluation
      process so as to accurately identify ideal candidates for safe kidney donation.

      Screening Procedures: Patients will be identified after acceptance by Stanford's kidney
      transplant team as appropriate candidates for living kidney donation prior to their surgery.

      The following assessments will be performed over the course of 4 years for this protocol.

      A. Informed Consent will be obtained.

      B. A Cimetidine Blocked 24 hour urine collection will be obtained prior to surgery.

      C. DETAILED KIDNEY FUNCTION STUDIES will be performed using iothalamate, and PAH at three
      different times:

        1. Prior to surgery for uninephrectomy (the night before to months before surgery)

        2. 6 months to 1 year post kidney donation.

        3. 4 years after kidney donation.

      D. The Structure of the Kidney will also be assessed at three different times during this
      protocol:

        1. Cortical and whole kidney volumes will be determined using the clinical MRI or CT
           performed routinely for kidney donor evaluation.

        2. At the time of surgery, in the operating room: A single wedge biopsy of the kidney will
           be taken for morphometric and later genetic analysis. *NOTE: Genetic analysis is for the
           genetics of ageing not disease. In this procedure, a small wedge kidney biopsy is
           excised under direct visualization by the transplant surgeon after the kidney has been
           removed from the donor and before the kidney is transplanted into the recipient. The
           area of excision is then oversewn and checked for bleeding.

           The size (volume) of the Tx kidney will be measured by water displacement in a graduated
           cylinder immediately before Tx. This volume will be used in our calculations to estimate
           the number of glomeruli in youthful vs ageing kidneys.

        3. A second MRI or CT will be obtained 6 months to 1 year after kidney donation to measure
           the kidney's overall compensatory growth and increase in cortical volume for comparison
           with the pre-operative volumes.

      1. Blood samples are obtained throughout the kidney function study. These samples are
           analyzed for Iothalamate and PAH (markers of kidney function) only.

        2. Kidney tissue obtained by biopsy at the time of surgery are used to analyze the
           structure of the kidney.

      No Tissue or Blood is used for genetic analysis.
