      Abstract: In Phase I, we designed and tested a Portable Visual Guidance System (PVGS), which
      combines a PDA - for user guidance - and an Internet website - for linking the user to an
      educational support team. Use of the PVGS 1) significantly improved the in vivo social
      pragmatics of students diagnosed with Aspergers Syndrome/Higher Functioning Autism (AS/HFA);
      2) revealed additional ways of improving social pragmatics; and 3) improved activity
      management in scheduling and vocational tasks.

      In Phase II, we will focus on social pragmatics and two closely related skills: feelings
      management and assignment management. We aim to:

        1. Replicate Phase I success in the most educational setting for AS/HFA high school aged
           students: mainstream school inclusion classes.

        2. Replicate Phase I findings more efficiently, with a less highly trained, on-site
           coaching staff and with more distant (non-site) expert supervision of that staff.

        3. Contrast the outcomes of the curriculum with a diagnosis-matched wait-list control
           group.

        4. Develop and implement software that will enable on-site staff to create and modify
           individualized guidance and monitoring screens as needs arise.

        5. Design a commercially attractive package of software, video training, video-conferenced
           support, and manuals.

        6. Complete the translation of the SymTrend website and all the above tools into Spanish.

      Significance: Successful completion of Phase II will:

        1. Provide a very effective and comprehensive system for teaching social pragmatics and
           related management skills to AS/HFA persons in an inclusion context.

        2. Provide a means of evaluating IEP effectiveness, thereby enabling a better use of
           special education funds and a reduction of litigation over IEP plan appropriateness and
           utility.

        3. Provide substantial support for our theoretical rationale for curriculum building in
           Special Education - a rationale that can guide the formulation of IEPs.

        4. Provide a theoretical rationale, an intervention framework, and intervention support
           technology that can be extended to cognitive behavioral treatment of other
           neuropsychiatric disorders and can be adapted for other forms of healthcare guidance.

        5. Provide an investigative system, as well as an intervention system, for tracking
           behavioral change in studies of frontal lobe and limbic neuroplasticity in
           neuropsychiatric disorders.
