    <description>In the dose-escalation cohorts, PCI-32765 will be administered in 1.25, 2.5, 5.0, 8.3, 12.5, and 17.5 mg/kg/d dose orally once per day for 28 days followed by a 7-day rest period to determine the MTD. If MTD is not reached, dosing levels may be increased beyond 17.5mg/kg/d by 33% increments.
In the continuous dosing cohorts, PCI-32765 will be administered in 8.3 mg/kg/day and 560 mg/day (fixed dose) dose orally once per day for 35 days.</description>

             Macroglobulinemia (WM), and pre-identified DLBCL ABC subtype oFor the DLBCL-ABC
             cohort, documented, activated B-cell subtype by either immunohistochemistry or tissue
             microarray analysis.

          -  Measurable disease (for NHL, bidimensional disease ≥ 2 cm diameter in at least one
             dimension, for CLL ≥ 5000 leukemia cells/mm3, for WM presence of immunoglobulin M
             paraprotein with a minimum IgM level ≥ 1000 mg/dL and infiltration of bone marrow by
             lymphoplasmacytic cells), and pre-identified DLBCL ABC subtype by immunohistochemistry
             (IHC).

          -  Have failed ≥ 1 previous treatment for lymphoma and no standard therapy is available.

          -  Immunotherapy, chemotherapy, radiotherapy or experimental therapy within 4 weeks
             before first day of study drug dosing.

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt; 1500/µL (unless patients have CLL and
                  bone-marrow involvement)

               -  Hgb &lt; 8.0 g/dL

          -  Uncontrolled illness including but not limited to: ongoing or active infection,
             symptomatic congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Class III or IV heart
             failure), unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, and psychiatric illness that
             would limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  Risk factors for, or use of medications known to prolong QTc interval or that may be
             associated with Torsades de Pointes within 7 days of treatment start.

             including 2nd degree AV block type II, 3rd degree AV block, or bradycardia
             (ventricular rate less than 50 beats/min). If the screening ECG has a QTc &gt; 450 msecs,
             the ECG can be submitted for a centralized, cardiologic evaluation.

          -  History of myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes (including unstable
             angina), coronary angioplasty and/or stenting within the past 6 months.

             evaluation of the safety of the study agent.

          -  Pregnant or lactating women (female patients of child-bearing potential must have a
             negative serum pregnancy test within 14 days of first day of drug dosing, or, if
