      The purpose of this study is to determine the recommended dose of pemetrexed and the maximum
      tolerated dose of radiotherapy when using concurrent pemetrexed/cisplatin/radiotherapy in the
      patients with local advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

      This study was conducted to explore the feasibility of concurrent chemoradiation therapy with
      pemetrexed, cisplatin and radiotherapy in unresectable local advanced non-small cell lung
      cancer. We will perform the dose escalation of pemetrexed to determine if full dose
      (500mg/m2) of pemetrexed could be administrated concurrently with cisplatin and conventional
      dose radiotherapy (66Gy) firstly. Secondly, radiation dose will be escalated to determine the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of radiotherapy when administered concurrently with full dose
      pemetrexed and cisplatin.
