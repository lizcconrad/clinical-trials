      Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of robot-assisted gait training (RAGT) in MS patients
      with severe walking disabilities (Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS] 5.5-7) as compared
      to regular physiotherapy.

      Methods: Prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial comparing RAGT with conventional
      walking training (CWT) in a group of stable MS patients (n=40) during an outpatient
      rehabilitation program. Inclusion criteria are chronic or secondary progressive MS patients
      with EDSS between 5.5-7, stable treatment 3 months before study entry, without generalized
      diseases. All patients will sign an informed consent. Following randomization, 20 patients
      will be treated with RAGT, 12 sessions over three weeks. The control group will be treated by
      CWT, 12 sessions in three weeks. The primary outcome measures will be the Functional
      Ambulatory Capacity (FAC) scale and the 6-minutes walking distance. The secondary outcome
      measures will be the Time up &amp; Go (TUG) test, 10 Meter Walking test, Berg balance test, EDSS
      score, FIM score and RAND questioner for quality of life. All tests will be performed by an
      external blinded assessor at baseline, after three weeks, and at follow-up after 3 months and
      six months.

      Importance: We anticipated that Robot-assisted gait training will be found as feasible and
      may be an effective therapeutic option in MS patients with severe walking disabilities.
