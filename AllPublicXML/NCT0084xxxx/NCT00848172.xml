      Background:

        -  Essential tremor (ET) is a neurological disorder characterized by uncontrollable
           shaking. Several medications are used to treat ET; however, they are often only partly
           effective and can have side effects.

        -  Research studies have shown that octanol, a food additive similar to alcohol, can
           improve tremor in animals. Octanol is less likely to make people drunk than alcohol. Two
           earlier NIH studies found that one form of octanol, called 1-octanol, did improve tremor
           in some people and had few side effects.

        -  In the body, 1-octanol is converted to octanoic acid. Researchers are interested in
           finding out whether octanoic acid can help people with ET.

      Objectives:

        -  To find out if octanoic acid can improve hand tremor in people with essential tremor.

        -  To measure levels of octanoic acid in the blood after it is taken.

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients 21 years of age and older with ET, who are willing to abstain from alcohol,
           caffeine, and all medications as required by the study and who are willing and able to
           fast for up to 12 hours at a time.

        -  Participants may not be of Asian or Native American ancestry because of genetic
           susceptibilities to the intoxicating effects of the study drug.

      Design:

        -  This study requires a 3-day hospital admission as well as two outpatient visits.

        -  Visit 1 (outpatient): Screening visit and blood alcohol level test

        -  Medical history, physical and neurological examination, a blood test, and an
           electrocardiogram to measure heart function. Women who are able to get pregnant will
           have a urine pregnancy test.

        -  Patients will consume 1.5 ounces of alcohol per drink (up to three drinks at least 30
           minutes apart), and be tested to evaluate how the tremor responds. Researchers will draw
           blood to measure blood alcohol level about 1 hour after the first drink and closely
           monitor patients for signs of intoxication.

        -  Inpatient examination

        -  Preparation: Researchers will prepare a schedule to stop any tremor medications that
           patients might be on. Patients may not drink alcohol or eat or drink anything with
           caffeine, including chocolate, for at least 2 days before admission.

        -  Day 1: Vital signs, blood (and urine pregnancy) tests, and electrocardiogram. Patients
           will be asked to wear a tremor monitor, similar to a wristwatch. Patients will also have
           IV lines inserted for blood draws.

        -  Days 2 and 3: Randomized study medication (octanoic acid on one day, placebo on the
           other day). Patients will fast before taking the drug, but will be allowed to eat and
           drink after the tests are completed (around noon).

        -  Blood will be drawn before taking the study drug and again (a total of nine times) after
           taking the drug.

        -  Tremor will be measured during the study, before and after taking the drug.

        -  Visit 2 (outpatient): 4 to 7 days after discharge

        -  Blood test and an electrocardiogram, and a series of questionnaires regarding the study.

      OBJECTIVE:

      We propose a study to examine the safety and efficacy of octanoic acid in essential tremor
      (ET).

      STUDY POPULATION:

      We will study 19 adult subjects with ethanol-responsive ET.

      DESIGN:

      Octanoic acid will be tested in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over
      design in 19 patients with essential tremor. The active study medication and placebo will be
      administered as oral single morning doses on consecutive days in a randomized sequence. All
      subjects will receive a dose that was defined as being safe according to available toxicity
      data (4mg/kg) and will be monitored closely during the total inpatient study phase of three
      days (day 0: baseline; days 1-2: active study days).

      OUTCOME MEASURES:

      The primary outcome measure for this study will be the effect on tremor power of the dominant
      hand, 80 minutes after administration of the study substance, compared to placebo. Tremor
      power will be measured using accelerometry with loading to test central tremor component.
      Secondary outcome measures include recordings of tremor power as measured by accelerometry at
      multiple other time points up to 300 min after administration, also recorded from the
      non-dominant hand and without loading. The change in tremor severity documented by
      spirography and actigraphy as well as data collected regarding drug safety (laboratory
      testing, documentation of vital signs, adverse events questionnaire and intoxication scale)
      as well as the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties will act as further secondary
      outcome parameters.

    <description>Postural tremor was measured using accelerometry with a motion sensor (accelerometer) placed at the dorsum of each hand, and tremor recorded simultaneously with surface-electromyography of wrist flexors and extensors for 2 minutes at each time-point. The recording was repeated with 1 lbs weight added to each wrist, which was described to record the central tremor component. The primary outcome measure was defined as tremor power of the central tremor component (after the addition of weight) 80 minutes after administration, measured at the dominant hand, normalized to baseline (baseline = 1), and comparing octanoic acid vs. placebo. Ratio of tremor power at 80 min divided by tremor power at baseline used for outcome measure calculation.</description>

        <title>Normalized Accelerometric Tremor Power, Dominant Hand, 80min After Administration, Weighted Condition</title>
        <description>Postural tremor was measured using accelerometry with a motion sensor (accelerometer) placed at the dorsum of each hand, and tremor recorded simultaneously with surface-electromyography of wrist flexors and extensors for 2 minutes at each time-point. The recording was repeated with 1 lbs weight added to each wrist, which was described to record the central tremor component. The primary outcome measure was defined as tremor power of the central tremor component (after the addition of weight) 80 minutes after administration, measured at the dominant hand, normalized to baseline (baseline = 1), and comparing octanoic acid vs. placebo. Ratio of tremor power at 80 min divided by tremor power at baseline used for outcome measure calculation.</description>

        <population>2 patients were excluded from primary outcome measure analysis because of one subject was withdrawn prior to drug administration due to an SAE, and one subject did not exhibit a central tremor component (primary measure), on the day of administration.</population>
