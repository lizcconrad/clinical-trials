      The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility of a trial on induced hypertension to
      improve neurological outcome in patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage that developed the
      serious complication &quot;delayed cerebral ischemia&quot;, and to assess whether induced hypertension
      results in improved cerebral blood flow (CBF) as measured by means of perfusion-CT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Delayed cerebral ischaemia (DCI) is a major complication after aneurysmal subarachnoid
      haemorrhage (SAH). The proportion of SAH patients who develop DCI is around 30%. Many centres
      around the world use induced hypertension, alone or in combination with haemodilution and
      hypervolaemia, so called Triple-H, as standard therapy in the treatment of DCI, but the
      efficacy of induced hypertension in reducing DCI is based on case series only, and not on a
      randomised clinical trial.

      Objective:

      To test the feasibility of a trial on induced hypertension to improve neurological outcome,
      and to assess whether induced hypertension results in improved cerebral blood flow (CBF) as
      measured by means of perfusion-CT.

      Study design:

      A randomised controlled feasibility trial.

      Study population:

      Patients admitted to the UMC Utrecht after recent SAH, who develop DCI. Twenty four patients
      will be randomised into a standard care group or one of the intervention groups.

      Interventions:

      Patients in the intervention groups are treated with induced hypertension (30 mmHg increase
      in mean arterial pressure) in order to improve CBF. Patients in the standard care group are
      treated according to the standardised SAH treatment protocol of the UMC Utrecht by monitoring
      mean arterial pressure and preventing dropping of mean arterial pressure to under 80 mmHg.
      24-36 hours after instalment of the treatment, a perfusion CT scan is performed. In patients
      that do not show any neurological improvement within 24 hours after starting the hypertensive
      treatment, the administration of norepinephrine will be tapered. In patients who show
      improvement, induced hypertension will be continued for a total period of 72 hours, after
      which norepinephrine will be gradually tapered. Measurement of CBF is performed in all
      participants with perfusion CT-scanning of the brain at the beginning of the study (as part
      of regular patient care) and after 24-36 hours after starting .

      Main outcome measurement:

      The number of patients with the diagnosis of DCI after SAH, in which the intervention
      (induced hypertension) was adequately performed, included within 18 months after the start of
      the study.

    Our RCT recently started. The RCT is similar to the feasibility trial, so it was terminated to
    avoid 2 trials running simultaniously.

    <intervention_name>Induced hypertension with norepinephrine</intervention_name>
    <description>Hypertension will be induced with norepinephrine. Administration of norepinephrine results in vasoconstriction, leading to an increase in blood pressure. The normal blood pressure of the patient will be calculated as the average MAP of the day before the start of the study. To achieve the intended hypertension (30 mmHg above the normal MAP for patients allocated to index group 2) in most cases a dose of 100-300 ng/kg/minute must be administered. Norepinephrine will be started on a dose of 100 ng/kg/minute, after which the dosing will be adjusted to achieve the desired blood pressure level. The maximum dose to be used in the study is 1000 ng/kg/minute. Norepinephrine is administered through the central venous catheter.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Admission to the UMC Utrecht.

          2. Age 18 years or over.

          3. Aneurysmal SAH, demonstrated on CT-angiography or cerebral angiography, with onset
             less than 72 hours before admission.

          4. A level of consciousness corresponding to a Glasgow Coma Sum Score above 8, as in
             patients with lower Glasgow Coma Sum Scores, assessment of further deterioration may
             be less reliable.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Symptomatic aneurysm not yet treated by coiling or clipping. Co-existing asymptomatic
             cerebral aneurysms are no reason for exclusion, since previous studies found no
             increased risk of rupture of such aneurysms during hypertensive and hypervolemic
             treatment.(26)

          2. Co-existing severe head injury.

          3. A history of a cardiac rhythm disorder, necessitating medical treatment.

          4. A history of a left ventricular pump failure, necessitating medical treatment.

          5. Pregnancy.

          6. Known allergy for CT-contrast agents.

          7. Renal failure, defined as a serum creatinine &gt; 150 Âµmol/l, because of the risk of
             contrast nephropathy.
