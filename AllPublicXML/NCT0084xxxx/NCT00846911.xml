      The objective of this global non-interventional study is to evaluate the impact of Acute
      Exacerbation of Chronic Bronchitis(AECB) on the patient and the community as well as the
      safety and effect of a treatment with Moxifloxacin tablets in daily life clinical practice.
      This includes data on the course of symptom relief, speed of return to normal daily life
      activities as well as records on adverse events.

      This study will be performed in accordance with international guidelines like EMEA (EMEA,
      EUDRALEX Volume 9A, Pharmacovigilance for Medicinal Products for Human Use) as well as local
      laws.
