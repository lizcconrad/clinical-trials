      This is a clinical trial for women with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer. The purpose of this
      study is to determine if the addition of a drug called azacitidine (VidazaÂ®)when added to
      carboplatin and paclitaxel will change the genetic material of the tumor so that the
      chemotherapy drugs work better.

      The study will also determine what the maximum tolerated dose of azacitidine that may be
      safely used in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ovarian cancer is a highly chemosensitive tumor with good responses to first line
      chemotherapy. The problem is the high rate of relapse, especially in advanced disease

      Relapses are likely due to the presence of chemoresistant cells that escape from first line
      platinum and taxane based regimens. Therefore, outcomes may be improved by adding treatment
      to initial standard therapy that makes resistant cells sensitive to chemotherapy. There are
      multiple targeted pathways that may achieve this goal. One promising path is epigenetics.

      The reasons for this trial are multifold. First, methylation pathways have been proven in
      tissue models to be integral to ovarian cancer pathogenesis. Second, cisplatin and
      azacitidine are synergistic, and therefore would be promising in combination to improve
      ovarian cancer outcomes by combating cisplatin resistance, which is a major cause of ovarian
      cancer mortality. It has been proven that azacitidine/decitabine reverses platinum
      resistance. Third, azacitidine has shown tolerable toxicity and promise in clinical trials to
      date. Ideally, ovarian cancer outcomes are likely to be improved by the addition of treatment
      that wipes out chemoresistant cells, thus preventing relapse.

      This study is a phase I, non-randomized, dose escalation treatment study using azacitidine in
      combination with intravenous chemotherapy with Paclitaxel and carboplatin.

      All patients will receive the chemotherapy drugs Carboplatin and Paclitaxel. Patients will
      then be randomized to receive one of three different doses of Azacitidine.
