      A double blind, Placebo (Vehicle) and Standard Care controlled, randomised study to
      investigate the clinical safety and toleration (including systemic pharmacokinetics), wound
      healing and antiscarring potential of two applications of intradermal RN1001 in healthy male
      subjects

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Double blind, randomised, Placebo and Standard Care controlled, single centre study. Each
      subject served as their own control, i.e. Arm 1 incisions/biopsies randomly received one of
      two treatments and Arm 2 incisions/biopsies received the same treatments as for Arm 1 but in
      reverse. The randomisation of the treatment allowed for control of possible positional
      effects on healing and subsequent scarring. Subjects were initially dosed and wounded
      (incisions and punch biopsies) on Day 0 and re-dosed on Day 1. On Day 3, Arm 1 incisions and
      punch biopsies were re-dosed as per Day 0 and excised, and re-dosed again on Day 4. Arm 2
      punch biopsies were excised at Day 5 but not re-dosed. Healed incisions/scars on Arm 2 were
      excised for histological analysis after 12 months and not re-dosed. All subjects, regardless
      of treatment were treated according to best practices for moist wound healing.
