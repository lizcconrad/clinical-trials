      The purpose of this study is to determine brain function in reading arabic diacritics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      fMRI is a well established imaging technique that allows investigators to see regional brain
      function based off of actions like reading, speaking, playing music, etc. Even the type of
      language and format of that language can change the area of the brain that is active while
      performing that action. This study is meant to see the areas of the brain that become active
      both prior to and during the process of reading diacritic markings in arabic.

        criteria, or if any of the following conditions have been met:

          -  Have any contraindications to an MR exam such as a pace-maker, metallic cardiac
             valves, magnetic material (i.e., surgical clips) implanted electronic infusion pumps
             or any other conditions that would preclude proximity to a strong magnetic field;
