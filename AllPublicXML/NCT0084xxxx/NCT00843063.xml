      Low-dose aspirin can prevent cerebral and cardiovascular accidents in individuals with
      symptomatic atherothrombotic disease, but its use is frequently limited by gastrointestinal
      side effects.

      The position of H2-receptor antagonists as a step-down therapy after healing of peptic ulcer
      or erosions by proton pump inhibitor is unclear.

      The objective of this randomized, double blinded control study was to compare the efficacy of
      high-dose famotidine with pantoprazole in the prevention of recurrent dyspeptic or
      complicated ulcer/ erosions in patients taking low-dose aspirin

    <textblock>
      Low-dose aspirin can prevent cerebral and cardiovascular accidents in individuals with
      symptomatic atherothrombotic disease . Its use is frequently limited by gastrointestinal side
      effects, ranging from dyspepsia (31%) to life-threatening bleeding or perforation of
      gastroduodenal ulcers (3.1%) over a period of 4 years .

      The best approach for the secondary prevention of low-dose aspirin induced symptomatic peptic
      ulcer or erosions in patients who need to continue aspirin remain uncertain. At present,
      eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection and long-term maintenance with proton pump
      inhibitor PPI appears to be the best options.

      The position of H2-receptor antagonists (H2RA) as a step-down therapy after healing of peptic
      ulcer or erosions is unclear.

      The objective of this randomized, double blinded control study was to compare the efficacy of
      high-dose famotidine with pantoprazole in the prevention of recurrent dyspeptic or
      complicated ulcer/ erosions in patients taking low-dose aspirin.
