  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD or Whipple procedure) involves the removal of the head of the
      pancreas and is the primary modality for treatment of peri-ampullary cancers (arising from
      the common bile duct, Ampulla of Vater, duodenum, neuroendocrine cells of the pancreas, and
      most commonly the exocrine pancreas). In Canada, cancer of the pancreas is the 11th cancer in
      terms of new cases/year, and the 5th leading cause of cancer related deaths/year. Following
      PD the remaining pancreas is re-connected to a portion of the gastrointestinal tract; the
      pancreas is very soft and difficult to sew and connect safely. The primary cause of
      complications following PD is related to leak occurring at this connection. Of patients that
      develop a leak, over half need a second operation, and up to 40% will die. The two main
      organs that the pancreas may be re-connected to are the jejunum or the stomach. The
      investigators will compare the rates of pancreatic leakage in two groups of patients
      randomized to reconnection to either the jejunum or stomach following PD. The goal of this
      study is to determine which of these methods is safer. The results may change practice
      patterns across North America and the world. It may in the future prevent many cases of
      avoidable leakage and the resulting morbidity of this including death. This will therefore
      reduce the morbidity and mortality of this group of cancer patients.

          -  Patients less than 18 years of age will be excluded.

          -  As well, patients with distant metastasis, local unresectability, and/or gastric
             involvement will be excluded.

        Other exclusion criteria include:

          -  female subjects who are pregnant or nursing
