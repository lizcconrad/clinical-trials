      The purpose of this study is to determine if low level laser light therapy might help to
      relieve tinnitus in adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tinnitus is the perception of sound, such as a ringing or hissing, that occurs in the ears or
      head in the absence of external stimuli. About 40-50 million people in the United States
      report experiencing tinnitus; 10-12 million have sought medical help for their tinnitus, with
      2.5 million reporting their tinnitus as debilitating. As a result of the distressing nature
      of tinnitus, it is often accompanied by anxiety, depression and sleep difficulties.

      Tinnitus is most often caused by sensorineural hearing loss due to presbyacusis (aging) or
      noise damage. It is believed that the tinnitus results when spurious neuro-electrical signals
      are produced by diseased, degenerated or damaged cochlear hair cells and interpreted by the
      brain as tinnitus.

      There is presently no cure for tinnitus. Current management strategies include using other
      external sounds to distract from the tinnitus, teaching relaxation and stress reduction
      techniques, and prescription medications to help ease stress, anxiety, depression and sleep
      difficulties. However, in general, current tinnitus management techniques are only minimally
      effective. It is believed that low level laser light therapy may offer a simple, non-invasive
      means of relieving the symptoms of tinnitus. In theory, low level laser light penetrates
      targeted tissues to stimulate the mitochondria in underlying cells to produce energy through
      the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In turn, the enhanced ATP fuels cellular
      energy and enhances blood flow to the cochlear hair cells (cilia) to assists in regulating
      the electrical signals disrupted by the diseased and/or degenerated cochlear hair cells. With
      the taming of the spurious electrical signals, the brain no longer has a basis to perceive
      the noise known as tinnitus.

    <measure>Total Score on the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI).</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and one week</time_frame>
    <description>The Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) is a 25-item questionnaire to assess how tinnitus affects an individual's life. Each question is responded to as 'yes' (4 points); 'sometimes' (2 points) or 'no' (0 points). The individual scores for the 25 questions are added to get a total THI score from 0 to 100. The higher the total THI score, the greater the negative impact tinnitus has on the individual's life. Change in total THI score is calculated as total THI score after the one week procedure administration phase minus total THI score at baseline. A positive (+) change in total THI score indicates the negative impact of tinnitus on the individual's everyday life has worsened. A negative (-) change indicates the negative impact of tinnitus on the individual's everyday life has improved (lessened). A change in total THI score of -20 or greater indicates a meaningful lessening of the impact of tinnitus on the individual's life and is positive for study success.</description>

    <measure>Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory®-II (BDI®-II) is a 21-item questionnaire used to assess depression. Most items are rated on a 4-point scale from 0 to 3, and a few items are rated on a 7-point scale. Individual item scores are added to get a total score from 0 to 63. The higher the total score, the more severe the depression, and the lower the total score, the less severe the depression. Change in BDI®-II score is calculated as the BDI®-II score 4 weeks after baseline evaluation minus the BDI®-II score at baseline. A positive (+) change in BDI®-II score indicates that the depression has worsened. A negative (-) change in BDI®-II score indicates the depression has lessened. A change in BDI®-II score of -6 or greater indicates a meaningful lessening of depression and is positive for study success.</description>

    <measure>Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)- Trait Portion</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Trait portion of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-T) evaluates an individual's tendency to get anxious and how they respond to stress. The STAI-T has 20 items rated on a 4-point frequency of occurrence scale of 1=Almost Never, 2=Sometimes, 3=Moderately So, and 4=Very Much So. The individual scores are summed to get the total STAI-T score. The higher the total score, the more anxious the individual, and the lower the total score, the less anxious the individual. Change in STAI-T score is calculated as the STAI-T score at 4 weeks after baseline evaluation minus the STAI-T score at baseline. A positive (+) change in STAI-T score indicates that the anxiety has worsened. A negative (-) change in STAI-T score indicates the depression has lessened. A change in STAI-T score of -8 or greater indicates a meaningful lessening of anxiety and is positive for study success.</description>

        <title>Total Score on the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI).</title>
        <description>The Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) is a 25-item questionnaire to assess how tinnitus affects an individual’s life. Each question is responded to as ‘yes’ (4 points); ‘sometimes’ (2 points) or ‘no’ (0 points). The individual scores for the 25 questions are added to get a total THI score from 0 to 100. The higher the total THI score, the greater the negative impact tinnitus has on the individual’s life. Change in total THI score is calculated as total THI score after the one week procedure administration phase minus total THI score at baseline. A positive (+) change in total THI score indicates the negative impact of tinnitus on the individual’s everyday life has worsened. A negative (-) change indicates the negative impact of tinnitus on the individual’s everyday life has improved (lessened). A change in total THI score of -20 or greater indicates a meaningful lessening of the impact of tinnitus on the individual’s life and is positive for study success.</description>

        <title>Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II)</title>
        <description>The Beck Depression Inventory®-II (BDI®–II) is a 21-item questionnaire used to assess depression. Most items are rated on a 4-point scale from 0 to 3, and a few items are rated on a 7-point scale. Individual item scores are added to get a total score from 0 to 63. The higher the total score, the more severe the depression, and the lower the total score, the less severe the depression. Change in BDI®–II score is calculated as the BDI®–II score 4 weeks after baseline evaluation minus the BDI®–II score at baseline. A positive (+) change in BDI®–II score indicates that the depression has worsened. A negative (-) change in BDI®–II score indicates the depression has lessened. A change in BDI®–II score of -6 or greater indicates a meaningful lessening of depression and is positive for study success.</description>

        <title>Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)- Trait Portion</title>
        <description>The Trait portion of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-T) evaluates an individual’s tendency to get anxious and how they respond to stress. The STAI-T has 20 items rated on a 4-point frequency of occurrence scale of 1=Almost Never, 2=Sometimes, 3=Moderately So, and 4=Very Much So. The individual scores are summed to get the total STAI-T score. The higher the total score, the more anxious the individual, and the lower the total score, the less anxious the individual. Change in STAI-T score is calculated as the STAI-T score at 4 weeks after baseline evaluation minus the STAI-T score at baseline. A positive (+) change in STAI-T score indicates that the anxiety has worsened. A negative (-) change in STAI-T score indicates the depression has lessened. A change in STAI-T score of -8 or greater indicates a meaningful lessening of anxiety and is positive for study success.</description>
