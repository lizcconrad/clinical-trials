  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study was to assess the proportion of participants in the
      infliximab plus naproxen arm versus the placebo plus naproxen arm, in a population of
      participants with moderate-to-severe active axial spondyloarthritis and disease duration of
      ≤3 years, who achieve the Assessment in Ankylosing Spondylitis (ASAS) partial remission
      criteria.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the 28-week treatment phase, participants were randomized to receive either infliximab
      plus naproxen or placebo plus naproxen.

      After 28-weeks of treatment, participants that achieved partial remission in the treatment
      phase were randomized to continued treatment with naproxen or to receive no treatment and
      were followed for an additional 24 weeks (follow-up phase).

          <title>Number of Participants With Complete Absence of Active Inflammatory Lesions at the Spine and Sacroiliac Joint at Treatment Week 52</title>
          <description>MRI scans (T1 for chronic changes and STIR for active changes) of the whole spine was performed to determine the Berlin MRI Spine Score. The Berlin MRI scoring for the spine was assessed on a scale of 0 (best) to 3 (worst) for a maximum total score of 69, with 0 = no inflammatory lesions; 1 = minor bone marrow edema; 2 = moderate bone marrow edema; 3 = major bone marrow edema; or N = non readable. Complete absence of active spinal inflammatory lesions was defined as a Berlin MRI Score = 0.
Each sacroiliac joint was divided into four quadrants. An activity score of 0 (best) to 3 (worst) was assessed for every quadrant of the left and right sacroiliac joint separately for a total maximum score of 24, with with 0 = no inflammatory lesions; 1 = minor bone marrow edema; 2 = moderate bone marrow edema; 3 = major bone marrow edema; or N = non readable. Complete absence of active sacroiliac inflammatory lesions was defined as a Score = 0.</description>
