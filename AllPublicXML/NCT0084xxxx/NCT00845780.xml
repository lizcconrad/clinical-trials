  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Amiodarone is considered to be the most effective antiarrhythmic drug in the prevention of
      persistent atrial fibrillation. It can however cause many adverse events, both cardiac and
      non-cardiac. Long-term maintenance of sinus rhythm after cardioversion is difficult
      especially because of high recurrence rates during the first month after cardioversion.
      Duration of atrial fibrillation, type of underlying disease, left ventricular function, left
      atrial size and age are associated with maintaining sinus rhythm. Early recurrence of atrial
      fibrillation may be related to a highly arrhythmogenic period due to recovery from electrical
      remodelling. Late recurrences may be related to other triggers than recovery from electrical
      remodelling. In this study the investigators want to investigate the effect of amiodarone
      withdrawal on the occurrence of late relapses of persistent atrial fibrillation. Furthermore,
      the investigators want to investigate the effect of amiodarone withdrawal on the occurrence
      of amiodarone related adverse events as well as adverse events related to atrial fibrillation
      or underlying heart disease. The investigators also want to investigate which patients
      characteristics are and potential triggers have a prognostic value in the occurence of late
      relapses after amiodarone withdrawal.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  history of persistent atrial fibrillation, necessitating at least one electrical
             cardioversion

          -  presence of sinus rhythm during the last 6 months, while on amiodarone treatment
             without adverse events related to amiodarone

          -  clinically stable

          -  age &gt; 18 years

          -  written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  sinus rhythm maintenance is preferable (because of atrial fibrillation related
             morbidity or any other reason)

          -  symptomatic heart failure NYHA III or IV

          -  unstable angina pectoris

          -  hemodynamically significant valvular disease

          -  concomitant treatment with other class I or III antiarrhythmic drug

          -  PCI,CABG, other cardiac surgery or major non-cardiac surgery within the last three
             months

          -  recent myocardial infarction (&lt; 3 months)

          -  presence of any disease that is likely to shorten life expectancy to &lt; 1 year
