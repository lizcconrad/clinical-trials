      Main Study Objectives:

      The study is conducted to

        -  evaluate the minimal allopurinol and azathioprine doses that, in combination, produce
           therapeutic 6-TGN levels

        -  evaluate the safety and tolerability of the different allopurinol/azathioprine dose
           levels

        -  assess if concomitant allopurinol affects TPMT activity

        -  assess the clinical efficacy of concomitant allopurinol-azathioprine therapy in the
           included patients
