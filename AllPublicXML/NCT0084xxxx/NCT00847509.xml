      Approximately 60 patients will be enrolled with highly suspected lung cancer, or head and
      neck cancer. The patients must also be starting radiotherapy or a chemoradiotherapy regimen
      (except with 5-fluorouracil). The patients will undergo 3 visits. One screening, one pre
      therapy PET/CT imaging visit, and one (3-5 weeks after the start of therapy) post PET/CT
      imaging visit. This study will evaluate the FLT and FDG images for tumor proliferation rates
      for early assessment of tumor response to radiation or chemo-radiation combo.

      PHASE: II/III

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary: To investigate the clinical value of serial quantitative [F-18] FLT positron image
      assessment of tumor proliferation rates for early assessment of tumor response to radiation
      or chemoradiotherapy regimens (except with 5-fluorouracil) in comparison to serial
      quantitative [F-18] FDG images

      Secondary: To gain additional clinical information and experience with [F-18]FLT to guide the
      design of a future, pivotal, Phase III trial where changes in tumor proliferation from
      pre-treatment baseline values can be used as a early indicator of response to therapy
      regimens.

      DESIGN: Open label, nonrandomized, uncontrolled, single group assignment

      DURATION: Pre treatment [F-18] FLT PET scan following a clinical [F-18] FDG PET scan followed
      by post treatment [F-18] FLT PET scan and a post treatment, clinical [F-18] FDG PET scan at 4
      weeks (±1 week) to monitor radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy.

      PROCEDURES: Informed consent, collection of demographic information, medical history,
      physical examinations, vital signs, 12-lead ECGs, concomitant medication collection, monitor
      adverse events, pre treatment [F-18] FLT PET scan and post treatment [F-18] FLT PET scan

      SUBJECTS: Approximately 60 patients will be enrolled with confirmed lung cancer, or head and
      neck cancer. The patients must also be starting radiotherapy or a chemoradiotherapy regimen
      (except with 5-fluorouracil) to be eligible. This allows for approximately 40 evaluable
      patients to complete this study at approximately four to eight sites and conducted in the
      United States.

             or ethnicity)

             frame(s)

             System:

          -  Lung cancer (T3 grade up, node positive, but no metastatic disease)
