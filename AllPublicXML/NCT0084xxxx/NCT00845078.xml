    <textblock>
      This study examines the aesthetic outcomes of breast reconstruction after mastectomy for
      breast cancer in patients who require post-mastectomy radiation treatment. Patients will
      undergo autologous tissue breast reconstruction either in immediate fashion, prior to
      radiation treatment, or in delayed fashion, after radiation treatment. Both approaches are
      acceptable and are practiced clinically. this will be an observational prospective cohort
      study.

      The investigators hypothesize that immediate autologous reconstruction patients who undergo
      subsequent radiation therapy have equivalent aesthetic outcome when compared to those in whom
      reconstruction is delayed until after radiation, with the additional benefit of avoiding the
      psychological side effects of breast amputation.

      Neo-adjuvant or adjuvant chemo-radiation remains one of the pillars for breast cancer
      treatment. (1, 2) Administration of radiation before or after autologous soft tissue
      reconstruction has being shown to alter the aesthetics of the new breast. (3-7) Currently,
      the optimal timing for autologous breast reconstruction in patients who need postmastectomy
      radiotherapy remains in debate between surgeons. (8) Various studies have tried to address
      this problem. However, most of them have been retrospective studies (3, 7, 9) and the
      prospective ones have not have enough patients, have mixed population of patients or the
      radiation protocols have not been normalized. (5, 6, 10)

      We hypothesize that immediate autologous reconstruction patients who undergo subsequent
      radiation therapy have equivalent aesthetic outcome when compared to those in whom
      reconstruction is delayed until after radiation, with the additional benefit of avoiding the
      psychological side effects of breast amputation.
