  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It should be shown that Cerebrolysin in combination with Alteplase, the medication that
      should recover the blood flow through the brain, is an effective and save medication to treat
      ischeamic stroke.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current trial should evaluate a combined treatment using Cerebrolysin immediately after
      thrombolysis to guarantee that the neurotrophic components are able to reach the endangered
      brain areas efficiently. An early start of treatment should guarantee rescue of most of the
      neurons reducing the overall damage.The study follows the design of pure thrombolytic trials
      to investigate, if the early neuroprotective treatment with Cerebrolysin is able to improve
      the overall outcome of patients at the day 90 evaluation visit. Due to the initial findings
      special emphasis will be also put on analysing the speed of recovery.

             neglect. Ischemic stroke is defined as an event characterized by the sudden onset of
             an acute focal neurologic deficit presumed to be due to cerebral ischemia after CT
             scan excludes haemorrhage.
