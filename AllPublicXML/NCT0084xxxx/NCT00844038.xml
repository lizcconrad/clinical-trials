      Steven-Johnson's syndrome, or great multiform erythema, appears as a systemic disturbance,
      with skin involvement and mucous membranes, related to several factors, such as, viral or
      bacterial infections and mainly the administration of medicines, in general painkillers and
      antibiotics. The objective of this work is report the emergence of ulcerative vesicle -bubble
      chronic disease in areas of lips, gum, tongue and genital mucous membrane in a 26 year-old
      patient, leucoderma and masculine gender, in treatment of breathing infection with
      sulfametoxazol-trimetropima, having been diagnosed as syndrome of Steven-Johnson.
