    <textblock>
      The main objective of the proposed study is to determine whether the effectiveness of a group
      therapy treatment for Binge Eating Disorder (BED) is improved and attrition reduced by
      optimally matching women with BED who have high attachment anxiety to Group Psychodynamic
      Interpersonal Psychotherapy (GPIP). This study represents the next phase in a program of
      research stemming from a previously conducted randomized controlled trial (RCT).

    <description>Early response to treatment is indicated by a reduction in depression symptoms measured by The Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II; Beck, Steer, &amp; Brown, 1996). The BDI-II is scored by summing the ratings for the 21 items. Each item is rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 to 3. The range for this scale is 0-63. Higher scores represent more depressive symptoms. We included cases that were missing up to 8 missing items and calculated scores for participants with missing items by taking the weighted mean and multiplying by 21.</description>

    <description>This intervention will consist of 16 weekly 90 minute sessions of Group Psychodynamic Interpersonal Psychotherapy (GPIP). GPIP was developed and empirically tested in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) at our Centre. GPIP will be preceded by an individual pre-group preparation session conducted by a psychologist trained in GPIP to orient the patient to the therapy. Patients are given a rationale for the treatment.</description>

          <description>In our study sample, the range of scores for the Need for Approval subscale of the Attachment Style Questionnaire was 1.86-5.71 (the possible range of this subscale is 1-7). Participants in this group scored lower than the cut off of 3.59 on the Need for Approval subscale of the Attachment Style questionnaire. They were assigned to therapy groups homogeneously composed of participants with low attachment anxiety (i.e. others that scored below the cut off). The type of therapy administered to this group was Group Psychodynamic Interpersonal Psychotherapy (GPIP; Tasca, G., Mikail, S. &amp; Hewitt, P. Group Psychodynamic Interpersonal Psychotherapy: A Manual for Time Limited Treatment of Binge Eating Disorder. (2002).) Participants received 16 weekly 90 minute sessions of GPIP from a male or female therapist.</description>

        <title>Depression Symptoms</title>
        <description>Early response to treatment is indicated by a reduction in depression symptoms measured by The Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II; Beck, Steer, &amp; Brown, 1996). The BDI-II is scored by summing the ratings for the 21 items. Each item is rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 to 3. The range for this scale is 0-63. Higher scores represent more depressive symptoms. We included cases that were missing up to 8 missing items and calculated scores for participants with missing items by taking the weighted mean and multiplying by 21.</description>
