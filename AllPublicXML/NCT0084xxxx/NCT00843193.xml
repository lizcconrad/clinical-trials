    <measure>Change From Baseline in Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-7) Over 12 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The ACQ-7 consists of 7 questions scored between zero (no impairment/ limitation) to 6 (total impairment/ limitation). The values of Week 1 is considered as Baseline. ACQ-7 was calculated as the average of the 7 scores. If any one individual score was missing, the ACQ-7 was set to missing.The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-randomization values. If either the Baseline or post-randomization value was missing, the change from Baseline was set to missing as well.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Demonstrated a Clinically Meaningful Increase in FEV1 Over the 12 Week Assessment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Upto 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 is forced expiratory volume in 1 second.A participant is defined as a FEV1 responder if he/she achieves a change from baseline FEV1 of &gt;=200ml. To evaluate whether the participant was a responder over 12 weeks, change from baseline FEV1 over 12 weeks was calculated by taking the mean of the changes at Visit 7, Visit 9 and Visit 11. A binary variable was created for each participant with 1 for the responder and 0 for the non-responder. If either Visit 9 or Visit 11 FEV1 data are missing, then the binary variable for the responder over 12 weeks was set to be missing. If Visit 7 data were missing, but Visit 9 and Visit 11 data were available, then the binary variable for the responder over 12 weeks was still calculated.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted in participants with severe asthmatics from 9-Dec-2008 to 19-July-2010 at 35 study centers in France (7), United States (6), United Kingdom (5), Poland (5), South Africa (4), Germany (3), Netherlands (3) and Norway (2).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>During run-in period of 28 days each participant’s inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) dose was up-titrated to 1000 microgram (μg)/day fluticasone propionate. Participants already taking ≥ 1000 µg/day fluticasone propionate or equivalent prior to study remained on their pre-study dose. Total of 198 participants were randomized and treated in the study.</pre_assignment_details>
      <group_list>
        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Placebo</title>
          <description>Participants received a total of three once-monthly intravenous (IV) infusions of sodium chloride placebo in a volume matched to the volume that would had been administered if the participant had been randomized to active treatment in order to maintain the integrity of the study blind. The IV infusions were administered by qualified study personnel, and were administered over 1 hour using a programmable infusion pump.</description>

        <description>The ACQ-7 consists of 7 questions scored between zero (no impairment/ limitation) to 6 (total impairment/ limitation). The values of Week 1 is considered as Baseline. ACQ-7 was calculated as the average of the 7 scores. If any one individual score was missing, the ACQ-7 was set to missing.The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-randomization values. If either the Baseline or post-randomization value was missing, the change from Baseline was set to missing as well.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in ACQ-7 Over 16 Weeks and 24 Weeks</title>
        <description>The ACQ-7 is a 7-item questionnaire that provides a measure of a participant’s asthma control. Participant responses were recorded on a 7-point scale ranging from zero (no impairment/ limitation) to 6 (total impairment/ limitation). The values of Week 1 is considered as Baseline. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-randomization values. If either the Baseline or post-randomization value was missing, the change from Baseline was set to missing as well. Change from Baseline of Week 16 and Week 24 are incorporated here which are Follow up weeks.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Who Demonstrated a Clinically Meaningful Change in ACQ-7 Over the 12 Weeks Assessment Period.</title>
        <description>The ACQ-7 is a 7-item questionnaire that provides a measure of a participant’s asthma control. Participant responses were recorded on a 7-point scale ranging from zero (no impairment/ limitation) to 6 (total impairment/ limitation). The percentage of participants who were classified as responders for ACQ-7, defined as a clinically meaningful decrease from baseline in ACQ-7 of at least 0.50, was generally similar between treatment groups at each visit and over the 12-week treatment period.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Forced Expiratory Volume (FEV1) Over 12 Weeks.</title>
        <description>FEV1 is forced expiratory volume in 1 second.Change from Baseline FEV1 was calculated for each of the following visit: Visit 6, Visit 7, Visit 9 and Visit 11. A binary variable was created for each participant with 1 for the responder and 0 for the non nonresponder at each visit. Week 1 was considered as the Baseline. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-randomization values. If either the Baseline or post-randomization value was missing, the change from Baseline was set to missing as well.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in FEV1 Over 16 Weeks and 24 Weeks</title>
        <description>FEV1 is forced expiratory volume in 1 second.Change from Baseline FEV1 was calculated for each of the following visit: Visit 6, Visit 7, Visit 9 and Visit 11. A binary variable was created for each participant with 1 for the responder and 0 for the non nonresponder at each visit. Week 1 was considered as the Baseline. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-randomization values. If either the Baseline or post-randomization value was missing, the change from Baseline was set to missing as well. Change from Baseline of Week 16 and Week 24 are incorporated here which are Follow up weeks.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Demonstrated a Clinically Meaningful Increase in FEV1 Over the 12 Week Assessment Period</title>
        <description>FEV1 is forced expiratory volume in 1 second.A participant is defined as a FEV1 responder if he/she achieves a change from baseline FEV1 of &gt;=200ml. To evaluate whether the participant was a responder over 12 weeks, change from baseline FEV1 over 12 weeks was calculated by taking the mean of the changes at Visit 7, Visit 9 and Visit 11. A binary variable was created for each participant with 1 for the responder and 0 for the non-responder. If either Visit 9 or Visit 11 FEV1 data are missing, then the binary variable for the responder over 12 weeks was set to be missing. If Visit 7 data were missing, but Visit 9 and Visit 11 data were available, then the binary variable for the responder over 12 weeks was still calculated.</description>

        <description>Plasma concentration-time data were well described by a 2-compartment model with first order elimination. Plasma concentrations of GSK679586 were determined at Day 1 (Pre-dose, 0.25h, 1.00h), Day 4 (72h), Day 29 (672 h), Day 57 (1344h), Day 61 (1440h), Day 85 (2016h), Day 141 (3360h), Day 169 (4032h) and Follow up visits. However, the derived PK parameters were determined only for the day of infusion administration. i.e. Day 1, Day 29 and Day 57. The AUC at Day 1 indicates AUC(0-1 h), Day 29 indicated AUC(0-672 h) and Day 57 indicated AUC(0-1344h). AUC(0-τ) for each participant was reconstructed from sparse PK sampling using Bayesian prediction obtained from a population PK model using nonlinear mixed effects methods (NONMEM, version V).</description>

        <description>Plasma concentration-time data were well described by a 2-compartment model with first order elimination. Plasma concentrations of GSK679586 were determined at Day 1 (Pre-dose, 0.25h, 1.00h), Day 4 (72h), Day 29 (672h), Day 57 (1344h), Day 61 (1440h), Day 85 (2016h), Day 141 (3360h), Day 169 (4032h) and Follow up visits. However, systemic clearance were determined only for the day of infusion administration. i.e. Day 1, Day 29 and Day 57. The systemic clearance at Day 1 indicates systemic clearance(0-1 h), Day 29 indicated systemic clearance(0-672 h) and Day 57 indicated systemic clearance(0-1344 h). Systemic clearance of parent drug for each participant was reconstructed from sparse PK sampling using Bayesian prediction obtained from a population PK model using nonlinear mixed effects methods (NONMEM, version V).</description>
