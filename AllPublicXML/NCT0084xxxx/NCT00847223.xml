      To determine the EFFICACY and the SAFETY PROFILE and TOXICITY of Zarnestra® in the treatment
      of patients with previously treated mantle cell lymphoma not appropriate for autologous bone
      marrow transplantation. 27 evaluable subjects will be enrolled for an analysis in 2 stages
      (11 for the first stage, 16 for the second).

      Patients who receive at least one dose of Zarnestra® and have at least one post-baseline
      response assessment of discontinued study frug for early progression are evaluable. Subjects
      not evaluable for response will be replaced, up to 35 patients.

    <textblock>
      Zarnestra® will be administered at 300 mg administered orally twice daily for the first 21
      days of each 28-days cycle. Tipifarnib treatment stops no later than day 21 of each cycle.

      Subjects will receive a total of 4 cycles of treatment. Two additional cycles might be
      administered for patients showing improvement to PR after 4 cycles.

      After testing the drug on 11 patients in the first stage, the trial will be terminated if 1
      or fewer respond and the drug will not be considered as effective.

      If two or more patients respond in the first stage, the trial goes on to the second stage to
      include a total of 27 patients.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subject 18 years or older.

             Health Organization 1997 classification.

          -  Patient not able to receive high dose autologous stem cell transplantation with
             relapsed, refractory or progressive MCL after prior anti-neoplastic treatment. Relapse
             or progression since previous anti-neoplastic therapy must be documented by new
             lesions or objective evidence of progression of existing lesions. Biopsy is not
             required.

          -  Ann Arbor stages I-IV.

          -  At least 1 measurable lymph node mass that is &gt;1.5 cm in 2 perpendicular dimensions,
             and has not been previously irradiated or has grown since previous irradiation.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] performance status 0-2.

          -  The following laboratory values at screening,:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.0 G/L and Platelets ≥ 75 G/L

               -  Aspartate transaminase (AST) ≤ 2.5 x ULN; Alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 x ULN;
                  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN; Creatinin level ≤ 150 µmol/L

          -  Female subject is either post-menopausal or surgically sterilized or willing to use an
             acceptable method of birth control (ie, a hormonal contraceptive, intra-uterine
             device, diaphragm with spermicide, condom with spermicide, or abstinence) for the
             duration of the study. Women are neither breast feeding nor pregnant for the duration
             of the study. Confirmation that the subject is not pregnant must be established by a
             negative serum β-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) pregnancy test result obtained
             during screening. Pregnancy testing is not required for post-menopausal or surgically
             sterilized women. Male subject agrees to use an acceptable method for contraception
             for the duration of the study.

             before Day 1 of Cycle 1, and (3) at a minimum 2 years following therapy they had no
             clinical evidence of prostate cancer, and their PSA was undetectable if they underwent
             prostatectomy or &lt;1 ng/mL if they did not undergo prostatectomy.

          -  Active systemic infection requiring treatment.

          -  Previously known HIV positive serology
