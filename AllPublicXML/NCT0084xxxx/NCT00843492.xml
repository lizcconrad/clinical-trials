  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fondaparinux in
      comparison with a heparin (nadroparin) in preventing deep vein thrombosis (blood clots in the
      leg veins), whether symptomatic or detected by ultrasound, and pulmonary embolism (blood
      clots that migrate to the lungs) in patients with leg injuries below the knee that require a
      cast or other type of immobilization but not surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fondaparinux sodium 2.5 mg (1.5
      mg in patients with a creatinine clearance between 30 and 50 mL/min) once daily versus
      Low-Molecular Weight Heparin (nadroparin 2850 anti-Xa IU, 0.3 mL, once daily), with respect
      to the occurrence of venous thromboembolism, death and bleeding complications in patients
      requiring rigid or semi-rigid immobilization for at least 21 days and up to 45 days because
      of isolated nonsurgical below-knee injury. Treatment will be continued up to complete
      mobilization, e.g. plaster cast or brace removal, for a maximum of 45 days. The study will be
      a European, multicentre, randomized, open-label, controlled, two-parallel-group, phase III
      study in 1350 male and female patients 18 years of age or older, presenting with at least one
      additional major risk factor for VTE. After randomization (Day 1), subjects will receive
      subcutaneously, once daily, either fondaparinux or nadroparin up to complete mobilization.
      After cast or brace removal, a systematic, bilateral compression ultrasound will be done in
      all patients. Patients will be contacted five weeks (± one week) after complete mobilization.
      All suspected venous thromboembolic events, including asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis, all
      deaths, and all bleeding events (with the exception of certain types of minor bleeding events
      defined in the protocol) will be reviewed by an independent adjudication committee blind to
      treatment assignment.

    <description>VTE is defined as asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT: the formation of a blood clot in a deep vein) detected by systematic compression ultrasonography, symptomatic DVT, or symptomatic fatal or non-fatal pulmonary embolism (PE). An embolism is a clot in the blood that forms and blocks a blood vessel. A pulmonary embolism is a blood clot that has travelled from elsewhere in the body through the blood stream to block the main artery of the lung or one of its branches. All venous thromboembolic events and deaths were adjudicated by the independent Central Adjudication Committee (CAC).</description>

    <description>The number of participants with VTE (defined as asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis [DVT: the formation of a blood clot in a deep vein] detected by systematic compression ultrasonography, symptomatic DVT, or symptomatic fatal or non-fatal pulmonary embolism [PE]) and death was assessed.

    <description>Major bleeding is defined as bleeding that results in a fatality, symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ, bleeding causing a fall in hemoglobin level of 20 grams/liter (1.24 millimoles/liter) or more compared with the pre-randomization hemoglobin level, or bleeding that leads to a transfusion of two or more units of whole blood or red blood cells. All episodes of bleeding were adjudicated by an independent CAC. The committee members were unaware of the participants' treatment assignment.</description>

    <description>Clinically relevant non-major bleeding that does not qualify as major is defined as bleeding leading to treatment discontinuation, and/or epistaxis (bleeding through the nose) that lasts for more than 5 minutes or necessitates intervention (e.g., packing), spontaneous macroscopic haematuria (blood in urine), gastrointestinal haemorrhage, haemoptysis (coughing up blood), or subcutaneous haematoma (localized collection of blood) &gt; 100 centimeters squared. All episodes of bleeding were adjudicated by an independent CAC. The committee members were unaware of the participants' treatment assignment.</description>

        <description>VTE is defined as asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT: the formation of a blood clot in a deep vein) detected by systematic compression ultrasonography, symptomatic DVT, or symptomatic fatal or non-fatal pulmonary embolism (PE). An embolism is a clot in the blood that forms and blocks a blood vessel. A pulmonary embolism is a blood clot that has travelled from elsewhere in the body through the blood stream to block the main artery of the lung or one of its branches. All venous thromboembolic events and deaths were adjudicated by the independent Central Adjudication Committee (CAC).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Clinically Relevant Non-major Bleeding From Day 1 to Complete Mobilization and From Day 1 up to the Final Visit or Contact</title>
        <description>Clinically relevant non-major bleeding that does not qualify as major is defined as bleeding leading to treatment discontinuation, and/or epistaxis (bleeding through the nose) that lasts for more than 5 minutes or necessitates intervention (e.g., packing), spontaneous macroscopic haematuria (blood in urine), gastrointestinal haemorrhage, haemoptysis (coughing up blood), or subcutaneous haematoma (localized collection of blood) &gt; 100 centimeters squared. All episodes of bleeding were adjudicated by an independent CAC. The committee members were unaware of the participants' treatment assignment.</description>
