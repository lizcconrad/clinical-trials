  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of progressive strength training of the
      fractured limb in patients with hip fracture, during admittance in an acute orthopedic ward.
      The primary study hypothesis is that the training will reduce the strength deficit in the
      fractured limb in comparison with the non-fractured limb. Secondary, that patients following
      the intervention will present larger improvements in physical function compared to controls.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Knee-extension strength in the fractured limb in comparison with the non-fractured limb.</measure>
    <time_frame>At inclusion, at postoperative day 10 and/or at discharge.</time_frame>
    <description>Maximal isometric knee-extension strength in the fractured limb in percentage of non-fractured limb. Isometric knee-extension strength will be measured using an externally fixated handheld dynamometer (Power Track II Commander; JTech Medical, Utah). A stap will be attached to the bed/chair and the patient's ankle (perpendicular to the lower leg), ensuring 90 degrees of knee flexion and an isometric contraction. The transducer will be placed under the strap at ankle level, just proximal to the malleolus, and the participant will be asked to extend the leg as forcefully as possible. Knee-extension strength will be expressed as the maximal voluntary torque per kilo body mass ([NIm]/kg), using the distance between the lateral femoral epicondyle and the center of the transducer and the body mass of each patient. The best of 4 trials for each limb will be used in analyses. The primary analysis will follow the intention-to-treat principle (last observation carried forward).</description>
