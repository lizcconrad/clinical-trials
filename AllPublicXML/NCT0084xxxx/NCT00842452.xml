      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as topotecan, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of topotecan in
      treating patients with gynecologic cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of oral topotecan hydrochloride in
           patients with unresectable gynecologic malignancies.

        -  To determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients.

        -  To obtain pharmacokinetic data to assess plasma concentrations of this drug when
           administered at the MTD.

      Secondary

        -  To explore the response in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral topotecan hydrochloride on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment
      repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients treated at the maximum tolerated dose undergo blood sample collection periodically
      on day 1 of course 1 for pharmacokinetic studies.
