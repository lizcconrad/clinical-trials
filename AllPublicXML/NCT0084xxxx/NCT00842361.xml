    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Japan. The aim of this clinical trial is to investigate the safety
      (with emphasis on hypoglycaemia) after switching from long-acting insulin
      analogue/intermediate-acting insulin or pre-mixed insulin/pre-mixed insulin analogue on a
      twice daily regimen to NN5401 (SIAC, insulin degludec/insulin aspart) on a twice daily
      regimen in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
