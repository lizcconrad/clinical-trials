  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized trial is to test the effectiveness of screening and brief
      intervention for risk drinking by nonpregnant women with specific medical problems
      exacerbated by excessive alcohol consumption. The medical problems are female factor
      infertility, hypertension, diabetes, and osteoporosis, conditions that are costly to treat
      and difficult to manage. Just as pregnant women are thought to be highly motivated to modify
      their alcohol consumption, so women with specific medical problems worsened by alcohol intake
      are an appropriate group to receive a brief intervention.
