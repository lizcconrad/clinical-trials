    <textblock>
      Patients with hormone and docetaxel refractory prostate cancer or relapsed/refractory
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma for which no available standard therapy or therapy which may provide
      clinical benefit is available will be enrolled. Primary objectives: estimate the maximum
      tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicities. Secondary objectives: Response rate,
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles, Prostate Specific Antigen response and renal
      elimination.

             function.

          5. Normal cardiac function in the opinion of the investigator and supported by LVEF 50%
             or greater on the screening echocardiogram (or MUGA), no significant abnormalities on
             the screening ECG (eg, left bundle branch block, III degree AV block, acute myocardial
             infarction, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or QTc interval ≥ 450 msec) and no history
             of additional risk factors for torsades de pointes (eg, heart failure, hypokalemia or
             family history of Long QT Syndrome).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Active secondary malignancy or history of other malignancy within the last two years
             except non-melanoma skin cancers or cervical carcinoma in situ.

             Classification.
