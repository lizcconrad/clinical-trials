      This single-arm, open-label, multi-center study will enroll 60 patients from approximately 20
      centers. All patients who meet study criteria and are currently taking, beginning or resuming
      treatment with Deferasirox will be allowed. The study will begin with a one month run-in
      phase, where all patients will be instructed to take Deferasirox according to their
      physician's current prescribing information.

      Following the run-in phase, patients will enter a three month, assessment phase. During the
      assessment phase, patients will have five general options for taking Deferasirox including
      with or without meals, crushed and added to a soft food or mixed in a liquid of choice.
