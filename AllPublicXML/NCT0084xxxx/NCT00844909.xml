      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and how the body affects
      the drug CNTO 136 in healthy Japanese and Caucasian volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study to assess the safety and
      pharmacokinetics of CNTO 136. In a randomized trial, study medication (CNTO 136 or placebo)
      is assigned by chance. Double-blinded means that neither the investigator nor the volunteer
      know which of the study medication they have been assigned to receive. Pharmacokinetics is
      the study of levels of CNTO 136 circulating in your blood over time. The study population
      will all be male and consist of 30 Japanese and 30 Caucasian volunteers. Three dose levels of
      study agent will be assessed. Participants will be required to stay at the research center
      after study agent administration for the inpatient portion of the study and then required to
      return for out-patient visits. One of 3 dose levels of CNTO 136 will be given just under the
      skin (subcutaneous (SC)). The length of this study will be about 20 weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Demonstrate an understanding of the study and sign an informed consent form

          -  Healthy with no clinically relevant abnormalities as determined by medical history,
             physical examination, blood chemistry assessments, hematologic assessments including
             complete blood count (CBC), coagulation tests, urinalysis, measurement of vital signs,
             and ECG

          -  Japanese volunteers must have been born in Japan, have resided outside of Japan for no
             more than 5 years, and have Japanese parents and maternal and paternal grandparents.
             Caucasian subjects must have Caucasian parents

          -  Have a weight in the range of 60 kg to 90 kg (inclusive), body mass index (BMI) of 19
             kg/m2 to 29 kg/m2

          -  Nonsmoker or agree to smoke no more than 10 cigarettes or 2 cigars per day throughout
             the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Currently have, or have a history of, disease or dysfunction of the pulmonary,
             cardiovascular, endocrine, hematologic, neurological, immune, gastrointestinal,
             genitourinary, or other body system, that is clinically significant in the opinion of
             the investigator

          -  Have any underlying physical or psychological medical condition that, in the opinion
             of the investigator, would make it unlikely that the healthy volunteer will complete
             the study

          -  Have evidence of any chronic medical condition requiring prescription medications (eg,
             hypertension, elevated cholesterol/triglycerides, asthma, or diabetes)

          -  Currently have any known malignancy or have a history of malignancy

          -  Have had major or traumatic surgery within 12 weeks of screening or any surgery within
             1 week.
