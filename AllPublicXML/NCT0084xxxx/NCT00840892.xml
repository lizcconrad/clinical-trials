  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is growing evidence that COPD is a multi-organ system disease. Besides impaired lung
      function, skeletal muscle weakness and weight loss are important determinants of impaired
      exercise performance, decreased quality of life and increased mortality. Based on earlier
      succesful intervention studies in pulmonary rehabilitation settings, MÃ¡xima Medical Centre
      developed an integrated, inter-disciplinary approach to the management of COPD including
      physical exercise, nutritional therapy, education, smoking cessation and psychological
      consultation. This COPD management program consists of a set of protocols that cover patient
      recruitment, diagnostic testing, treatment, follow-up and communication between
      professionals.

      The exercise program and the nutitional therapy are carried out by local physiotherapists and
      dieticians working outside but in conjunction with the hospital. A program in such a setting
      could be substantially less expensive and certainly more easily accessible for many more
      patients than an inpatient or hospital-based outpatient rehabilitation program, as it is
      offered close to a patient's home. This study investigates the (cost-)effectiveness of the
      COPD management program compared to usual care in a randomized controlled trial.

      Patients with moderate to severe COPD and a reduced exercise capacity during an incremental
      exercise test of less than 70% of predicted, are randomised to a treatment or a control
      group. The treatment group will participate in the COPD management program during the first 4
      months after which they will be followed up for the remaining months. Both groups (n=100) are
      followed for 2 years and outcomes will be assessed at the beginning of the program, after 4,
      12 and 24 months by disease-specific and generic measures of health status, body composition,
      skeletal muscle function and exercise capacity. A cost-effectiveness and cost-utility
      analysis with a two-year time horizon will be performed. The analysis is conducted from a
      societal perspectice, including the program costs and all COPD-related direct costs within
      and outside the healthcare sector ans costs of lost productivity.

    <description>The INTERCOM program consisted of exercise training, education, nutritional therapy and smoking cessation support offered by local physiotherapists and dieticians in the proximity of the patient's home and by respiratory nurses in the hospital. The program was divided in a 4-month intensive intervention phase, followed by a 20-month maintenance phase.</description>
