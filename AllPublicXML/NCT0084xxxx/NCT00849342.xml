      This study is conducted in Europe. The aim of this observational study is to investigate the
      effect of switch from other basal insulin treatments to Levemir速 on body weight in obese
      diabetic patients. A local extension will be conducted in Slovenia in order to reach the
      planned 400 patients for the sub-analysis of Slovenian patients.

      Included in the study is a retrospective part to evaluate the weight progress since
      initiation of insulin treatment of another basal insulin and/or oral antidiabetic drugs (OAD)
      and/or bolus insulin therapy. Retrospective data will be collected at baseline and at
      approximately 6 and 12 months before starting insulin detemir therapy.
