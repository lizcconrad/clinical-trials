      This study is to evaluate the NGAL point of care device as an aid in the early risk
      assessment of AKI (acute kidney injury)in an All-Comers ED population.

    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center prospective pilot clinical study to assess the utility of the Triage
      neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) Test as an aid in the early risk assessment
      for development of acute kidney injury (AKI) (sub clinical minimal changes in creatinine
      levels to complete failure resulting in kidney replacement therapy) in an all-comers
      population of patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) and designated for
      hospital admission.. The secondary objectives are to assess the utility of the Triage NGAL
      Test as an aid in the assessment of AKI severity in patients presenting to the ED, to
      determine if the combination of Triage NGAL measurements and clinical judgment can improve
      the early risk assessment for the development of AKI and to correlate Triage NGAL levels to
      patient outcomes.

      Approximately 700 adults presenting to the ED and designated for admission to the hospital
      will be enrolled. The treating physician will note their preliminary ED diagnosis of AKI vs.
      no AKI (including prerenal azotemia, non-progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) and
      preserved renal function) and their level of confidence in that diagnosis as a percentage
      following the initial exam.

      EDTA anti-coagulated blood samples (for Triage NGAL Test) and blood samples for processing to
      serum (for Cystatin C test) will be collected and measured for NGAL and Cystatin C levels in
      all subjects at the following time points:

        -  immediately upon decision to admit to the hospital from the ED [baseline],

        -  at 6 and 12 hours after baseline draw

        -  on days 1, 2 and 3 following admission to the hospital, and

        -  on the day of hospital discharge (if the subject is hospitalized beyond day 3)

      The results of these NGAL and Cystatin C assessments will be blinded to the medical team
      during the study and will not impact the medical management of the subject.

      Blood samples for unblinded standard of care assessment of serum creatinine (analyzed at the
      hospital's laboratory) will also be obtained:

        -  in the ED [baseline],

        -  on days 1, 2 and 3 following admission to the hospital, and

        -  on the day of hospital discharge (if the subject is hospitalized beyond day 3)

      Additional study specific blood samples for blinded assessment of serum creatinine (analyzed
      at the hospital's laboratory) will also be obtained:

      • at 6 and 12 hours after baseline draw
