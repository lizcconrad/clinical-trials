  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atypical antipsychotics (AA) are broadly used to treat a variety of psychiatric and
      neurological disorders in children and adolescents. Weight gain is a common side effect of
      these drugs. AA induced weight gain can be the cause of the metabolic syndrome which is a
      major health concern, as well as cancer and significant psychological disorders. Weight gain
      may also lead to low compliance with AAs.

      A number of studies have been conducted in order to find a way to prevent, reduce or reverse
      AA induced weight gain in children and adolescents, but so far there is no commonly accepted
      treatment for the problem.

      Metformin is an antihyperglycemic drug, approved by the FDA for treatment of type 2 diabetes
      in children older than 10 years of age. The drug usually does not cause hypoglycemia, even in
      high dosage. Contraindications include renal impairment, hepatic disease, a past history of
      lactic acidosis (of any cause), cardiac failure requiring pharmacological therapy, or chronic
      hypoxic lung disease. The drug also should be discontinued temporarily prior to the
      administration of intravenous contrast media and prior to any surgical procedure. The
      reported incidence of lactic acidosis during metformin treatment is less than 0.1 cases per
      1000 patient-years, and the mortality risk is even lower.

      Acute side effects of metformin, which occur in up to 20% of patients, include diarrhea,
      abdominal discomfort, nausea, metallic taste, and anorexia. These usually can be minimized by
      increasing the dosage of the drug slowly, when indicated, and taking it with meals.
      Intestinal absorption of vitamin B 12 and folate often is decreased during chronic metformin
      therapy, and calcium supplements reverse the effect of metformin on vitamin B12 absorption.

      Three studies have studied the effect of metformin on weight gain secondary to use of AAs in
      adults and 3 other studies studied the effect of metformin in children and adolescents. Most
      of these studies have proved the drug to be efficient. No serious side effects have been
      demonstrated in any of these studies.

      Objective- To assess the effect of metformin on body weight of children and adolescents
      treated by AAs.

      Setting- recruitment and follow up would take place in the pediatric ward and outpatient
      clinic at the Ness- Tziona Mental Health Center.

      Participants- 30 adolescents aged 12- 20 years old, treated with AAs, who are overweight as
      defined by more than 10% of what is expected according to age and height.

      Importance of the Study

        1. Identify a medication capable of reducing or preventing weight gain by an AA agent.

        2. Identify an agent capable of improving compliance due to lower side-effect profile of
           AAs.
