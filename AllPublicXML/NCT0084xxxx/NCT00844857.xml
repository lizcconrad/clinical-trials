      The main goal of this study is to help answer the following research question(s) and not to
      treat the child's illness.

        -  Can this study drug make children with bipolar depression feel better?

        -  Does this study drug work better than a placebo (sugar pill)?

        -  Does this study drug cause side effects in children who take it?

        -  Is this drug safe to use in children? (The study drug is a mixture of olanzapine and
           fluoxetine)

    <description>CDRS-R Total score measures the presence and severity of depression in children. The scale consists of 17 items scored on a 1-to-5- or 1-to-7-point scale. A rating of 1 indicates normal functioning. Total scores range from 17 to 113. In general, scores below 20 indicate an absence of depression, scores of 20 to 30 indicate borderline depression, and scores of 40 to 60 indicate moderate depression. Least Square (LS) mean was adjusted for baseline, country, treatment, visit, and treatment times (*) visit interaction.</description>

In general, scores below 20 indicate an absence of depression, scores of 20 to 30 indicate borderline depression, and scores of 40 to 60 indicate moderate depression.

          <title>Percentage of Participants With Response Up to Week 8</title>
          <description>Response is defined as a CDRS-R total score greater than or equal to (≥)50% reduction from baseline and YMRS elevated mood score ≤2. CDRS-R Total score measure the presence and severity of depression in children. The scale consists of 17 items scored on a 1-to-5- or 1-to-7-point scale. Rating of 1 indicates normal function. Scores range: 17 to 113. In general, &lt;20 indicate an absence of depression, scores 20 to 30 indicate borderline depression, and scores of 40 to 60 indicate moderate depression. YMRS is an 11-item scale that measures the severity of manic episodes. Four items are rated on a scale from 0 (symptoms not present) to 8 (symptom extremely severe). The remaining items are rated on a scale from 0 (symptoms not present) to 4 (symptom extremely severe). The YMRS total score ranges from 0 to 60.</description>

          <description>CDRS-R Total score measure the presence and severity of depression in children and consists of 17 items scored on a 1-to-5- or 1-to-7-point scale. Rating of 1 indicates normal function. Total scores range from 17 to 113. In general, scores &lt; 20 indicate an absence of depression, scores of 20 to 30 indicate borderline depression, and scores of 40 to 60 indicate moderate depression. LS mean was adjusted for baseline, country, and treatment.</description>
