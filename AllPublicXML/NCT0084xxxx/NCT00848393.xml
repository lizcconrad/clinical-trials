  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac surgery induces a measurable stress response in patients which leads to increased
      morbidity and mortality post-operatively. Through clinical observation, anesthesiologists
      have determined that varying the combinations of anesthesia drugs used during surgery and
      just after reduces the stress response, and by extension, morbidity and mortality. However,
      only a few studies have explored this phenomenon scientifically.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we aim to demonstrate comparatively that use of dexmedetomidine in addition to
      low dose narcotics reduces the stress response in cardiac surgical patients and results in
      less morbidity and mortality. Additionally, dexmedetomidine should facilitate safe early
      extubation in pediatric cardiac patients, which results in decreased ventilator associated
      co-morbidities. Patients will be randomly assigned to three groups; one group will receive
      low dose fentanyl, one will receive low dose fentanyl with dexmedetomidine, and one will
      receive high dose fentanyl. Blood samples will be collected post-induction, post-sternotomy,
      after going on cardiopulmonary bypass, at the completion of surgery, and post-operatively to
      determine the patients' stress hormone levels. The patients will receive standard
      post-operative care, and clinical data collected as part of this care will be used to
      determine the incidence of morbidity and mortality. The results of the blood tests will be
      correlated with the incidence of morbidity and mortality to demonstrate the relative
      effectiveness of the different anesthesia methods.

      Blood samples will be analyzed for the presence of the stress hormones cortisol, epinephrine,
      norepinephrine, ACTH, Interleukin 8, TNF-alpha, and nitrated albumin. Arterial blood gas,
      glucose and lactate levels, heart rate, blood pressure, use of vasoactive support, length of
      ventilator use, post-operative mortality, post-operative morbidity, length of ICU stay, and
      length of hospital stay will be recorded.

      Children previously enrolled in the surgery study will complete assessments of their
      cognitive ability, developmental status, and emotional and behavioral adjustment. For the
      neuro-developmental outcome follow up, Children's cognitive ability will be assessed using
      the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales, 5th Edition (SB5). The SB5 is a widely-used measure
      of intellectual functioning that is normed for ages 2 and up. The test takes 30-50 minutes to
      administer to young children, and provides an overall IQ score, as well as scores for five
      primary factors of cognitive ability: Fluid Reasoning, Knowledge, Quantitative Reasoning,
      Visual-Spatial Processing; and Working Memory. The SB5 has demonstrated excellent reliability
      and validity.
