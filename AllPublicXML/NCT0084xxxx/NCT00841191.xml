  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the recommended dose of siltuximab monotherapy, in
      participants with solid malignant (cancerous) tumors (a mass in a specific area) and to
      estimate the clinical benefit of siltuximab monotherapy in participants with ovarian cancer
      and with Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) mutant tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-part, Phase 1/2, open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention),
      multiple-dose and dose-escalation study of intravenous (directly into a vein) siltuximab in
      participants with malignant solid tumors. The study tests the safety and effectiveness of the
      experimental drug, siltuximab, in participants with advanced cancer (abnormal tissue that
      grows and spreads in the body). This study also tests how siltuximab is cleared from the body
      and how the body reacts to it. For this reason blood tests will be performed and some
      characteristics of the tumor will be analyzed. Siltuximab will be given by intravenous
      infusion (a fluid or a medicine delivered into a vein by way of a needle) over 1 hour. In
      Phase 1 (Cohort 1-4) doses will be administered in a range of 2.8-15 milligram per kilogram
      (mg/kg). Cohort 5 of Phase 1 will receive the recommended dose and schedule as determined
      from Cohort 1-4. Participants in Phase 1 (Cohort 1-4) will receive 4 administrations of
      siltuximab over a 10-13 week period, while participants in Cohort 5 and Phase 2 will receive
      12 administrations over a 33 week period. Follow-up visits up to 12 weeks after last dose
      will be scheduled. Participants may then be contacted for up to 1 year after the last dose
      for follow-up survival and disease status information. Efficacy will primarily be evaluated
      as per response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) criteria. Participants' safety
      will be monitored at every visit.

    <time_frame>Baseline until disease progression or withdrawal of consent, assessed every 9 weeks up to Week 4 after last dose administration</time_frame>
    <description>The CBR is a confirmed complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) lasting at least for 6 weeks as per response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) criteria. CR: disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level; PR: at least 30 percent decrease in sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD; SD: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since treatment started.</description>

    <description>Overall response is defined as a confirmed CR or PR using RECIST criteria. CR is defined as disappearance of all target lesions and non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level, and PR is defined as at least 30 percent decrease in sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD.</description>

             response evaluation criteria in solid tumors [RECIST], as applicable)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Received any prior systemic therapy or had major surgery for the cancer under study
             within 4 weeks (in the case of nitrosoureas and mitomycin C within 6 weeks) prior to
             first siltuximab administration

          -  Prior anti-interleukin 6 (IL-6) targeted therapy

          -  Serious concurrent illness or history of uncontrolled heart disease such as: unstable
             angina (chest pain due to decreased oxygen being supplied to the heart), congestive
             heart failure (failure of the heart resulting in fluid build-up in the lungs, other
             body tissues, or both), myocardial infarction (heart attack) within preceding 12
             months, clinically significant rhythm or conduction abnormality

          -  Participants with known allergies (over sensitivity to a substance) or clinically
             significant reactions to murine, chimeric, or human proteins

          -  Any uncontrolled medical condition, including the presence of laboratory
             abnormalities, that places the participant at unacceptable risk by participating in
             the study or confounds the ability to interpret data from the study
