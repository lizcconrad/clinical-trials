  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infliximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody directed towards Tumor Necrosis Factor -alpha
      that is largely used in inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

      A relationship between dose and clinical outcomes was shown in populations of RA patients but
      there is an interindividual variability of this relationship. At an individual level, this
      dose-effet relationship can be separated into the dose-concentration (pharmacokinetic or PK)
      and the concentration-effet (pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic or PK-PD) relationships.

      Serum trough concentrations of infliximab have been shown to be variable between patients
      receiving the same treatment regimen. This PK variability may be explained by several factors
      (e.g. genetic and immunological factors). The concentration-effect relationship may also be
      variable and the sources of this variability need to be studied as well. To date no detailed
      infliximab PK analysis has been published. The sources of variability of the dose-effect
      relationship need to be characterized to optimize infliximab dosing regimen in patients.

      The FAKIR study is a multicenter prospective observational study that will focus on patients
      treated with infliximab. Its aims are:

        1. to characterize the PK and PK-PD variability of infliximab in RA, using clinical
           criteria and biomarkers, assessed over time ;

        2. to study the influence of the polymorphism of FCGRT (the gene encoding FcRn) on the PK
           variability of infliximab; to study the influence of the polymorphism of FCGR3A (the
           gene encoding Fc gamma RIIIa) on the PK-PD variability of infliximab; and to study the
           influence of antibodies toward infliximab on the PK and PK-PD variabilities of
           infliximab.
