  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether genetic polymorphisms in drug transporters
      were associated with the side effects of OROS-methylphenidate medication in attention
      deficit/hyperactivity disorder(ADHD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      20 to 30% of children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder(ADHD) do not respond or
      could not tolerate methylphenidate treatment. Drug transporters such as multidrug resistant
      proteins(MDR) plays important role in the clearance of psychotropic drugs and their
      metabolites from brain tissue. It suggested that methylphenidate was a P-glycoprotein(encoded
      by MDR1 gene)substrate and showed inhibitory effects on the P-glycoprotein efflux function.
      Single nucleotide polymorphisms(SNP)in the MDR1 gene were analyzed in children and
      adolescents with OROS-methylphenidate treatment. The hypothesis is that MDR1(ABCB1)
      polymorphisms are associated with the side effects of OROS-methylphenidate.
