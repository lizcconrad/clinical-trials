      The purpose of this study is to determine efficacy and toxicity of recombinant human
      epidermal growth factor (rhEGF) as a preventive drug of oral mucositis during intensive
      chemotherapy with stem cell transplantation in patients with hematologic malignancies.

    <textblock>
      Oral mucositis is one of the most common adverse events during chemotherapy and affects
      quality of life of patients receiving chemotherapy in relation to the dose of drugs. However,
      there is only one drug (palifermin) approved by the US FDA for the prevention of oral
      mucositis and the other methods to prevent or treat oral mucositis are just empirical and
      lack evidences. The results of recent study demonstrated promising efficacy and minimal
      toxicity of recombinant human epidermal growth factor (rhEGF) as a preventive drug of oral
      mucositis in head and neck cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy (Wu HG, et al. Cancer
      2009;115(16):3699-3708). This clinical trial is a double-blind randomized prospective
      single-institutional phase II study to evaluate efficacy and toxicity of recombinant human
      epidermal growth factor (rhEGF) as a preventive drug of oral mucositis during intensive
      chemotherapy with stem cell transplantation in patients with hematologic malignancies.
