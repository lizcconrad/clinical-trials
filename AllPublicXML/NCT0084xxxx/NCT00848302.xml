  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 30 patients with lower extremity disease scheduled to undergo diagnostic angiography
      will undergo baseline bloodwork and IVUS (intravascular ultrasound), followed by dosing with
      L-arginine to assess changes in endothelial function.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will assess doses of regional L-arginine supplementation in patients undergoing elective
      angiography for lower extremity PAD. Assessment of EDR and EIR with IVUS in patent arteries
      will be performed with one of 3 doses of catheter-directed L-arginine. We will obtain plasma
      samples from the peripheral arteries and assay amino acid levels and protein oxidation
      products using mass spectrometry. These experiments will determine the optimal L-arginine
      supplementation dose to be used in further studies. We expect to show that L-arginine
      supplementation will have a more significant effect on vessels less affected by
      atherosclerosis, but that this effect diminishes with greater atheroma accumulation as
      measured by IVUS virtual histology. Also, we expect L-arginine supplementation to be most
      effective in vessels with low baseline L-arginine levels. Lastly, we will compare local
      arterial factors obtained via catheter-directed arterial sampling (NOx, L-arginine,
      nitrotyrosine levels) to traditional serum risk factors (glucose, HbA1c, LDL, homocysteine
      and hs C-reactive protein).
