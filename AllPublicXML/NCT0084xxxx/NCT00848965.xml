    <measure>Weighted Mean Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) at 2-5 Hours Post-dose (1-4 Hours Post-start of Challenge [PSC]) in the Vienna Challenge Chamber (VCC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 8 of each study period (Periods 1-4); up to Day 158</time_frame>
    <description>The TNSS (score of 0-12), defined as the sum of the symptom scores for nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, nasal itch, and sneeze (each scored on 0-3 scale [0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe]) was measured at pre-challenge, and then every 15 minutes from 0.25 to 4 hours PSC. In the VCC, aerosolized allergen is administered in a sealed chamber to evaluate the efficacy of antihistamines/other treatments. Weighted mean TNSS was calculated by dividing the value of the area under the response time curve between 1 and 4 hours (calculated by trapezoidal rule) by the time interval of available data.</description>

    <measure>Weighted Mean Nasal Airflow at 2-5 Hours Post-dose (1-4 Hours Post-start of Challenge)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 8 of each study period (Periods 1-4); up to Day 158</time_frame>
    <description>Allergic rhinitis decreases the passage of air through the nose (nasal airflow) by increasing the nasal airway resistance. Rhinomanometry is used as an objective measurement of airway resistance. Nasal airflow was measured using active anterior rhinomanometry at pre-challenge, and then every 30 minutes from 0.5 to 4 hours post start of VCC. Weighted mean nasal airflow was calculated by dividing the value of the area under the response time curve between 1 and 4 hours (calculated by trapezoidal rule) by the time interval of available data.</description>

    <measure>Weighted Mean Nasal Secretion at 2-5 Hours Post-dose (1-4 Hours Post-start of Challenge)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 8 of each study period (Periods 1-4); up to Day 158</time_frame>
    <description>Nasal secretion was measured by weighing tissues used by participants. Wet tissue weight assessments were made pre-challenge, and then every 30 minutes from 0.5 to 4 hours post start of challenge chamber throughout the study. Weighted mean nasal secretion was calculated by dividing the value of the area under the response time curve between 1 and 4 hours (calculated by trapezoidal rule) by the time interval of available data.</description>

    <measure>Weighted Mean Eye Symptom Score at 2-5 Hours Post-dose (1-4 Hours Post-start of Challenge)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 8 of each study period (Periods 1-4); up to Day 158</time_frame>
    <description>The eye symptom score (total score of 0 [none] to 9 [severe]) was calculated as the sum of the symptom scores for watery eyes, itchy eyes, and red eyes, each of which was scored on a categorical scale from 0 to 3 (0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe), and was measured at pre-challenge, and then every 15 minutes from 0.25 to 4 hours post-start of challenge chamber. Weighted mean eye symptom score was calculated by dividing the value of the area under the response time curve between 1 and 4 hours (calculated by trapezoidal rule) by the time interval of available data.</description>

    <measure>Weighted Mean Global Symptom Score (GSS) at 5 Hours Post-dose (1-4 Hours Post-start of Challenge)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 8 of each study period (Periods 1-4); up to Day 158</time_frame>
    <description>GSS (total score=0-30) is calculated as the sum of sneeze, nasal itch, rhinorrhea, nasal obstruction, cough, itchy throat, itchy ears, watery eyes, itchy eyes, and red eyes SSs, each of which was scored on a categorical scale from 0 to 3 (0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe), as was measured at pre-challenge, and then every 15 mins from 0.25 to 4 hours post-start of challenge chamber. Weighted mean global symptom score was evaluated by dividing the value of the area under the response time curve between 1 and 4 hours (calculated by trapezoidal rule) by the time interval of available data.</description>

    <measure>Glucocorticoid (GC) Receptor Biomarker Levels in Nasal Epithelial Scraping Samples: CCL2</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (pre-dose) and Day 8 of each study period (Periods 1-4); up to Day 158</time_frame>
    <description>AROS Applied Biotechnology (AB) analyzed the nasal epithelial scrapings of participants and generated TaqMan (type of chemistry developed by AB to detect polymerase chain reaction [PCR] products) messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) biomarker expression data for CCL2, a steroid-responsive gene. Preliminary analysis of the mRNA abundance data was performed by Discovery Statistics. mRNA abundance data were normalized to the scores of GAPDH and 18S housekeeping genes. B-actin was not used. CCL2 data are presented by period to show the treatment-by-period interaction. ng, nanograms.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1 (pre-dose) and Day 8 of each study period (Periods 1-4); up to Day 158</time_frame>
    <description>AROS Applied Biotechnology (AB) analyzed the nasal epithelial scrapings of participants and generated TaqMan (type of chemistry developed by AB to detect polymerase chain reaction [PCR] products) messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) biomarker expression data for 7 steroid-responsive genes (DUSP_1_TI, FKBP5, GILZ, PLAU, CCL2, PTGS2, and RGS2) and 3 housekeeping reference genes (GAPDH, 18S, and b-actin).

          <description>Participants received placebo/fluticasone propionate (FP) in a dose of 25, 50, 100, and 200 micrograms (Âµg) once daily as 1 nasal spray into each nostril from 2 separate devices for 8 days each, in a crossover design. Treatment was given in one of five sequences in Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4 (with a minimum of a 14-day washout period between treatments): ABCD, EABC, DEAB, CDEA, and BCDE (A, Placebo; B, FP 25 Âµg: C, FP 50 Âµg; D, FP 100 Âµg; E, FP 200 Âµg). On Day 8 of each treatment period (1 hour post-dose), participants entered the Vienna Challenge Chamber (VCC) for a 4-hour period, and the assessments were conducted 2-5 hours post-dose. All participants attended a follow-up visit within 2 to 4 weeks after their final dose, and the overall duration for participation in the study (screening to follow-up) did not exceed 158 days.</description>

        <title>Weighted Mean Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) at 2-5 Hours Post-dose (1-4 Hours Post-start of Challenge [PSC]) in the Vienna Challenge Chamber (VCC)</title>
        <description>The TNSS (score of 0-12), defined as the sum of the symptom scores for nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, nasal itch, and sneeze (each scored on 0-3 scale [0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe]) was measured at pre-challenge, and then every 15 minutes from 0.25 to 4 hours PSC. In the VCC, aerosolized allergen is administered in a sealed chamber to evaluate the efficacy of antihistamines/other treatments. Weighted mean TNSS was calculated by dividing the value of the area under the response time curve between 1 and 4 hours (calculated by trapezoidal rule) by the time interval of available data.</description>

        <title>Weighted Mean Nasal Airflow at 2-5 Hours Post-dose (1-4 Hours Post-start of Challenge)</title>
        <description>Allergic rhinitis decreases the passage of air through the nose (nasal airflow) by increasing the nasal airway resistance. Rhinomanometry is used as an objective measurement of airway resistance. Nasal airflow was measured using active anterior rhinomanometry at pre-challenge, and then every 30 minutes from 0.5 to 4 hours post start of VCC. Weighted mean nasal airflow was calculated by dividing the value of the area under the response time curve between 1 and 4 hours (calculated by trapezoidal rule) by the time interval of available data.</description>

        <title>Weighted Mean Nasal Secretion at 2-5 Hours Post-dose (1-4 Hours Post-start of Challenge)</title>
        <description>Nasal secretion was measured by weighing tissues used by participants. Wet tissue weight assessments were made pre-challenge, and then every 30 minutes from 0.5 to 4 hours post start of challenge chamber throughout the study. Weighted mean nasal secretion was calculated by dividing the value of the area under the response time curve between 1 and 4 hours (calculated by trapezoidal rule) by the time interval of available data.</description>

        <description>AROS Applied Biotechnology (AB) analyzed the nasal epithelial scrapings of participants and generated TaqMan (type of chemistry developed by AB to detect polymerase chain reaction [PCR] products) messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) biomarker expression data for 7 steroid-responsive genes (DUSP_1_TI, FKBP5, GILZ, PLAU, CCL2, PTGS2, and RGS2) and 3 housekeeping reference genes (GAPDH, 18S, and b-actin). Preliminary analysis of the mRNA abundance data was performed by Discovery Statistics. mRNA abundance data were normalized to the scores of GAPDH and 18S housekeeping genes. B-actin was not used.</description>
