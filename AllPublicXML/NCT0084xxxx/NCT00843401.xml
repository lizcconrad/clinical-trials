      1.0 BACKGROUND

      A common method for assessing the respiratory status of hospitalized pediatric and neonatal
      patients is the use of pulse oximetry. This noninvasive device uses a light emitting diode
      (LED) emitter, which is applied to an area of the body with good local blood flow. Red and
      infrared light is shined through the blood-perfused tissue under the sensor and the detected
      light information is sent back to a signal processing unit, or monitor, for calculation of
      oxygen saturation (SpO2)1. Typically the sensor may be placed either on the forehead, a
      finger, or in neonates - the foot, palm or toe. Use of this noninvasive method provides
      continuous information on the oxygenation status of patients and has greatly reduced the
      number of arterial blood gas punctures or samples required for patient care.

      While the advantages of noninvasive pulse oximetry are significant, there are a number of
      factors that can negatively impact the performance of the device2. Patient monitoring during
      low saturation episodes has been one of the challenges to optimal device performance.
      Improvements to sensor technology over the last 20 years have progressively improved the
      accuracy and reliability of the device. Since their introduction to clinical care in the
      1980's, a number of improvements have been made to increase the accuracy of pulse oximetry in
      oxygen saturations of 80% and below.

      Nonetheless, while much of the clinical research on pulse oximetry sensors over the years has
      evaluated device accuracy and reliability, limited data are available in these conditions1,6.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of new pulse oximetry sensors
      specifically designed for low saturation episodes in pediatric and neonatal patients. Results
      of this study will provide basic information to drive further improvements in the technology.

      2.0 PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES

      The general purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, accuracy and performance of
      pediatric and neonatal oximetry sensors over clinically relevant ranges of arterial
      saturations between 60-100%.

      The study objectives are as follows:

        1. To evaluate the accuracy of a neonatal sensor in the saturation range of 70-80% in the
           following weight category: 0-5kg.

        2. To evaluate the accuracy of neonatal and pediatric transmission (digit/foot/hand)
           sensors in the saturation range of 60-80% in the following weight categories: 0-5kg;
           and, 5-40kg.

        3. To evaluate the accuracy of neonatal and pediatric transmission (digit/foot/hand)
           sensors in the saturation range of 80-100% in the following weight ranges: 0-5kg; and,
           5-40kg.

      These objectives will be achieved by enrolling hospitalized patients from several neonatal
      and pediatric units, including cardiac cath lab, OR and intensive care areas. Table 1 below
      outlines the specifics for data collection.

      (30 data points targeted)

      *Data required for 70-80% saturation range only

      Data may be collected continuously from the test and reference devices by a validated
      computer data acquisition system and/or by Case Report Form (CRF) recording, for direct
      comparison to measurements taken from Co-Oximetry (or arterial blood gases (ABGs) if
      Co-Oximetry is not an option). Arterial blood sampling will be obtained as necessary for
      patient management as defined by the attending physician.

      3.0 DEFINITION OF TERMS

      3.1 Pulse oximetry sensors: Pulse oximetry sensors are devices, which are attached to the
      skin (hand, forehead, finger, toe, foot) with or without an adhesive material and connected
      to a signal-processing unit for the purpose of noninvasive oxygen saturation monitoring. For
      the purposes of this study, three different sensors will be simultaneously placed on each
      enrolled patient: a reference sensor and two test sensors (Nellcor Puritan Bennett LLC,
      Boulder, CO, and Masimo Corporation, Irvine, CA). The Masimo sensor will be a rainbow R25,
      R25-L, R20 or R20-L, and the Nellcor sensor will be an OxiMax MAX-A, MAX-P, MAX-I or MAX-N.
      All sensors are currently available on the market but the Masimo sensors have not been
      compared to the Nellcor sensors in head-to-head tests. During the study, a Masimo sensor will
      be connected to a Masimo bedside pulse oximetry monitor (the Radical-7) via a standard
      patient cable, and a Nellcor sensor will be connected to a Nellcor bedside pulse oximetry
      monitor (the N-600x) via a standard patient cable.

      3.2 Sensor accuracy: Sensor accuracy is the capability of the tested sensor to reflect oxygen
      saturations that are consistent with those obtained directly from arterial blood sampling and
      evaluated with Co-Oximetry. 3.3 Skin color: For the purposes of this study, skin color will
      be assessed with Nellcor's visual inspection rating scale (i.e., 1 very light, 2 olive hue, 3
      dark olive, 4 extremely dark).

      3.4 Data point: Paired data value from Co-Oximetry and the test sensor. 3.5 Transmission
      sensor: A sensor where the emitter and photodetector are opposite of each other, with the
      measuring site (i.e., digit) in-between 3.6 Reflectance sensor: A sensor where the emitter
      and photodetector are next to each other and on top of the measuring site.

      4.0 MATERIALS AND METHODS 4.1 Study Design. This is a multicenter observational study wherein
      the information collected on the test devices will not be used for clinical management. A
      repeated-measures experimental design will be used to compare the test sensors with
      conventional oximetry and Co-Oximetry, the defined &quot;Gold Standard&quot;. Both of the test sensors
      and a reference sensor will be simultaneously applied to each subject. The reference sensor
      will be applied for the patient's clinical management, while the test sensors will be applied
      to an extremity as indicated.

      A minimum of 50 subjects with a minimum of 100 data points across sites will be necessary to
      address subject-to-subject variability and to yield a statistically significant RMSD.
      Enrollment in the study will be suspended as soon as both minimums are achieved. A data point
      is defined as a paired data value from Co-Oximetry and the test sensors. If high variability
      is observed, a need for more subjects or data-points may be determined.

      5.0 STUDY PROCEDURE

      All patients who meet the eligibility criteria for the study, after having signed the
      Informed Consent will have the following procedures carried out:

      5.1 The reference sensor will be applied according to the product Directions For Use7 (DFU),
      while the test sensor or sensors will be applied to a recommended site per the test sensor's
      DFU.

      5.2 Demographic (the patient's physical characteristics) and baseline data will be collected.
      5.3 Skin color. For the purposes of this study, skin color will be assessed with Nellcor's
      visual inspection rating scale (i.e., 1 very light, 2 olive hue, 3 dark olive, 4 extremely
      dark).

      5.4 The date, time, and test sensor tracking numbers will be recorded on the CRF.

      5.5 Each sensor will be connected to a patient cable, which will be connected to a SpO2
      monitor. The monitors connected to the Nellcor and Masimo test sensors will not be used for
      patient care management decisions. Alarms on the test sensors/monitors will be inactivated
      prior to study use to avoid patient management confusion.

      5.6 Test sensors and data collection will be discontinued five to fifteen minutes after the
      last anticipated arterial blood draw. The date and time of sensor discontinuance will be
      recorded on the CRF.

      A sample study procedure can be found in Attachment A. A sample Adverse Event Form can be
      found in Attachment B.

      6.0 DATA ANALYSIS

      Pulse oximetry measurements of saturation from the test devices (sensors) will be compared to
      Co-Oximetry measurements of arterial oxygen saturation to demonstrate that the test sensors
      meet the oxygen saturation accuracy specifications for SpO2 when used on neonatal and
      pediatric populations.

      SpO2 accuracy will be determined by calculating the root mean square of the differences
      (RMSD) between test sensor and SaO2 CO-oximeter (or ABG) value to the following equation:

      RMSD = where d is the difference between SpO2 and SaO2. Paired data values may then be
      plotted comparing the Pulse-Oximetry values and Co-Oximetry values, across the saturation
      range of interest (i.e., ≤80%).

      7.0 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING All known and anticipated adverse events associated with this
      study are identified in Section 8.0, Risk Analysis. All reportable anticipated, and
      unanticipated, adverse events will be documented on the Adverse Event Form.

      8.0 RISK ANALYSIS

      The risks to participation in this study are primarily physical. Involvement in this study
      requires the addition of two additional pulse oximetry sensors to the extremities of the
      subjects. There are no psychological, social, economic, legal or other risks that have been
      identified. We believe that the risks from the devices and the study procedure are
      non-significant.

      Physical risks from the use of the devices may consist principally of a burn to the skin.
      Pulse oximetry sensors are attached to the fingers or other skin surfaces, and use light to
      measure saturation, generating a small amount of heat. Because of the low amount of current
      required to power the LED's, risk of burn is minimal. The long history of safe performance of
      Nellcor and Masimo Pulse Oximetry in the marketplace is evidence that this risk is very low.
      In addition, the short duration of this study makes this risk extremely unlikely.

      The application and removal of oximetry or other non-invasive tissue sensors present a
      minimal risk to the subject. There may be minor discomfort associated with removal of
      adhesive sensors or a reaction to the standard adhesive. Injury from a reaction to a sensor
      adhesive is rare.

      9.0 BENEFITS

      There are no direct benefits to subjects who participate in these studies. Benefits from the
      study will be the overall improvement of patient care, as a sensor can be developed which is
      expected to be accurate and reliable in reporting saturations below the 80% saturation range.
      Future patients will benefit from the accurate and reliable products that are developed using
      the procedure described above.

      10.0 STATEMENT OF NON-SIGNIFICANT RISK

      Nellcor believes that this is a &quot;non-significant risk&quot; device study due to the nature of the
      devices being tested. Utilizing the information presented in Section 9.0 and the FDA criteria
      listed below to distinguish between significant and non-significant risk devices, Nellcor has
      determined that the devices referred to in the Protocol present no potential for serious risk
      to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject and are NOT:

        1. Implants; or

        2. Used in supporting or sustaining human life; or

        3. Substantially important in diagnosing, curing, mitigating or treating disease or in
           preventing impairment of human health.

      Nellcor requests that the IRB indicate its agreement with this determination of risk in its
      letter of approval for this study.

      11.0 ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS

      No therapeutic modifications are proposed in this study. Written informed consent will be
      obtained from each participating patient. If the patient is a minor, written informed consent
      will be obtained from the subject's parents or legal guardian(s) and their permission sought
      for participation in this study. Federal policies for protection of human subjects will be
      followed at all times8.

      12.0 CONFIDENTIALITY

      Subject confidentiality will be kept at all times. Patient records may be made available to
      employees from Nellcor and the United States of America Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      for data review only. The results of this study may be presented at meetings or in
      publications; however, subject identity will not be disclosed.
