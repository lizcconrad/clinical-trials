      The objective of this study is to test the usability of the Alice PDx device by both the end
      user (patient/participant) and the sleep technician. Data will be collected via
      questionnaires regarding the participant's ability to understand the participant user manual
      under home conditions and the technician's ability to set up the Alice PDx according to the
      health care provider manual. This study will also compare the physiological data recorded by
      the Alice PDx to the physiological data recorded by its predicate device the Alice 5 System
      and validate its equivalence. This will be evaluated by comparing the manual study scores for
      detected apnea and hypopnea events and on an event by event basis during a standard
      polysomnography (PSG)/ sleep study. The study will test the ability of the Alice PDx to
      record good quality data as determined by the Good Study Indicator (GSI) function of the
      Alice PDx firmware.

      The primary hypothesis is that the participant will be able to successfully apply the Alice
      PDx basic leads following the participant user manual instructions and the sleep technician
      will be able to successfully apply the advanced leads in preparation for the sleep study. In
      addition, it will be demonstrated that the Alice PDx is equivalent to the Alice 5 System in
      its intent to record, display and print physiological data to the clinician/physician in
      order to aid in the screening/follow-up diagnosis of respiratory sleep disorders.

    <textblock>
      Alice PDx is a portable, diagnostic recording device. It may be used for obstructive sleep
      screening as well as follow-up and diagnostic assessment. The device may be used in a sleep
      lab or clinical setting by trained professionals and it may be used at home by patients as
      directed by their health care provider. The Alice PDx device is not currently approved by the
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

      The Alice PDx device is capable of recording various physiological inputs and storing the
      data locally on a removable storage card. The device may also be connected directly to a PC
      (personal computer) running the Alice Sleepware software application. Sleepware can display
      live or pre-recorded data in a resolution consistent with the computer hardware
      specifications.

    <description>The Alice PDx incorporates a unique Good Study Indicator (GSI). The GSI is a predicated on airflow and oximeter signal quality and displays the amount of &quot;good quality data&quot; needed for a study to be complete and valid. The GSI visually displays the amount of good quality data in 25-percent increments on the Alice PDx screen. For purposes of this secondary objective this number was compared from participants who set-up and wore the device at home and those that wore the device in a sleep lab set up by a sleep technician.</description>

        <title>The Secondary Objective of This Study is to Compare the Measurements of the Alice PDx When Patients Complete the Set-up of the Device at Home and When Patients Are Set up by a Sleep Technician in the Sleep Laboratory.</title>
        <description>The Alice PDx incorporates a unique Good Study Indicator (GSI). The GSI is a predicated on airflow and oximeter signal quality and displays the amount of &quot;good quality data&quot; needed for a study to be complete and valid. The GSI visually displays the amount of good quality data in 25-percent increments on the Alice PDx screen. For purposes of this secondary objective this number was compared from participants who set-up and wore the device at home and those that wore the device in a sleep lab set up by a sleep technician.</description>
