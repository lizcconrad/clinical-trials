    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn if paravertebral block (PVB) will reduce chronic pain
      after surgery. Our hypothesis is that chronic pain from breast surgery as a consequence of
      central sensitization can be prevented by blocking sensory input to the CNS during surgery
      and the immediate post-operative period.
