          <description>Outcome measure analysed at 1, 9 and 18 months, 2 and 3 years. Clinically-driven is defined as: Revascularization of the stent with evidence of new distal ischemic signs (worsening Rutherford Becker Clinical Category that is clearly referable to the target lesion, and target lesion diameter stenosis ≥ 50% determined by duplex ultrasound or arteriography.) (Note: This does not include coincidental overlap of a PTA balloon or stent into a study stent, that has &lt;50% stenosis, while treating a non-target lesion in the target vessel).</description>
