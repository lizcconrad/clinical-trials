      The purpose of this study is to describe the epidemiology of pulmonary hypertension in
      individuals with HIV infection and to investigate its pathogenesis. We propose to conduct a
      prospective observational cohort study to determine the association between highly active
      antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and viral suppression in HIV-infected patients who have been
      identified to have pre-clinical pulmonary hypertension (Aim 1). In addition, we will
      investigate the mechanistic role of the HIV-1 Nef protein and HHV-8 infection in the
      development and progression of pulmonary hypertension in individuals with HIV (Aim 2). We
      will also investigate endothelial function in HIV-infected patients with pulmonary
      hypertension (Aim 3).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Infection with HIV greater than 6 months in duration

          2. Right heart catheterization showing PASP &gt; 30mm Hg

          3. Ability to provide reliable history of HIV medications or has received the majority of
             medical care from San Francisco General Hospital with available records of medical
             treatment.

          4. Ability to participate in follow-up for the duration of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known significant cardiovascular disease, including clinically significant valvular
             heart disease, congenital heart disease, current or prior symptomatic coronary
             disease, or known cardiomyopathy.

          2. Any known pulmonary disease that could potentially cause pulmonary hypertension.

          3. A pO2 by pulse oximetry below 90% on room air.

          4. Obstructive sleep apnea.

          5. Known collagen vascular disease.

          6. History of anorexigen use

               -  7. Age less than 18 years old.

               -  8. Other co-morbidities for which the investigators, in conjunction with the
                  primary care provider, believe render the participant with an expected survival
                  of 6 months or less.
