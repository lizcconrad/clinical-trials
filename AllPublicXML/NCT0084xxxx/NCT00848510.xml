  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to test an experimental drug called EMD 525797 (Abituzumab). This drug
      is not yet approved for sale and has only been tested in a small number of people to date
      (prior to this study starting another research study was carried out involving 37 healthy
      volunteers receiving the study drug). Until more is known about this study drug, it can only
      be used in research studies.

      This research study is planned to answer important questions about how the study drug is
      tolerated and how it may work in subjects with ovarian and colorectal cancer which has spread
      to the liver (i.e. metastatic cancer). The Sponsor (Merck KGaA) of this study is developing
      the study drug.

    <measure>Number of Subjects With Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Toxicity was graded using National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 3.0. A DLT was defined as any Grade 3 or 4 haematological or non-haematological toxicity occurring during the first 4 weeks of treatment (that is, until the beginning of Week 5, with the exception of Grade 3 asymptomatic increase in liver function tests (aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase [ALT], and alkaline phosphatase [ALP]) returning to Baseline within 7 days.), at any dose level, for which a causal relationship to the investigative medicinal product could not be ruled out by the Investigator and/or the Sponsor.</description>

    <measure>Volume Transfer Coefficient of Contrast Agent Across the Capillary Walls</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening 1, screening 2, Week 1 Day 2, Week 1 Day 5, and Week 2 Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Volume transfer coefficient was defined as the volume transfer coefficient of contrast agent across the capillary wall, reflecting endothelial permeability and blood flow. Volumetric transfer coefficient was measured by dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). DCE-MRI is a noninvasive quantitative method of investigating microvascular structure and function by tracking the pharmacokinetics of injected low molecular weight contrast agents as they pass through tumor vasculature.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Serious TEAEs, TEAEs Leading to Discontinuation and TEAEs Leading to Death</measure>
    <time_frame>From the initiation of the trial treatment until 30 days after last administration of trial treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) was defined as any new untoward medical occurrences/worsening of pre-existing medical condition without regard to possibility of causal relationship. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/ significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect. TEAEs were the AEs that occurred between first dose of study drug and up to 30 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects With Best Overall Response, Tumor Response and Clinical Benefit</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor response was assessed by the Investigator, based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.0 criteria. Tumor response was defined as the presence of a &quot;best overall response&quot; of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). CR: Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and/or normalization of serum levels of tumor markers. PR: At least a 30 percent decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of the LD of target lesions. The qualification of a CR or of a PR needed a confirmation by a second computed tomography (CT) scan at least 4 weeks after the first scan. Best overall response was derived programmatically as the best response recorded from the first investigation medicinal product administration until disease progression. Clinical benefit was defined as the presence of a &quot;best overall response&quot; of complete response or partial response or stable disease lasting at least 6 weeks.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects With Worsened Post Baseline Shift in ECOG Performance Status Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks after last dose administration</time_frame>
    <description>The number of subjects who experienced worse post baseline shift were assessed as per ECOG performance status score recorded during the treatment. The ECOG score is categorized as Grade 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 where Grade 0=fully active, Grade 1=restricted in physically strenuous activity, Grade 2=unable to carry out any work activities, Grade 3=capable of only limited self-care and Grade 4=completely disabled.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects With Positive Binding Abituzumab Antibodies</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 of Weeks 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and week 11 and end of study (EOS) visit (4 weeks after last dose administration)</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects were defined as abituzumab positive if at least one positive result of antibodies against abituzumab was observed. In all other cases, subjects were defined as abituzumab negative.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Time from first study drug intake to disease progression, death or last tumor assessment until end of trial visit (4 weeks after last dose administration)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as the time from first study drug intake until radiological progression (based on RECIST Version 1.0) or death due to any cause. Only deaths within 84 days of last tumor assessment are considered. Subjects without event were censored on the date of last tumor assessment. Investigator read was the assessment of all imaging by the treating physician at the local trial site.</description>

          <description>An adverse event (AE) was defined as any new untoward medical occurrences/worsening of pre-existing medical condition without regard to possibility of causal relationship. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/ significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect. TEAEs were the AEs that occurred between first dose of study drug and up to 30 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state.</description>

        <title>Number of Subjects With Best Overall Response, Tumor Response and Clinical Benefit</title>
        <description>Tumor response was assessed by the Investigator, based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.0 criteria. Tumor response was defined as the presence of a “best overall response” of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). CR: Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and/or normalization of serum levels of tumor markers. PR: At least a 30 percent decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of the LD of target lesions. The qualification of a CR or of a PR needed a confirmation by a second computed tomography (CT) scan at least 4 weeks after the first scan. Best overall response was derived programmatically as the best response recorded from the first investigation medicinal product administration until disease progression. Clinical benefit was defined as the presence of a “best overall response” of complete response or partial response or stable disease lasting at least 6 weeks.</description>
