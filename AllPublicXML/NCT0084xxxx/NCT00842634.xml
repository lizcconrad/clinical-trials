  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is being carried out to study a new way to possibly treat HIV. This agent
      is called a &quot;Zinc Finger Nuclease&quot; or ZFN for short. ZFNs are proteins that can delete
      another protein named CCR5. This CCR5 protein is required for certain common types of HIV
      (CCR5 tropic) to enter into and infect T-cells. T-cells are one of the white blood cells used
      by the body to fight HIV. The most important T-cells are those called &quot;CD4 T-cells.&quot;

      Some people are born without CCR5 on their T-cells. These people remain healthy and are
      resistant to infection with HIV. Other people have a low number of CCR5 on their T-cells, and
      their HIV disease is less severe and is slower to cause disease (AIDS).

      In order to delete the CCR5 protein on the T cells, this study will isolate large numbers of
      T-cells from subjects, and then deliver the ZFNs using a delivery vehicle called a viral
      vector. The viral vector used in this study is called an adenoviral vector. The vector is
      added to the cells at the beginning of the manufacture process and the ZFNs knock out the
      CCR5 protein. By the time T-cells are returned to subjects, there is minimal adenovirus or
      ZFN present. The removal of the CCR5 protein on the T-cells subjects receive, however, is
      permanent.

      The purpose of this research study is to find out whether &quot;zinc finger&quot; modified T-cells are

        1. safe to give to humans and

        2. find how &quot;zinc finger&quot; modified T cell affects HIV

      This is an experimental study. Laboratory studies have shown that when CD4 T-cells are
      modified with &quot;zinc fingers&quot;, HIV is prevented from killing the CD4 T cells. On the basis of
      these laboratory results, there is the potential that &quot;zinc fingers&quot; may work in humans
      infected with HIV and improve their immune system by allowing their CD4 T-cells to survive
      longer (HIV usually kills T cells it infects).

      All subjects who receive ZFN Modified CD4+T cells will enroll in a Long Term, Follow-up study
      to monitor subjects. Subjects will be followed every 3 months for four years. If the ZFN
      Modified CD4+T cells are no longer found in the blood after four years, then subjects will be
      contacted yearly for the next 6 years. If the ZFN Modified CD4+T cells are found in the blood
      at year four, then the subjects will continue to be seen once a year until the ZFN Modified
      CD4+T cells are no longer found in the blood for a maximum of 10 years.
