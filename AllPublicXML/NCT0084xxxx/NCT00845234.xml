  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) administers a shock to terminate potentially
      life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. The device saves lives, but presents psychological
      challenges for patients. At present, there is a paucity of brief interventions for ICD
      patients designed for administration in a clinic setting that considers issues of cost, time,
      and available resources. The present study examined the impact of a brief cognitive
      behavioral (CBT) educational intervention on primary endpoints of patient acceptance and
      quality of life and secondary endpoints of depression and anxiety. It was hypothesized that
      the intervention would result in significant improvements primary and secondary endpoints for
      participants in the intervention group.

    <description>Intervention consisted of a brief, educational CBT intervention and included the following domain areas: ICD knowledge and post-discharge care, understanding shock, stress management, family and relationships, device recall, and survivorship. The intervention was provided at baseline (0 weeks). Intervention was led by investigator and lasted 15 minutes in duration.</description>
