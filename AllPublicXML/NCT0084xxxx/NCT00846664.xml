      Patients will be performing Logan short arc banding protocols to see the effect on multifidus
      size

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The subjects will initially be scanned by diagnostic ultrasound by to assess the cross
      sectional area of their lumbar multifidi. Then they will perform 3 sets of 30 second periods
      of Logan Short Arc Banding on the ATM machine twice a week for 4 weeks and then they will be
      scanned again using diagnostic ultrasound to assess the effects of the rehabilitation
      exercise.
