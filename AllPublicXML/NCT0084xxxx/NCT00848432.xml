      This study set out to determine the duration of maintenance treatment with therapeutic
      risperidone dose in schizophrenia. In a multi-center, open label, randomized, controlled
      study design, patients with schizophrenia who were clinically stabilized following an acute
      episode were randomly assigned to a 'maintenance group' (optimal therapeutic doses continued
      for at least 1 year), a 4-week group (optimal therapeutic doses continued for 4 weeks
      followed by a 50% dose reduction that was maintained for at least 11 months) or a 26-week
      group (optimal therapeutic doses continued for 26 weeks followed by a 50% dose reduction for
      at least another 6 months).

      Prevention of relapse is the crucial task in the maintenance treatment of schizophrenia. This
      study set out to determine the duration of maintenance treatment with therapeutic risperidone
      dose in schizophrenia. In a multi-center, open label, randomized, controlled study design,
      patients with schizophrenia who were clinically stabilized following an acute episode were
      randomly assigned to a 'maintenance group' (optimal therapeutic doses continued for at least
      1 year), a 4-week group (optimal therapeutic doses continued for 4 weeks followed by a 50%
      dose reduction that was maintained for at least 11 months) or a 26-week group (optimal
      therapeutic doses continued for 26 weeks followed by a 50% dose reduction for at least
      another 6 months).
