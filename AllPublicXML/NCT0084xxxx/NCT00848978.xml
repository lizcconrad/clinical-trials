      The Health Enhancing Strength Training in Nonagenarians (STRONG) is a randomised control
      trial to assess the effectiveness of an aerobic and strength training program for improving
      functional capacity and quality of life in nonagenarians. Sixty (51 women) nonagenarians (age
      range: 90-102 years) who live in a geriatric nursing home will be randomly assigned to either
      a usual care (control) group (n=30) or an intervention (training) group (n=30). Participants
      allocated in the usual care group will receive general physical activity guidelines and
      participants allocated in the intervention group will also enroll in three weekly
      non-consecutive individualized training sessions (~45-50 min each) during 8 weeks. The
      exercise program will consist of muscular strength [with a special focus on leg press at 30%
      (start of the program) to 70% 1 repetition maximum (end)] and aerobic exercises
      (cycle-ergometry during 3-5 to 15 minutes at 12-14 points in the rate of perceived exertion
      scale). Results from STRONG will help to better understand the potential of regular physical
      activity for improving the well-being of the oldest population groups.

    <description>Participants allocated in the intervention group will be enrolled in three weekly non-consecutive training sessions for 8 weeks. Each session will last for about 45-50 min. The exercise program will consist of muscular strength and aerobic exercises. Each session will start and end with a low intensity ~5-7 min warm-up and cool-down period respectively, consisting mainly of stretching exercises involving all major muscle groups.</description>
