  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In spite of multiple attempts to improve the efficacy of first-line chemotherapy in advanced
      gastric cancer, the progress that has been achieved so far is rather limited, and many
      investigators are exploring newer regimens.A combination of decetaxel (Taxotere) with
      Cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5FU) is considered one of the most effective regimens in this
      disease. However, it is associated with significant toxicity which avoided its general
      adaptation by the medical community. The current study is exploring a newer way to administer
      these three drugs, hopefully making the regimen more comfortable, less toxic and maybe even
      more effective. We will do this by changing the dose and timing of Taxotere and Cisplating,
      by replacing protracted infusion of 5FU with tablets of Capecitabine (Xeloda) and by adding
      the anti-angiogenic drug, Bevacizumab (Avastin), which had shown encouraging results in this
      disease.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients above 18 years of age at the time of enrollment.

          2. Histologically confirmed previously untreated metastatic or unresectable
             adenocarcinoma of the stomach.

          3. Patients must have at least one measurable lesion (measuring &gt;10mm in standard CT or
             &gt;5mm in spiral CT).

          4. Adequate organ function.

          5. Life expectancy of at least three months.

          6. Patients must have an ECOG Performance Status of 0 or 1.

          7. Signed written informed consent to participate in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Participation in an investigational trial within 30 days of the screening visit.

          2. Known allergy or any other adverse reaction to any of the study drugs or to any
             related compound.

          3. Prior anti-angiogenic treatment, chemotherapy or radiotherapy for advanced disease.
             Patients will be eligible if they had received adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy
             more than 12 months prior to enrollment.

          4. Prior treatment with drugs included in the investigational regimen. Prior use of
             5-fluorouracil in the adjuvant setting is allowed.

          5. Significant bleeding by the primary tumor (in unoperated patients).

          6. Clinically significant (i.e. active) cardiovascular disease. This includes, but is not
             limited to, the following examples:

               -  Cerebrovascular accidents (up to 6 months prior to randomization)

               -  Myocardial infarction (up to 1 year prior to randomization).

               -  Serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication.

               -  Clinically significant ECG findings. Patients who suffer from serious cardiac
                  arrhythmia requiring medication can enter the study only if they are considered
                  to be in a stable condition regarding both the arrhythmia and their medication.
                  Patients with pacemakers are allowed to enter the study only if they are
                  considered as being in a stable condition. In case of doubt, the investigator
                  should obtain a consultation with a local cardiologist.

          7. Major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 28 days
             prior to study treatment start, not fully healed wounds, or anticipation of the need
             for major surgical procedure during the course of the study.

          8. Severe co-morbid conditions including uncontrolled diabetes or hypertension, cerebral
             vascular disease or uncontrolled infection.

             enrollment.

         12. Clinically significant hearing loss.

         13. Patients with a history of seizure disorder who are receiving phenytoin,
             phenobarbital, or other antiepileptic medication.

         14. Known peripheral neuropathy of CTCAE v 3.0 Grade 1 or more.

         15. Organ allografts requiring immunosuppressive therapy.

         16. Serious, non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture.
