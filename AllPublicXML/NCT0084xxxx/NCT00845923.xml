      This proof of concept study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of topically
      administered Civamide Patch for the treatment of moderate to severe daily pain associated
      with postherpetic neuralgia localized to the trunk, and with localized post-incisional
      neuropathic pain syndromes on the trunk.

      There will be up to approximately 20 evaluable subjects in this open-label study. The study
      is composed of a 1-week non-treatment Baseline Period (Day -7 to -1), during which subjects
      will be required to complete a Daily Diary assessing overall pain and sleep interference. The
      1-week Baseline Period will be followed by a 4-week Treatment Period, in which subjects will
      apply the Civamide Patch (0.015%) daily 12 hours per day, for a period of 4 weeks, complete a
      Daily Diary assessing overall pain and sleep interference, followed by a 2-week
      Post-Treatment Observation Period. In the course of the study, subjects will visit the clinic
      a total of five times for physical examinations, vital signs, review of diaries, and
      distribution and collection of test patches. Efficacy assessment will be the mean change from
      Baseline Period in efficacy variables during the course of the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject healthy other than history of postherpetic neuralgia of at least 6 months
             after healing of a herpes zoster skin rash.

          -  Subject must be taking a stable dose of a medication(s) for PHN pain, and be expected
             to remain on this stable daily dose throughout the study.

          -  Single, localized area of skin on trunk with PHN, measuring approximately 10 x 14 cm
             or less.

          -  Average Daily Pain Score of 4 or higher on 11-point Likert scale during the 7-Day
             Baseline Period.

          -  Males or females between 18 to 80 years of age, inclusive.

          -  Non-pregnant, non-lactating females of childbearing potential who agree to use

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has area of skin on trunk affected by PHN, greater than an area amendable to
             treatment by the patch, or exhibits active skin disease, infection, severe erythema,
             or other compromise in integrity of skin which, could influence or interfere with the
             evaluation of safety or efficacy.

          -  Subject has history of frequent headache or other painful conditions (other than that
             associated with PHN), expected to require more than twice a week additional
             administration of OTC acetaminophen (≤ 1000 mg total daily dose for pain management).

          -  Clinical, historical or previous laboratory evidence of significant cardiovascular,
             renal, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, hepatic, endocrine, neurological, psychological,
             or other systemic disease that might confound the results of study or pose an
