  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pregnenolone (PREG) is a neurosteroid, which displays multiple effects on the central nervous
      system, and may be beneficial in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia. Our recent
      8-week, randomized, double-blind trial among patients with chronic schizophrenia and
      schizoaffective disorders, in which PREG versus placebo and DHEA have been added to
      conventional or atypical antipsychotics have yielded encouraging results with low-dose PREG
      (30 mg/day; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00140192; Ritsner et al., in press). The goal of
      the present study is to evaluate the potential role of PREG's augmentation compared to
      placebo in the treatment of young patients with newly diagnosed schizophrenia or
      schizophreniform or schizoaffective disorders.

      In a 8-week, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial PREG (50 mg/day) or placebo
      capsules will be added to the stable ongoing antipsychotic treatment of 60 patients with
      recent-onset schizophrenia or schizophreniform or schizoaffective disorders. Participants
      will be assessed at baseline and after 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks of treatment. A battery of
      research instruments will be used for assessment of psychopathology, cognitive functions,
      side effects, general functioning and quality of life. In addition blood PREG levels will be
      monitored at baseline and during the study. The study is powered to detect moderate
      between-group effects on persistent positive, negative and cognitive symptoms.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. 18-40 years of age, any ethnic group, either sex.

          2. DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia, schizophreniform or schizoaffective disorders (36).

          3. Duration of illness less than 5 years since onset first psychotic episode.

          4. Subjects entering the study must score at least 4 on the Clinical Global Impression
             Scale.

          5. At least two weeks of ongoing treatment with current antipsychotic agents during the
             pre-treatment stabilization period.

          6. Stable symptoms throughout the 2-week pre-treatment stabilization period. Clinical
             stability is defined as two consecutive weekly CGI ratings with no change in score,
             and with no more than a 20% change in PANSS total score.

          7. No change in anticholinergic, benzodiazepine, or mood stabilizer medications for the
             pre-treatment stabilization period.

          8. No anticipated need to alter any of the above medications (antipsychotics,
