Vz/F is influenced by the fraction absorbed. Vz/F for axitinib in absence of chemotherapy (axitinib alone) was evaluated on Cycle 1 Day -1 and in combination with chemotherapy on Cycle 1 Day 1. Vz/F for capecitabine in presence of steady-state axitinib was evaluated on Cycle 1 Day 1 and in absence of axitinib (capecitabine alone) on Cycle 2 Day 1.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Objective Response (OR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to disease progression or withdrawal, assessed on Day 21 of every other cycle starting from Cycle 2 up to Day 784</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants with objective response based assessment of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Confirmed response are those that persist on repeat imaging study at least 4 weeks after initial documentation of response. CR are those with disappearance of all target lesions. PR are those with at least 30 percent (%) decrease in sum of the longest dimensions of target lesions taking the baseline sum of the longest dimensions as a reference.</description>

    <description>Time in months from the first documentation of objective tumor response to objective tumor progression or death due to any cause. Duration of tumor response was calculated as (the date of the first documentation of objective tumor progression or death minus the date of the first CR or PR that was subsequently confirmed plus 1) divided by 30.4. DR was calculated for the subgroup of participants with a confirmed objective tumor response. CR = disappearance of all target lesions. PR = at least 30% decrease in sum of the longest dimensions of target lesions taking the baseline sum of the longest dimensions as a reference.</description>

    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</measure>

    <description>Time in months from start of study treatment to first documentation of objective tumor progression or death due to any cause. PFS was calculated as (first event date minus the date of first dose of study medication plus 1) divided by 30.4. Tumor progression was determined from oncologic assessment data (where data meet the criteria for progressive disease [PD]), or from adverse event (AE) data (where the outcome was &quot;Death&quot;). PD was a&gt;=20% increase in sum of the longest dimensions of target lesions taking as a reference the smallest sum of the longest dimensions recorded since the treatment started, or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions.</description>

Results for axitinib were normalized to axitinib 5 mg dose, results for capecitabine and its metabolites (5-FU, 5-DFUR and 5-DFC) were normalized to Cycle 1 Day 1 capecitabine dose and results for cisplatin were normalized to Cycle 1 Day 1 cisplatin dose.</description>

Results for axitinib were normalized to axitinib 5 mg dose, results for capecitabine and its metabolites (5-FU, 5-DFUR and 5-DFC) were normalized to Cycle 1 Day 1 capecitabine dose and results for cisplatin were normalized to Cycle 1 Day 1 cisplatin dose.</description>

        <title>Plasma Decay Half-Life (t1/2) for Axitinib, Capecitabine, Capecitabine's Metabolites and Cisplatin</title>
        <description>Plasma decay half-life is the time measured for the plasma concentration to decrease by one half. Plasma decay half life for axitinib in absence of chemotherapy (axitinib alone) was evaluated on Cycle 1 Day -1 and in combination with chemotherapy on Cycle 1 Day 1. Plasma decay half life for cisplatin (assessed by estimating total platinum in plasma ultrafiltrate), capecitabine and capecitabine’s metabolites (5-FU, 5-DFUR and 5-DFC) in presence of steady-state axitinib were evaluated on Cycle 1 Day 1 and in absence of axitinib (cisplatin/capecitabine alone) on Cycle 2 Day 1.</description>

CL/F for axitinib in absence of chemotherapy (axitinib alone) was evaluated on Cycle 1 Day -1 and in combination with chemotherapy on Cycle 1 Day 1.

          <description>Time in months from start of study treatment to first documentation of objective tumor progression or death due to any cause. PFS was calculated as (first event date minus the date of first dose of study medication plus 1) divided by 30.4. Tumor progression was determined from oncologic assessment data (where data meet the criteria for progressive disease [PD]), or from adverse event (AE) data (where the outcome was &quot;Death&quot;). PD was a&gt;=20% increase in sum of the longest dimensions of target lesions taking as a reference the smallest sum of the longest dimensions recorded since the treatment started, or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions.</description>
          <population>Efficacy analysis set included all enrolled participants who received at least 1 dose of study medication, had measurable disease at baseline (according to RECIST criteria version 1.0), and had at least 1 tumor assessment during study.</population>
