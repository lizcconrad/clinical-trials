  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is characterized by hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, absolute or
      relative insulin deficiency, hyperglucagonemia, increased hepatic glucose production,
      frequently accelerated gastric emptying and obesity. The known effects of the incretin
      hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) on the metabolism are stimulation of insulin
      secretion, inhibition of glucagon secretion and hepatic glucose production, reduction in
      gastric emptying and modulation of the appetite. T2DM have disturbances in this system,
      providing a rationale for therapeutic use of GLP-1 in T2DM. Furthermore, GLP-1 seems to exert
      trophic effects on the beta-cell.

      Dipeptidyl Peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitors represent a new class of oral anti-hyperglycemic
      agents for the treatment of T2DM. The therapeutic utility of these antihyperglycemic agents
      rests on their ability of to increase active (intact) levels of incretin peptides, including
      GLP-1 and GIP.

      Twenty four T2DM volunteers will be evaluated by a meal tolerance test (MTT) for incretin
      hormone measurements, and by the hyperglycemic clamp followed by an arginine test for
      assessing the beta-cell function and the acute insulin response. Others parameters as body
      composition and basic biochemistry will be also evaluated at Laboratory of Investigation on
      Metabolism and Diabetes - LIMED / State university of Campinas, Brazil.

      T2DM in elderly are behaving differently. Elderly patients have no increase in liver
      production of glucose; when obese, have normal insulin secretion, however, display extreme
      resistance to its action. In non obese individuals, the concentration of glucose necessary
      for insulin secretion is increased and the action is standard. These findings suggest
      therefore that the approach should be differentiated treatment for these individuals.
