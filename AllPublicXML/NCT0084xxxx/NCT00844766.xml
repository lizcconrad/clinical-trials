  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis underlying this study is that whilst there is no home-screening test for
      lactose intolerance, this test would have significant value as lactose tolerance tests and
      breath hydrogen tests are expensive and time consuming. Therefore, it would be highly
      beneficial to validate a simple home-screening test.

      This study will validate a simple home-screening test that uses lactose and not milk.
