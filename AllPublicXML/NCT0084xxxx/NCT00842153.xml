      The purpose of the study is to compare the efficacy and safety of Clobetasol propionate to
      that of its Vehicle in the treatment of mild to moderate plaque-type psoriasis. This is a
      multi-center, double blind, randomized, parallel designed study which consists of 2 weeks of
      treatment and a follow-up visit 2 weeks later.

    <time_frame>Weeks 1, 2, and 4</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator assessed the TLGI of participants relative to their initial Baseline condition based on a 7-point scale: 0=completely cleared, possible residual discoloration; 1=almost cleared, 90% improvement, very significant clearance with only traces of disease remaining; 2=marked improvement, approximately 75%, with some disease remaining; 3=moderate improvement, approximately 50%; 4=mild improvement, approximately 25%, significant disease remains; 5=no change, no detectable improvement; 6=excerbation, worsening of signs and symptoms of disease.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 2</time_frame>
    <description>Participants assessed their level of pruritus (itching) over the previous 24-hour period using the following scale: 0=no itching; 1=minimal, very rarely aware of localized itching, present when relaxing and lasted for very short time; 2=mild, aware of itching at times, present when relaxing, not present when focused on other activities; 3=moderate, often aware of itching, annoying, sometimes disturbed sleep and daytime activities; and 4=severe, constant itching, distressing, frequent sleep disturbance, interfered with activities.</description>

    <description>Participants assessed all treated areas using the Subject Global Assessment scale: 0=skin completely clear, possible residual hyperpigmentation; 1=psoriasis almost clear, patchy remnants of fine scaling present; 2=psoriasis mild, with small amount of psoriasis remaining (i.e., fine to coarse scales in some areas, definite redness, barely visible plaque thickness); 3=psoriasis moderate, between slight and definitely noticeable; 4=psoriasis very noticeable with redness, scaling, plaque thickness; 5=psoriasis severe with severe redness, thick scaling, and plaques.</description>

    <measure>Mean Percent Change From Baseline to Week 2 in Pruritus (Target Lesion)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) and Week 2</time_frame>
    <description>Participants assessed their level of pruritus (itching) for the target lesion using a 10 centimeter (cm) Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) with the left side anchored with &quot;0=None&quot; and the right side anchored with &quot;10=Very Severe.&quot; A target lesion (&gt;2 cm squared [cm^2]) was considered to be one on the trunk or extremities (excluding palms/soles, elbows, or knees). Percent change from Baseline was calculated as the value at Week 2 minus the value at Baseline (Week 0) divided by the Baseline (Week 0) value * 100.</description>

        <title>Mean Percent Change From Baseline to Week 4 in Pruritus (Target Lesion)</title>
        <description>Participants assessed their level of pruritus (itching) for the target lesion using a 10 centimeter (cm) Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) with the left side anchored with “0=None” and the right side anchored with “10=Very Severe.” A target lesion (&gt;2 cm squared [cm^2]) was considered to be one on the trunk or extremities (excluding palms/soles, elbows, or knees). Percent change from Baseline was calculated as the value at Week 4 minus the value at Baseline (Week 0) divided by the Baseline (Week 0) value * 100.</description>
