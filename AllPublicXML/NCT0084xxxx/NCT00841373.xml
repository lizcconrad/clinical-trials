      The object of the study is to compare treatment of iris/angle neovascularization with
      panretinal photocoagulation (laser) to treatment with panretinal photocoagulation and an
      anti-angiogenic drug: ranibizumab.

      A.To obtain preliminary data on the safety and tolerability of ranibizumab (0.5 mg)in
      patients with new or progressive neovascularization of the iris or angle due to retinal
      ischemic diseases in addition to treatment with PRP using the incidence and severity of
      adverse events identified by subjenc reporting vital signs, and ocular examition.

      B.To assess the proportion of patients who fail to experience regression of iris and angle
      neovascularization documented by the clinical examination, iris florescein angiography and
      gonioscopic evaluation.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        All subjects must meet the following criteria to be eligible for study entry:

          1. Signed informed consent and authorization of use and disclosure of protected health
             information

          2. Age = 18 years

          3. Presence of iris neovascularization and or angle neovascularization due to any retinal
             ischemic disease that is new onset or noted to progress recently on the slit lamp
             examination or gonioscopy

          4. Best corrected visual acuity in the study eye 20/20 (Snellen equivalent using EDTRS
             protocol at 4 meters) to light perception. Only one eye will be enrolled in the study.
             If both eyes are eligible, the investigator will select the eye to be enrolled. Visual
             acuity in the non-study eye must be better than no light perception

          5. Patient is able and willing to return for all scheduled visits

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Use of intraocular or periocular injection of steroids (for, example triamcinolone) in
             the study eye within 3 months of the study

          2. Use of intraocular injection of anti-angiogenic drugs in the study eye and or
             participation in a clinical trial using an antiangiogenic treatment within 45 days
             from the enrollment in the study.

          3. Acute endophthalmitis within 1 month.

          4. Recent rhegmatogenous retinal detachment or macular hole surgery within last 2 months

          5. Uncontrolled uveitis in the last month.

          6. Treatment with PRP within 2 weeks of the study enrollment.
