    <textblock>
      The search for metabolic abnormalities in patients with neurological disorders represents an
      important challenge 1) to identify new potentially treatable inherited metabolic diseases,
      and 2) to identify biomarkers or new treatments in more common neurodegenerative or
      neurogenetic disorders.

      This approach is currently limited by the fact that techniques aiming at identifying abnormal
      metabolites in human fluids (metabolomics) only detect subsets of molecules and that no
      general assays is available to detect abnormalities in the metabolism of complex molecules
      that takes place within cell organelles. As a consequence, only limited parts of the
      metabolism can be studied simultaneously.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate whether NRM spectroscopy of body fluids (urines,
      cerebrospinal fluid) could allow to detect new metabolic abnormalities in patients with
      complex neurological diseases.

      It is now established that most inborn errors of metabolism may present in adulthood as a
      neurological disorder. The diagnosis of these diseases is essential because, unlike the
      so-called neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic diseases are often accessible to specific
      treatments.

      Conversely, many patients are followed for a complex neurological disease of unknown cause.
      We hypothesize that a significant proportion of these patients carry yet undetected inborn
      error of metabolism.

      Recently, the use of Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMRS) has uncovered new
      metabolic diseases leading sometimes to specific treatments. However, the place of this
      technique in the investigation of patients with complex neurological diseases remains to be
      determined.

      The primary goal of this project is to assess the interest of NMRS in urine and CSF to search
      metabolic abnormalities, not detected by conventional biochemical techniques. It is an open
      study. The study will be conducted in close collaboration between the neurology and genetic
      departments of the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital, on the one hand and the nuclear medicine
      department of Poitiers in the other. 250 patients will be included over a period of 2-3 years
      and will be divided into 4 groups: Group 1: patients with complex neurological disease of
      unknown cause (200 patients) for whom urines and CSF will be collected. Group 2: positive
      controls (25 patients): patients with already known metabolic disease for whom we already
      have CSF or urines. Group 3: negative controls (25 patients): patients with non metabolic
      neurological disorders of known cause hospitalized for a lumbar puncture.
