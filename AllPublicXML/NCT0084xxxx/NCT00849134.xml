  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-time-in-human study. The overall purpose of the study is to assess whether
      the drug is safe and well tolerated after single, increasing doses. At different doses, we
      will look to see how much of the drug gets into the bloodstream, how the drug is broken down
      and excreted and whether this is affected by the presence of food.

    <textblock>
      GSK1482160 is a new drug to be developed for treating inflammatory pain (for example,
      arthritis). It acts on structures on inflammatory cells, known as P2X7 receptors. Blocking
      these receptors reduces the release of important inflammatory chemicals which exists within
      the body and are thought to play an important role in promoting inflammatory pain.

      This study will start with a very low dose of study drug, which will then be gradually
      increased in subsequent doses. This is known as dose-rising and is the way to assess safety
      and tolerability (any side effects that make taking the drug unpleasant). Effects will be
      compared to those seen when a placebo (a &quot;dummy&quot; drug) is taken. Up to 4 groups of 8 healthy
      male or female volunteers will be enrolled into the study. In addition, part of the study
      will be used to check if there is a difference in the blood levels of the study drug when
      taken with or without a high fat meal.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy as determined by a responsible physician, based on a medical evaluation
             including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and cardiac
             monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters outside the
             reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the
             Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to
             introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.

          2. Male or female aged between 18 and 55 years inclusive.

          3. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of non-childbearing potential:

          4. Non-childbearing potential is defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented
             tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous
             amenorrhoea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle
             stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/ml and oestradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml (&lt;140 pmol/L) is
             confirmatory.]1

          5. Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in Section
             8.1. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study
             medication until 5 x terminal half-lives after the last dose.

          6. Body weight &gt; 50 kg and BMI within the range 18.5 - 29.9 kg/m2 (inclusive).

          7. Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form. The written informed consent
             form should be signed and dated.

          8. QTcB or QTcF &lt; 450 msec; or QTc &lt; 480 msec in subjects with Bundle Branch Block. A
             12-lead ECG at pre-study screening, which in the opinion of the Principal Investigator
             or physician designee has no abnormalities that will compromise safety in this study.
             The specific inclusion criterion with regard to QT interval (either QTcb or QTcf,
             machine or manual over-read, males or females) is that QTc should be less than 450msec
             (based on single or average QTc of triplicate ECGs obtained over a brief recording
             period).

          9. No abnormality on relevant clinical chemistry or haematology examination at the
             pre-study medical examination. Subjects with laboratory parameters outside the
             reference range for this age group will only be included if the principal Investigator
             or designee considers that such findings will not introduce additional risk factors.
             Consultation with the GSK medical monitor is required before such subjects may be
             included. In any case, liver function tests (including bilirubin, ALT, AST or alkaline
             phosphatase) and markers of renal function (including urea and creatinine) must be
             strictly within the normal range at screening.

         10. Normal physical examination (providing no evidence of clinically active disease or
             physical or mental impairment). A subject with a clinical abnormality may be included
             only if the Principal Investigator or physician designee considers that the
             abnormality will not introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with
             study procedures. Consultation with the GSK medical monitor is required before such
             subjects may be included.

         11. A 24-hour Holter at pre-study screening, which in the opinion of the Principal
             investigator or physician designee has no abnormalities that will compromise safety in
             this study. If a rhythm abnormality is detected, the subject may be included in the
             study only if the Principle Investigator or physician designee considers that the
             abnormality will not introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with
             study procedures. Consultation with Principal Investigator, GSK medical monitor and,
             if required, a specialist cardiologist will occur before such a subject may be
             included.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject has a positive pre-study drug/alcohol screen. A minimum list of drugs that
             will be screened for include amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, opiates,

             (125ml) of wine.

          7. The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 90 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          8. Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first
             dosing day.

          9. Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary
             supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a
             potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first
             dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical
             Monitor that the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise
             subject safety.ONFIDENTIAL HH2007/00234/
