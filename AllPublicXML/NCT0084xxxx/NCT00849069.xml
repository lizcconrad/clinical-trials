  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of
      GSK2231395A candidate vaccine in adults and elderly adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease. Subjects will be vaccinated 3 times with an interval of respectively 2 and 10
      months.

  <why_stopped>
    The study has been stopped for logistic reasons not related to the safety or efficacy of the
    vaccine.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who the investigator believes that they can and will comply with the
             requirements of the protocol should be enrolled in the study.

          -  A male or female between, 40 and 80 years of age, inclusive, at the time of consent.

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the subject.

          -  Subject has a confirmed history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
             exacerbations, including multiple exacerbations in the 24 months prior to Screening

          -  Subject has a baseline chest X-ray obtained while untreated/off systemic
             corticosteroids for at least 30 days duration

          -  Subject is able to perform baseline pre- and post-bronchodilator pulmonary function
             tests while untreated/off systemic corticosteroids for at least 30 days duration and
             not participating in a pulmonary rehabilitation program.

          -  If the subject is female, and of childbearing potential, she agrees to use acceptable
             contraception and not become pregnant for the duration of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Is established by a screening pulmonary function test as having mild chronic
             obstructive pulmonary disease

          -  Is established by both a screening PFT and clinical history as having very severe
             chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

          -  Is diagnosed with a respiratory disorder other than chronic obstructive pulmonary
             disease

          -  Has a primary diagnosis of asthma.

          -  Is prescribed/receiving systemic antibiotics in the last 30 days.

          -  Is prescribed/receiving systemic corticosteroids in the last 30 days.

          -  Has chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs
             within 6 months prior to the first vaccine dose.

          -  Is undergoing, planning to undergo, or has undergone in the last 6 months a pulmonary
             rehabilitation program.

          -  Has undergone, or planning to undergo, lung transplantation and/or lung volume
             reduction.

          -  Has chest x-ray indicating an acute pulmonary disease requiring therapy or that might
             interfere with the study, such as CAP, tuberculosis, or lung cancer

          -  Has had pneumonia within 3 months prior to first vaccination.

          -  Is receiving regular long-term oxygen therapy.

          -  Has a known diagnosis of α-1 antitrypsin deficiency.

          -  Has a known or suspected hypersensitivity/reaction to any components of the candidate
             vaccine, the comparator vaccine (Twinrix® Adult or any ingredient), and/or the
             bronchodilator used in the study procedures.

          -  Has been previously vaccinated for Hepatitis A and/or B. As a portion of the subjects
             will be randomized to receive Twinrix® Adult comparator, it is important that all
             subjects qualify to receive Twinrix® Adult.

          -  Is using any investigational or non-registered product (drug or vaccine) other than
             the study vaccine, within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or
             planned use during the study period, or participation to another
             pharmaceutical/vaccine study.

          -  Has administered, or is planning administration, of any vaccine not foreseen by the
             study protocol within 30 days of the first dose of vaccines.

          -  Has administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the 3 months
             prior to first vaccination.

          -  Has any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition,
             including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

          -  Has significant disease, in the opinion of the investigator, likely to interfere with
             the study and/or likely to cause death within the study duration.

          -  Has acute cardiac insufficiency.

          -  Has inflammatory processes such as known chronic active infections (e.g. Hepatitis B,
             Hepatitis C).

          -  Has past or current malignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders.

          -  Has clinically significant hematological or biochemical abnormalities as per the
             judgment of the investigator.

          -  Has acute disease at the time of vaccination.

          -  Is a pregnant or lactating female.

          -  Is female and is planning to become pregnant or planning to discontinue contraceptive
