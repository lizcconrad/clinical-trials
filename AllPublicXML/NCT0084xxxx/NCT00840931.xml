    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combined
      therapy of lenalidomide (Revlimid®) and Granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor and
      CD40 Ligand expressed in the K562 cell line (GM.CD40L) bystander vaccine. This research is
      also being done to see how well the combination of these drugs works to fight myelodysplastic
      syndrome (MDS).

    <description>Participants will take two 5 mg capsules of lenalidomide per day for 21 days followed by 7 days of rest. This 28 day period is considered 1 cycle. Participants will receive 4 treatment cycles with 28 days in each cycle. Those participants showing a clinical response after 4 cycles of treatment may continue to receive lenalidomide as a single agent for additional cycles at the treating Physicians discretion. During each 28 day cycle participants will also receive GM.CD40L bystander vaccination injections in 2-week intervals on days 8 and 22 for a total of 8 immunizations during the 4 cycle treatment period.</description>
