    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the bacteria, fungi, and viruses that are present in
      the sinuses of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis to patients without sinus disease using a
      new technology, called a microarray, that will allow more accurate identification of
      microorganisms than current laboratory methods.

        Twenty total patients are being recruited: ten adult patients who meet the clinical
        criteria for chronic rhinosinusitis requiring surgical therapy and ten adult patients
        undergoing either orbital decompression for Graves' orbitopathy or maxillomandibular
        advancement for obstructive sleep apnea, with no history of sinus disease.
