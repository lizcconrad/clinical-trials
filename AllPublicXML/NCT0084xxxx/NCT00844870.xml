      After 4 weeks of training the hypothesis that the more natural training program would yield
      greater functional changes was proven correct.

      Analysis indicated that both methods improved reaching without trunk use Reaching performance
      scale (RPS), but the trunk -stabilized group led to more significant changes. Training under
      less restrictive conditions associated with Task-Related Training (TRT) (auditory feedback
      from trunk sensor) as compared to stabilized TRT, led to improved functional and impairment
      measure scores (WMFT, FM and shoulder flexion). Conclusion: Fading feedback with both
      training methods, during extended TRT reaching/grasping practice generally led to some
      improvements. However, as demonstrated by impairment and functional outcome measures, using
      TRT with an auditory feedback signals is a more effective approach than forcing the
      stabilization of the trunk during rehabilitation of the upper-limb.
