  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the treatment of a doxorubicin in
      combination with cyclophosphamide followed by a combination of pazopanib in combination with
      paclitaxel prior to surgery results in a pathological complete response in females with
      breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II non-randomized, multi-center study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of the combination of pazopanib and paclitaxel following treatment with
      cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin for the treatment of neoadjuvant breast cancer.

      Patients will receive standard doses of AC every 21 days for 4 cycles. This will be followed
      by weekly paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 IV on Days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days for 4 cycles given
      concurrently with pazopanib 800 mg PO daily starting with the first paclitaxel dose and
      continuing until 7 days before surgery. Clinical complete response rate will be determined by
      tumor assessments performed by palpation at two time points: following AC (before
      paclitaxel/pazopanib begins) and 2-4 weeks following the last dose of paclitaxel (before
      surgery). Following recovery from preoperative therapy, patients will undergo the
      clinically-indicated surgery. Pazopanib will resume 4-6 weeks after surgery and continue
      daily for 6 months of postoperative pazopanib therapy.

ER+ and PR+ indicate ER and PR positivity; a minus sign indicates that cells are negative for receptors. A participant's hormone status determines treatment modalities.</description>

        <description>cCR was determined by tumor assessments performed by palpation. All clinical response assessments were to be performed by physical examination of the breast and the axilla. cCR was defined as the resolution of all target and non-target lesions identified at Baseline and no new lesions or other signs of disease progression. The criteria to be used for the determination of progressive disease were at the investigator's discretion.</description>

A G3 LVD event is defined as symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF) responsive to intervention.

        <title>Number of Participants With Recurrence Events</title>
        <description>The number of participants with recurrence events during the 24 months after study entry are reported. A recurrence event is defined as invasive local (evidence of invasive/in situ breast cancer [except LCIS] in the ipsilateral breast [IB]/skin of the breast), regional (development of tumor in the ipsilateral [IP] internal mammary, IP supraclavicular, IP infraclavicular, and/or IP axillary nodes, as well as the soft tissue of the IP axilla, following surgery), or distant (evidence of tumor in all areas, with the exception of those described for local and regional recurrence) breast cancer recurrence during the 24 months after study entry.</description>

This was followed by weekly paclitaxel (WP) 80 mg/m^2 IV on Days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days for 4 cycles given concurrently with oral pazopanib 800 mg (2 tablets taken at the same time each day, either 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal) taken daily and continuing until 7 days before surgery. Pazopanib was resumed at the same oral dose 4-6 weeks after surgery and was continued daily for 6 months.</description>
