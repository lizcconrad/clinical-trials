      The purpose of this project is to look at how sleep affects glucose values in children with
      Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. It will also evaluate if glucose is affected by times of day due to
      the body's own internal rhythm also known as the circadian rhythm.

    <textblock>
      Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is one of the most prevalent chronic pediatric diseases, affecting
      2.80 cases per 1000 youth between the ages of 10 and 19. Since the crux of diabetes
      management is glucose regulation, any further challenges such as stress and/or poor sleep may
      make glucose regulation even more difficult. Mounting evidence supports the association
      between inadequate sleep and obesity as well as metabolic syndrome. Despite emerging findings
      supporting that total sleep time (TST) may contribute to the risk of obesity and/or metabolic
      complications, less research has been focused on Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) and on other
      sleep parameters.

      Participants will have a Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) and actigraph placed which they
      will wear for 5 days. At the end of the 5 days, they will return the glucose meter, CGM, and
      actigraph to a clinic staff or research team member to download their data. They will provide
      us with a glucose log that contains the glucose levels obtained from a fingerstick capillary
      glucose meter. In this log, participants will also record their activities, meals, and
      insulin administered. They will also provide us with a sleep diary. In addition, participants
      will have the option for the child to undergo polysomnography (sleep study) for one night in
      their home or two nights in the sleep lab.
