    <textblock>
      Despite immediate symptomatic success after coronary bypass surgery in patients with coronary
      artery disease, this effect is not sustained over time since risk factors for coronary artery
      disease are still in place. The role of secondary prevention becomes increasingly important
      as it can potentially decrease or eliminate the need for another intervention in these high
      risk subjects. This project seeks to evaluate the effect of emphasizing secondary prevention
      measures in this patient population during hospital admission and through six months
      post-discharge.
