  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The efficacy of anti-VEGF treatments such as Bevacizumab in cases of HHT can be considered
      because of the molecular mechanisms implied in angiogenesis and HHT, as well as the
      mechanisms of action of this type of treatment. Two articles that have recently reported
      spectacular improvement thanks to Bevacizumab in patients with HHT complicated with severe
      liver involvement and cardiac effects support us in this sense.

      Up to now, the only treatment recommended in the severe hepatic forms of HHT is a liver
      transplant, the disadvantages of which are both multiple and well known: long waiting lists,
      surgical morbidity and mortality, immunosuppressive treatment for life. Furthermore,
      treatment with Bevacizumab is not a contraindication, should the drug be ineffective, for a
      subsequent liver transplant if necessary.

          -  HHT related criteria

               -  Patients monitored for clinically confirmed HHT disease.

               -  Patients with severe liver involvement in relationship with the HHT disease

               -  Patients with a high cardiac output on ultrasound.

          -  Associated disease related criteria

               -  Blood: neutrophil ≥ 1.0x109 / L and platelets ≥ 100x109 / L.

               -  INR (International Normalized Ratio) ≤ 1.5 (except for patients on
                  anticoagulants) and TCA ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of the standard laboratory

               -  Renal function: creatinine ≤ 1.25 x upper limit of the standard laboratory.
                  Patients who proteinuria to strip ≥ 2 + will have control of the Proteinuria of
                  24 hours to be ≤ 1g / 24 hours
