      The purpose of this study is to determine the value of adding IMC-A12 to irinotecan +
      cetuximab in improving PFS at 18 weeks from the date of randomization for patients with
      metastatic K-RAS wild-type CRC that has progressed on an oxaliplatin/bevacizumab-containing
      regimen.
