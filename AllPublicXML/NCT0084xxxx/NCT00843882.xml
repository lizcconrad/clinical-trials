    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III trial studies lenalidomide to see how well it works with or without
      epoetin alfa in treating patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and anemia. Lenalidomide may
      stop the growth of myelodysplastic syndrome by blocking blood flow to the cells. Colony
      stimulating factors, such as epoetin alfa, may increase the number of immune cells found in
      bone marrow or peripheral blood. It is not yet known whether lenalidomide is more effective
      with or without epoetin alfa in treating patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and anemia.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the rate of major erythroid response (MER) between lenalidomide monotherapy and
      combined treatment of lenalidomide and epoetin alfa in erythropoietin non-responsive
      low-/intermediate-1 (Int-1)-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients or erythropoietin
      treatment naïve patients with low probability of erythropoietin benefit.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the time to MER by treatment assignment. II. To evaluate the duration of MER by
      treatment assignment. III. To estimate the frequency of MER to salvage combination therapy in
      patients who fail to experience a MER with lenalidomide monotherapy.

      IV. To evaluate and compare the frequency of minor erythroid response by treatment
      assignment.

      V. To investigate the mechanism and target of lenalidomide action in patients with chromosome
      5q31.1 deletion.

      VI. To evaluate the frequency of cytogenetic response and progression, and the relationship
      between cytogenetic pattern and erythroid response.

      VII. To evaluate the frequency of bone marrow response (complete response [CR] + partial
      response [PR]).

      VIII. To evaluate the relationship between erythroid response and laboratory correlates
      outlined below: pretreatment and on study endogenous erythropoietin level (Arm A); to
      evaluate the effect of cluster of differentiation (CD)45 isoform profile on lenalidomide
      enhancement of erythropoietin-induced signal transducer and activator of transcription 5A
      (STAT5) phosphorylation in CD71^Hi erythroid precursors and the relationship to erythroid
      response; to characterize molecular targets relevant to lenalidomide cytotoxicity in
      del5q31.1 cells; to evaluate the frequency of cryptic chromosome 5q31.1 deletions in patients
      with non-del5q31.1 MDS by array-based genomic scan, and to determine the relationship to
      hematologic response.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Patients with del 5q31.1 karyotype
      are assigned to Arm A.

      ARM A: Patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21.

      ARM B: Patients receive lenalidomide PO QD on days 1-21 and epoetin alfa subcutaneously (SC)
      once weekly.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 28 days for 4 courses. Patients who achieve a major
      erythroid response (MER) may continue treatment beyond 4 courses in the absence of disease
      progression, disease conversion to acute myeloid leukemia, or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      in Arm A who fail to achieve MER or who achieve MER but relapse after 16 weeks of treatment
      with lenalidomide may crossover and receive treatment in Arm B.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 6 months.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  NOTE: Results of the bone marrow biopsy and aspirate as well as cytogenetics are
             mandatory to register subjects onto study, which are indispensable to determine
             International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) category needed for eligibility; please
             note that it is not necessary to wait for the week 16, week 32, or week bone marrow
             and cytogenetic results prior to starting the next cycle unless deemed necessary by
             the treating physician; one example of this exception can include if the subject shows
             signs of progression, such as increased peripheral blood blast percentage; at that
             juncture, the treating physician may prefer to await the results prior to starting a
             new cycle; if a cycle is started, and based on the bone marrow results it is felt by
             the treating physician that the subject should not continue on treatment, please be
             sure to note this information on the case report forms at end of treatment
