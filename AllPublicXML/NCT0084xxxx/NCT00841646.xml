        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects aged 18 years of age and older who are mentally competent and who have signed

               1. Medical history,

               2. Physical examination,

               3. Clinical judgment of the Investigator;

          -  Able to understand and comply with all study procedures and to complete study diaries,
             can be contacted, and will be available for all study visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous receipt of any H5 vaccine;

          -  Receipt of another investigational agent within 4 weeks, or before completion of the
             safety follow-up period in another study, whichever is longer, prior to enrollment and
             unwilling to refuse participation in another clinical study through the end of the
             study;

          -  Experienced any acute disease or infection requiring systemic antibiotic or antiviral
             therapy (chronic antibiotic therapy for urinary tract prophylaxis is acceptable)
             within the past 7 days;

          -  Experienced fever (defined as axillary temperature 38.0°C) within 3 days prior to
             Visit 1;

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding;

          -  Females of childbearing potential who refuse to use an acceptable method of birth
             control for the duration of the study. Adequate contraception is defined as hormonal
             (e.g., oral, injection, transdermal patch, implant, cervical ring), barrier (e.g.,
             condom with spermicide or diaphragm with spermicide), intrauterine device (e.g., IUD),
             or monogamous relationship with vasectomized partner who has been vasectomized for 6
             months or more prior to the subject's study entry;

          -  Any serious disease, such as:

               1. Medically significant cancer,

               2. Autoimmune disease (including rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes mellitus type 1),

               3. Medically significant diabetes mellitus type 2,

               4. Medically significant chronic pulmonary disease,

               5. Medically significant acute or progressive hepatic disease,

               6. Medically significant acute or progressive renal disease;

               7. Medically significant acute or progressive neurological disease;

          -  Surgery planned during the study period;

          -  Bleeding diathesis;

          -  Hypersensitivity to eggs, chicken protein, chicken feathers, influenza viral protein,
             neomycin or polymyxin or any other component of the study vaccine;

             or anaphylactic shock following administration of any vaccine;

          -  Known or suspected impairment/alteration of immune function, for example, resulting
             from:

               1. Receipt of immunosuppressive therapy (any systemic corticosteroid therapy or
                  cancer chemotherapy), Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed

               2. Receipt of immunostimulants,

               3. High risk for developing an immunocompromising disease;
