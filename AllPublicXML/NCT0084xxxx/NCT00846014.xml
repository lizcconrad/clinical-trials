  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research is to use Helium-3 MRI to see the changes in airflow of the lungs
      at different times of an attack. These three stages are immediately after the attack, 1 month
      later and 4-6 months later.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a pulmonary disorder that affects millions of people each year. The exact method of
      exacerbation is still under some discussion. Currently there is no cure for the disorder but
      treatment is of a wide variety.

      This study is meant to image the asthmatic lung at various time points post exacerbation.
      Since pulmonary imaging is currently limited to radiation techniques, this method will allow
      exacerbated images without the unnecessary exposure to radiation.

    <description>Patients will be required to breath in individual 1 liter bags of gas while in an MRI to produce lung images. These bags of gas are each made up of 333mL of Helium-3 gas and 667mL of Nitrogen. The first three bags will be administered with a break between each of five to ten minutes. Then the drug aformoterol will be administered and an hour will pass. Then three additional bags will be administered, again with five to ten minutes between each bag.</description>
