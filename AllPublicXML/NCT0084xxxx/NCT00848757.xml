      The purpose of this research collaboration between Dr. William Tamborlane, Deputy Directory
      of the Yale Center for Clinical Investigation (YCCI) and Fair Haven Community Health Center's
      (FHCHC) Diabetes Prevention Team is to determine the efficacy of an intensive life-style
      intervention (ILI) program that has been developed and implemented at the FHCHC to prevent
      the development of diabetes.

    <textblock>
      This project is a clinical outcome study that merges the expertise of a senior Yale clinical
      investigator, the clinical and translational research resources of YCCI, the clinical and
      community expertise of the FHCHC Diabetes Team, and the high-need patient population of
      FHCHC. In addition to determining the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of an ILI for diabetes
      prevention in an inner-city community health center setting, this project will evaluate the
      effectiveness of pooling academic expertise with direct clinical services to disadvantaged,
      at-risk populations.

    <description>Women with pre-diabetes randomized to the ILI will attend an intensive 12-week group program of nutritional education, diet, behavior modification and structured exercise, which is based on the published curriculum from the DPP &quot;Lifestyle Balance&quot; program, but modified for a group format and to be more culturally and linguistically appropriate for this population.</description>

    <description>Women with pre-diabetes randomized to usual care will be offered 30 minute appointments with a medical provider to review their diagnosis, risk for diabetes, and stress the importance of lifestyle changes to prevent diabetes, including weight loss and exercise and setting individual goals for these. Usual care participants will be encouraged to achieve goals equivalent to the ILI group: to reduce their weight by 7%, and to increase their physical activity to approximately 150 minutes moderate intensity exercise per week. They will be offered a consultation with an FHCHC nutritionist to achieve dietary/weight loss objectives. Participants are offered printed educational materials which are language and literacy-appropriate.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        In order to be eligible for this study, the following criteria must be met:

          -  Subjects must be willing to travel to the clinic for all regularly scheduled study
             visits, and to the lifestyle intervention program site for the ILI (the John Martinez
             School).

          -  Subjects must have had a 2 hour 75 gram Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) with
             fasting glucose between 100 and 126, or 2 hour glucose between 140 and 200 mg/dl in
             order to participate in this study within the 4 months prior to enrollment.

          -  Willingness to undergo fasting blood testing: HOMA-IR, fasting lipid profile
             (including total cholesterol, HDL, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides) at the beginning
             of the study (if not previously obtained with the OGTT) and repeated at 12 months.

          -  Subjects must have no medical contraindications to exercise or dieting.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects will be excluded from the study if they have diabetes or other serious
             medical or psychiatric condition that would preclude participation in the ILI program.

          -  Subjects will be excluded if they are taking medications that potentially cause
             significant weight gain or weight loss (including prescription medication, over the
             counter medication, or herbal supplements)..

          -  Women who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant will not be enrolled in this
             study.

          -  Any behavioral or psychosocial issue that will interfere with the subject's completion
             of the program, including an eating disorder will prohibit subjects from participating
             in this study.

          -  Subjects cannot participate if they have concurrent membership in a comprehensive
             weight management program.
