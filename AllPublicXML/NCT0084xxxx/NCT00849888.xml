      The study purpose is to determine if thymus tissue cultured in a serum-free (SF) solution is
      a safe and effective treatment for atypical and typical complete DiGeorge anomaly. [Funding

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Complete DiGeorge anomaly is a congenital disorder characterized by athymia. Without
      successful treatment, patients remain immunodeficient and usually die by age 2 years. In
      &quot;typical&quot; complete DiGeorge subjects who have no T cells, thymus transplantation without
      immunosuppression has resulted in diverse T cell development and good T cell function. In
      &quot;atypical&quot; complete DiGeorge subjects who have no thymus, a rash, and some T cells that
      presumably developed extrathymically, thymus transplantation with immunosuppression has
      resulted in diverse T cell development and good T cell function. Thus far, thymus
      transplantation studies have used thymus cultured in fetal bovine serum (FBS medium). This
      protocol's purpose is to determine whether transplanted thymus cultured in serum free medium
      can safely support thymopoiesis and T cell reconstitution as does FBS medium cultured thymus
      tissue in DiGeorge anomaly subjects. This protocol includes 2 arms: atypical DiGeorge
      subjects who will receive immunosuppression and thymus transplantation; and, typical complete
      DiGeorge subjects who will receive thymus transplantation without immunosuppression. Serum
      free medium use would reduce concerns of animal product exposure including potential exposure
      to bovine spongiform encephalopathy(BSE).
