  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies have shown that obese people are more prone to high blood pressure. With the
      co-existence of obesity, hypertension and diabetes, patients were more susceptible to
      hyperlipidemia, coronary and cerebral atherosclerosis and peripheral vascular disease.
      Abdominal obesity has often accompanied by substantial accumulation of visceral fat, which
      increased secretion of many inflammatory mediators, cytokines and adipocytokines and played
      an important role in cardiovascular and metabolic disease. Some reports had shown that
      angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) may improve metabolic profiles in patients with
      diabetes or metabolic syndrome, in addition to its hypotensive effect. It has been reported
      that some ARB, such as telmisartan and candesartan, can prevent weight gain and
      high-fat-induced obesity in experimental animals. However, whether telmisartan intervention
      on improvement of fat deposition and other related metabolic profiles is better than a CCB
      drugs (amlodipine) in those obese hypertensive patients with diabetes, was still unknown.
