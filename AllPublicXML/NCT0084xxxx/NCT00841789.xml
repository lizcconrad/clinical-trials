  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Etanercept (Enbrel) when used in
      conjunction with IVIG and aspirin, improves treatment response to IVIG in patients with
      Kawasaki Disease. Funding Source- FDA/OOPD

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Kawasaki Disease (KD) is a potentially life threatening acute vasculitis in children with a
      predilection for involvement of the coronary arteries. Aspirin and Intravenous gamma globulin
      (IVIG) are principally used for the treatment of the symptoms of Kawasaki Disease. Aspirin
      reduces inflammation and platelet formation, but has no effect in attenuating the development
      of coronary abnormalities. Although IVIG reduces inflammation and the prevalence of coronary
      artery abnormalities, it has a relatively high failure rate of 23-30%, warranting new
      treatment methods for Kawasaki Disease. We propose a placebo controlled double blinded
      randomized study to determine if etanercept 0.8 mg/kg subcutaneously (max 25 mg) given three
      times at weekly intervals starting at initial diagnosis is safe in this patient population
      and if it is a successful adjunct therapy with IVIG in reducing the incidence of persistent
      or recurrent fever.

    <intervention_model_description>Approximately 200 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive Etanercept or Placebo. Subjects are randomized after hospital admission and diagnosis of Kawasaki Disease at eight participating sites. The primary analysis time-point is visit 5 (day 44). Sample size calculation is based on initial IVIG refractory rate at Seattle Children's. Assuming a 17.4% refractory rate in the control group and a 4.3% refractory rate in the Etanercept group, 200 subjects will provide 80% power at a 5% 2-sided type I error rate. Analyses will be based on a modified intention to treat population, including all subjects who were randomized and received at least 1 dose of study drug. Efficacy analyses will be based on randomization assignment, and safety analyses will be based on the treatment actually received. The statistical analysis plan will be finalized prior to database lock and study unblinding.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Determine if Etanercept at the dosing regimen of 0.8 mg/kg (50 mg max) SQ X3 doses given at weekly intervals, when used in conjunction with IVIG and aspirin will reduce the incidence of fever persistence or recrudescence.</measure>
    <time_frame>42 days after initial dose</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome is the proportion of subjects who become refractory to IVIG. Subjects requiring 1 dose of IVIG are classified as responders and subjects requiring more than 1 dose are classified as IVIG refractory.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Determine if the safety profile differs between the etanercept treated group and the placebo group.</measure>
    <time_frame>42 days after initial dose</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of subjects with serious adverse events and hospital re-admissions prior to visit 5 will be compared using the chi-square test or Fisher's Exact test, as appropriate. The incidence of individual adverse events and serious adverse events will be tabulated using the Pediatric Heart Network Classification System.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Determine if Etanercept treatment alters the rate of coronary artery dilation and disease (CAD) at 2 and 6 weeks after treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>42 days after initial dose</time_frame>
    <description>The primary echocardiographic outcome will be the proportion of subjects with improvement defined as (20% change in coronary artery) from the worst findings during the acute study period (scheduled visits from admission to visit 4, including any unscheduled visits) to the primary study outcome time-point at visit 5 (visit 5). This calculation will be based on changes in absolute values and not z-scores as initially planned. Groups will be compared using a logistic model including a binary term for age &lt; versus &gt; 1 year. Two aspects of the echo findings will be considered:
Maximum aneurysm size and
Maximum measurements for left main coronary artery (LMCA), left anterior descending artery (LAD) and right coronary artery (RCA).
Change in diameter of each coronary artery will be determined at standard measurement location or aneurysm with the latter taking precedent.</description>

    <measure>CRP Laboratory Measurements</measure>
    <time_frame>42 days after initial dose</time_frame>
    <description>Time to return to normal levels of C-Reactive protein (CRP) from admission to the visit 5 visit will be compared using Kaplan-Meier Curves. If the proportional hazards assumption is not violated, Cox Proportional Hazards Regression will be used to calculate hazard ratios.
The proportion of subjects with normal CRP levels at the visit 5 visit will be tabulated and 95% confidence intervals will be produced.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hemoglobin Laboratory Measurements</measure>
    <time_frame>42 days after initial dose</time_frame>
    <description>Continuous change in Hemoglobin will be compared longitudinally using mixed models for repeated measures.
Maximum toxicity grade for anemia through visit 5 according to the common toxicity criteria for adverse events (Grade 1: See chart below * to &lt; 10.0 g/dl, Grade 2: &lt; 10.0 to 8.0 g/dl, Grade 3: &lt; 8.0 g/dl) will be tabulated, and 95% confidence intervals will be produced for the proportions.</description>
