    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the usefulness of imaging with radiolabeled methionine
      in the evaluation of children and young adults with tumor(s). Methionine is a naturally
      occurring essential amino acid. It is crucial for the formation of proteins. When labeled
      with carbon-11 (C-11), a radioactive isotope of the naturally occurring carbon-12, the
      distribution of methionine can be determined noninvasively using a PET (positron emission
      tomography) camera. C-11 methionine (MET) has been shown valuable in the monitoring of a
      large number of neoplasms. Since C-11 has a short half life (20 minutes), MET must be
      produced in a facility very close to its intended use. Thus, it is not widely available and
      is produced only at select institutions with access to a cyclotron and PET chemistry
      facility. With the new availability of short lived tracers produced by its PET chemistry
      unit, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (St. Jude) is one of only a few facilities with
      the capabilities and interests to evaluate the utility of PET scanning in the detection of
      tumors, evaluation of response to therapy, and distinction of residual tumor from scar tissue
      in patients who have completed therapy. The investigators propose to examine the
      biodistribution of MET in patients with malignant solid neoplasms, with emphasis on central
      nervous system (CNS) tumors and sarcomas. This project introduces a new diagnostic test for
      the noninvasive evaluation of neoplasms in pediatric oncology. Although not the primary
      purpose of this proposal, the investigators anticipate that MET studies will provide useful
      clinical information for the management of patients with malignant neoplasms.

      The study focuses on the following objectives:

      Primary objective:

        -  To estimate the success rate of Methionine (MET) for visualizing tumors at the time of
           diagnosis. The study hypothesizes that at least 70% of newly diagnosed tumors within
           each group will be studied and will be successfully visualized.

      Secondary objective:

        -  To compare uptake of MET in tumors with tumor grade in patients with newly diagnosed or
           relapsed, and/or persistent disease. Hypothesis: high grade tumors will concentrate
           higher amounts of MET than lower grade tumors measured both qualitatively and
           semi-quantitatively.

        -  To examine the bio-distribution of MET in organs that do not contain tumor, in
           particular the lungs, heart, mediastinum, liver, spleen, pancreas, muscle, brain, and
           bone marrow.

      Exploratory objectives:

        -  To compare the findings on MET PET scans with those of standard imaging modalities,
           principally MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and FDG (fluorodeoxyglucose) PET CT
           (computed tomography) at diagnosis, or at study enrollment for patients with relapsed
           and or persistent disease, and for all patients over time.

        -  To compare the extent of abnormality on MRI with that of MET.

        -  To determine the presence or absence of elevated MET uptake beyond those of MRI defined
           abnormality.

        -  To explore the relationship between MET uptake and prognosis.
