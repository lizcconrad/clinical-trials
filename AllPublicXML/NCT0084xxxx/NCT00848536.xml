    <description>For an individual patient, two consecutive IOP measurements for each eye were taken. The mean IOP values for each individual patient's eye were rounded up to the next whole number if the value was ≥ 0.5 mmHg
All IOP measurements were performed with a Goldmann applanation tonometer. All IOP measurements for any individual subject were to be performed preferably by the same operator using the same tonometer.
Mean IOP for the patient's worse eye at baseline was used in the primary endpoint analysis. If both eyes were equal, then the right eye was selected for analysis</description>

          <description>For an individual patient, two consecutive IOP measurements for each eye were taken. The mean IOP values for each individual patient’s eye were rounded up to the next whole number if the value was ≥ 0.5 mmHg
All IOP measurements were performed with a Goldmann applanation tonometer. All IOP measurements for any individual subject were to be performed preferably by the same operator using the same tonometer.
Mean IOP for the patient’s worse eye at baseline was used in the primary endpoint analysis. If both eyes were equal, then the right eye was selected for analysis</description>
