  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smoking induces an inflammatory reaction in the airways which can ultimately result in
      persistent damage and the development of a Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).
      However, not all subjects who smoke end up with COPD. After long-term smoking, approximately
      20% of subjects develop COPD. At this time, it is unclear why some subjects develop COPD,
      whereas others maintain a normal lung function.

      In addition, smoking has important consequences in asthma. Patients with asthma who smoke
      have a more severe asthma and more often experience an asthma exacerbation. In addition, it
      has been shown that inhaled corticosteroids are less effective in smoking asthmatics.

      With this research project, the researchers will investigate the effects of smoking on the
      airways. To this end, the researchers will compare markers of airway inflammation, lung
      function and symptoms between healthy smokers and non-smokers of varying age. In addition,
      the researchers will compare those healthy subjects with patients with asthma and COPD which
      are characterized in earlier studies.

          -  A subject is not eligible to enter and participate if he does not agree that we inform
