  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label phase II study of an investigational drug, sunitinib malate in patients
      with advanced malignant paraganglioma or phaeochromocytoma cancer. Paragangliomas (PGs) are
      tumours that arise from the para-sympathetic system in the head and neck and sympathetic
      system in the thorax and abdomen. Paragangliomas that secrete hormones (catecholamines) from
      the adrenal glands are called pheochromocytomas (PCs). In this study, patients whose disease
      has advanced or spread despite prior standard therapy, will receive sunitinib for 4-weeks
      followed by a 2-week rest period, for up to 12 months, in the absence of disease progression.
      Sunitinib is an investigational drug, which has been shown to shrink tumours in several
      tumour models. The study will evaluate the efficacy as well as the toxicity profile of
      sunitinib when used as an alternative treatment for patients with PG/PC tumours.

      This study will be a single arm, open-label, phase II trial of sunitinib in patients with
      metastatic or locally advanced malignant paraganglioma or phaeochromocytoma. Oral sunitinib
      (50 mg) will be administered to all patients daily for the first four weeks of a six week
      study cycle, followed by a 2-week rest. Patients will be assessed for response to study
      treatment using MRI/CT scans as well as bio-chemical tests, and will receive the study
      treatment for up to 12 months or until disease progression.

      Primary study outcomes include:

      To assess the efficacy (response rate) of sunitinib given orally daily for 4 out of every 6
      weeks in patients with advanced or metastatic paraganglioma/ pheochromocytoma.

      To assess the toxicity of sunitinib in patients with advanced or metastatic paraganglioma/
      pheochromocytoma.

      To document effects of sunitinib on markers of biochemical activity of advanced or metastatic
      paraganglioma/ pheochromocytoma.
