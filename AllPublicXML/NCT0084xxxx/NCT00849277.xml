      The purpose of this study is to determine whether probiotic treatment improves the protection
      against respiratory infections after influenza vaccination in elderly living in nursing
      homes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Influenza virus is a member of the orthomyxovirus family and causes an acute viral disease of
      the respiratory tract. The illness is usually self-limiting. Hospitalization and deaths
      mainly occur in high-risk groups (elderly, chronically ill). Response to vaccination is
      subject to high levels of variability due to age, stress, nutritional stage, etc.

      Lactic acid bacteria are naturally commensal bacteria in the small and large intestines.
      These bacteria protect the host against potential pathogens by competitive exclusion and also
      by the production of antibacterial agents known as bacteriocins. It has only been recently
      shown that another mechanism whereby probiotic bacteria may provide a health benefit is by
      modulating immune responses.

      Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota (LcS) is widely consumed in fermented milk products.
      Several studies, in animals as wells as in humans, report on the immunomodulatory functions
      of LcS.

      The aim of this multicentre, randomized, placebo controlled, double blind study (RCT) is to
      assess if probiotic treatment with Lactobacillus casei Shirota improves the protection
      against influenza(-like) infections after vaccination with trivalent influenza vaccine in
      elderly residing in nursing homes.

      Trial endpoints:

        1. Clinical outcome: difference in incidence in upper respiratory tract infections
           (influenza-like illness)

        2. Serological outcome: difference in influenza vaccine specific serum IgG between
           probiotic and control treatment

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  healthy male and female volunteers of 65 years or older

          -  volunteers reside in residential homes

          -  volunteers must be willing to swallow Yakult/placebo 2x/day for 3 weeks prevaccination
             and 5 months follow-up

          -  participants must be able to comply with requirements of study (e.g. assessment of
             respiratory symptoms, Yakult/placebo administration)

          -  participants must read and sign written Informed Consent Form after the nature of the
             study has been fully explained

        Exclusion Criteria:

        elderly with:

          -  any medical or practical condition which make the volunteer not suitable for
             participating in this study at discretion of the investigator

          -  any current relevant infectious disease

          -  any current known disorder having negative repercussions on the volunteer's immune
             system, such as auto-immune diseases, COPD requiring oxigen, cancer, chronic
             inflammatory disease

          -  allergy to influenza vaccine, eggs, neomycin, amphotericin B, erythromycin, amantadine

          -  ongoing treatment with immunosuppressive drugs, chemotherapeutics or other
             antineoplastic medication

          -  current use of antibiotics or use 6 weeks prior to study entry

          -  use of any investigative drug (other drugs who are also under investigation) within 90
             days prior to study entry

          -  with markedly abnormal results in any of the screening laboratory tests
