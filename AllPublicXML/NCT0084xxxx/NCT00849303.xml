    <textblock>
      The purpose of the first part of this study is to understand plastic brain mechanisms
      associated with successful gait-oriented stroke rehabilitation. Patients are randomized to
      receive intensive in-patient multiprofessional rehabilitation at different time points. One
      group will receive rehabilitation immediately after an acute care at the neurological clinic
      (8 days) and one group 5 weeks after the insult. Patients practise walking every workday for
      60 min (actual 30min) either on a treadmill or on a gait trainer for four weeks, and receive
      also other physiotherapy. In addition to selected parameters measuring brain plasticity,
      detailed assessments of functional abilities including motor ability and quality of life will
      be performed. A novel tool, MR-image navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is
      utilized in assessing cortical excitability in relation to stroke, time, rehabilitation, and
      recovery.
