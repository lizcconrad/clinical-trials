  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects are having a bone marrow or SCT for either a type of cancer of the blood called
      Leukemia or a cancer of the lymph nodes called non- Hodgkin's Lymphoma. Although a transplant
      can cure leukemia or lymphoma, some people will relapse. In those who relapse, current
      treatment cures only a very small percentage. Although giving patients a dose of donor immune
      cells before relapse can prevent relapse of the leukemia or lymphoma, DLI can also cause a
      serious complication called graft versus host disease (GVHD). This is a gene transfer
      research study using special immune cells which are specific for these cancer cells.

      The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. This study combines 2 of those
      ways, antibodies and T cells. T cells (CTLs or cytotoxic T cells) are infection-fighting
      blood cells that can kill cells, including tumor cells. Antibodies and T cells have been used
      to treat patients with cancers; they have shown promise, but haven't been strong enough to
      cure most patients.

      The antibody used in this study is called anti-CD19. This antibody sticks to leukemia cells
      because of a substance on the outside of these cells called CD19. For this study, the
      anti-CD19 antibody has been changed so that instead of floating free in the blood it is now
      joined to T cells. When an antibody is joined to a T cell in this way it's called a chimeric
      receptor.

      In the laboratory, investigators found that T cells that are trained to recognize common
      viruses can stay in the blood stream for many years. By joining the anti-CD19 antibody to
      CTLs that recognize viruses, they believe that they will also be able to make a cell that can
      last a long time in the body, provide protection from viruses, and recognize and kill
      leukemia. The CTLs which we will join the anti-CD19 antibody to attack 3 viruses
      (trivirus-specific CTLs), CMV, EBV, and adenovirus.

      CMV is a virus that rarely causes problems in healthy people but can cause serious infections
      in patients with suppressed immune systems. It can cause a very serious pneumonia, and can
      also affect the intestinal tract, liver and eyes. 2/3 of normal people harbor this virus in
      their body. If the subject or donor are positive for CMV, the subject is at risk of
      developing CMV disease after transplant. EBV causes mononucleosis or &quot;mono&quot; (infection with
      fatigue, high fever, and swollen lymph nodes). It is normally controlled by a healthy immune
      system but when the immune system is weak after bone marrow transplant it can cause fevers,
      enlarged lymph nodes and a type of cancer called lymphoma. Adenovirus is a virus that causes
      symptoms of a common cold but can cause life-threatening infections in patients with weak
      immune systems.

      Studies have shown that trivirus-specific CTLs grown from the stem cell donor can be given
      safely to transplant recipients and can stop these viruses from causing severe infections.
      These CD19 chimeric receptor trivirus specific T cells are an investigational product not
      approved by the FDA.

      The purpose of this study is to find the biggest dose of chimeric T cells that is safe, to
      assess the side effects, to see how long the T cells last and to evaluate whether this
      therapy might help prevent infections and relapse in people with CD19+ leukemia or lymphoma
      having a SCT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The donor gave us blood to make CD19 chimeric receptor trivirus specific T cells in the
      laboratory. These cells were grown and frozen for the subject. To make these special T cells
      they are grown with stimulator cells. Stimulator cells are also made from the donor's blood
      but they are irradiated so that they can no longer grow. Stimulator cells have been infected
      with viruses so that they carry proteins from 3 viruses (CMV, adenovirus, and EBV). These
      cells are cultured with the T cells so that they can learn to see and attack cells infected
      with CMV, EBV and adenovirus.

      To get the CD19 antibody to attach to the surface of the T cell, an antibody gene was
      inserted into the T cell. This is done with a virus called a retrovirus that has been made
      for this study and will carry the antibody gene into the T cell. This virus also helps to
      find the T cells in the blood after injected. Once sufficient numbers of T cells are made,
      the investigators freeze the cells and test them to make sure they kill CD19+ tumors cells
      and cells infected with CMV, EBV and adenovirus. Once testing is completed the cells will be
      ready to give to the subject.

      When the subject enrolls on this study, they will be assigned a dose of CD19 chimeric
      receptor trivirus specific T cells. The subject will be given an injection of cells into the
      vein through an IV line at the assigned dose. The injection will take about 20 minutes.
      Investigators will monitor the subject in the clinic after the injection for up to 3 hours.
      The treatment will be given by the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at Texas Children's
      Hospital or The Methodist Hospital.

      To learn more about the way the CD19 chimeric receptor trivirus specific T cells are working
      and how long they last in the body, extra blood will be drawn. The total blood drawn during
      this study will not exceed 300 tsp.

      For subjects receiving the CTLs for treatment of their disease: If the subject has stable
      disease (the tumor did not grow) or there is a reduction in the size of the tumor on imaging
      studies or by blood count after the T-cell infusion, the subject can receive up to six
      additional doses of the T cells if they wish. After each T-cell infusion, the subject will be
      monitored.

      Because the subject will have received cells with a new gene in them the subject will be
      followed for a total of 15 years to see if there are any long term side effects of gene
      transfer.
