      This multi-centre, randomized, cross-over, prospective study will evaluate the occurrence of
      AF with AF pacing therapies programmed on (APP and VRR) and with AF therapies programmed off
      (APP and VRR) in patients with no known prior history of AF (all patients have a pacing
      indication). The occurrence of AF as well as time to first event and AF burden (frequecy and
      duration).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  No prior history of AF or atrial flutter, primary indication of SSS or AV block for
             dual chamber pacemaker, confidentiality agreement signed and dated before implant,
             available for follow-up at the study centre where they were enrolled at the protocol
             defined intervals, willing and capable of participating in all testing associated with
             the study, on stable regime of arrhythmia management drugs.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Documented history of AF or atrial flutter, clinically significant ventricular
             arrhythmias, &lt; 18 yrs old, life expectancy &lt; 1 year or expectation of heart
             transplantation during the study period, likely to or have received a mechanical
             tricuspid valve during the study, enrolled in other cardiovascular studies, women who
             are pregnant, inability or refusal to sign Patient Confidentiality Agreement,
             inability or refusal to complete the follow-up schedule at the study centre in which
             they were enrolled, exhibit arrhythmias due to reversible cause eg, digitalis
             toxicity, hypoxia, transient electrolyte imbalance, acute myocardial infarction or
             electrocution.
