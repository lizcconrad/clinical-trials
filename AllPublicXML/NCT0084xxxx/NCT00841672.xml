  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the blood pressure (BP) lowering effect of the combination of
      aliskiren/amlodipine 300/10 mg versus amlodipine 10 mg monotherapy in patients with moderate
      to severe hypertension by testing the hypothesis that the combination of aliskiren/amlodipine
      produces a superior reduction from baseline in mean sitting systolic blood pressure (msSBP)
      after 8 weeks of treatment.
