  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized controlled trial evaluating the duration of steroid replacement therapy in
      patients with adrenal insufficiency and septic shock. Patients will be randomized to receive
      either hydrocortisone 50 mg IV every six hours for seven days (control) or hydrocortisone 50
      mg IV every six hours until 24 hours after achievement of hemodynamic stability (MAP &gt; 65 mm
      Hg off of vasopressors).
