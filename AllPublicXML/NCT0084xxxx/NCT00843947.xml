    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of RIST, conditioned
      with fludarabine and busulfan, using G-CSF mobilized PBSC from an HLA-matched sibling or an
      unrelated volunteer donor. The primary endpoint of this study is day 100 TRM (Treatment
      Related Mortality). Secondary endpoints include response, engraftment times, acute and
      chronic GVHD, chimerism, toxicities, progression-free survival and overall survival.

      Objectives

        -  To assess the efficacy and toxicity of Reduced Intensity Transplant (RIST) for patients
           with hematological malignancies, conditioned with fludarabine (Fludara®) and busulfan
           intravenous (Busulfex™).

        -  To evaluate progression-free survival and overall survival.

        -  To determine donor chimerism.

        -  To assess the risk of acute and chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  • Diagnosed with (any of the following)

        Disease Subtype Disease Status Leukemia Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) Recurrent disease
        in remission* OR CR1 with poor-risk cytogenetics, antecedent hematological disease (i.e.
        myelodysplasia) or treatment-related leukemia Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) Recurrent
        disease in remission* OR CR1 with Philadelphia chromosome or poor risk cytogenetics Chronic
        myelogenous leukemia (CML) First or second chronic phase. There must be documented disease
        progression after imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) therapy OR documented lack of cytogenetic
        response 6 months post-imatinib initiation OR imatinib intolerance.

        Patient - Inclusion criteria (Continued) Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) Recurrent
        disease after fludarabine-based therapy. Patients must have chemosensitive** disease at the
        time of relapse.

        Lymphoma Recurrent Hodgkin's Lymphoma

        Recurrent Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) (Low, intermediate or high grade)

        Transformed NHL Patients must have had prior autologous transplantation and received
        cytoreductive therapy at the time of relapse to achieve complete remission (CR) or
        CR/unconfirmed (CRu) as defined by the International Workshop

        OR

        Patient with relapsed disease and required &gt;2 salvage regimens to achieve CR or CRu.

        Multiple Myeloma Recurrent Myeloma Patients must have had prior autologous transplantation
        and demonstrate chemosensitivity** at the time of relapse Myelodysplastic Syndrome #
        RA/RARS RCMD/RCMD-RS RAEB-1 Patients must be transfusion-dependent and have International
        prostate symptom score (IPSS) of 1.5 or higher Advanced myeloproliferative disease
        Myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia; primary or evolved from other MPD Patient must be
        transfusion dependent or have evidence of progressive organomegaly or evidence of

          -  remission is defined as morphological remission with bone marrow aspirate/biopsy
             showing &lt;= 5% blasts within 4 weeks before the start of therapy. (Cytogenetic or
             molecular remission is not required)

               -  In CLL, chemosensitivity is defined as greater than 50% reduction of wbc and
                  lymphadenopathy. In MM, it is defined as greater than 50% reduction of
                  M-component or plasma-cell marrow infiltration.
