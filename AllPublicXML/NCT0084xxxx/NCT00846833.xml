  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesized that haploidentical NK cells kill tumor cells more efficiently than
      autologous NK cells, based on the missing-self hypothesis. Therefore, we performed this study
      to investigate the role of haploidentical NK cell therapy in patients with refractory or
      relapsed malignant melanoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Human NK cells recognize and kill transformed cells in a MHC-unrestricted fashion, suggesting
      the role of cancer immunotherapy. However, autologous NK cells showed the lack of significant
      clinical effects, because they are inhibited by self MHC class I molecules, based on the
      missing-self hypothesis. Contrarily, haploidentical NK cells with KIR-ligand incompatibility
      can mediate graft-versus-leukemia effect and protect patients with acute myelogenous leukemia
      (AML) from graft-versus-host disease. In addition, adoptive transfer of haploidentical NK
      cells following high-intensity conditioning induced complete remission (26%) in
      poor-prognosis AML patients. Thus, this study was designed to investigate the role of
      adoptive NK cell therapy in patients with refractory or relapsed malignant melanoma using
      CD3+ depleting CliniMACS® system.
