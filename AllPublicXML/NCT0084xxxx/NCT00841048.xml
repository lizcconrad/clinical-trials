  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of AZD4017 when
      given as multiple oral ascending doses to healthy volunteers. This will be done by comparing
      the effect of AZD4017 to placebo. The study will aslo investigate the absorption,
      distribution and disappearance of AZD4017 in the body. Information about plasma
      concentrations of AZD4017 vs time after dose intake will also be collected and some measures
      of pharmacokinetics versus pharmacodynamics will be included. The future indication for
      AZD4017 is planned to be Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.
