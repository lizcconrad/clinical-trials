      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate efficacy of Hydroxypropyl Guar Galactomannan
      0.25% (HPGG) ophthalmic gel compared to Vehicle for the treatment of dry eye.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A 7-day Vehicle pre-randomization (run-in) phase during which all patients will receive 1
      drop of Vehicle in each eye twice daily will precede the 21-day treatment phase, for an
      overall study duration of 28 days.
