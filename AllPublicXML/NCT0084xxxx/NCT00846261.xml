      In this retrospective study, the investigators evaluated the clinical and functional results
      of infected nonunion of the long bone with soft-tissue defects treated simultaneously with
      Ilizarov technique combining open dressing change in 22 patients. The investigators wanted to
      find out whether that the internal bone transport with external fixator combining open
      dressing change is a valuable method to treatment for those patients with infected bone
      nonunion and poor condition of the soft tissue such as sinus, skin defect.

    <textblock>
      From January 2002 to now, totally 22 patients (18 males, 4 females) were underwent internal
      bone transport for infected nonunion in the long bone with soft-tissue defects. The mean age
      of the patients was 36.5 years (range, 19 to 57). The infected nonunion occurred on the femur
      in 1 patients, the tibia in 21 patients. The hybrid mono-lateral limb reconstruction external
      fixator was used, combined with bone transport. The results were evaluated by the
      classification of the Association for the Study and Application of the Method of Ilizarov
      (ASAMI) which divided into bone and functional categories
