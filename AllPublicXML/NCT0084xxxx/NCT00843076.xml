  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic infection by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a common cause of liver disease, which
      may progress to cirrhosis and eventually liver cancer. The therapeutic indication will depend
      mainly on the importance of liver damage (fibrosis), which can be assessed by physical
      techniques, blood tests and a liver biopsy. The overall objectives of the project are to
      understand how HCV variability may influence the severity of steatosis (accumulation of fat
      in the liver), studying 30 patients chronically infected with HCV (half of these patients
      infected by HCV genotype 3, versus the other half infected by HCV of another genotype). A
      small portion of the biopsy performed for the routine pathology examination will be placed in
      special fixation buffer for electron microscopy (EM). Counting and measuring the size of
      lipid droplets present in the liver by EM will be used to precisely quantify and characterize
      the liver steatosis. A blood sample of patients will also be collected to sequence the viral
      genome present in the patient and identify the amino acids involved in an increase in
      intracellular accumulation of lipid droplets. This work should clarify the impact of the
      viral variability in the severity of steatosis. Ultimately, the identification of viral
      sequences responsible for an increase of this phenomenon could be crucial for understanding
      the mechanisms involved in the steatosis.
