  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is intended to test whether a focused nutritional intervention in hospitalized
      patients with type 2 diabetes can have an impact on long term eating habits, physical
      activity and anthropometric parameters.

      The rational is to use the food tray as a means of conveying simple and practical nutritonal
      and behavioral messages.

    <textblock>
      Patients hospitalized at Hadassah Medical Center who have type 2 diabetes will relieve a
      focused nutritional intervention using mainly the food tray during the hospitalization. The
      intervention will be administered by the hospital nutrition team.

      At baseline (upon admission) - medical data will be collected as well as nutritional and
      behavioral questionnaires will be administered. The intervention will take place during the
      hospitalization period. Follow up using the same tools will be performed at 3 and 12 month.

      We believe that the hospitalization period, even for reasons non related to diabetes, is a
      window of opportunity to implement lifestyle changes.

    <description>The guidance will be performed using the food tray during the hospitalization and will consist of meeting the nutritionist and receiving brochures along with the meal tray focusing on constituents and elements of the diet. The served meals will consist of elements recommended for patients with T2DM (such as whole grains, low fat dairy products and canola oil).</description>
