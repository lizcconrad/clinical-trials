  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of preoperative chemoradiation and adjuvant chemotherapy with 5-FU based chemotherapy
      reduced local recurrence rate to less than 10%, but has only had limited effect on overall
      survival due to the constantly high (more than 30%) rate of distant metastasis.

      However, it has been shown that complete eradication of the primary tumour observed in the
      histopathological specimen (pathological complete response, pCR) correlates with a favourable
      overall prognosis so obtaining a pCR might be beneficial. The aim of the study is to
      investigate whether the addition of bevacizumab to preoperative fluoropyrimidinebased
      chemoradiation improves pathological complete remission rate in locally advanced rectal
      cancer with acceptable toxicity. Secondary objectives are to evaluate pathological
      downstaging rate, histopathological R0 resection rate,sphincter preservation rate,
      perioperative surgical complication rate, local control, DFS, OS, late toxicity and quality
      of life.

      -  radiotherapy: 45 Gy to the pelvis (25x 1.8 Gy on days 1-33, excluding weekends) plus 5.4
           Gy on days 36-38 as a boost to the primary tumour (3 fractions of 1.8 Gy).Three-
           dimensional CT planing and a four field box technique with high energy photons (15 MV)
           will be used. All fields will be treated daily. Multileaf collimators will be used to
           shape individual radiation fields. Patients will be irradiated in a prone position with
           a full bladder and by using belly board to minimize exposure of the small bowel.

        -  capecitabine 825 mg/m² p.o. twice daily on days 1-38 (including weekends),

        -  bevacizumab: at dose 5 mg/kg on days -14, 2, 16,30.

        -  Radical surgery (TME): to be undertaken ideally 6-8 weeks following completion of
           chemoradiation.

      Postoperative treatment (in patients achieving histopathological R0 or R1
      resection):capecitabine 1250 mg/m² p.o. twice daily for 14 consecutive days every three
      weeks; 4 cycles (R0)or 6 cycles (R1) beginning 6-8 weeks after surgery
