    <textblock>
      Standard antiviral treatment consists of weekly injections with Peginterferon-α in
      combination with ribavirin. This treatment may lead to significant weight loss (7% within 24
      weeks on average), with decreased quality of life. In this study the investigators will
      examine in 50 patients whether nutritional advise and support can prevent weight loss during
      antiviral therapy.

    <textblock>
      Standard antiviral treatment consists of weekly injections with Peginterferon-α in
      combination with ribavirin. This therapy, however, leads to weight loss of approximately 7%
      in the first 24 weeks of therapy possibly related to impaired postprandial gastric emptying.
      Such rapid weight loss is a marker of deterioration of the nutritional status with increased
      risk of complications and reduced immunological barrier function. Deterioration of the
      nutritional status also exacerbates side effects of the antiviral treatment like fatigue and
      depression. As a result, the quality of life of these patients may decrease. In the current
      controlled, prospective, multicenter, study we primarily aim to compare the effects of
      preventative versus on demand nutritional advice in combination with nutritional support on
      reduction of weight loss in patients receiving standard antiviral therapy with PEG-interferon
      in combination with ribavirin. We will randomize patients for the preventative intervention
      with dietary consultation combined with dietary supplementation of a daily snack or the on
      demand dietary support group (only dietary follow up, no dietary advice or snack, standard
      care). In the on demand group, patients will be referred to the dietitian in case of weight
      loss of ≥ 5% or a BMI &lt; 20 during antiviral therapy. Assuming that 60% reduction of weight
      loss during the first 24 weeks of treatment is clinically relevant, 2 x 25 patients need to
      be included (α=0.05, β=0.2: power=0.8 and a drop-out rate of 15%). Primary aim is to assess
      whether the intervention can decrease the amount of weight loss during therapy.
