      This is a multi-institution, non-randomized, open label, Phase IIa prospective trial to
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of maintenance lenalidomide after allogeneic
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT).

      Lenalidomide maintenance therapy will start between day 60 and 90 after allogeneic HCT at a
      starting dose of 10mg PO once daily. Dose escalation and de-escalation will be performed
      depending on tolerability of lenalidomide. Dose range is 5mg every other day to 5 - 25 mg
      given daily on days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle for 12 cycles maximum or maximum of 12 months from
      first dose of study drug.

      Patients will be followed until 28 days from completing the 12th planned cycle of
      lenalidomide maintenance or 12 months from first dose of study drug, which ever comes first,
      (14 to 15 months after receiving the allograft) or discontinuation of study drug.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  One prior allograft from an 8/8 or 7/8 allele matched related or unrelated donor,
             received 60 to 90 days prior to initiation of lenalidomide

          -  Meet the diagnostic criteria of symptomatic myeloma at anytime prior to allogeneic HCT

          -  Have high-risk multiple myeloma

          -  Received ≤ three (3) prior lines of therapy. Prior therapies may include: combination
             chemotherapy, monotherapy, lenalidomide and autologous HCT. Localized radiation
             therapy does not count as a single line of therapy. Previous progression on
             lenalidomide does not exclude participation in the study.

          -  Received a reduced intensity conditioning regimen

          -  Received or are receiving a GVHD prophylaxis regimen of a calcineurin inhibitor in
             combination with either methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or sirolimus

          -  Karnofsky performance score ≥ 80 or ECOG ≤ 2

             within 1 month of enrollment

             lenalidomide

          -  Patients who have received donor lymphocyte infusions
