      As a multi-site randomized controlled clinical trial,through a central system,patients were

      plus modern rehabilitation techniques.All patients were treated for 2 weeks. At the first day
      after the treatment and the 14 days after treatment, each patient was evaluated for the
      following three clinical indications: (1)evaluation of neurological deficits by U.S. National
      Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS);(2) evaluation of motor function by the short form
      Fugl-Meyer motor function scoring system (FMI); and (3) assessment of limb spasticity by the
      modified Ashworth spasticity rating scale.
