    <description>FACIT-Fatigue is a 13-item questionnaire. Participant scored each item on a 5-point scale: 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). The larger the participant's response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated), the greater the fatigue. For all questions, except for the 2 negatively stated ones, the code was reversed and a new score was calculated as 4 minus the participant's response. The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-Fatigue score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score). A higher score reflected an improvement in the participant's health status.</description>

        <description>DAS28-4 (ESR) calculated from swollen joint count (SJC) and tender/painful joint count (TJC) using 28 joint count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (millimeters per hour [mm/hour]) and patient's global assessment (PtGA) of disease activity (transformed score ranging 0 to 10; higher score indicated greater affectation due to disease activity). Total score range:0 to 9.4, higher score indicated more disease activity. DAS28-4 (ESR) less than or equal to (=&lt;) 3.2 implied low disease activity, greater than (&gt;) 3.2 to 5.1 implied moderate to high disease activity and less than (&lt;) 2.6=remission.

          <description>DAS28-4 (ESR) calculated from swollen joint count (SJC) and tender/painful joint count (TJC) using 28 joint count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (millimeters per hour [mm/hour]) and patient's global assessment (PtGA) of disease activity (transformed score ranging 0 to 10; higher score indicated greater affectation due to disease activity). Total score range:0 to 9.4, higher score indicated more disease activity. DAS28-4 (ESR) less than or equal to (=&lt;) 3.2 implied low disease activity, greater than (&gt;) 3.2 to 5.1 implied moderate to high disease activity and less than (&lt;) 2.6=remission. For comparison of CP-690,550 with placebo, placebo sequences were combined into single reporting group for Month 6 analysis.</description>

        <description>SF-36 is a standardized survey evaluating 8 aspects of functional health and well being: physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role emotional and mental health. The score for a section is an average of the individual question scores, which are scaled 0-100 (100=highest level of functioning) and is reported as 2 summary scores; physical component score and mental component score. Total score range for the summary scores = 0-100, where higher score represents higher level of functioning.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Month 1, 3, 6</time_frame>
        <population>FAS included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study medication. 'N' (number of participants analyzed) signifies those participants who were evaluable for this measure. 'n' signifies those participants who were evaluable for this measure at given time points for each group respectively.</population>

        <title>36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) at Month 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24</title>
        <description>SF-36 is a standardized survey evaluating 8 aspects of functional health and well being: physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role emotional and mental health. The score for a section is an average of the individual question scores, which are scaled 0-100 (100=highest level of functioning) and is reported as 2 summary scores; physical component score and mental component score. Total score range for the summary scores = 0-100, where higher score represents higher level of functioning.</description>

        <title>Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale (MOS-SS) at Baseline, Month 1, 3 and 6</title>
        <description>Participant-rated 12 item questionnaire to assess constructs of sleep over past week.7 subscales: sleep disturbance, snoring, awakened short of breath, sleep adequacy, somnolence (range:0-100); sleep quantity(range:0-24), optimal sleep(yes or no). 9 item index measures of sleep disturbance provide composite scores: sleep problem summary, overall sleep problem. Except Adequacy, Optimal, Quantity of sleep, higher scores=more impairment. Scores transformed(actual raw score(RS) minus lowest possible score divided by possible RS range*100);total score range:0-100,higher score=more intensity of attribute.</description>

        <description>Participant-rated 12 item questionnaire to assess constructs of sleep over past week.7 subscales: sleep disturbance, snoring, awakened short of breath, sleep adequacy, somnolence (range:0-100); sleep quantity(range:0-24), optimal sleep(yes or no). 9 item index measures of sleep disturbance provide composite scores: sleep problem summary, overall sleep problem. Except Adequacy, Optimal, Quantity of sleep, higher scores=more impairment. Scores transformed(actual raw score(RS) minus lowest possible score divided by possible RS range*100);total score range:0-100,higher score=more intensity of attribute.</description>

        <title>Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue Scale at Baseline, Month 1, 3, and 6</title>
        <description>FACIT-Fatigue is a 13-item questionnaire. Participant scored each item on a 5-point scale: 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). The larger the participant's response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated), the greater the fatigue. For all questions, except for the 2 negatively stated ones, the code was reversed and a new score was calculated as 4 minus the participant's response. The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-Fatigue score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score). A higher score reflected an improvement in the participant's health status.</description>

        <title>Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue Scale at Month 12, 18 and 24</title>
        <description>FACIT-Fatigue is a 13-item questionnaire. Participant scored each item on a 5-point scale: 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). The larger the participant's response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated), the greater the fatigue. For all questions, except for the 2 negatively stated ones, the code was reversed and a new score was calculated as 4 minus the participant's response. The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-Fatigue score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score). A higher score reflected an improvement in the participant's health status.</description>

          <description>WLQ: participant-reported 25-item scale to evaluate degree to which health problems interfere with an ability to perform job roles along 4 dimensions: Time Management scale (5-items); Physical Demands scale (6-item); Mental-Interpersonal Demands Scale (9-items); Output Demands scale (5-items). All the scales ranged from 0 (limited none of the time) to 100 (limited all of the time). Work Loss Index, which represented percentage of lost work over time period relative to a normative population, was derived (total score:0[no loss] to 100[complete loss of work]).</description>
          <population>FAS included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study medication. 'N' (number of participants analyzed) signifies those participants who were evaluable for this measure. 'n' signifies those participants who were evaluable for this measure at given time points for each group respectively.</population>

        <title>Work Productivity and Healthcare Resource Utilization (HCRU) at Baseline, Month 3 and 6</title>
        <description>Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)-HCRU assessed healthcare usage during last 3 months for direct, indirect medical cost domains. Direct cost: visit to doctor, non-medical practitioner, nursing home, hospital, surgery, emergency room(ER) treatment, diagnostic tests, over-night stay, home healthcare services, aids/devices used. Indirect costs associated with functional disability: employment status, willingness to work, work disability due to RA, sick leave, part time work, ability to perform chores, chores done by family, friends or housekeeper. Assessment was based on 0 to 2-point scale; higher score=higher medical cost.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Month 3, 6</time_frame>
        <population>FAS included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study medication. 'N' (number of participants analyzed) signifies those participants who were evaluable for this measure. 'n' signifies those participants who were evaluable for this measure at given time points for each group respectively.</population>

        <description>Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)-HCRU assessed healthcare usage during last 3 months for direct, indirect medical cost domains. Direct cost:visit to doctor,non-medical practitioner,nursing home,hospital,surgery,emergency room(ER) treatment,diagnostic tests, over-night stay,home healthcare services, aids/devices used. Indirect costs associated with functional disability:employment status,willingness to work,work disability due to RA,sick leave,part time work,ability to perform chores,chores done by family/friends/housekeeper. Assessment was based on 0 to 2-point scale;higher score=higher medical cost.</description>
