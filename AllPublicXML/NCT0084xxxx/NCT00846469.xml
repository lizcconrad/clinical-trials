  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the usefulness of CCTA (Coronary Computed
      Tomography Angiography) in the emergency room setting to diagnose and predict the outcome of
      patients with chest pain who have a low to moderate risk of heart disease.

      And to also determine if the use of CCTA(Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography) is more
      cost effective (cost less) than the current standards of care treatments. To determine if
      patients who present to the emergency room w/low to moderate probability of having an ACS
      (Acute Coronary Syndrome) prefer CCTA (coronary computed tomography angiography)-based care
      compared to standard algorithm based care.

    <description>A CCTA (coronary computed tomography angiography) scan is a CT scan of the blood vessels of the heart. This CCTA (Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography)will be performed and a contrast medication will be injected through an IV line to help make the CT pictures more clear. Medication may or may not be given to control your heart rate during the scan. After the scan is completed it will be read. Your emergency room physician will use the CT results to determine your treatment.</description>
