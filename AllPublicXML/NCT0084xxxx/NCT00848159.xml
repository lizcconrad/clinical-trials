      This study aimed to measure the degree of thoracic kyphosis in elderly women with those
      affected by osteoporosis in the spine, through photogrammetry computer and check the
      difference between the values obtained with the assumption of greater thoracic kyphosis in
      osteoporotic women.

      The decrease in bone density of vertebrae leads to a reduction of the anterior vertebral
      bodies, resulting in compression and collapse of vertebrae, with narrowing of intervertebral
      disc spaces and, determining a number of deformities in the spine and postural changes, among
      which can highlight the increase in thoracic kyphosis. This becomes significantly higher with
      age and after menopause, defined as an increase in curvature in the sagittal plane of the
      thoracic spine.

      Radiographic images have been used for the measurement of thoracic kyphosis, but with some
      drawbacks of this method such as radiation exposure, radiographic image quality
      unsatisfactory hampering its analysis and the lack of equipment in the physical environment
      to monitor clinical evolution of the treatment, causing thus the search for noninvasive
      methods for evaluating the curves of the spine, including the photogrammetry computed.

      According to the American Society of Photogrammetry, the computed photogrammetry is &quot;the art,
      science and technology of information on physical objects and environment through processes
      of recording, measuring and interpreting photographic images and patterns of electromagnetic
      radiant energy and other sources.&quot; It is a widely used tool for assessment by quantifying the
      postural changes through the application of photogrammetric principles to photographic images
      obtained in body movements, adding to the diagnostic evaluation for physical therapy in
      different areas.

      The two groups were photographed in the sagittal plane with right column markers fixed on two
      anatomical points. The selected images were quantified by computerized photogrametry, using

        The investigators evaluated 12 women with mean age of 68.5 years (range 65 to 74 years),
        divided into two groups. Group 1 consists of six women with a densitometric diagnosis of
        osteoporosis in column (SD: -2.70 to -4.97) and group 2 consists of six women with a
        densitometric diagnosis of osteopenia in column (DP: 1.07 to -2 , 09), both compared with
        young adults.
