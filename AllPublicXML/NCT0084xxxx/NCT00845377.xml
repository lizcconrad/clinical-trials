  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression is one of the leading causes of emotional suffering in later life. It has been
      estimated that 2-5% of community-dwelling elderly people suffer from major depression, but
      according to recent studies, as much as 25 % have clinically significant depressive
      symptoms.Typically, depressive symptoms in the elderly are treated solely with
      antidepressants.

      The aim of this project is to study the effects of a comprehensive psychosocial intervention
      on the psychological well-being, quality of life and use of services in depressed elderly
      people. In addition, the processes of intervention are studied from the perspective of the
      participants as well as the service system. The research is conducted in collaboration with
      the city of Espoo. The design of the study combines clinical trial with qualitative process
      analysis.
