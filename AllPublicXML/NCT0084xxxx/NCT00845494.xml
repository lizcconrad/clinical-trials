    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine if a behavioral knowledge based education
      intervention will decrease medication transcription errors among professional nurses when
      admitting elder patients to a hospital. The hypothesis is those professional nurses who
      receive the behavioral-cognitive eduction medication taking intervention will have fewer
      medication errors than those professional nurses who do not.
