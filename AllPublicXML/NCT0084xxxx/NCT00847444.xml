  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, 2x2 factorial design, randomized controlled, Phase III
      study comparing the disease free survival after randomisation in patients treated with 3
      cycles of Epirubicine-Fluorouracil-Cyclophosphamide(FEC)-chemotherapy, followed by 3 cycles
      of Docetaxel(D)-chemotherapy, versus 6 cycles of Docetaxel- Cyclophosphamide
      (DC)-chemotherapy, and to compare the disease free survival in patients with BMI of 24 - 40
      kg/m² after randomisation with versus without the lifestyle intervention. Patients will be
      required to have histopathological proof of a HER2/neu negative tumor and: axillary lymph
      node metastases (pN1-3) or high risk node negative, defined as: 'pT ≥2 or histopathological
      grade 3, or age ≤35 or negative hormone receptor status, but are not allowed to have evidence
      of distant disease. Patients will have to be entered into the study no later than 6 weeks
      after complete resection of the primary tumor. No other antineoplastic treatment other than
      surgical treatment, the defined cytotoxic and endocrine treatment and radiotherapy will be
      allowed prior to study entry and during the course of the study.

      Rationale:

        -  Taxane based chemotherapy will be established as treatment standard in the adjuvant
           setting of early breast cancer

        -  3xFEC100, followed by 3xDoc100 has been established as standard treatment option for
           node-positive breast cancer

        -  Anthracycline based regimens do not seem to be superior in Her2/neu-negative patients
           (Gennari et al., Slamon et al.)

        -  Dietary intervention can improve outcome in patients with early breast cancer (WINS,
           Chlebowski et al.)

      Primary Endpoints:

        -  The first primary objective of this study is to compare disease free survival after
           randomisation in patients treated with a combination of
           5-FU/Epirubicine/Cyclophosphamide followed by Docetaxel vs. Docetaxel/Cyclophosphamide

        -  The second primary objective of this study is to compare disease free survival after
           randomisation in patients with vs. without lifestyle intervention

      Design:

      Prospectively randomized open label Phase III study with 2x2 factorial design

          9. Willingness to participate in a telephone-based lifestyle intervention programme [10.]
             Intention of regular follow up visits for the duration of the study [11.] Ability to
             understand the nature of the study and to give written informed consent

        Patients will be excluded from the study for any of the following reasons:

          1. Inflammatory breast cancer

          2. Previous or concomitant cytotoxic or other systemic antineoplastic treatment which is
             not part of this study

          3. A second primary malignancy (except in situ carcinoma of the cervix or adequately
             treated basal cell carcinoma of the skin)

          4. Cardiomyopathy with impaired ventricular function (NYHA &gt; II), cardiac arrhythmias
             influencing LVEF and requiring medication, history of myocardial infarction or angina
             pectoris within the last 6 months, or arterial hypertension not being controlled by
             medication

          5. Any known hypersensitivity against Docetaxel, Epirubicine, Cyclophosphamide, or any
             other medication included in the study protocol. The contraindication, warning notices
             and measures of precaution of the products, as notified in the product infroamtion,
             have to be respected

          6. Use of any investigational agent within 3 weeks prior to inclusion

          7. Patients in pregnancy or breast feeding (in premenopausal women anticonception has to
             be assured)

          8. Insulin-requiring diabetes mellitus (non-insulin requiring patients with type 2
             diabetes are eligible for the study)

          9. Serious digestive and/or absorptive problems that exclude adherence to the study diet
             [10.] Self-reported inability to walk at least one kilometer (at any pace) [11.]
             Cardiovascular, respiratory or musculoskeletal disease or joint problems that preclude
             moderate physical activity. Moderate arthritis that does not preclude physical
             activity is not a reason for exclusion [12.] Psychiatric disorders or conditions that
             would preclude participation in the study intervention [13.] Patients not sufficiently
             fluent in German language to understand the nature of this study and any of the
             interventional measures
