      The purpose of this study it to evaluate the safety and immune response of peptides (URLC10)
      emulsified with Montanide ISA51 in treating patients with unresectable, advanced or recurrent
      gastric cancer.

    <textblock>
      URLC10 has been identified as cancer specific molecules especially in non small cell lung
      cancer using genome-wide expression profile analysis by cDNA microarray technique. In a prior
      study, it has been shown that URLC10 are upregulated in esophageal cancer and gastric cancer
      and other cancer. The investigators identified that peptides derived from these proteins
      significantly induce the effective tumor specific CTL response in vitro. According to these
      findings, in this trial, the investigators evaluate the safety, immunological and clinical
      response of URLC10 peptide vaccine in the patients with gastric cancer. Patients will be
      vaccinated once in one week to the eighth vaccine and will be vaccinated once in two weeks
      from the ninth vaccine. On each vaccination day, the URLC10 peptide (1mg) mixed with
      Montanide ISA 51 will be administered by endodermic injection
