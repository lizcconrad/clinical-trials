      1. To explore the pathology of nerve, vascular, and skin in the amputated leg

        2. To diagnose small-fiber sensory neuropathy of the contralateral leg by investigating the
           skin intervention

        3. To search for (1) mechanisms of amputation and (2) prevention measures for further
           amputation in the currently healthy-looking limb

      Diabetic foot occurs in 15% of diabetic population (3) and 15% of the diabetic foot patients
      end up with lower limb amputation. Peripheral neuropathy (sensory, motor and autonomic),
      peripheral vascular disease, trauma, infection and poor wound healing all contribute to
      diabetic foot problem.

      Peripheral neuropathy could be evaluated in a variety of ways, including vibratory
      thresholds, thermal thresholds, pressure perception thresholds, muscle strength. All these
      predict foot ulceration to some degree(1). Motor nerve conduction velocity is an independent
      predictor for the development of new foot ulcer in diabetic population.

      For more detailed structural study of neuropathy in diabetic patient, we could use skin
      biopsy method. Skin biopsy with PGP9.5 immunohistochemistry has been demonstrated by
      ultrastructural studies to label the terminal portions of both small myelinated and
      unmyelinated nerve in the epidermis . Intra-epidermal nerve fiber (IENF) density is reduced
      in patient with impaired glucose tolerance and clinically overt diabetes . Previous IENF
      density study was performed in diabetic patients with sensory symptom but no foot ulcer. Now
      we tried to evaluate IENF density in severe diabetic foot patient who received below knee
      amputation. Skin biopsy willl be performed at amputated leg. The skin biopsy area will be
      located at lateral side of distal leg, 10 cm above the lateral malleolus as previous protocol
      of our group . Underlying sural nerve and posterior tibial nerve will be also harvested for
      further ultra-structural study. The result will be compared to the control group which were
      recruited from a previously described cohort matched by gender and age.

      After amputation, sural nerve, posterior tibial nerve, and the accompanying vasculature will
      be harvested from the amputated leg. 3mm-puch skin will be taken from the amputated leg, 10
      cm above the lateral malleolus.

        Diabetic foot wound patient who underwent below-knee amputation due to poor wound healing
        and severe infection condition. The patient population often receives leg revasculariztion
        surgery but poor response for wound healing.
