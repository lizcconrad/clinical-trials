  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if by using insulin analog (Glargine and lispro
      insulin) with an insulin pen the investigators are able to obtain a higher rate of correct
      timing of insulin and food administration as when compared to the usual therapy (insulin NPH
      and regular) with syringes.

    <description>The active control group will receive twice daily NPH insulin as basal insulin and bolus (prandial) insulin as regular insulin to be administered 30 minutes before meals. The administration of basal (prandial) regular insulin and food will be done as the current usual care on the hospital ward. The protocol for initial insulin dose and subsequent dose adjustment has been developed by the &quot;Inpatient Diabetes Advisory Group&quot; and is detailed in appendix B. The patient will receive information regarding diabetes treatments, appropriate diet and diabetic self management which will be provided by the nursing and nutritional staff.</description>

    <description>The study group will receive Insulin Glargine as basal insulin and bolus (prandial) insulin as lispro insulin (choice between pens or vials will be made). The administration of bolus (prandial) insulin pen or syringe will be delivered concurrently with the food tray (the concept of &quot;insulin pen/syringe on the food tray&quot;) by the nursing staff that together with hospital food services identifies the food tray for the patients in the study group. The protocol for initial insulin dose and subsequent dose adjustment has been developed by the &quot;Inpatient Diabetes Advisory Group&quot; and is detailed in appendix A. The patient will receive information regarding diabetes treatments, appropriate diet and diabetic self management which will be provided by the nursing and nutritional staff</description>
