      The study will evaluate the effectiveness of atomoxetine (Strattera) with and without Parent
      Management Training (PMT) in children with Autism, Asperger's Disorder, or Pervasive
      Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (PDDNOS) who have symptoms of Attention
      Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). This is a double-blind placebo, parallel study where
      the atomoxetine will have a dose titration over a 6 week period. All children will be seen
      weekly during this titration period, with additional visits at Week 8 and Week 10. Families
      assigned to the PMT arm will have an additional weekly meeting with a clinician for a total
      of 9 PMT visits. PMT involves teaching parents to implement behavioral interventions with
      their children. Subjects who are clinical responders (ADHD Responders and Compliance
      Responders) from the 10 week study period will be followed every 4 weeks in a 24-week
      extension study. Subjects who are clinical nonresponders will continue in PMT if they
      received PMT during the double-blind phase, and they will receive an open trial of
      atomoxetine if they were on placebo during the double-blind phase. All subjects (responders
      and nonresponders) will be invited to participate in follow-up assessments every 4 weeks for
      24 weeks after the completion of the double-blind phase.

    <description>Respondents were defined as having ≥30% decrease on the SNAP and CGI-I&lt;=2). The Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham (SNAP)-IV Parent and Teacher Rating Scales were used to measure ADHD and oppositional symptoms at home and school. The SNAP-IV ADHD section contains items for each of the 18 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV symptoms of ADHD rated from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much). The Clinical Global Impressions Scale (CGI) includes subscales for severity of illness and global improvement. The Severity scale is scored from 1 (normal) to 7 (extremely ill), with a rating of ≥4 required for inclusion. The Improvement score ranged from 1 (very much improved) through 4 (no change) to 7 (very much worse). The CGI was completed by a blinded rater based on parent/child interview and review of completed parent and school behavior problem questionnaires at each study visit.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Were Autism Spectrum Disorder Respondents</measure>
    <time_frame>week 10</time_frame>
    <description>Respondents were defined as having ≥30% decrease on the HSQ and CGI-I≤2). The 25-item HSQ was adapted by the Research Units on Pediatric Psychopharmacology Autism Network to evaluate behavioral noncompliance in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The Home Situations Questionnaire - Pervasive Developmental Disorder (HSQ) is a 25-item parent rating scale assessing noncompliance. Parents are asked to indicate whether each item is a problem and, if so, its severity from 1 (mild) to 9 (severe). The School Situations Questionnaire (SSQ) is a 9-item teacher rating scale that assesses noncompliance. The SSQ is a companion instrument to the HSQ and uses the same rating scale.
The Clinical Global Impressions Scale (CGI) includes subscales for severity of illness and global improvement. The Severity scale is scored from 1 (normal) to 7 (extremely ill),</description>

          <title>Atomoxetine (ATX) + Parent Management Training</title>
          <description>ATX doses were split twice daily to prevent side effects. However, once-daily dosing was allowed if strongly preferred by a given family. ATX doses were individually adjusted according to a weight-based dosage schedule, with medical clinicians allowed to delay increases or to reduce doses due to adverse events. The initial dose was 0.3 mg/kg/day (rounded to the nearest 5 mg) with weekly escalations by 0.3 mg/kg/day, unless there were limiting side effects or no further room for improvement, to a target dose of 1.2 mg/kg/day, and could be increased to a maximum of 1.8 mg/kg/day based on clinical status and response.
Parent Management Training (PT)-Families assigned to PT met weekly for individual sessions with a PT clinician. Sessions were adapted from the RUPP Parent Training Manual and covered topics such as preventing behavior problems, reinforcement, time out, and planned ignoring. Each session lasted 60 to 90 minutes and included didactic materials, videos, and role playing.</description>

ATX doses were individually adjusted according to a weight-based dosage schedule, with medical clinicians allowed to delay increases or to reduce doses due to AEs. The initial dose was 0.3 mg/kg/day (rounded to the nearest 5 mg) with weekly escalations by 0.3 mg/kg/day, unless there were limiting side effects or no further room for improvement, to a target dose of 1.2 mg/kg/day, and could be increased to a maximum of 1.8 mg/kg/day based on clinical status and response.
Parent Management Training-Families assigned to PT met weekly for individual sessions with a PT clinician. Sessions were adapted from the RUPP Parent Training Manual and covered topics such as preventing behavior problems, reinforcement, time out, and planned ignoring. Each session lasted 60 to 90 minutes and included didactic materials, videos, and role playing.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Were Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Respondents</title>
        <description>Respondents were defined as having ≥30% decrease on the SNAP and CGI-I&lt;=2). The Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham (SNAP)–IV Parent and Teacher Rating Scales were used to measure ADHD and oppositional symptoms at home and school. The SNAP-IV ADHD section contains items for each of the 18 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV symptoms of ADHD rated from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much). The Clinical Global Impressions Scale (CGI) includes subscales for severity of illness and global improvement. The Severity scale is scored from 1 (normal) to 7 (extremely ill), with a rating of ≥4 required for inclusion. The Improvement score ranged from 1 (very much improved) through 4 (no change) to 7 (very much worse). The CGI was completed by a blinded rater based on parent/child interview and review of completed parent and school behavior problem questionnaires at each study visit.</description>
