  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in the 4-Item Agitation/Aggression Subscale of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-4 A/A) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>NPI assessed noncognitive psychopathology in participants with Alzheimer's dementia. A 4-item subscale of the standard 12-item NPI measured the neuropsychiatric symptoms of A/A, with items consisting of agitation/aggression, aberrant motor behavior, irritability/emotional lability, and disinhibition. Scores for each subscale (frequency x severity) were calculated to obtain each item score. The total subscale score ranged from 0 to 48, with higher scores indicating more frequent and/or severe A/A symptoms. If a symptom was not present at all, the site would not enter anything for frequency or severity, and a zero would be imputed for that item. Least Squares (LS) Mean value was adjusted for NPI strata, treatment, pooled site, visit, treatment-by-visit, baseline NPI-4 A/A, and baseline-by-visit interaction.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in 10-Item Version of Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-10) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>NPI assessed noncognitive psychopathology in participants with Alzheimer's dementia. A 10-item scale of the standard 12-item NPI measured neuropsychiatric symptoms minus the appetite and sleep disturbance items. Scores for each subscale (frequency × severity) were calculated to obtain the item score. The total subscale score ranged from 0 to 120, with higher scores indicating more frequent and/or severe A/A symptoms. If a symptom was not present at all, the site would not enter anything for frequency or severity, and a zero would be imputed for that item. LS Mean value was adjusted for NPI strata, treatment, pooled site, visit, treatment-by-visit, baseline NPI-10, and baseline-by-visit interaction.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) Depression Domain at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>NPI Depression domain was an item of the standard 12-item NPI that measured depression in participants with Alzheimer's dementia. Scores for each subscale (frequency × severity) were calculated to obtain the item score, which ranged from 0 to 12 with higher scores indicating more frequent and/or severe neuropsychiatric symptoms. If a symptom was not present at all, the site would not enter anything for frequency or severity, and a zero would be imputed for that item. LS Mean value was adjusted for NPI strata, treatment, pooled site, visit, treatment-by-visit, baseline NPI depression, and baseline-by-visit interaction.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) Psychosis Subscale Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The NPI Psychosis subscale score was the sum of the delusions and hallucinations items of the standard 12-item NPI that measured psychosis symptoms in participants with Alzheimer's dementia. Scores for each subscale (frequency x severity) were calculated for each item score and ranged from 0 to 24 with higher scores indicating more frequent and/or severe neuropsychiatric symptoms. LS Mean value was adjusted for NPI strata, treatment, pooled site, visit, treatment-by-visit, baseline NPI psychosis, and baseline-by-visit interaction.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory-Community Version (CMAI-C) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>CMAI-C is the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory - Community Version, and it contained 36 questions. The first 35 items were rated from 1 (never) to 7 (several times per hour) and the last item asked if there was any other inappropriate behavior, with a free text field to specify the behavior. The total score ranged from 7 to 245 (7 x 35), with higher scores reflecting more severe agitation. LS Mean value was adjusted for NPI strata, treatment, pooled site, visit, treatment-by-visit, baseline CMAI-C, and baseline-by-visit interaction.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>CSDD was a 19-item, clinician-rated scale designed to measure the presence and severity of depressive symptoms in dementia participants. Symptoms were rated as absent, mild/intermittent, or severe. Scores ranged from 0 to 38; scores of 8 or more suggested clinical depression. LS Mean value was adjusted for NPI strata, treatment, pooled site, visit, treatment-by-visit, baseline CSDD, and baseline-by-visit interaction.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Total T-Score in the Frontal System Behaviors Scale (FrSBe) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>FrSBe was a 46-item, caregiver-rated scale that assessed behaviors associated with damage to the frontal lobes and frontal systems of the brain, including executive function, disinhibition, and apathy. Raw scores were normalized to T-scores based on gender, education, and age. Higher T scores represent a worse outcome. A score of 50 reflects a normative sample, and T scores at or above 65 are considered clinically significant. LS Mean value was adjusted for NPI strata, treatment, pooled site, visit, treatment-by-visit, baseline FrSBe, and baseline-by-visit interaction.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Clinical Global Impression-Severity-Agitation/Aggression (CGI-S-A/A) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>CGI-S-A/A was a 7-point, single-item rating scale for overall severity of symptoms based on the investigator's general clinical experience with a similar participant population. This Likert scale ranged from 0 (normal) to 7 (most severely ill). LS Mean value was adjusted for NPI strata, treatment, pooled site, visit, treatment-by-visit, baseline CGI-S-A/A, and baseline-by-visit interaction.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Clinical Global Impression-Severity-Global Functioning (CGI-S-GF) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>CGI-S-GF was a 7-point, single-item rating scale for overall functioning based on the investigator's general clinical experience with a similar participant population. This Likert scale ranged from 0 (normal) to 7 (most severely ill). LS Mean value was adjusted for NPI strata, treatment, pooled site, visit, treatment-by-visit, baseline CGI-S-GF, and baseline-by-visit interaction.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in the 14-Item Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale, Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog14) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>ADAS-Cog14, a 14-item rating scale, measured the severity of cognitive dysfunction in persons with AD. Scores ranged from 0 to 90, with a higher score indicating worse cognitive functioning. LS Mean value was adjusted for NPI strata, treatment, pooled site, visit, treatment-by-visit, baseline ADAS-Cog, and baseline-by-visit interaction.</description>

A 4-item subscale of the standard 12-item NPI measured the neuropsychiatric symptoms of A/A, with items consisting of agitation/aggression, aberrant motor behavior, irritability/emotional lability, and disinhibition. Scores for each subscale (frequency x severity) were calculated to obtain each item score. The total subscale score ranged from 0 to 48, with higher scores indicating more frequent and/or severe A/A symptoms. If a symptom was not present at all then a zero would be imputed for that item.</description>

The total subscale score ranged from 0 to 120, with higher scores indicating more frequent and/or severe A/A symptoms. If a symptom was not present at all, the site would not enter anything for frequency or severity, and a zero would be imputed for that item. LS Mean value was adjusted for NPI strata, treatment, pooled site, visit, treatment-by-visit, baseline NPI-10, and baseline-by-visit interaction.</description>
