  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, comparative, single evaluator-blinded trial to evaluate clinical,
      histological and immunohistochemical effects of oral isotretinoin plus moisturizer sunscreen
      as compared to the use of 0,05% tretinoin cream plus moisturizer sunscreen for the treatment
      of photodamage on face and forearms. Main oral isotretinoin safety parameters will also be
      analyzed, as well as adverse events related to topical products.

      A 24-week study, with 7 or 9 monthly visits, comprising healthy adult volunteers, aged 50 to
      75 years will be carried out. The patients should present advanced to severe photodamage on
      face and forearms. Written informed consent will be obtained from each subject prior to
      enrollment.

      Eligible patients will be randomly divided in two groups:

      A- 10 patients will be treated with oral isotretinoin, 20.0 mg/day, every other day, 15
      capsules per month, for 24 weeks, associated with the use of moisturizer broad spectrum
      sunscreen twice a day.

      B- 10 patients (controls) will be treated with 0,05% tretinoin cream applied on face and
      forearms at night and the same moisturizer broad-spectrum sunscreen twice a day.

      After randomization, laboratory tests will be requested for patients from group A and will be
      repeated on weeks 4 and 24.
