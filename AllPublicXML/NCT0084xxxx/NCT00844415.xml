    <description>Patients were carefully assessed for signs and symptoms of bleeding. Bleeding was to be classified as major or minor. Major bleeding had to satisfy one or more of the following criteria:
Overt bleeding associated with a decrease in haemoglobin of at least 2 g/dL in 24 hours, Overt bleeding requiring a transfusion of red blood cells, Overt bleeding which was retroperitoneal, intracranial, intraocular, or intraarticular, any overt bleeding deemed by the attending physician to require discontinuation of study medication. Minor bleeds were clinical bleeds that did not fulfill the criteria for major bleeds.</description>

          <description>Dabigatran was administered twice daily for three consecutive days (total 6 doses). All patients received an initial oral dose of 1.71mg/kg of dabigatran (80 percent of the adult dose of 150 mg/70 kg adjusted for the patient’s weight). Based on thrombin time (TT) and clinical assessment, the dose was adjusted to the target dose of 2.14 mg/kg of dabigatran (100 percent of the adult dose adjusted for the patient’s weight). Three patients received 75 mg dabigatran (first dose) followed by 100 mg twice daily (BID). Three patients took dabigatran 100 mg (first dose) followed by 125 mg BID. Two patients received a dose of 125 mg dabigatran followed by 150 mg BID. One patient received only a single dose of dabigatran (75 mg).</description>

All patients received an initial oral dose of 1.71mg/kg of dabigatran (80 percent of the adult dose of 150 mg/70 kg adjusted for the patient's weight). Based on thrombin time (TT) and clinical assessment, the dose was adjusted to the target dose of 2.14 mg/kg of dabigatran (100 percent of the adult dose adjusted for the patient's weight). Three patients received 75 mg dabigatran (first dose) followed by 100 mg twice daily (BID). Three patients took dabigatran 100 mg (first dose) followed by 125 mg BID. Two patients received a dose of 125 mg dabigatran followed by 150 mg BID. One patient received only a single dose of dabigatran (75 mg).</description>

All patients received an initial oral dose of 1.71mg/kg of dabigatran (80 percent of the adult dose of 150 mg/70 kg adjusted for the patient’s weight). Based on thrombin time (TT) and clinical assessment, the dose was adjusted to the target dose of 2.14 mg/kg of dabigatran (100 percent of the adult dose adjusted for the patient’s weight). Three patients received 75 mg dabigatran (first dose) followed by 100 mg twice daily (BID). Three patients took dabigatran 100 mg (first dose) followed by 125 mg BID. However, for the two patients who received a dose of 125 mg dabigatran followed by 150 mg BID, and the one patient who received only a single dose of dabigatran (75 mg), no summary statistics were calculated, due to sparse data.</description>
