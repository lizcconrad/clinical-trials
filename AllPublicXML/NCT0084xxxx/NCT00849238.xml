    <textblock>
      The rationale for this study is to determine if Campath-1H can be used in liver transplant
      recipients to induce a state of immunological unresponsiveness that would not only eliminate
      the need for calcineurin inhibitors maintenance therapy, but also reduce corticosteroids
      utilization, decreasing the incidence of acute cellular rejection and perhaps reduce the
      severity of histologic recurrence of certain autoimmune diseases responsible for causing
      liver failure. The investigator propose a randomized prospective open label trial in 50 liver
      transplant recipients who will received a calcineurin inhibitors free immunosuppressive
      protocol that consist of a single dose of Campath-1H as an induction therapy in association
      with maintenance mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept®) and low dose steroids. The second group
      will receive a standard immunosuppressive regimen, which consists of IV steroid induction
      therapy and maintenance steroids, together with tacrolimus at a full therapeutic dose with no
      induction antibody therapy.
