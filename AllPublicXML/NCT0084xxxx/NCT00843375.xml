  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy is the current state-of-the-art screening procedure for detecting colorectal
      cancers. However, compliance with this screening procedure by the public is very low for a
      variety of reasons. New screening tools are needed to improve detection of colon cancer.
      Biomarkers from stool, urine, serum, tissue and plasma may provide valuable initial screening
      tools to sort the population into those that need colonoscopy and those that most likely do
      not. This is a cross-sectional study of subjects undergoing clinically-indicated colonoscopy
      or who have diagnosed colorectal cancer who are willing to provide biospecimens.

      In recognition of the fact that novel potential biomarkers are continually being identified
      and will need to be validated in a rapid, efficient and scientifically rigorous manner, the
      NCI has made an enormous commitment to the development of a network that will facilitate
      biomarker development and validation in multiple organ sites. As part of the National Cancer
      Institute-funded Early Detection Research Network (EDRN), the Great Lakes-New England
      Clinical Epidemiological Center (GLNE CEC) proposes a research study that validates potential
      molecular markers (&quot;biomarkers&quot;) for the detection of precancerous and cancerous conditions
      and cancer risk assessment. Although examples of such biomarkers are currently in clinical
      use (i.e. CEA, CA-125), there are limitations to all of them. Our consortium focuses on
      gastrointestinal neoplasia. The goals of this phase of the proposed research are:

        1. Assessment of the utility of individual stool-based, serum-based and urine-based
           biomarkers for discriminating between patients with adenocarcinomas, patients with
           adenomas, patients without adenomas and normal subjects.

        2. Assessment of the utility of individual stool-based, serum-based and urine-based
           biomarkers for detecting indicators of carcinogenesis known to be present or not present
           in adenomas, adenocarcinomas, and normal mucosa.

        3. Construction of a panel of markers from those considered in Objectives 1 and 2 to
           discriminate, under a number of assumptions concerning prevalence and cost of
           misclassification, between:

           a Subjects with normal colons versus patients without adenomas, patients with adenomas
           and patients with cancers; b Subjects with normal colons, patients without adenomas and
           patients with adenomas, versus subjects with cancers; c Subjects with normal colons
           versus patients without and patients with adenomas versus patients with cancers.

        4. Comparison of the characteristics of individual markers and panels as discriminators to
           those of the established current standard, Fecal Occult Blood test (FOBT).

        5. Development of a bank of stool samples linked to serum, tissue, urine and clinical data
           from patients with colorectal cancer, adenomas and normal controls for validation of
           stool-based markers that may be developed in the future.

      To meet our goals the investigators propose to collect stool, rectal mucus, serum, plasma,
      and urine samples from 800 subjects (200 colorectal cancers, 200 adenomas, 200 higher risk
      normals and 200 normal colons for controls). The stool samples will be assayed for
      stool-based biomarkers. EDRN Common Data Elements (CDEs) will be completed by the recruiting
      sites and provided for the laboratories developing the assay.
