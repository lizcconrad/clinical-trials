    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the postprandial (anytime after a meal) effect of
      different dietary fats on endothelial function in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected men.

      This study requires two visits. Once determined eligible by the study criteria, during the
      first visit the participant will be randomly placed to receive one of two high-fat meals. The
      participant will receive the other study meal during the second visit. At each visit,
      brachial artery ultrasounds will be performed before and 3 hours after the meal is eaten. The
      sample size is 50 subjects. This study will be conducted at the Clinical Research Center at
      Tufts Medical Center.
