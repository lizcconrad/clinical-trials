  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus is a major risk factor for the development of ischemic heart disease, and
      patients with diabetes mellitus have a worse outcome following an acute myocardial infarction
      than non-diabetic patients. Furthermore, abnormal glucose metabolism below the diagnostic
      threshold of diabetes mellitus is also associated with increased risk of death compared to
      patients with a normal glucose metabolism. The frequency of abnormal glucose metabolism in
      acute myocardial infarction is high, and approximately 70% of myocardial infarction patients
      have diabetes mellitus, newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus or impaired glucose tolerance,
      leaving only 30% with normal glucose metabolism. The increased mortality among patients with
      acute myocardial infarction and abnormal glucose metabolism seems mainly related to a higher
      occurrence of congestive heart failure, suggesting that an abnormal glucose metabolism may
      play an important role among others in endothelial dysfunction, infarct healing and overall
      left ventricle function. This raises the question, whether patients with acute myocardial
      infarction and abnormal glucose metabolism have increased frequency of micro- or
      macrovascular disease or both.

      Coronary flow velocity reserve reflects the patency of the epicardial coronary artery in
      combination with vasodilator capacity of the microcirculation and may therefore offer a tool
      for assessment of macro- and microcirculation.

      This study will focus on the relation between coronary flow velocity reserve estimated by
      transthoracal Doppler echocardiography and mortality, risk for heart failure and left
      ventricle function after acute myocardial infarction stratified according to glycometabolic
      state
