    <textblock>
      Most of the neonatal deaths that occur worldwide every year are associated with low birth
      weight (LBW), caused by intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and/or preterm delivery.
      Accurate assessment of fetal growth and gestational age for timely identification and
      management of growth restriction are therefore public health priorities, especially in
      developing countries where 98% of all neonatal deaths occur. Every year, more than 50 million
      women become pregnant in malaria endemic regions. Malaria infection at any time during
      pregnancy reduces birthweight. However, little is known about the relationship between the
      timing of infection during pregnancy and the extent of the impact on birth weight. The
      mechanisms by which malaria causes LBW also remain unclear. Reduced placental blood flow,
      placental changes, red blood cell changes, severe anaemia and pro-inflammatory cytokines have
      all been implicated.

      In this proposed, longitudinal, observational, minimal risk study, which will take place in
      SMRU antenatal clinics on the Thai-Burmese border, the effect of malaria infection during
      pregnancy on fetal growth will be determined. Women will be screened before 13+6 weeks of
      gestation and followed with regular ultrasound examinations during pregnancy. When a woman
      has a malaria infection an extra ultrasound scan will be done to measure growth retardation
      or placental blood flow changes. Bloodsamples will be taken to detect changes in red blood
      cell properties and putative markers of malaria infection. For this study the maximum amount
      of blood taken during pregnancy is 13 cc in an uninfected woman. For each malaria episode an
      additional 7 cc blood will be taken. After delivery a placenta and a cord sample will be
      taken to detect placental changes. The investigators aim to recruit four hundred pregnant
      women over the course of two years. This study involves minimal risk to participants as
      ultrasound examination is part of routine antenatal care in many countries in the world.

        Pregant women who present at the SMRU ante natal clinics. The antenatal clinics (ANC) are
        based on the Thai-Burmese border, in a region where Karen people (a minority group in
        Burma) are the principal inhabitants.
