  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized study of ambrisentan that will last 16 weeks. The study will include
      patients with diastolic heart failure and pulmonary hypertension. Patients will be randomized
      (1:1) to ambrisentan or placebo. The ambrisentan or matching placebo will be started at 2.5
      mg by mouth daily and increased to 5mg and then 10mg daily, if tolerated. Patients will be
      seen at least monthly for 16 weeks. Adverse reactions will be reviewed and the required
      monthly laboratory tests (liver function testing and pregnancy testing, if applicable), will
      be performed. Patients will also complete an exercise test (six minute walk distance) and a
      quality of life survey at the baseline, week 4 and week 16 visit. An echocardiogram and a
      right heart catheterization and left ventricular end diastolic pressure measurement will be
      performed at the 16 week visit. The primary end-point is safety, and secondary end-points
      include the catheterization results, echocardiogram results, the walk distance and the
      quality of life survey. The expected completion of the study is 18 months from initiation.
      Ambrisentan is an FDA approved drug for PAH, but not for CHF.

      Hypothesis: patients with pulmonary hypertension secondary to diastolic congestive heart
      failure (CHF) treated with ambrisentan for 16 weeks will have improved hemodynamics,
      increased exercise capacity and improved functional class with an acceptable safety profile,
      compared with placebo treated patients.

      Objectives: to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ambrisentan treatment in patients with
      pulmonary hypertension due to diastolic CHF. Efficacy will be assessed by improvement in
      hemodynamics (PVR(Pulmonary Vascular Resistance): primary efficacy endpoint), six minute walk
      distance (6MWD), World Health Organization (WHO) functional class and quality of life after
      16 weeks of treatment with ambrisentan. Safety of ambrisentan will be compared to placebo.

      Concomitant Medication: Treatment with standard medications for CHF including diuretics and
      optimal blood pressure control with antihypertensive medications will be allowed throughout
      the study period. Diuretics adjustment will also be allowed and encouraged based on the
      planned diuretic management protocol. Approved medications for CHF in general are allowed as
      well, though it should be noted that there are no medications shown to have benefit in
      diastolic CHF. Patients may not be on an endothelin antagonist or sildenafil.
