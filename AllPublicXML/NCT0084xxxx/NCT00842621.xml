    <textblock>
      In this prospective observational trial, participants with chronic hemolysis will be assessed
      with echocardiogram for elevated tricuspid jet velocity and other evidence of pulmonary
      hypertension. Participants will have laboratory studies evaluating: severity of hemolysis,
      splenic function, inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and hypercoagulability. There will
      be 3 main categories of participants enrolled in this study: (1) pediatric participants with
      severe sickle cell disease (SCD) (HbSS, HbS/β° thalassemia ) who are not receiving treatment
      (e.g., hydroxyurea or chronic transfusions); (2) pediatric participants with other forms of
      SCD or severe SCD (HbSS, HbS/β° thalassemia) patients being treated with hydroxyurea or
      chronic transfusions; and (3) pediatric and adult participants with other non-sickling
      hematological disorders.

      1. The study will investigate the relationship between tricuspid regurgitation jet velocity
           (TRV) and intravascular hemolysis, as measured by serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), in
           untreated children with severe sickle cell disease (HbSS or Hb S/β°-thalassemia)

        2. The Study will estimate the prevalence of elevated TRV (≥ 2.5 m/s) in untreated children
           with severe sickle cell disease (HbSS or Hb S/β°-thalassemia), as measured by
           echocardiography.

      Secondary objectives for this study include the following:

        1. To estimate the prevalence of elevated TRV in children with severe sickle cell disease
           (HbSS or Hb S/β°-thalassemia) receiving hydroxyurea or chronic transfusion therapy.

        2. To estimate the prevalence of elevated TRV in children with other forms of hemolytic
           anemia, including other sickling disorders (such as HbSC or HbS/β+-thalassemia) and
           non-sickling hemolytic anemia (such as hereditary spherocytosis).

        3. To estimate the prevalence of elevated TRV in adults with non-sickling hemolytic anemia,
           with or without splenic function.

        4. To investigate the association between TRV and splenic function

        5. To investigate the associations between TRV and laboratory parameters of inflammation
           and hypercoagulability, such as white blood cell count, platelet count, serum N-terminal
           pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP),endothelial dysfunction, and other markers of
           hemolysis (bilirubin, plasma free hemoglobin, haptoglobin, etc.)

        6. To evaluate genetic determinants of elevated TRV in children and adults with hemolytic
           anemia.

        7. To investigate changes in TRV and hemolysis over time using serial measurements 2 ± 0.5
           years after initial enrollment testing.
