    <textblock>
      Membranous nephropathy is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults. It is difficult to
      treat and if persistent leads to end stage renal failure in a significant number of patients.
      It is currently treated in this institution with tacrolimus monotherapy. This is effective in
      the majority of patients in reducing proteinuria but the remissions are often partial and
      patients tend to relapse when the tacrolimus treatment is stopped. We propose to use
      mycophenolate mofetil in combination with tacrolimus with the aim of obtaining a more
      complete initial response to treatment, a decreased rate of relapse on withdrawal of therapy
      and less progression of renal failure. This will be a randomised control trial, patients will
      be randomised to receive treatment with tacrolimus alone (our current standard therapy)or
      treatment with tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil. Participants will receive treatment for
      up to 2 years and then be monitored for relapse of their nephrotic syndrome.

      Study Hypothesis: When mycophenolate mofetil is added to tacrolimus in the treatment of
      membranous glomerulonephritis it is likely to improve the initial response to treatment and
      reduce the risk of relapse on stopping therapy.
