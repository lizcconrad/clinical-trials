      This research proposal has two main objectives. The first is to increase understanding of the
      underlying physiological interactions that occur between the cardiovascular, pulmonary, and
      ANS during transition between positive pressure mechanical ventilation (MV) and spontaneous
      breathing. The second is to determine if heart rate variability, (HRV) a reflection of
      autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity, and autonomic information flow (AIF), a set of
      nonlinear measures derived from HRV, both measured in the intensive care unit (ICU) can
      predict patient outcomes including successful weaning and in-hospital recovery time after an
      episode of cardiopulmonary compromise requiring MV.

      Hypothesis 1. Transitions between mechanically supported ventilation and spontaneous
      breathing will disturb cardiovascular synchrony, altering the relationship of HRV, AIF,
      respiratory rate, and blood pressure;

      Hypothesis 2. More normal HRV and AIF values, measured during baseline MV and sedation
      awakening (a period immediately prior to SBT when sedative medications are discontinued) will
      be associated with easier weaning, and shorter intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital lengths
      of stay; more abnormal measurements will be associated with longer lengths of stay;

      Hypothesis 3. AIF is a more sensitive predictor of successful weaning from MV than HRV.
