  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the long-term clinical and radiological results of
      operative and conservative treatment of Tossy type 3 acromio-clavicular dislocation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The optimal treatment of Rockwood type 3 AC joint injuries is still controversial. This
      controversy results from the low level of evidence of the early literature and the evaluation
      of all AC joint injuries with a type I through III classification system.

      There are no prospective randomized controlled long-term studies on the treatment of Tossy
      type 3 AC dislocation using primary repair and minimal pin fixation.

      In this study, the non-surgical treatment consisted of immobilisation of the injured AC-joint
      in a Kenny-Howard-type splint for four weeks. The surgical treatment consisted of an open
      reduction and fixation of the AC joint with two smooth Kirschner wires (2 mm in diameter)
      across the AC-joint. The K-wires were bent at the proximal ends, with suturing of the
      superior AC ligament.

    <description>The non-surgical treatment consisted of immobilisation of the injured AC-joint in a Kenny-Howard-type splint for four weeks. The patient was encouraged in mobilisation of the elbow several times per day and the mobilisation of the shoulder with pendulum type movements were initiated four weeks after the injury. Active mobilisation of the shoulder was allowed six weeks after the injury.</description>

    <description>The surgical treatment was accomplished within two days after the injury, and it consisted of an open reduction and fixation of the AC joint with two smooth Kirschner wires (2 mm in diameter) across the AC-joint. The K-wires were bent at the proximal ends, with suturing of the superior AC ligament. The position of Kirschner wires was confirmed during the operation using C-arm transillumination. The articular disc of AC joint was removed if it was damaged. Postoperative care consisted of immobilisation of the AC joint in a sling, (Polysling, body band) for four weeks and the mobilisation of the shoulder started four to six weeks later in a similar manner as in the non-operative group.</description>
