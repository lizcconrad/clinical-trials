    <textblock>
      The purpose of the E-LITE Study is to evaluate the feasibility and potential effectiveness of
      two lifestyle interventions in a community based primary care setting. The study aims to
      assess how changes in diet, exercise, and behavioral self-management affect weight and
      related risk factors for adults at risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the United States, there is an epidemic of obesity and, as a result, an epidemic of
      diabetes. Obese individuals with pre-diabetes (defined as impaired fasting glucose or
      impaired glucose tolerance) are at high risk for progression to diabetes. A vast majority of
      these individuals also have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease because of
      concomitant risk factors, such as abdominal obesity, dyslipidemia, and elevated blood
      pressure. Intensive lifestyle interventions that focus on dietary change, physical activity,
      and behavior modification have demonstrated efficacy in achieving and maintaining clinically
      significant (&gt;5%) weight loss in populations of patients with pre-diabetes. However, the
      effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, generalizability, and sustainability of such interventions
      in routine primary care settings remain unknown, and rigorous clinical research is needed.

      The primary hypothesis for the E-LITE Study is that the CM intervention will reduce BMI more
      than the SM intervention, which in turn will reduce BMI more than usual care, over 15 months.
      Secondarily, we hypothesize that, compared with usual care, intervention participants will be
      associated with greater improvements in waist circumference, lipids, blood pressure, blood
      glucose, lifestyle behaviors, and psychosocial well-being. In addition, we will examine the
      durability of weight loss and behavioral change in the months after the initial 3-month
      intensive stage.

    <description>Participants will attend a group orientation where the study nutritionist will provide an overview of the self-management lifestyle intervention program. Participants will receive instructions on how to use HeartHubTM, the American Heart Association's patient portal for information, tools, resources about cardiovascular risk assessment, goal setting, action planning, and self-monitoring.
During the remainder of the 15-month intervention, participants will receive reminders on a regular basis to use the patient portal to assist in their ongoing self-management.</description>

    <description>In addition to participating in the activities described above, with the exception of the orientation session, participants in the Care Management Program will attend 12 weekly weight management classes during the initial 3 months. Classes will be co-led by a dietician and exercise specialist and will include a private weigh-in, a group discussion, a presentation of a lifestyle topic, 30 minutes of supervised moderate physical activity, followed by individual action-planning and goal-setting.
During the remainder of the 15-month intervention, participants will continue to monitor their body weight, caloric intake, physical activity, and other data according to their care plan. In addition, study interventionist will follow up with participants regularly, via secure messaging or by phone, to provide ongoing counseling and support.</description>
