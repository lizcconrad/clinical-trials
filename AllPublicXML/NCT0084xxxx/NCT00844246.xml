  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness of
      implementing the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP's) recommendation that clinicians
      provide developmental surveillance at all well child visits and institute developmental
      screening at critical developmental periods in childhood, namely at 9, 18, 24 and 30 months
      of age.

      The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness of
      implementing the AAP's recommendation that clinicians provide developmental surveillance at
      all well child visits and institute developmental screening at critical developmental periods
      in childhood, namely at 9, 18, 24 and 30 months of age. The study will also examine its
      acceptance by pediatric practices, its adoption and adaptation in urban pediatric practices,
      and the effectiveness of a developmental screening protocol that conforms to the AAP and
      Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) recommendations compared with that of developmental
      surveillance alone.

    <description>School Readiness Specialist (SRS) will administer the screening questionnaire to the subject during the intervention period, at the subject's 9, 18, 24 and 30 month visits. They will then see their PCP for a well child visit in which the results of the test will be interpreted, developmental counseling and/or anticipatory guidance provided as per usual care. EI (Early intervention) referral will be completed, at the discretion of the providers, if the subject fails the developmental screen or the caregivers raise a specific concern about the child's development.</description>

    <description>Primary Care Physician (PCP) will do the developmental screening at the subject's 9, 18, 24 and 30 month well child visits. Once the screening questionnaire is complete the PCP will then score the screening tool and interpret the test results. Developmental counseling and/or anticipatory guidance will be provided, as per usual care. EI (Early intervention) referral will be completed, at the discretion of the providers, if the subject fails the developmental screen or the caregivers raise a specific concern about the child's development.</description>

    <description>Subjects randomized to routine surveillance will receive routine preventive care as well as developmental surveillance at all well child visits, including the 9, 18, 24 and 30 month visits. EI referral will be completed, at the discretion of the provider, if the PCP observes a developmental delay during surveillance or the caregivers raise a specific concern about the child's development.</description>

    <description>Subjects who are randomized to PCP arm will be screened for developmental delays by their Primary Care Clinician at their 9, 18, 24 and 30 month well child visits. The corresponding screening tools may be mailed to the study participants 2 weeks before the scheduled well child visits. Those who do not complete the screening tools or those who did not receive them in the mail will then complete the questionnaire in the office prior to seeing their doctor or with their doctor. The PCP will then score the screening tool and interpret the test results. Developmental counseling and/or anticipatory guidance will be provided, as per usual care. EI referral will be completed, at the discretion of the provider with the approval of the caregiver , if the subject fails the developmental screen or the caregivers raise a specific concern about the child's development.</description>
