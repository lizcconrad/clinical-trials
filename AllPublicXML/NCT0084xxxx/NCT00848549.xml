    <time_frame>At 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, and 27 months</time_frame>
    <description>The retention rate is defined as the percentage of subjects remaining on the study at each visit, starting from the first dose of study drug in the extension phase.</description>

    <measure>Time to Drop-out Due to Lack of Efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1 to Week 109 (in core study) and Month 1 to Month 27 (in extension study)</time_frame>
    <description>Lack of efficacy was if the subject had poor seizure control (defined as experiencing a seizure despite being on the maximum dose for = 2 weeks). The subject could withdraw at any time due to lack of efficacy.</description>

    <measure>Time to Drop-out Due to Adverse Event (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1 to Week 109 (in base study) and Month 1 to Month 27 (in extension study)</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events in study subjects included any change in the subject's condition.
This includes symptoms, physical findings, or clinical syndromes. All AEs that occurred after signing of informed consent through the last visit and for 15 days following study drug discontinuation were captured on the AE Case Report Form (CRF).</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants That Are Seizure Free for at Least 24 Month Consecutive Period in the Base Study and Extension Phase</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 5 to Week 109 (in base study) and Month 1 to Month 27 (in extension phase)</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants that have remained seizure free for at least a 24 month consecutive period from the start of the Flexible Dosing Period (FDP: the period following the Titration Period and leading into the Maintenance Period) in the base study through the treatment period of this study. Seizure freedom was defined as the absence of all seizure regardless of seizure type.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Quality of Life Assessed by Quality of Life in Epilepsy-Problems Questionnaire (QOLIE-31-P) Overall Score at Each Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0, 26, 52, 78 and 117</time_frame>
    <description>The QOLIE-31-P is a 31-item questionnaire evaluating a participant's QOL perception in 7 domains: seizure worry,emotional well being,energy/fatigue, cognitive functioning, medication effects, social functioning,overall QOL. The overall score is derived by weighing and then summing the 7 domain scores. Precoded numeric values for some domains are such that a higher number reflects a more favorable health state; others are such that a higher number reflects a less favorable state. Precoded values are converted to 0-100 point scores; higher converted scores always reflect better QOL.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Quality of Life Assessed by Quality of Life in Epilepsy-Problems Questionnaire (QOLIE-31-P) Overall Score at Each Visit</title>
        <description>The QOLIE-31-P is a 31-item questionnaire evaluating a participant's QOL perception in 7 domains: seizure worry,emotional well being,energy/fatigue, cognitive functioning, medication effects, social functioning,overall QOL. The overall score is derived by weighing and then summing the 7 domain scores. Precoded numeric values for some domains are such that a higher number reflects a more favorable health state; others are such that a higher number reflects a less favorable state. Precoded values are converted to 0-100 point scores; higher converted scores always reflect better QOL.</description>
