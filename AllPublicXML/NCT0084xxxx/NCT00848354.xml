  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this 2 phased, open-label study is to compare the safety and efficacy of
      etanercept with conventional Disease Modifying Antirheumatic Drug (DMARD) therapy in Latin
      American subjects with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis over 128 weeks. Phase 1 is a
      randomized 24 week treatment period; Phase 2 is an optional open-label 104 week period that
      allows the investigator to choose continuation with the phase I treatment or the addition,
      discontinuation or titration of other DMARD therapy already being utilized for the study.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in HAQ Score at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>HAQ: self-reported, valid assessment of functional disability in rheumatoid arthritis. Assessed based on ability of participants to perform daily activities in 8 categories: dressing, arising, eating, walking, reaching, gripping, hygiene, and carrying out daily activities. HAQ score range: 0-3: without any difficulty: 0, with some difficulty: 1, with much difficulty: 2, unable to do: 3. HAQ total scores expressed as overall mean score with range 0-3: 0-0.25: normal functioning; 0.25-0.5: mild functional limitation; 0.5-1: moderate functional limitation; more than 1: significant functional limitation.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) Score at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 is standardized 36-item survey evaluating 8 aspects of functional health and well being: physical and social functioning, physical and emotional role limitations, bodily pain, general health perception, vitality, and mental health. Domain scores range from 0-100, with greater scores reflecting better health status. Two additional overall summary scores - physical and mental component scores - were also obtained. Summary scores are standardized where the general population mean is 50 with a standard deviation of 10. Greater scores again indicate better health status.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Van Der Heijde Modified Total Sharp Score (vdH mTSS), Annualized, at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>mTSS: sum of erosion and joint space narrowing (JSN) scores for 44 joints (16 per hand and 6 per foot). mTSS scores ranged from 0 (normal) to 448 (worst possible total score). Each x-ray visit included 4 films, each of which were read by 2 readers. The mTSS was calculated by the images scored for erosions and JSN. An increase in mTSS from Baseline represented disease progression and/or joint worsening, no change represented halting of disease progression, and a decrease represented improvement.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The study consisted of 3 periods - Phase 1 (week 0-week 24), Phase 2 Year 1 (week 24-week 76), and Phase 2 Year 2 (week 76-week 128). 429 participants were randomly assigned to open label etanercept + methotrexate or open label conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) + methotrexate in a 2:1 allocation, respectively.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Five participants (etanercept + methotrexate: 3, DMARD + methotrexate: 2) were randomized but did not receive study treatment. These participants were either randomized in error or withdrew consent before receiving the first dose. Phase 1 DMARD therapy was either hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) or sulfsalazine (SSZ), as selected by the investigator.</pre_assignment_details>

Phase 2: During the optional Phase 2-period (week 24-week 128), the participants could remain on etanercept and methotrexate, or a non-biologic DMARD the investigator preferred in accordance with the local label (SSZ or HCQ) could be added in exchange for or in addition to etanercept. Methotrexate could be continued, discontinued or titrated. Phase 1 reporting groups were used also for Phase 2 data, regardless of the participant`s Phase 2 treament regimen.</description>

        <title>Summary of Changes in Therapy at the Beginning of Phase 2</title>
        <description>The investigators were allowed to alter each participant`s therapy at the beginning of Phase 2. Continuations, discontinuations and additions made to Phase 1 treatment regimen were summarized.</description>
        <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
        <population>mITT population included all participants who took at least 1 dose of study drug and had at least 1 post-randomization visit that included evaluation of tender and swollen joints and at least 3 of other 5 variables required to calculate ACR50. LOCF method was used. One participant was randomized to etanercept but received SSZ in Phase 1.</population>

            <title>Etanercept + Methotrexate</title>
            <description>Phase 1: Etanercept 50 mg injection s.c. once weekly along with methotrexate tablet (7.5-25 mg) orally once weekly either in single dose or in 2 divided doses for 24 weeks. Phase 2: During the optional Phase 2-period (week 24-week 128), the participants could remain on etanercept and methotrexate, or a non-biologic DMARD the investigator preferred in accordance with the local label (SSZ or HCQ) could be added in exchange for or in addition to etanercept. Methotrexate could be continued, discontinued or titrated. Phase 1 reporting groups were used also for Phase 2 data, regardless of the participant`s Phase 2 treament regimen.</description>

Phase 2: During the optional Phase 2-period (week 24-week 128), the participants could remain on DMARD (SSZ or HCQ) and methotrexate, or a DMARD the investigator preferred in accordance with the local label (HCQ, SSZ, and/or etanercept) could be added in exchange for or in addition to the Phase 1 DMARD (SSZ or HCQ). Methotrexate and the DMARD administered in Phase 1 could be continued, discontinued or titrated. Phase 1 reporting groups were used also for Phase 2 data, regardless of the participant`s Phase 2 treament regimen.</description>

            <description>Phase 1: Conventional DMARD combination therapy (SSZ or HCQ) tablets administered as per local prescribing practice, along with methotrexate tablet (7.5-25 mg) orally once weekly either in single dose or in 2 divided doses for 24 weeks. Phase 2: During the optional Phase 2-period (week 24-week 128), the participants could remain on DMARD (SSZ or HCQ) and methotrexate, or a DMARD the investigator preferred in accordance with the local label (HCQ, SSZ, and/or etanercept) could be added in exchange for or in addition to the Phase 1 DMARD (SSZ or HCQ). Methotrexate and the DMARD administered in Phase 1 could be continued, discontinued or titrated. Phase 1 reporting groups were used also for Phase 2 data, regardless of the participant`s Phase 2 treament regimen.</description>

        <description>DAS28-based EULAR response criteria were used to measure individual response as none, good, and moderate, depending on the extent of change from Baseline and the level of disease activity reached. Good DAS28-based EULAR response was defined as: DAS28-value ≤3.2 and DAS28-improvement from Baseline &gt;1.2.</description>

            <groups_desc>ANCOVA model with Baseline as covariate and factors for treatment and country as class variables was used to calculate p-values. ANCOVA was ran at each time-point shown, however as p-values obtained were identical, only one p-value is presented (which is applicable to each time-point - Week 2, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16, Week 20, and Week 24 - independently).</groups_desc>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Painful Joint Counts at Week 37, Week 50, Week 63, Week 76, Week 89, Week 102, Week 115, and Week 128</title>
        <description>Painful joint count is a physical assessment of the ACR-specified 68 joint set for tenderness/pain. Each joint is rated as either painful or not painful with the total number of painful joints reported as the score. Score range is from 0-68 with lower scores indicating the better outcome.</description>

        <population>mITT population (LOCF) was used. Phase 2 Year 1 (week 37-week 76)-sample size (Etanercept + Methotrexate, DMARD + Methotrexate: 260, 126) is different from Phase 2 Year 2 (week 89-week 128)-sample size (241, 120).</population>

Phase 2: During the optional Phase 2-period (week 24-week 128), the participants could remain on etanercept and methotrexate, or a non-biologic DMARD the investigator preferred in accordance with the local label (SSZ or HCQ) could be added in exchange for or in addition to etanercept. Methotrexate could be continued, discontinued or titrated. Phase 1 reporting groups were used also for Phase 2 data, regardless of the participant`s Phase 2 treament regimen.</description>

        <description>Swollen joint count is a physical assessment of the ACR-specified 66 joint set for swelling. Each joint is rated as either swollen or not swollen with the total number of swollen joints reported as the score. Score range is from 0-66 with lower scores indicating the better outcome.</description>

Methotrexate and the DMARD administered in Phase 1 could be continued, discontinued or titrated. Phase 1 reporting groups were used also for Phase 2 data, regardless of the participant`s Phase 2 treament regimen.</description>

            <description>Phase 1: Conventional DMARD combination therapy (SSZ or HCQ) tablets administered as per local prescribing practice, along with methotrexate tablet (7.5-25 mg) orally once weekly either in single dose or in 2 divided doses for 24 weeks. Phase 2: During the optional Phase 2-period (week 24-week 128), the participants could remain on DMARD (SSZ or HCQ) and methotrexate, or a DMARD the investigator preferred in accordance with the local label (HCQ, SSZ, and/or etanercept) could be added in exchange for or in addition to the Phase 1 DMARD (SSZ or HCQ). Methotrexate and the DMARD administered in Phase 1 could be continued, discontinued or titrated. Phase 1 reporting groups were used also for Phase 2 data, regardless of the participant`s Phase 2 treament regimen.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Joint Space Narrowing Score Using vdH mTSS at Week 24</title>
        <description>mTSS: sum of erosion and JSN scores for 44 joints (16 per hand and 6 per foot). mTSS scores ranged from 0 (normal) to 448 (worst possible total score). Each x-ray visit included 4 films, each of which were read by 2 readers. The mTSS was calculated by the images scored for erosions and JSN. An increase in mTSS from Baseline represented disease progression and/or joint worsening, no change represented halting of disease progression, and a decrease represented improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Westergren ESR at Week 37, Week 50, Week 63, Week 76, Week 89, Week 102, Week 115, and Week 128</title>
        <description>ESR is a laboratory test that provides a non-specific measure of inflammation. The test assesses the rate at which red blood cells fall in a test tube. Normal range is 0-30 mm/hour. A higher rate is consistent with inflammation. ESR was performed at the investigative site using an ESR kit supplied by the centralized laboratory.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in SF-36 Health Survey Vitality Domain Score at Week 8, Week 16, and Week 24</title>
        <description>The SF-36 is standardized 36-item survey evaluating 8 aspects of functional health and well being: physical and social functioning, physical and emotional role limitations, bodily pain, general health perception, vitality, and mental health. Domain scores range from 0-100, with greater scores reflecting better health status. Two additional overall summary scores – physical and mental component scores - were also obtained. Summary scores are standardized where the general population mean is 50 with a standard deviation of 10. Greater scores again indicate better health status.</description>
        <time_frame>Week 8, Week 16, and Week 24</time_frame>
        <population>mITT population included all participants who took at least 1 dose of study drug and had at least 1 post-randomization visit that included evaluation of tender and swollen joints and at least 3 of other 5 variables required to calculate ACR50. LOCF method was used.</population>

Phase 2: During the optional Phase 2-period (week 24-week 128), the participants could remain on etanercept and methotrexate, or a non-biologic DMARD the investigator preferred in accordance with the local label (SSZ or HCQ) could be added in exchange for or in addition to etanercept. Methotrexate could be continued, discontinued or titrated. Phase 1 reporting groups were used also for Phase 2 data, regardless of the participant`s Phase 2 treament regimen.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in SF-36 Health Survey Mental Component Score at Week 8, Week 16, and Week 24</title>
        <description>The SF-36 is standardized 36-item survey evaluating 8 aspects of functional health and well being: physical and social functioning, physical and emotional role limitations, bodily pain, general health perception, vitality, and mental health. Domain scores range from 0-100, with greater scores reflecting better health status. Two additional overall summary scores – physical and mental component scores - were also obtained. Summary scores are standardized where the general population mean is 50 with a standard deviation of 10. Greater scores again indicate better health status.</description>

Phase 2: During the optional Phase 2-period (week 24-week 128), the participants could remain on DMARD (SSZ or HCQ) and methotrexate, or a DMARD the investigator preferred in accordance with the local label (HCQ, SSZ, and/or etanercept) could be added in exchange for or in addition to the Phase 1 DMARD (SSZ or HCQ). Methotrexate and the DMARD administered in Phase 1 could be continued, discontinued or titrated. Phase 1 reporting groups were used also for Phase 2 data, regardless of the participant`s Phase 2 treament regimen.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in SF-36 Health Survey Physical Component Score at Week 8, Week 16, and Week 24</title>
          <description>The SF-36 is standardized 36-item survey evaluating 8 aspects of functional health and well being: physical and social functioning, physical and emotional role limitations, bodily pain, general health perception, vitality, and mental health. Domain scores range from 0-100, with greater scores reflecting better health status. Two additional overall summary scores – physical and mental component scores - were also obtained. Summary scores are standardized where the general population mean is 50 with a standard deviation of 10. Greater scores again indicate better health status.</description>
          <population>mITT population included all participants who took at least 1 dose of study drug and had at least 1 post-randomization visit that included evaluation of tender and swollen joints and at least 3 of other 5 variables required to calculate ACR50. LOCF method was used.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in SF-36 Health Survey Role Limitations Due to Emotional Problems Domain Score at Week 8, Week 16, and Week 24</title>
        <description>The SF-36 is standardized 36-item survey evaluating 8 aspects of functional health and well being: physical and social functioning, physical and emotional role limitations, bodily pain, general health perception, vitality, and mental health. Domain scores range from 0-100, with greater scores reflecting better health status. Two additional overall summary scores – physical and mental component scores - were also obtained. Summary scores are standardized where the general population mean is 50 with a standard deviation of 10. Greater scores again indicate better health status.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in SF-36 Health Survey Physical Functioning Domain Score at Week 8, Week 16, and Week 24</title>
        <description>The SF-36 is standardized 36-item survey evaluating 8 aspects of functional health and well being: physical and social functioning, physical and emotional role limitations, bodily pain, general health perception, vitality, and mental health. Domain scores range from 0-100, with greater scores reflecting better health status. Two additional overall summary scores – physical and mental component scores - were also obtained. Summary scores are standardized where the general population mean is 50 with a standard deviation of 10. Greater scores again indicate better health status.</description>
        <time_frame>Week 8, Week 16, and Week 24</time_frame>
        <population>mITT population included all participants who took at least 1 dose of study drug and had at least 1 post-randomization visit that included evaluation of tender and swollen joints and at least 3 of other 5 variables required to calculate ACR50. LOCF method was used.</population>

Phase 2: During the optional Phase 2-period (week 24-week 128), the participants could remain on etanercept and methotrexate, or a non-biologic DMARD the investigator preferred in accordance with the local label (SSZ or HCQ) could be added in exchange for or in addition to etanercept. Methotrexate could be continued, discontinued or titrated. Phase 1 reporting groups were used also for Phase 2 data, regardless of the participant`s Phase 2 treament regimen.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in SF-36 Health Survey Social Functioning Domain Score at Week 8, Week 16, and Week 24</title>
        <description>The SF-36 is standardized 36-item survey evaluating 8 aspects of functional health and well being: physical and social functioning, physical and emotional role limitations, bodily pain, general health perception, vitality, and mental health. Domain scores range from 0-100, with greater scores reflecting better health status. Two additional overall summary scores – physical and mental component scores - were also obtained. Summary scores are standardized where the general population mean is 50 with a standard deviation of 10. Greater scores again indicate better health status.</description>
