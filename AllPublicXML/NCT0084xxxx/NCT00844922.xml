      Patients who participated in the previous trial 28130, who were eligible, were entered into
      this trial. Patients who were randomized to placebo in the previous trial 28130 continued on
      placebo while patients who were randomized to Org 34517 (SCH 900636), regardless of dose,
      were titrated to 900 mg Org 34517. Patients in this trial took their study medication for 2
      weeks in order to study the safety and tolerability of Org 34517.
