  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 2 part study will investigate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of MabT hera in
      combination with RoActemra in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis despite a stable dose
      of methotrexate. In Part 1 of the study, patients will be randomized to receive either
      MabThera 0.5g iv or placebo on days 1 and 15, follo wed by RoActemra at one of the ascending
      doses between 2mg/kg and 8mg/kg at week s 4, 8 and 12 (MabThera arm) or 8mg/kg (placebo arm).
      In Part 2, additional pati ents will be randomized to one of 2 groups to receive MabThera
      0.5g on days 1 an d 15 followed by the selected dose (from Part 1)of RoActemra at weeks 4, 8
      and 1 2, or placebo on days 1 and 15 followed by RoActemra 8mg/kg at weeks 4,8 and 12.

      All patients will then be eligible to receive extension treatment withRoActemra every 4
      weeks. The anticipated time on study treatment is 12 months, and the tar get sample size is
      &lt;100 individuals.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving Low Disease Activity (LDA) at Week 16 Assessed Using Disease Activity Score Based on 28 Joint Count and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (DAS28-ESR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The Disease Activity Score based on 28 joint count (DAS28) and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), is a measure of the participant's disease activity. It is based on the Tender Joint Count (TJC [28 joints]), Swollen Joint Count (SJC [28 joints]), participant's global assessment of disease activity (PtGA) Visual Analog Scale (VAS) in millimeters (mm), and ESR in millimeters per hour (mm/hour). DAS28-ESR scores range from 0 - 10. Definition of LDA was based on DAS28-ESR scores. To achieve LDA the DAS28-ESR had to be (less than or equal to) ≤ 3.2.
DAS28-ESR equals (=) (0.56 times (*) (square root)√ TJC plus (+) (0.28 * √ SJC + (0.70 * ln(ESR))+(0.014 * (Global Health) GH)
Where:
TJC = based on 28 joints SJC = based on 28 joints ESR = erythrocyte sedimentation rate in mm/hour GH = participant's global assessment of disease activity ln = natural log</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving Remission at Week 16 Assessed Using DAS28-ESR</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The DAS28-ESR score is a measure of the participant's disease activity. It is based on the TJC (28 joints), SJC (28 joints), participant's global assessment of disease activity (mm), and ESR (mm/hour). DAS28-ESR is expressed on a unit on a scale with the minimum score=0 (best) to maximum score=10 (worst). Remission was defined as DAS28-ESR less than (&lt;) 2.6</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants by European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Response Category at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>DAS28-based EULAR response criteria were used to measure individual response as none, good, and moderate, depending on the extent of change from baseline and the level of disease activity reached. Good responders: change from baseline (greater than) &gt;1.2 with DAS28 ≤3.2; moderate responders: change from baseline &gt;1.2 with DAS28 &gt;3.2 to ≤5.1 or DAS28-ESR &gt;5.1 or change from baseline &gt;0.6 to ≤1.2 with DAS28 ≤5.1; nonresponders: change from baseline ≤0.6 or change from baseline &gt;0.6 and ≤1.2 with DAS28 &gt;5.1.</description>

    <description>The DAS28-ESR score is a measure of the participant's disease activity. It is based on the TJC (28 joints), SJC (28 joints), participant's global assessment of disease activity (mm), and ESR (mm/hour). DAS28-ESR is expressed as a score on a scale with the minimum score=0 (best) to maximum score=10 (worst).
DAS28-ESR scores were calculated as follows: DAS28-ESR = (0.56 * √TJC)+(0.28 * √SJC)+(0.70 * ln(ESR))+(0.014 * GH).
No imputation used for tender and swollen joint counts, ESR, and patient's global assessment of disease activity VAS.</description>

    <description>The Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score was calculated according to the following formula: CDAI = SJC + TJC + GH/10 + EGA/10
Where:
SJC = swollen joint count based on 28 joints; TJC = tender joint count based on 28 joints; GH = Participant's global assessment of disease activity; EGA = evaluator's (physician's) global assessment of disease activity. CDAI scores range from 0-76 and the following cut-off points for different disease activity states have been used: high disease activity &gt;22; moderate disease activity &gt;10 and ≤22; LDA &gt;2.8 and ≤10; and remission ≤ 2.8. No imputation used for TJC, SJC, Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity VAS and Physicians global assessment of disease activity VAS.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 40, and 48</time_frame>
    <description>The SDAI is the numerical sum of five outcome parameters: TJC and SJC (based on a 28-joint assessment), Participant and Physician assessed global disease activity (assessed on 0-100 mm VAS; higher scores = greater affection due to disease activity), and ESR (mm/hour). SDAI total score ranged from 0 to 86. Higher scores indicated greater disease activity.</description>

    <description>An assessment of 28 joints for swelling and tenderness will be made. Joints will be assessed and classified as swollen (1)/not swollen (0) and tender(1)/not tender (0) by pressure and joint manipulation on physical examination. Joint prosthesis, arthrodesis or fused joints were not taken into consideration for swelling or tenderness. The 28 joints assessed comprise shoulders (2 joints), elbows (2 joints), wrists (2 joints), metacarpophalangeal joints on digits 1-5 (10 joints), interphalangeal on digit 1 (2 joints), proximal interphalangeal joints on digits 2-5 (8 joints), and knees (2 joints).</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving Low Disease Activity (LDA) at Week 16 Assessed Using Disease Activity Score Based on 28 Joint Count and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (DAS28-ESR)</title>
        <description>The Disease Activity Score based on 28 joint count (DAS28) and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), is a measure of the participant's disease activity. It is based on the Tender Joint Count (TJC [28 joints]), Swollen Joint Count (SJC [28 joints]), participant's global assessment of disease activity (PtGA) Visual Analog Scale (VAS) in millimeters (mm), and ESR in millimeters per hour (mm/hour). DAS28-ESR scores range from 0 - 10. Definition of LDA was based on DAS28-ESR scores. To achieve LDA the DAS28-ESR had to be (less than or equal to) ≤ 3.2.
DAS28-ESR equals (=) (0.56 times (*) (square root)√ TJC plus (+) (0.28 * √ SJC + (0.70 * ln(ESR))+(0.014 * (Global Health) GH)

          <description>The DAS28-ESR score is a measure of the participant's disease activity. It is based on the TJC (28 joints), SJC (28 joints), participant's global assessment of disease activity (mm), and ESR (mm/hour). DAS28-ESR is expressed on a unit on a scale with the minimum score=0 (best) to maximum score=10 (worst). Remission was defined as DAS28-ESR less than (&lt;) 2.6</description>

        <description>The Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score was calculated according to the following formula: CDAI = SJC + TJC + GH/10 + EGA/10
Where:
SJC = swollen joint count based on 28 joints; TJC = tender joint count based on 28 joints; GH = Participant’s global assessment of disease activity; EGA = evaluator’s (physician’s) global assessment of disease activity. CDAI scores range from 0-76 and the following cut-off points for different disease activity states have been used: high disease activity &gt;22; moderate disease activity &gt;10 and ≤22; LDA &gt;2.8 and ≤10; and remission ≤ 2.8. No imputation used for TJC, SJC, Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity VAS and Physicians global assessment of disease activity VAS.</description>
