  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Though it is generally accepted that exposure to sunlight is a major causative factor for
      skin cancer, the risk for developing melanoma is not directly linked to sun exposure such as
      in non-melanoma skin cancer. Therefore, a dual pathway has been proposed, distinguishing
      melanoma that develops on skin that is chronically exposed to sunlight from those that occur
      on skin that is normally protected. The risk for each type of melanoma is believed to be
      determined in part by genetic factors. To define these markers reproducibly, the
      investigators plan to establish a large cohort with comprehensive information regarding sun
      sensitivity (skin type), history of experienced sun exposure, skin pigmentation phenotypes,
      total number of nevi, and other types of skin tumors in a central European population. The
      investigators will obtain blood from all participants for DNA as well as serum analyses.
      Based on the finding that genetic variants of the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) gene,
      associated with red hair and fair skin, have been shown to be associated with increased risk
      for melanoma, particularly those harboring BRAF mutations, the investigators will now focus
      on the study of recently discovered genetic variants associated with pigmentation.
      Furthermore, the investigators will study the relation of these variants with oncogenic
      mutations of melanoma in BRAF, RAS and c-Kit. The study of other genetic variants will
      follow, once a sufficiently large cohort has been established to reveal an independent
      genetic risk factor in a multivariate analysis including potential covariates as mentioned
      above. The identification of genetic risk factors for melanoma will not only help identify
      individuals with increased risk but also improve our understanding of the molecular
      background of the development of melanoma.

        Our goal is to recruit at least one thousand melanoma patients of any stage and one
        thousand controls in order to acquire a well sized cohort for identifying independent
        molecular markers in multivariate analyses (for statistical considerations see &quot;Statistical
        analysis&quot; on page 8). Patients who visit the out-door clinic of the Department of
        Dermatology at the Medical University of Vienna with any other diseases than melanoma,
        their spouses and spouses of melanoma patients will be asked to contribute as controls.
