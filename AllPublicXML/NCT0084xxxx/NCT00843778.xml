    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IIIB, multi-centre, open-label, follow-up study to study C87076 [NCT00674362]
      designed to continue to assess the safety and efficacy of Certolizumab Pegol.

      Two different population will enter the study from C87076 [NCT00674362] and will be treated
      with Certolizumab Pegol every two weeks until it is commercially available for the indication
      of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) in the subject's country or region or until further notice from
      UCB:

      Population 1: Are those subjects who failed to achieve remission at Week 20 and/or Week 24
      and who completed the Week 24 assessment of study C86076 [NCT00674362].The Week 24 assessment
      (visit 14) of C87076 [NCT00674362] will also be the entry assessment (visit 1) for C87080.
      The subjects will receive Certolizumab Pegol 200 mg every two weeks. No induction period will
      be applied to ensure the blinding of study C87076 [NCT00674362].

      Population 2: Are those subjects who achieved remission at both Week 20 and Week 24, flared
      up between Week 24 and Week 52 and completed the Week 52 assessment in study C87076
      [NCT00674362]. The Week 52 assessment (visit 26) of C87076 [NCT00674362] will also be the
      entry assessment (visit 1) for C87080.

      Subjects who flared prior to Week 48 in the C87076 [NCT00674362] study will receive
      Certolizumab Pegol 200 mg every two weeks in the C87080 study.

      Those who flared at Week 48 or Week 52, will receive respectively once 400 mg Certolizumab
      Pegol or three times 400 mg Certolizumab Pegol at two weeks interval as part of an induction
      phase in the C87080 study. Thereafter the subject enters the C87080 study and will be further
      treated with 200 mg Certolizumab Pegol every two weeks.

        <description>A TEAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence (eg, noxious or pathological changes) in a subject or clinical investigation subject compared with pre-existing conditions, that occurs during any phase of a clinical trial including Pretreatment, Run-In, Wash-Out, or Follow-Up Phases. A TEAE is defined as being independent of assumption of any causality (eg, to trial or concomitant medication, primary or concomitant disease, or trial design). TEAEs are all AEs in which the onset and time is after the first study drug administration in C87080, up to 70 days after the last injection.</description>

Certolizumab Pegol 200 mg was administered every two weeks at the hospital by a nurse or at the patient's home done by patient (self-injection).
Subjects who flared at Week 48 or Week 52 of feeder study C87076 [NCT00674362], received respectively once 400 mg Certolizumab Pegol or three times 400 mg Certolizumab Pegol at two weeks interval as part of an induction phase in the C87080 study. Thereafter the subject entered the C87080 study and was further treated with 200 mg Certolizumab Pegol every two weeks.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Subjects Reporting At Least One Treatment-emergent Adverse Event (TEAE) During The Study Period</title>
          <description>A TEAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence (eg, noxious or pathological changes) in a subject or clinical investigation subject compared with pre-existing conditions, that occurs during any phase of a clinical trial including Pretreatment, Run-In, Wash-Out, or Follow-Up Phases. A TEAE is defined as being independent of assumption of any causality (eg, to trial or concomitant medication, primary or concomitant disease, or trial design). TEAEs are all AEs in which the onset and time is after the first study drug administration in C87080, up to 70 days after the last injection.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in HAQ-DI (Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index) at Completion/Withdrawal Visit</title>
        <description>HAQ-DI is derived based on the mean of individual scores in 8 categories of daily living activities (using 20 questions). Each question is scored 0-3 (0 = without any difficulty, 1 = with some difficulty, 2 = with much difficulty, and 3 = unable to do). Thus, the mean also has a range from 0-3. Change from Baseline is computed as the value at Completion/Withdrawal minus the Baseline value. A negative value in change from Baseline indicates an improvement.</description>

        <title>Mean POST-Self-Injection Assessment Questionnaire (SIAQ) Domain Scores at Week 4</title>
        <description>The six domains of the POST SIAQ are feelings about injections, self-image, self-confidence, injection-site reactions, ease of use, and satisfaction with self-injection. The SIAQ items are scored on a semantic Likert-type scale where lower numbers indicate a worse experience. Domain scores range from 0 to 10. Subjects self-injecting at this visit completed this SIAQ questionnaire. The POST-SIAQ is taken after the injection at that visit.</description>
        <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
        <population>Of the 130 subjects in the Full Analysis Set, 82 or 83 subjects are included in the analysis of each subscale measure, based upon the number of subjects self-injecting at the visit, with the available subscale score at the visit. For each subscale of the questionnaire, N, Mean and SD are presented for non-missing values.</population>

        <title>Mean POST-Self-Injection Assessment Questionnaire (SIAQ) Domain Scores at Week 10</title>
        <description>The six domains of the POST SIAQ are feelings about injections, self-image, self-confidence, injection-site reactions, ease of use, and satisfaction with self-injection. The SIAQ items are scored on a semantic Likert-type scale where lower numbers indicate a worse experience. Domain scores range from 0 to 10. Subjects self-injecting at this visit completed this SIAQ questionnaire. The POST-SIAQ is taken after the injection at that visit.</description>
        <time_frame>Week 10</time_frame>
        <population>Of the 130 subjects in the Full Analysis Set, 72, 73 or 74 subjects are included in the analysis of each subscale measure, based upon the number of subjects self-injecting at the visit, with the available subscale score at the visit. For each subscale of the questionnaire, N, Mean and SD are presented for non-missing values.</population>
