  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bipolar disorder is a major health concern. Intercritical periods are marked with residual
      symptoms, both thymic and cognitive, which affects quality of life of patients, but also the
      quality of observance. The implementation of cognitive remediation programs could be
      interesting. The aim of this study is to evaluate the overall performance on euthymic bipolar
      patients with memory complaints included in the program named &quot;COGMED&quot;, targeting the working
      memory.

      The impact of this program on compliance, quality of life, and memory complaints will be
      evaluated.

      The investigator will measure whether there is a correlation between working memory and
      overall performances.

      Finally, the investigator will try to achieve a profile of bipolar patients in whom the
      Cogmed program is particularly effective on a plan of overall performance.

      Patients with bipolar disorder and memory complaints will be recruited.

      Two visits :

        1. at baseline (V0) : the investigator evaluate bipolar disorder, treatment, mood, quality
           of life, global functioning, and memory complaints. Patients also have a
           neuropsychological assessment. The COGMED program is proposed to patients with memory
           complaints and explain by the investigator

        2. 4-6 weeks after the end of the program (11-13 weeks after V1) : the same evaluation is
           realized to compare score before and after the program of cognitive remediation.

      Between the two visits the patient will benefit of COGMED program, at home, during 5 weeks.

      COGMED is a remediation cognitive program, based on working memory, consisting on daily
      exercises at home on a computer.

    <description>Patient should connect on his computer at home, 5 times a week, for 5 weeks. Every day, the patient has to do 8 exercises for a total duration of 30 to 45 minutes.
In total, the patient will have to complete 25 sessions. The difficulty level of the proposed items adjust automatically to the patient's maximum capacity to compel him to provide a cognitive effort. A progression index assesses the progress made by the patient.
Every week, the investigator will call the patient for 10 minutes in order to gather the patient's feelings, his difficulties, provide some advice and encourage him.
The investigator will have to analyze the results of curves available for each event, as well as the patient's progress index.</description>
