    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of paclitaxel in combination
      with cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone in chinese patients with relapsed/refractory multiple
      myeloma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM)remains a crucial challenge.The
      investigators have previously shown that the combination of paclitaxel and cyclophosphamide
      acts synergistically to induce apoptosis of myeloma cells in vitro. Based on these
      preclinical studies, the investigators initiated a phase II clinical trial of paclitaxel 175
      mg/m(2) IV over 3 h d1 combined with cyclophosphamide 200 mg/m(2) IV over 30-60 min d1,3,5
      and dexamethasone 20mg IV over 30-60 min d1-4 in patients with relapsed or refractory MM.
      This regimen was administered every four weeks for a total of six cycles
