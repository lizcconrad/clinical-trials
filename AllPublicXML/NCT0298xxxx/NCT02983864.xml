    <textblock>
      The objective of the proposed project is to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT)
      comparing sexual assault perpetration and related outcomes (i.e., bystander behavior; rape
      myth acceptance) for men who receive a group alcohol intervention only to men who receive a
      group integrated alcohol and sexual assault intervention.
