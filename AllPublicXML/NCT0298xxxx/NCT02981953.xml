  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current management of tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is either conservative (by medication)
      or by surgery, usually in concomitant with other valves repair or replacement. TR can worsen
      or appear late after successful mitral valve surgery which portends a poor prognosis
      .However, standard surgical approaches requiring cardiopulmonary bypass and especially second
      surgery have an excessive risks. Thus many patients are denied surgery because of unfavorable
      risk-benefit balance. Therefore there is a need for novel devices enabling interventional
      cardiologists and cardiothoracic surgeons to perform tricuspid annuloplasty by transcatheter
      methods. Cardioband replicates established surgical techniques (e.g., annuloplasty) using
      transfemoral approach, without sutures and with adjusted on the beating heart. Similar to the
      approved indication for mitral annuloplasty. The Cardioband System is expected to allow for
      treatment of patients that would otherwise not undergo Tricuspid valve repair due to the
      invasiveness of current techniques.

      The Cardioband Transcatheter System (Cardioband) is a marketed system that was approved for
      treatment of secondary (functional) mitral regurgitation (FMR) (CE granted on September
      2015). The Cardioband is an annuloplasty band that is similar to a surgical annuloplasty,
      however deployed on the beating heart through a transvenous approach. The CE mark study with
      30 subjects has been completed and documented significant reduction of severity of MR and
      improvement in quality of life by Minnesota living with heart failure questionnaire (MLHFQ),
      Ney York Heart Association (NYHA) and 6- minute walk test (6MWT), in subjects with moderate
      to severe MR. The aim of the current study is to evaluate the Cardioband annuloplasty system
      for repair the Tricuspid Regurgitation.
