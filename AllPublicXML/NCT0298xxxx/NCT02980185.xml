      To assess the feasibility, Residual Tumor, complication rate and survival of totally
      laparoscopic primary cytoreduction in carefully selected patients with Advanced Ovarian
      Cancer, compared with abdominal primary cytoreduction in a single-Institution, single-surgeon
      prospective series.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients with presumed stage III-IV ovarian cancer and clinical conditions allowing
      aggressive surgery were candidate to possible primary cytoreduction with the aim of achieving
      residual tumor=0. A definite protocol was adopted: after radiological preoperative evaluation
      with PET-CT scan, all patients underwent laparoscopic evaluation with the Fagotti score. Once
      considered suitable for primary debulking surgery, the possibility of attempting laparoscopic
      cytoreduction was carefully evaluated using strict selection criteria; patients were divided
      in two groups, based on the type of surgical approach. At the end of laparoscopic primary
      cytoreduction, a ultra-low pubic minilaparotomy was performed to extract surgical specimens
      and to perform laparoscopic hand-assisted exploration of the abdominal organs, in order to
      ensure complete excision of the disease. Surgical data, optimal cytoreduction (defined as
      residual tumor=0) rates and survival outcomes were investigated.
