  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study describes a randomized, double-blind, cross-over study of intravenous G-CSF
      followed by infusion with autologous mobilized peripheral blood mononuclear cells (mPBMCs) in
      children with cerebral palsy (CP) to determine the safety and feasibility of the procedure,
      as well as the potential efficacy for improving neurological impairment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesized that mobilized peripheral blood mononuclear cells (mPBMCs) would be a better
      source of cell therapy for children with CP, if these cells had a similar neuroregenerative
      potential to bone marrow/cord blood mononuclear cells (MNCs). Multipotent precursor cells
      exist in peripheral blood, and a fraction of elutriated blood cells from normal individuals
      contains MNCs that have the potential to be MSCs. There are several advantages to using
      mPBMCs for cell therapy in children with CP: the G-CSF that is used to mPBMCs has
      neuroregenerative potential; the collection and fractionation of stem cells can be repeated;
      and, the therapy is suitable for most children with CP.

    <description>G-CSF would be administered for 5 days and then mobilized peripheral blood mononuclear cells (mPBMCs) would be collected in all included patients. One month after cryopreservation of the mPBMCs (M1), patients will be randomized to receive either mPBMCs or placebo. Six months after randomization (M7), cross-over infusion of mPBMCs or placebo will be performed and the patients are observed for another 6 months. mPBMCs group would be included all patients who received mPBMCs at M1 or M7.</description>
