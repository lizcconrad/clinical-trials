  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The anesthetic technique of choice for surgical treatment of CTS varies among surgeons. In
      the last decade some studies have described the performance of this surgery using local
      anesthesia with adrenaline without the necessity of sedation or the use of pneumatic garrote,
      having good effectiveness and substantial reduction of costs. However there is need for
      studies with an appropriate design and methodology to evaluate the actual effectiveness of
      this kind of anesthesia for the surgical treatment of CTS.

      Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness and cost of open surgery for CTS in a randomized
      trial comparing two anesthesia methods: intravenous regional anesthesia (Bier) and local
      anesthesia with adrenaline without limb garroting (Lalondi).

      Methods: This study was developed in the Group of Hand Surgery and Upper Limb; Department of
      Orthopedics and Traumatology, Federal University of São Paulo, UNIFESP / EPM with
      co-participation of the Hand Surgery and Microsurgery Department of Hospital Alvorada. This
      study will be a Randomized Clinical Trial. The previous calculation of the sample resulted in
      78 patients. The following primary outcomes will be assessed: Pain through visual analogue
      scale (VAS). Costs: Costs related to anesthetic and surgical procedures will be recorded. The
      secondary outcomes will be: Use of Analgesics, Anxiety and Depression through the HADS
      (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) scale. Quality of life through the Boston Carpal
      Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire (BCTQ). Remission of paresthesia after surgical intervention,
      complications and failures.

      Surgical treatment of CTS is most often performed under hospital conditions, with the use of
      anesthesia. The anesthetic technique of choice varies among surgeons. In the last decade some
      studies have described the performance of this surgery using local anesthesia with adrenaline
      without the necessity of sedation or the use of pneumatic garrote, having good effectiveness
      and substantial reduction of costs for the procedure with this anesthetic method. However,
      when we evaluated the level and strength of the evidence from these studies, we notice that
      there is a need for studies with an appropriate design and methodology to evaluate the actual
      effectiveness of this kind of anesthesia for the surgical treatment of CTS.

      Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness and cost of open surgery for CTS in a randomized
      trial comparing two anesthesia methods: intravenous regional anesthesia (Bier) and local
      anesthesia with adrenaline without limb garroting (Lalondi).

      Methods: This study was developed in the Group of Hand Surgery and Upper Limb; Department of
      Orthopedics and Traumatology, Federal University of São Paulo, UNIFESP / EPM with
      co-participation of the Hand Surgery and Microsurgery Department of the Medical Residency
      Service in Hand Surgery of Hospital Alvorada. This study will be a Randomized Clinical Trial.
      The previous calculation of the sample resulted in the need for total inclusion of 35
      patients in each group, total of 70 patients, considering a loss of 10% during follow-up we
      will include 78 patients. The following primary outcomes will be assessed: Pain through
      visual analogue scale (VAS), that, will be measured in the pre-operative, transoperatory,
      immediate postoperative, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 8 hours, 12 hours after surgery. Costs:
      Costs related to anesthetic and surgical procedures will be recorded. The secondary outcomes
      will be: Use of Analgesics, Anxiety and Depression through the HADS (Hospital Anxiety and
      Depression Scale) scale. Quality of life through the Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome
      Questionnaire (BCTQ). Remission of paresthesia after surgical intervention, complications and
      failures.

    <description>Patients in the study group will respond to Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire (BCTQ) translated and validated for Portuguese preoperative (after initial clinical evaluation) and postoperative (3th month PO). It is a disease specific questionnaire, self-administered, and evaluates the severity of the symptoms and functional status of patients with CTS. The BCTQ assesses the symptoms and the severity, frequency, time and type. The functional degree of scale evaluates how the syndrome affects daily life. Issues relating to the severity scale are composed of 11 questions. Each question has five answers, placed in order of increasing severity of symptoms. The issues relating to the functional status are composed of 8 questions, each of which corresponds to a functional activity. Each activity has a 5-degree-answer of difficulty progressively worsening.</description>

    <description>The anesthetic technique described by Bier will be done by the anesthesiologist. The following steps were followed: 1)Placement double tourniquet on the proximal portion of the arm 2)Asepsis and antisepsis of the operative limb 3)Puncture and venous catheterization most distal in the limb 4)Elevation of limb for 1 to 2 minutes, next the limb will be spirally wrapped with Esmarch from the distal to proximal 5)The proximal cuff will be inflated 6)Withdrawal of Esmarch and injection of 40ml of lidocaine without epinephrine at 0.5% 7)Removal the canula until the distal cuff is inflated and the proximal cuff is emptied 8)Removal of the club must be done after the surgery, at least 40 minutes after the injection of the anesthetic.</description>

    <description>Patients will be anesthetized by surgeons, who are familiar with the technique described by Lalonde. Around thirty minutes before surgery, will be infused with 20 ml of an anesthetic solution. The infiltrated solution is composed of 1% lidocaine with epinephrine in 1: 100,000. Initially 10 mL of the solution will be applied slowly in the flexion fold region of the wrist just below the skin and subfascial plane. The needle is moved slowly. The needle is then redirected to the radial side of the proximal palmar region for infiltration of another 2-3 mL of the subcutaneous solution. The remaining 7-8mL in the subdermal plane and anterior to the transverse carpal ligament.</description>
