    <textblock>
      The MR308-3501 study is a multicenter, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group study in male
      and female adult subjects to demonstrate the efficacy of MR308 in the treatment of acute
      moderate to severe pain after the extraction of at least two third molars requiring bone
      removal.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter double-blind, randomised, phase III study in male and female subjects
      with acute pain after third molar tooth extraction. The dental procedure must have involved
      extraction of at least two impacted third molars requiring bone removal. If only two impacted
      third molars are extracted, they must be ipsilateral and both require bone removal under
      local anaesthesia.

      The Screening Visit (Visit 1) can take place up to 28 days before the planned third molar
      extractions. The randomisation visit (Visit 2) consists of three different sections, a part
      before the surgery, the part with the surgery and before randomisation, and a part with the
      randomisation and post-randomisation assessments. The visits 3 and 4, one respectively two
      days after the randomisation can be performed by telephone if the subject does not
      participate in the pharmacokinetic sampling.

      The last dose of IMP should be taken by the subject about 72h after the initial dose and
      before the Completion/Discontinuation Visit (Visit 5) is performed.

      The Adverse Event (AE) Follow-up Visit (Visit 6) is the last study visit and should not be
      done earlier than seven days after the subject's last dose of IMP. It can be performed by
      telephone.

    <measure>Efficacy of MR308 doses in the treatment of moderate to severe acute pain, based on the Sum of Pain Intensity Differences (SPID).</measure>
    <time_frame>0-4 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint is the Sum of Pain Intensity Differences over 0-4 hours (SPID4). SPID4 is derived as the weighted Sum of Pain Intensity Differences (baseline pain - current pain), measured at different time points via the PI-VAS. Time between two consecutive measurements will be used for weighting. Larger values indicate larger pain relief.</description>

             one which results in a low failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per year) when used
             consistently and correctly such as sterilisation, implants, injectables, combined oral
             contraceptives, some IUDs (Intrauterine Device, hormonal), sexual abstinence or
             vasectomised partner).

             antidepressants, MAO inhibitors (within 14 days before taking IMP), antipsychotics,
             anticonvulsant and other seizure threshold-lowering medicinal products), celecoxib
             (e.g. increased risk of post-operative bleeding, active peptic ulceration, GI bleeding
             or inflammatory bowel disease) or paracetamol.

          4. Known sensitivity and/or contraindication to tramadol, celecoxib, paracetamol,
             sulfonamides, opioids, NSAIDS, COX-2 inhibitors, or related compounds or formulation
             excipients as well as severe hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. anaphylactic shock,
             bronchospasm, angioedema) to any drugs.

          5. Subjects who are known to have had inadequate pain relief from paracetamol, tramadol
             or celecoxib.

          6. Subjects requiring any medication which is prohibited as per section prohibited
             medication.

             perception.

          9. Significant neurological or psychiatric disorders including mental instability
             (unrelated to the pain) that could interfere with pain assessment; other pain that
             might impair the assessment of the nociceptive pain.

         10. Any medical history of significant and/or inadequately controlled cardiovascular
             (uncontrolled high blood pressure, high risk of cardiovascular events, severe heart
             failure), pulmonary, hematologic, (including coagulopathy/bleeding disorders),
             neurological (e.g. subjects with epilepsy or those susceptible to seizures), liver
             disease (e.g. severe hepatic impairment), kidney disease (e.g. serum creatinine level
             greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal, impaired renal function in subjects
             taking diuretics, ACE-inhibitors, or angiotensin II antagonists), endocrine,
             immunologic, dermatologic painful conditions or any other conditions that may
             compromise the ability of the subject to participate in the study or might interfere
             with drug absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion.

         11. Previous randomisation in this study.

         12. Subjects who participated in a clinical research study involving a new chemical entity
             or an experimental drug within 30 days of study entry (defined as the start of the
             Screening Period).

         13. Subjects who were treated regularly with opioid analgesic or NSAIDs within 30 days
             prior to screening or who have received a long-acting NSAID within three days prior to
             the start of the surgery.

         14. Subjects who have received any analgesic medication (e.g. NSAIDs, oral opioid
             preparations etc.) other than short-acting preoperative or intraoperative local
             anaesthetic agents within 12 hours before the start of the surgery or peri operatively
             until randomisation.

         15. Subjects who are incapable of complying with the protocol.

        Additional Exclusion Criteria after Surgery:

          1. Serious complication during surgery and up to randomisation, including:

               -  Post-operative primary and secondary bleed that cannot be controlled.

               -  Subjects who did not had the third molar extraction completed as planned.

          2. Post-operative medications or treatments that can have an analgesic effect or cause
             sedation or have amnesic effect are not permitted as these may interfere with the
             study assessments. These include use of ice packs, corticosteroids, nitrous oxide,
             benzodiazepines, alcohol, hypnotics, analgesics, opioids, other psychotropic medicinal
             products and any other analgesia except the provided study treatments

          3. If in the Investigators opinion there are any factors that may confound the analysis
             of the study regarding efficacy and safety (e.g. a PI-VAS score greater than 90).
