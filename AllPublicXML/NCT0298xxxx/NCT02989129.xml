  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn about the effectiveness of quercetin in
      treating and preventing CINP. Researchers also want to learn if quercetin has an effect on
      participant's quality of life.

      Study Product Administration:

      If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, participant will take
      quercetin tablets by mouth 2 times every day for 12 weeks. The study staff will give
      participant the tablets and additional instructions on how to take the study product.

      Length of Participation:

      Participant may take quercetin for up to 12 weeks. Participant will no longer be able to take
      quercetin if the pain symptoms gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if
      participant is unable to follow study directions.

      Study Visits:

      Every week, participant will either come to the clinic or a member of the staff will call
      participant to learn how participant is doing, if participant has had any side effects, and
      to check that participant is taking quercetin correctly. Participant will also complete a
      questionnaire about any pain symptoms participant may be having. The call/questionnaire
      should take about 10-15 minutes to complete.

      End-of-Study Visit:

      About 7 days after participant's last dose of quercetin, participant will complete the same
      questionnaires participant completed at screening.

      Participation in this study will be over after the end-of-study visit.

      This is an investigational study. Quercetin is commercially available as a supplement, but it
      is not FDA approved.The study doctor can explain how the study product is designed to work.

      Up to 20 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.
