  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In pediatric age groups communication difficulties very sometimes may present further
      obstacles in obtaining a detailed injury history and early identification of TBI symptoms.

      Most emergency management protocols are focused exclusively on the identification of the
      relatively small number of patients who may require operative intervention, as early surgery
      is believed to improve outcome.

      However early rehabilitation can also be effective for the much larger number of patients who
      do not require surgery[1] In addition, Hall and others recently reported that low doses of
      ionizing radiation to the brain in infancy may influence cognitive abilities in adulthood.
      [2] Accordingly, increased serum concentrations of, for example S100B ( a calcium-binding
      protein present in high concentrations in glial cells) and neurone-specific enolase ( NSE: a
      cytoplasmatic enzyme occuring predominantly in neurones ) have been demonstrated to reflect
      the presence and severity of brain tissue damage in acute head injuries. [3] In both
      pediatric age and adults.
