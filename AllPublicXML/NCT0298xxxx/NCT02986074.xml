      The study will compare therapeutic efficacy of a novel spinal cord stimulation leads implant
      based on anatomical landmarks with standard surgical implantation technique.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to compare the therapeutic efficacy of the conventional,
      paresthesia mapping-based burst spinal cord stimulation (SCS) implantation strategy to a more
      novel, anatomic midline-based approach that has the potential to streamline the workflow
      associated with the SCS treatment continuum.
