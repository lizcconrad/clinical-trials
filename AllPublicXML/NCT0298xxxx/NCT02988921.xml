  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with functional features of diffusion weighted imaging (DWI)
      are advancing imaging technologies that have potential to overcome limitations of
      conventional staging methods, radiation treatment planning and the assessment of tumor
      response in esophageal or esophagogastric cancer. This study aimed to explore the value of
      MRI for the prediction of tumor response to chemoradiotherapy and accurate target volume
      delineation as compared to CT simulation for patients with unresectable or potentially
      resectable esophageal or esophagogastric cancer undergoing chemoradiotherapy. The average CT
      texture features are also extracted before and during treatment to establish a model to
      predict the prognosis or side effects (e.g. radiation pneumonitis or esophagitis) of
      patients.

      1. Both DW-MRI and CT simulation will be performed before chemoradiotherapy and after 18-22
           fractions. Also MRI will be performed after treatment. The investigators will contour
           based on the MRI image and compare this with the standard CT plan before and during
           treatment.

        2. The predictive potential of initial tumor ADC, and change in ADC during and after
           treatment for tumor response will be assessed.

        3. The average CT texture features not only in the present study but also of those who
           treated previously in our department (since 2014) will be extracted before and during
           chemoradiotherapy to establish a model to predict the prognosis of patients.
