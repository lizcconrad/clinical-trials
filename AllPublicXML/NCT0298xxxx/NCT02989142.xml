      The project focuses on prevention of major pregnancy and birth related complications :
      pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH), gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), caesarean section
      (CS), and large-for-gestational-age (LGA), i.e. the birth weight of the baby exceeds the 90%
      percentile of birth weights for the specific pregnancy duration.

      The investigators focus on the pre-conception period, i.e. the pre-conception period of the
      2nd pregnancy in women with an excessive weight gain during their 1st pregnancy, aiming to
      decrease the complications rate in their 2nd pregnancy.

      Women with an excessive gestational weight gain have obtained the extra weight during a
      rather short period of time, e.g. 20 kilos in the last 4 or 5 months of their pregnancy. This
      characteristic distinguishes the target group from the general population with
      overweight/obesity, in whom the extra weight was acquired during many years and independent
      from a pregnancy, making a behaviour change more complex.

      The coaching intervention combines face-to-face counselling with the use of a mobile App
      connected to medical devices (scale and pedometer). The app monitors important indicators
      (weight, eating behaviour, physical activity, mental wellbeing), provides coaching through
      established behavioral change techniques, and is specifically tailored for women with
      excessive weight gain during the previous pregnancy.

      The goal is to decrease the rate of pregnancy and birth-related adverse outcomes in the next
      pregnancy by a healthy life style, starting shortly after their 1st delivery and sustained
      during the next pregnancy.

      The aim is to decrease the prevalence of pregnancy and birth-related complications
      (pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH), gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), caesarean section
      (CS), and large-for-gestational-age babies (LGA)). These complications occur in 26% of
      pregnancies with normal start BMI and adequate weight gain, in 34% in normal start BMI but
      excessive gestational weight gain and in up to 66% in obese class III (BMI≥40kg/m²) combined
      with excessive gestational weight gain. Moreover, as the prevalence of maternal obesity
      continues to rise, increasing numbers of children are exposed to an 'obesogenic intrauterine
      environment'. Obesity in pregnancy has therefore the potential to result in an
      'intergenerational cycle' of obesity through in utero programming.

      The investigators focus on women with excessive weight gain during their 1st pregnancy as
      currently, half of them do not return to their pre-pregnancy weight before the next
      pregnancy. This results in a complication rate as high as 42% (PIH, GDM, CS, LGA). The
      investigators target a healthy BMI at start of pregnancy by intervening during the
      pre-conception period- and an adequate weight gain during pregnancy by intervening during
      pregnancy in these women. The intervention will be evaluated in a randomized controlled trial
      including 1,100 women.

      The proposed intervention combines face-to-face coaching with the use of a mobile App
      (so-called 'inter-act' app) connected to medical devices (scale and pedometer). The app
      monitors women's weight, eating behaviour, physical activity, mental wellbeing, and provides
      continuously coaching through positive behavioral change techniques. The 'inter-act' App
      covers after the 1st delivery breast-feeding support, while during pregnancy, the gestational
      weight gain guidelines of the Institute of Medicine (IOM) are included.

      Drop out of less motivated women is avoided as the time points of the four pre-conception
      coaching sessions coincide with the existing postnatal follow-up visits for neonates
      (Governmental vaccination scheme through the organisation &quot; Kind &amp; Gezin&quot;), and the three
      pregnancy coaching sessions coincide with the three routine ultrasound scans during normal
      pregnancy (KCE Guidelines).

      Each year, there are 8,900 singleton pregnancies in Flanders in whom the mother had excessive
      gestational weight gain in the prior pregnancy. The current rate of at least one of the four
      major pregnancy and birth-related complications (PIH, GDM, CS, LGA) in the 8,900 pregnancies
      is 42%. If the complications rate reduces with 1/4, this involves more than 900 pregnancies,
      and reduces costs related to caesarean sections, gestational diabetes, obesity in mother &amp;
      child.

    <description>The existence of pregnancy-induced hypertension and gestational diabetes mellitus are assessed during pregnancy. Whether the 2nd pregnancy results in a caesarean section and large-for-gestational-age baby will be known at the time of delivery 2nd pregnancy. Therefore, the primary outcome of prevalence of participants with pregnancy and birth-related complications is assessed at the time of delivery 2nd pregnancy.</description>

    <description>Costs related to these complications:
caesarean section costs 4,013€ compared to 2,909€ for a vaginal delivery, resulting in a 4,013-2,909= 1,104€ additional cost per caesarean section (Onafhankelijke Ziekenfondsen, 2012).
Gestational diabetes has an additional cost 820 € (Danyliv et al., IADPSG 2014, Gestational Diabetes and health care cost).
There is also the impact of gestational diabetes on the baby. Intrauterine exposure through gestational diabetes predisposes the off-spring to diabetes: yearly cost for diabetes around 5,800€ (American Diabetes Association).
Obesity: yearly additional direct medical cost for obesity approximately 3000 € per person due to increased contacts with health care providers and hospitalisation costs (De Jonghe E and Annemans L, 2009).
The costs of the coaching sessions are based on the official nomenclature of midwives (RIZIV - Rijksinstituut voor ziekte- en invaliditeitsverzekering, Belgian institute)</description>

    <description>Pre-conception coaching sessions: We encourage less motivated women to participate to the trial by collaborating with Kind &amp; Gezin from the very beginning, as most timepoints of the counselling sessions coincide with the time points of the Kind&amp;Gezin vaccine scheme (postpartum week 6, week 8, week 12, 6 months). We will organize the coaching in a &quot;mother and baby friendly&quot; community-based setting or in the hospitals, as preferred by the mothers.
Pregnancy coaching sessions: take place in hospital, at the time of the three planned ultrasound scans.
By consequence, the applied methodology can be applied as such at the moment of global utilisation in Flanders.</description>
