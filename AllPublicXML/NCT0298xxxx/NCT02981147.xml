      Common colds are the most frequently encountered human diseases worldwide. Common cold is a
      conventional term used for mild upper respiratory illnesses, which comprises a heterogeneous
      group of self-limited diseases caused by numerous viruses. The frequency is age-specific with
      fewer episodes in adults than in younger children. Cough due to the common cold is probably
      the most common cause of acute cough. In a significant subset of patients with &quot;post
      infectious&quot; cough, the etiology is probably an inflammatory response triggered by a viral
      upper respiratory infection (ie, the common cold). The resultant sub-acute or chronic cough
      can be considered to be due to an upper airway cough syndrome, previously referred to as
      postnasal drip syndrome.

      Thyme leaf (Thymus vulgaris) expels phlegm and relieves congestion . It is antiseptic and an
      immune stimulant. The primary chemical constituents of Thyme include essential oil (borneol,
      carvacrol, cymol, linalool, thymol), bitter principle, tannin, flavonoids (apigenin,
      luteolin), saponins, and triterpenic acids. Thyme warms and stimulates the lungs, expels
      mucus, and relieves congestion. It also helps deter bacterial, fungal, and viral infections.
      The thymol content of thyme works as an expectorant and cough suppressant and is frequently
      used in cough syrups.
