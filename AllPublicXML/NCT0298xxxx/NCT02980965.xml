  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was an open-label, randomized controlled trial that aims to compare the efficacy and
      safety of the concurrent neoadjuvant chemotherapy with endocrine therapy and neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy alone in ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Data showed that concurrent neoadjuvant chemotherapy with endocrine therapy was a effective
      option for ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer patients. However this is still a
      controversial issue. The present study is an open-label randomized controlled clinical trial
      that aims to investigate the efficacy of concurrent NCT with endocrine therapy (AI with or
      without GnRH-a) in patients with ER-positive, HER2-negative breast carcinoma.
