    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation, Phase 1 study of intravenous (IV)
      samalizumab to determine its maximum tolerated dose (MTD), overall safety/tolerability,
      PK/pharmacodynamic parameters, and efficacy in patients with advanced solid tumors.

          2. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2.

          3. Patient has advanced/metastatic cancer with disease progression after treatment with
             all available therapies known to confer clinical benefit.

          4. Patient has a life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has a symptomatic brain metastasis.

          2. Patient has active gastrointestinal bleeding as evidenced by either hematemesis or
             melena.

          3. Patient has acute gastrointestinal ulcers.

          4. Patient has a history of any cancer other than the present condition (except
             nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix), unless in complete
             remission and off all therapy for that disease for a minimum of 3 years.

          5. Patient with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids or
             other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug administration.

          6. Patient has an active infection requiring therapy.

          7. Patient's serum is positive for the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg).
             antibodies to hepatitis C virus (HCV), or antibodies to human immunodeficiency Virus
             1/2 (HIV 1/2)

             treatment.

          9. The patient's most recent test values within 14 days before the date of entry meet the
             following standards:

               -  Bone marrow function: neutrophil count ≤ 1500/mm3, hemoglobin ≤ 9.0 g/dL,

                  the standard value of each institution, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine
                  aminotransferase ≥ 2.5 x ULN based on the reference laboratory

               -  Renal function: serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 x ULN based on the reference laboratory

         10. Patient has ongoing immune-stimulated adverse events (AEs) from other immunotherapies
             (eg, pneumonitis, thyroiditis, or hepatitis) or a history of pneumonitis.

         11. Patient has received chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and/or immunotherapy within the
             28 days prior to first dose of study drug, or within a Washout Period for the
             chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and/or immunotherapy of 5 half-lives, whichever occurs
             first.

         12. Patient has toxicities from previous immunotherapy that have not resolved to Grade 1.
