  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2, open-label, multicenter study of HS-10296 with dose escalation, dose
      expansion and extension cohorts in locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC) patients who have progressed following prior therapy with an epidermal growth factor
      receptor(EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) agent. The study is designed to evaluate
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and anti-tumor activity of once-daily and orally
      (PO) administered HS-10296. The overall study design is shown in the flow chart below, which
      consists of 3 phases: dose escalation, dose expansion and extension cohort.

          1. Provision of signed and dated written informed consent prior to any study-specific
             procedures, sampling, and analyses. If a patient declines to participate in any
             voluntary exploratory research and/or genetic component of the study, there will be no
             penalty or loss of benefit to the patient and he/she will not be excluded from other
             aspects of the study.

          2. Age at least 18 years.

          3. Histological or cytological confirmation diagnosis of NSCLC.

          4. Radiological documentation of disease progression while on a previous continuous
             treatment with an EGFR TKI, e.g., gefitinib or erlotinib. In addition, other lines of
             therapy may have been given. All patients must have documented radiological
             progression on the last treatment administered, prior to enrolling in the study.

                  have experienced clinical benefit from EGFR TKI, according to the Jackman
                  criteria (followed by systemic objective progression (RECIST or World Health
                  Organization [WHO]) while on continuous treatment with an EGFR TKI.

          6. For the dose expansion and extension cohorts, patients also must have confirmation of
             tumor T790M+ mutation status from a biopsy sample taken after disease progression on
             the most recent treatment regimen with an EGFR TKI.

             Prior to entry, a result from the central analysis of the patient's T790M mutation
             status must be obtained.

                  the first dose of study treatment. (If sufficient wash-out time has not occurred
                  due to scheduling or PK properties, an alternative appropriate wash-out time
                  based on known duration and time to reversibility of drug-related adverse events
                  must be agreed upon by Hansoh and the Investigator).

               -  Any cytotoxic chemotherapy, investigational agents, or anticancer drugs for
                  advanced NSCLC used for a previous treatment regimen or clinical study within 14

                  first dose of study treatment.

               -  Radiotherapy with a limited field of radiation for palliation within 1 week of
                  the first dose of study treatment, with the exception of patients receiving
                  radiation to more than 30% of the bone marrow or with a wide field of radiation
                  which must be completed within 4 weeks of the first dose of study treatment.

          2. Previously untreated NSCLC patients. To be eligible for this study, patients must have

          4. Spinal cord compression or brain metastases unless asymptomatic, stable, and not
             requiring steroids for at least 4 weeks prior to start of study treatment.

          5. Any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases, including uncontrolled
             hypertension or active bleeding diatheses, which, in the Investigator's opinion, makes

                  first degree relatives or any concomitant medication known to prolong the QT
                  interval.
