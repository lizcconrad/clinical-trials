  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sudoscan™ (Impeto Medical, Paris France) uses electrochemical skin conductance as a novel
      noninvasive method to detect sudomotor dysfunction. Several small studies have recently shown
      that Sudoscan use in the assessment of small fiber polyneuropathy (in diabetes mellitus) can
      be performed non-invasively, quickly and effectively. The investigators aim to study the use
      of Sudoscan in rare disease condition associated with small fiber polyneuropathy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Small fiber polyneuropathy (SFPN) is diagnosed through a combination of symptoms, signs and
      confirmatory diagnostic testing. Nerve conduction studies are not sensitive enough in most of
      the cases leaving the ankle skin biopsy with measurement of intraepidermal nerve fiber
      density (IENFD) as the main diagnostic tool. Despite its utility and reproducibility, skin
      biopsy is invasive, expensive and requires a central laboratory for processing and
      interpretation. Quantitative sudomotor axon reflex testing (QSART) is also routinely used for
      evaluation of small fiber neuropathy as sudomotor axons can also be involved. This test
      however remains technically challenging and requires testing conditions in specialized labs
      that are not always suitable for all patients' population. By comparing findings on skin
      biopsy and/or QSRT, accepted gold standard for diagnosing SFPN, the investigators seek to
      find faster, less-invasive ways to diagnose and monitor small-fiber polyneuropathy in rare
      diseases using Sudoscan measurement.

    <description>QSRT (quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test) testing involves having a technician wipe the subject's arms and leg with alcohol, then tissue to wipe it dry. Electrodes filled with acetylcholine are put on three areas of the leg and one on the wrist, stimulators are turned on and sweat responses are measured.</description>
