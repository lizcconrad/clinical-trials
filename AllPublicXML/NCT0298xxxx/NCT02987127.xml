  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastric low-grade mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (MALToma) is associated with
      Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection, and around 70% of these tumors can be cured by HP
      eradication therapy (HPE). However, the role of antibiotics in the frontline treatment of
      extragastric MALToma remains unclear. In addition to anecdotal case reports showing
      histologic regression of extragastric MALTomas after antibiotics, our explorative study found
      that frontline HPE (clarithromycin, amoxicillin, and omeprazole) resulted in complete
      remission (CR) in this subgroup patients (2 salivary gland, 1 lung, 1 colon, and 4 ocular
      adnexal MALToma [OAML]). Interestingly, two patients with OAML who do not respond to
      Chlamydia psittaci (CP) eradication using doxycycline achieved CR after HPE. These findings
      suggest that bacterial infections, including HP, may be involved in the lymphomagenesis of
      these extragastric MALTomas. Our preliminary results also revealed that 5 (23.8%) of 21
      HP-negative gastric MALToma patients achieved CR after HPE, indicating that antibiotics may
      also have ability to eradicate non-HP bacteria. Based on our preliminary findings and the
      indolent biologic behavior of MALToma, it is reasonable to use frontline HPE in the treatment
      of early-stage low-grade extragastric MALToma.

      Through a prospective trial of frontline HPE in the treatment of early-stage extragastric
      MALToma, investigators will evaluate and investigate the following issues:

        1. The CR and partial remission (PR) rate for antibiotics as 1st-line therapy for stage IE
           and stage IIE extragastric MALToma

        2. The durability of CR and PR (relapse-free survival) after antibiotics treatment (HPE) in
           early-stage extragastric MALToma

        3. The assessment of the evidence of bacterial infection, such as HP, in extragastric
           MALToma.

        4. The identification of potential biomarkers that help us predict whether extragastric
           MALToma can respond to frontline HPE.
