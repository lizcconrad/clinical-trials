      A prospective, single-arm, traditional feasibility study of a physician-modified fenestrated
      Cook Zenith TX2 aortic endograft base device in adult patients meeting traditional size
      criteria for open surgical treatment of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms. Patients meriting
      surgical treatment of their aneurysm that also meet inclusion and exclusion criteria will be
      eligible for enrollment. Patients will be followed for 5 years post procedure. Major adverse
      events will also be recorded by the Sponsor-Investigator and will be monitored by a locally
      appointed Data Monitoring Committee, the Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board, and
      the FDA.

          9. Have a body habitus that would inhibit X-ray visualization of the aorta.

         10. Have a major surgical or interventional procedure unrelated to the treatment of the
             aneurysm planned ≤30 days of the endovascular repair.
