      The purpose of this study is to assess the usefulness of the Thyromental Height Test in
      prediction of difficult intubation using double lumen endotracheal tubes in patients
      scheduled for elective thoracic procedures.

    <textblock>
      Proper prediction of the occurrence of difficult intubation plays a crucial role in
      anaesthesiology. For years attempts have been made to develop methods allowing
      anaesthesiologists to correctly predict the occurrence of difficult intubation. None of the
      currently used tests and anthropometric measurements present satisfying predictive value.
      Recent studies show promise in Thyromental Height Test (TMHT), which base on the height
      between the anterior borders of the mentum and the thyroid cartilage, measured while the
      patient lies in the supine position with closed mouth, as a single, non-invasive predictor of
      difficult intubation. Use of double lumen endotracheal tubes during thoracic procedures, due
      to greater diameter of the tube, may lead to higher occurrence of difficult intubation. That
      is why, the purpose of this study is to assess the usefulness of the TMHT in prediction of
      difficult intubation using double lumen endotracheal tubes in patients scheduled for elective
      thoracic procedures and relate it to other, commonly used predictive tests.

      During routine, preoperative anaesthetic visit thyromental height, thyromental distance,
      sternomental distance and Mallampati scale score are assessed. Then, during direct
      laryngoscopy and intubation, score in Cormack-Lehane scale and occurrence of difficult
      intubation are noted.
