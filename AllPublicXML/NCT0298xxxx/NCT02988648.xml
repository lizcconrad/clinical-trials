      The purpose of this phase I/II study is to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of
      Radioiodide (131I-) as a novel targeted therapy for metastatic breast cancer that
      overexpresses functional Na/I symporter. The study will enroll patients with metastatic
      breast cancer who have had clinical and/or radiographic evidence of disease progression on
      prior hormonal and/or chemotherapy.

      The primary objectives of the study are as follows:

        1. To evaluate the feasibility of using 124I- PET/CT scans to identify patients whose
           metastatic lesions accumulate radioactive iodide and therefore are candidates for 131I-
           therapy.

        2. Determine the frequency of iodide (124I) enriching metastatic breast cancer.

        3. Evaluate the safety and clinical activity of one-time 131I treatment to patients who
           screen positive on 124I- PET/CT screening, positivity is defined as calculated iodide
           enrichment that will allow delivering 2000 cGy or more radiation to one or more
           metastatic lesion by administering up to 200mCi 131I-.

      The secondary objectives of the study are as follows:

      1. To investigate a correlation between NIS expression in tumor tissue with 124I- uptake on
      screening PET/CT scan

      The Phase I portion will follow a 3+3 design with 4 dose levels (30, 60, 120, and 200 mCi) of
      I- treatment. The maximum tolerated dose will be used in the Phase II efficacy assessment
      which will follow a Simon's optimal two-stage design. The primary efficacy measure is
      objective tumor response rate (CR or PR) with targeted activity level of &gt; 20% response rate.

      The study will be terminated for futility if no tumor response is seen in the first 12
      patients. If futility criteria is not met, a total of 37 eligible patients will be enrolled
      in the Phase II portion. If 4 or more responses are seen after 37 patients were evaluated,
      then the investigators will conclude that the regimen warrants further study.

    <description>The primary efficacy measure is objective tumor response rate (CR or PR) with targeted activity level of &gt; 20% response rate.
Patients should be followed regularly until disease progression and until resolution of all acute toxicities associated with treatment administration. If stable disease or resolution of toxicities takes longer than 24 weeks, follow up frequency will be determined by the treating physician.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Each patient must meet all inclusion criteria in order to be considered for enrollment:

             measurable or evaluable metastatic disease by Response Evaluation in Solid Tumors
             (RECIST) 1.1.

          -  Life expectancy ≥12 weeks.

          -  Radiologic or clinical evidence of disease progression on prior hormonal and/or
             chemotherapy

          -  There is no restriction on the number of prior lines of therapy.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status score of &lt; 2.

          -  Full recovery to Grade ≤ 2 from any prior side effects of prior therapy for cancer
