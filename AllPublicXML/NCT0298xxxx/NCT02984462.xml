  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective randomized study about hallux valgus surgery. The investigator try
      to assess if the fixation of percutaneous Akin osteotomy with a cannulated screw have an
      incidence in the first ray mobility since the two technics ( fixation and no-fixation) are
      described and practiced, and since the stiffness of the first metatarso-phalangeal joint is
      determinant in the result of this functional surgery.

      It's a prospective monocentric randomized work about forefoot surgery. Every patient included
      undergoes an hallux valgus chevron osteotomy of the first metatarsal associated with a
      percutaneous Akin osteotomy of the first phalange. The investigators study the impact of the
      fixation of percutaneous Akin osteotomy ( osteotomy of the first phalange of hallux) with two
      arms: one with fixation of the percutaneous Akin osteotomy, and one with a non-fixed
      percutaneous Akin osteotomy This study as been approved by Institutional review board;
      written informed consent is required for all patients before inclusion.

      The clinic follow-up of each patients included in the study will be the same of the normal
      follow-up for this type of surgery in our practice. This includes clinical exam, radiologic
      exam, and functional score AOFAS before surgery, at 6 weeks after the surgery, four months
      after surgery and finally one year after the surgery.

      The primary outcome measure which is the first metatarso-phalangeal global mobility will be
      blindly measure by an observator.

    <description>The act to AKIN is osteotomy in percutaneous; This technique can be performed with or without fixation, and both methods make reference in the literature. With fixation method to get rid of the risk of loss of the surgical reduction of the misalignment, but requires an additional surgical procedure marked by the implementation of a percutaneous cannulated screw on part of the osteotomy. Without fixing method allows to get rid of this gesture, and risk a possible annoys by osteo-synthesis material. Surgical dressings of surgery of hallux valgus allow to keep the reduction for 15 days. Both techniques give excellent results and are performed in our service of routinely.</description>
