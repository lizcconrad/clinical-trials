  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Izun Pharmaceuticals has shown that PeriActive, an oral rinse containing extracts of Sambucus
      nigra, Echinacea purpurea, and Centella asiatica significantly reduced gingival inflammation
      in an experimental gingivitis model in a phase II study, as well as in numerous other
      clinical trials. The product and its individual components were shown to be safe.

      Based on these favorable results, Izun is now seeking to demonstrate that a combined
      anti-bacterial/anti-inflammatory rinse will potentially enhance soft tissue healing and
      reduce localized inflammation following dental implant surgery equal to, or better than, a
      chlorhexidine rinse, with fewer side effects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized phase IV controlled trial with two parallel arms: (1) PeriActive rinse
      and (2) Chlorhexidine 0.12% rinse. Subjects will be randomized to one of two treatment groups
      at the time of implant surgery. An alternating 1:1 randomization scheme will be used, with
      the first patient receiving Chlorhexidine, the second patient receiving PeriActive, the third
      patient receiving Chlorhexidine and so forth.

      Implant surgery will require an incision and tissue reflection. Implant(s) will be placed at
      bone level (+/- 2 mm). The abutment placed will be transgingival at least 2 mm above soft
      tissue level. Tissues will be sutured with 6-0 ePTFE (Goretex) sutures, as needed.
      Antibiotics will be prescribed for 7 days following surgery. In addition, at the end of the
      surgical visit, the patient will be issued two bottles of the assigned rinse which will be
      used twice each day.

      Details of Study Visits Screening/Visit 1 - Day 0 Following signing of informed consent form,
      adult male and female subjects aged ≥18 years will be screened for study eligibility by
      assessment of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Screening procedures will include collection
      of demographic data and medical history. Eligible subjects will then undergo implant surgery,
      and relevant indices will be measured. Subjects will then be instructed in how to rinse with
      the relevant oral rinse and be given two bottles for the remainder of the study.

      Visits 2 and 3 - 2 and 4 weeks (± 3 days) post-surgery, respectively At visit 2, sutures will
      be removed and a light curetting of the sites (as needed) will be performed, followed by
      evaluation for Gingival Index (GI; modified for incision), Plaque Index (PI) and compliance
      with protocol. At visit 3, only clinical indices and compliance with protocol with be
      evaluated.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects must be adult males or females over the age of 18 years.

          2. Subjects must be able and willing to follow study procedures and instructions.

          3. Subjects must present with the need for implant surgery that would necessitate
             surgical incision (flap elevation) and transgingival implant healing cap, be available
             for follow-up visits and be able to follow rinse protocol instructions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who exhibit gross oral pathology and severe gingival inflammation at the time
             of surgery at the projected surgical site.

          2. Subjects chronically treated (i.e., ≥ two weeks) with anti-inflammatory medications
             (steroids or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) or any other medications known to
             affect gingival tissue status (e.g., phenytoin, cyclosporine) within one month of the
             screening examination. Prophylactic use of aspirin ( 81 mg daily) and Plavix when used
             for cardiovascular indications will be permitted (a note should be inserted into
             patient's documentation) and any therapeutic treatment modifications will be under the
             jurisdiction of the treating dentist. All other medications for chronic medical
             conditions should be initiated at least three months prior to enrollment.

          3. Subjects with active infectious diseases such as hepatitis, human immunodeficiency
             virus (HIV) or tuberculosis

          4. Subjects with Types I or II diabetes, thyroid disease or cancer chemotherapy
