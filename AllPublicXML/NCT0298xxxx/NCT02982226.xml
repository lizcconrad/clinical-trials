  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate both the safety and efficacy of the ReNu™
      injection on pain and inflammation in subjects diagnosed with plantar fasciitis as compared
      to a Corticosteroid Injection which is considered standard of care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a two (2) arm evaluation in 150 subjects with plantar fasciitis. Patients will be
      treated with ReNu™(study treatment) or Corticosteroids (control).

      At each follow-up visit, concomitant medications and adverse events shall be collected from
      each subject, and each subject shall complete following questionnaires:

        -  AOFAS Ankle-Hindfoot Score (AOFAS-AHS)

        -  Visual Analog Score (VAS)

        -  Single Answer Numeric Evaluation (SANE)

        -  Subject Satisfaction Score (at the 6 Month Follow Ups ONLY)

      The subjects will be assessed at Baseline (pre-injection) using these scales and again at all
      subsequent study follow-up visits.
