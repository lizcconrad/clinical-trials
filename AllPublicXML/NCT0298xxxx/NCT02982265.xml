    <textblock>
      Pre-eclampsia is a heterogeneous multisystem disorder that complicates 2-8% of pregnancies
      and remains a leading cause of maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity.

      Pre-eclampsia is defined as new onset of hypertension (defined as a diastolic blood pressure
      ≥ 90 mm Hg and a systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg on at least two different recordings
      taken at least 4-6 h apart and less than 7 days apart, using an appropriate cuff) and
      substantial proteinuria (defined as excretion of protein ≥300 mg in 24 h or a protein
      concentration ≥ 300 mg/L or ≥ &quot;1 +&quot; on dipstick in at least two random urine samples taken at
      least 4-6 h apart but no more than 7 days apart) at or after 20 weeks of gestation.

      Pre-eclampsia only occurs in the presence of placenta and is resolved by delivery of the
      same. However, the underlying causes of the disease remain largely unknown.

    <textblock>
      Poor placentation is considered a powerful predisposing factor for pre-eclampsia. Recently,
      it has been suggested that the occurrence of pre-eclampsia requires a combination of an
      excessive or atypical maternal immune response to the trophoblast and/or exaggerated
      endothelial activation as well as a generalised hyper-inflammatory state resulting in
      endothelial dysfunction and associated increased vascular reactivity. Any factors (maternal
      and paternal constitutional, genetic and environmental risk factors) that enhance these
      responses would predispose to pre-eclampsia.

      The list of predisposing factors includes: extremes of maternal age, black race, previous
      history of pre-eclampsia, family history of pre-eclampsia, multifetal gestation, ≥ 10 years
      from previous pregnancy, limited sperm exposure, first paternity, pregnancies after donor
      insemination (assisted reproductive technology), oocyte donation or embryo donation, chronic
      hypertension or renal disease, rheumatic disease, maternal low birth weight, obesity and
      insulin resistance, pre-gestational diabetes mellitus, increased testosterone, increased
      homocysteine concentration, atherosclerosis (increased triglycerides and LDL, decreased HDL),
      maternal infections, pre-existing thrombophilia, maternal susceptibility genes and hydropic
      degeneration of placenta. Finally, smoking seems to be inversely correlated with
      pre-eclampsia.

      Pre-eclampsia can result in a fetal syndrome characterized by fetal growth restriction,
      reduced amniotic fluid, abnormal oxygenation, fetal demise and preterm birth. Moreover, women
      with pre-eclampsia are at increased risk for abruptio placentae, disseminated
      coagulopathy/HELLP syndrome, pulmonary oedema, acute renal failure, eclampsia, cerebral
      haemorrhage, death and cardiovascular or renal disease.

      Early prediction of pre-eclampsia would allow for close surveillance and preventive
      strategies
