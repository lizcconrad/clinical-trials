  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although several studies have considered the relationship between infertility and semen thiol
      compounds levels, no study on the effects of asthenospermia treatments such as oral zinc
      supplementation on thiol related enzymes activity which are important in fertility of the
      individual has been reported.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study was conducted to study the effect of zinc supplementation on the
      quantitative and qualitative characteristics of semen along with reduced thiol, oxidized
      thiol and thiol related enzymes in the seminal plasma of asthenospermic patients.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The presence of asthenozoospermia in the semen sample.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The absence of endocrinopathy, varicocele, and female factor infertility. Smokers and
             alcoholic men were excluded from the study because of their recognized high seminal
             ROS levels and decreased antioxidant levels.
