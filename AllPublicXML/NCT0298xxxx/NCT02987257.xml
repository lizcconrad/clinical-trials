    <textblock>
      Defining the true effect of adjunctive therapy for Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and Toxic
      Epidermal Necrolysis (SJS/TEN) on time to full healing, mortality, and long-term outcomes
      represents a critical need in the field of dermatology and burn surgery. Collaborating with
      20 sites from across North America we will determine if cyclosporine or etanercept therapy
      improves SJS/TEN short outcomes above supportive care alone The scientific premise for this
      study is that case series, cohorts, and small non-randomized studies have not supported the
      use of non-pulsed corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), while showing the
      promise of cyclosporine and etanercept in reducing the time to complete re-epithelialization.
      By indirect comparison, etanercept appears to be superior in small studies, however none of
      the studies have evaluated these therapies in a blinded and randomized trial. Additionally,
      we will uncover the underlying process of SJS/TEN through the analysis of skin samples,
      blood, blister fluid and immune cells to study the immune system and changes in gene
      expression with and without drug therapy. This will improve the treatment of patients in the
      future.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aim 1: Establish the most effective therapy for SJS/TEN. A multi-centered, double-blind
      randomized control trial including 20 sites with an enrollment of 267 patients over 4 years
      will be undertaken to understand which of supportive care, cyclosporine or etanercept causes
      the greatest reduction in time to complete re-epithelialization. Assessment of the primary
      outcome will occur using a previously validated method consisting of two independent
      assessors and digital photograph analysis. Secondary outcomes will include all-cause
      mortality, time to cessation of disease progression, adverse effects related to a study
      medication, secondary chronic mucocutaneous morbidity, and hospital length of stay. Subgroup
      analysis will be performed to examine differences for treatment between gender, SCORTEN,
      percent body surface area (%BSA) and drug half-life.

      Aim 2: Enhance our understanding of genetic and biomarker predictors in SJS/TEN. Genome
      sequencing and transcriptome profiling will be used to evaluate changes in expression over
      time within each treatment arm to identify involved genes and responses to treatment. Changes
      over the course of hospitalization and at the follow-up visit will be tested. Additionally,
      high resolution HLA and Mega chip typing will be performed on individuals with a clear drug
      cause according to the Algorithm of Drug Causality for Epidermal Necrolysis (ALDEN) Score.
      These will be matched to drug tolerant controls. Third, measurement of granulysin will occur
      at presentation and serial time points to establish its role as a predictive biomarker in
      disease prognosis and response to treatment.

      Aim 3: To gain insights into the immunopathogenesis of SJS/TEN. We will collect blister
      fluid, skin biopsies and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) during the acute SJS/TEN
      reaction before treatment, following completion of treatment (PBMCs), and on follow-up from
      recovery PBMCs. This will analyze T-cell changes and gene expression as it relates to the
      disease and treatment. We expect that this will direct therapy for the future.

        Clinical Criteria

          1. Erythematous to dusky macules that show evidence of coalescing AND/OR denuding skin or
             blistering in a predominantly truncal distribution. Nikolsky sign (sloughing with
             direct lateral pressure on non-blistered, but involved, skin) is considered to be a
             supportive feature.

          2. Mucous membrane involvement

          3. Prodromal symptoms including fever, myalgia, and headache

          4. Increasing number of lesions

          5. History of a new medication

        To continue within the study, the following pathologic criteria are required:

          1. Confirmation of interface dermatitis +/- necrotic keratinocytes +/- eosinophils

          2. Negative direct immunofluorescence for features that alter the diagnosis

        Exclusion Criteria:

             evaluation not in keeping with SJS/TEN.

          2. Patients who received 2 or more concomitant study medications to specifically treat
             SJS/TEN would be removed to avoid confounding the outcome measures for response to a
             specific therapy.

          3. Non-dialysis renal insufficiency [creatinine &gt;200 mmol/l (2.3 mg/dl)]
