  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose/aim of this study is to assess the safety and antibody response to vaccination
      with a booster dose of Menveo given 4-6 years after primary MenACWY vaccination and to assess
      the safety and antibody response to a single dose of Menveo given to vaccine-naïve subjects
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 3b, controlled, open-label, multi-center study to evaluate safety and
      immunogenicity of Menveo after a single vaccination in healthy individuals who were
      vaccinated with Menveo or Menactra 4 to 6 years before and in vaccine-naive individuals.
      Vaccine-naive subjects: subjects who have not received any meningococcal vaccine prior to
      participation to this clinical trial.

      Subjects will be randomised into one of the two different blood draw schedules according to a
      1:1 ratio.

        -  Blood draws at Day 1, Day 4 and Day 29

        -  Blood draws at Day 1, Day 6 and Day 29
