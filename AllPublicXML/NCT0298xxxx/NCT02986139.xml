      Assess the injection site pain associated with a New Etanercept formulation in adult subjects
      with RA or PsA

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 3b, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 2-period, 2-sequence crossover
      study in subjects with RA or PsA who are naive to etanercept. The study will evaluate
      injection site pain associated with the commercial formulation of etanercept and the new
      formulation of etanercept immediately after injection of each formulation.The study will
      consist of a screening period of up to 14 days, a 2 week treatment period with a 30 day post
      treatment safety follow up. Each dose will follow the recommended label dosing for subjects
      with RA and PsA: 50 mg weekly (scheduled approximately 7 days apart).
