    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to assess comparative bioavailability of two test
      formulations of Gliclazide 120 mg Modified Release tablets (120 mg gliclazide per modified
      release tablet) Manufactured By Indeus Life Sciences Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai India (An Affiliate Of
      Disphar International B.V., The Netherlands) Relative To DIAMICRON MR® 60 mg 2 × (60 mg
      gliclazide per modified release tablet) Of Les Laboratories Servier Industrie, France in 15
      healthy adult subjects under fasting conditions. The second aim is to asses the safety of
      subjects and to determine other pharmacokinetic data.
