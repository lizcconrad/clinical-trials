  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will perform a diagnostic accuracy study comparing tracheal breath sound
      recordings in awake individuals to the STOP-Bang screening questionnaire, using the
      apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) score determined by polysomnography as the gold standard.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a breathing disorder with numerous health effects including
      a greater risk of peri-operative anesthetic complications. Numerous screening tools exist but
      are not without limitations. Diagnostic overnight sleep studies are resource-intensive and
      difficult to obtain in the short time period between pre-operative clinic assessment and the
      day of surgery.

      This project aims to test the diagnostic performance of a new screening technology,
      Awake-OSA, for screening of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). &quot;Awake-OSA&quot; uses a small external
      microphone placed on the neck, to record and analyze tracheal breath sounds at the bedside
      while the patient is awake.

      Using polysomnography (PSG) as a gold standard, the investigators will compare Awake-OSA
      (breath sound recording) and the STOP-Bang screening questionnaire in their ability to
      accurately identify patients with OSA, as well as classify OSA in terms of severity.

      Early, point-of-care diagnosis has the potential to provide a low-cost, convenient
      alternative to traditional screening questionnaires and enable more selective use of PSG. Our
      goal is to improve peri-operative patient safety while improving use of resources and
      streamlining patient care.
