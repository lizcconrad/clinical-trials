      The goal of this project is to examine the physiological mechanisms that contribute to
      improvements of glucose homeostasis in type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) following gastric bypass
      Roux-en-Y bariatric surgery (GBP). The central hypotheses are: 1) that surgical changes in
      the anatomy of nutrient absorption achieved by GBP change incretin hormone secretion which in
      turn improves pancreatic islet function; and 2) that improvement in insulin secretion induced
      by the changes in incretin function, together with improvement in insulin resistance induced
      by weight loss, normalize glucose homeostasis in type 2 DM.

      Funds are not available to pay for the surgery for patients, only to address research
      questions.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are at least 18 years of age and undergo bariatric surgery by a LABS
             certified surgeon.

          -  Enrollment in LABS-1 or LABS-2.

          -  Documented type 2 diabetes (fasting plasma glucose greater than 125 mg/dl) that is
             treated with lifestyle efforts (drug na√Øve) or taking acceptable oral medications (see
             appendix) with a HgA1c less than or equal to 8.5% and a fasting blood glucose less
             than or equal to 180 mg/dL. This will be one group.

          -  Non-diabetic (ND) with normal values for fasting glucose and HbA1c. This will be the
             second group.

          -  Adequate IV access.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Informed consent not obtained.

          -  Patient with diabetes with an HbA1c greater than 8.5% or a fasting blood glucose
             greater than 180 mg/dL.

          -  Creatinine greater than 1.7.

          -  Unlikely to comply with the 6 month follow-up (post-surgical) protocol (i.e.
             geographically inaccessible for study visits) or unable to communicate with local
             study staff.

          -  Use of unacceptable diabetic medications (see appendix) at baseline (see appendix).
