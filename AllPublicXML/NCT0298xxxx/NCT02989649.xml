    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to observe alogliptin and alogliptin fixed-dose combinations
      (FDCs) utilization patterns, as well as clinical response to treatment with alogliptin or
      alogliptin FDCs, in standard clinical practice.

      The drug being studied in this study is called alogliptin and alogliptin FDCs. Alogliptin and
      alogliptin FDCs is being researched to treat people who have diabetes mellitus type 2. This
      study will look at the glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level dynamics in participants with
      diabetes mellitus type 2.

      The study will enroll approximately 1199 patients. Alogliptin and alogliptin FDCs will be
      prescribed by the physician as part of participants' T2DM treatment program (independent of
      participation in this study).

      This multi-center study will be conducted in China and Hong Kong. The overall duration of
      study for observation will be approximately 6 months, or up to loss to follow-up or death,
      whichever occurs first. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic as per regular
      doctor's appointments.

    <description>An ADR is defined as any response to a medicinal product that is noxious and unintended and that occurs at doses normally used in humans for the prophylaxis, diagnosis, or therapy of diseases or for the restoration, correction, or modification of physiological function. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence or effect that at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is medically important due to other reasons than the above mentioned criteria. Adverse events such as pancreatitis, hepatic disorders, and hypersensitivity reactions (including angioedema, anaphylaxis, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome) will be considered as AESI.</description>
