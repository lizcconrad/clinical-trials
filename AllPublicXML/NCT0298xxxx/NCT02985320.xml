    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of sIPVs of different dosages in adults,
      children and infants in a phase I open-label study, and then assess its immunogenicity and
      safety in healthy infants between 60 and 90 days old in a phase II blind, randomized, and
      controlled study.

    <textblock>
      This study is a combination of phases I and II. Phase I study is open-label, and only collect
      safety information of the investigational sIPVs in adults, children and infants. Phase II
      study is double-blind, randomized, controlled study of the immunogenicity and safety of the
      investigational vaccines and two other commercialized inactivated poliovirus vaccines in
      healthy infants.
