  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose with this investigation is to further our knowledge about cognitive
      behavioral therapy (CBT) for insomnia by examining treatment components, mediators, and
      moderators. The first aim that will be addressed is to explore the efficacy of the CBT
      components with a dismantling-treatment strategy. Two active CBT interventions, intended to
      define its components - cognitive therapy and behavior therapy - will be compared with one
      another as well as with a waitlist condition on a broad range of outcomes at five to nine
      assessment points depending on the measures. The design will thus enable us to examine what
      CBT component or components are necessary, sufficient and facilitative of therapeutic change.
      The second aim that will be explored is to investigate what processes occur in CBT that may
      contribute to treatment outcome with a treatment-mediator strategy. To examine mediators for
      CBT, the following mediators will be assessed; Anxiety and Preoccupation about sleep
      Questionnaire (APSQ), Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep (DBAS), Sleep
      Associated Monitoring Index (SAMI), Sleep-Related Behavior Questionnaire (SRBQ), time in bed,
      napping, bedtime variability, and rise time variability. The hypothesis is that cognitive
      processes will mediate cognitive therapy outcomes, and that behavioral factors will have a
      mediating role for behavior therapy improvements. The third aim that will be addressed is to
      examine what patient characteristics does CBT depend on to be effective with a
      treatment-moderator strategy. To investigate moderators for CBT, the following moderators
      will be assessed; age, gender, occupational status, level of education, initial insomnia
      severity, dysfunction, medication use, chronic pain, psychiatric co-morbidity, medical
      co-morbidity, behavioral and cognitive processes used as mediators will also be employed as
      moderators.

             Structured Interview for Sleep Disorders (DSISD): sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome,
             periodic limb movement disorder, circadian rhythm disorder, and parasomnias.
