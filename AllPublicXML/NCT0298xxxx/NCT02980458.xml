  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study will be conducted in order to compare the bioavailability of the generic
      Test product (Deferiprone 500 Lipomed tablets, Lipomed AG, Switzerland) with a marketed
      Reference product (Ferriprox® film-coated tablets, Apotex Europe B.V., Germany) both
      containing 500 mg deferiprone. For this issue the pharmacokinetics will be characterised
      after single dose administration of each one tablet.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be performed in an open-label, randomised (order of treatments), single dose,
      2 period cross-over design with a wash out phase of at least three treatment free days
      between both administrations. Sample collection will be performed over eight hours after
      fasted administration. This time is considered adequate for the determination of plasma
      concentration vs. time profiles long enough for reliable estimation of the extent of
      absorption, i.e. the AUC derived from measurements is expected to cover at least 80% of the
      AUC extrapolated to infinity for deferiprone
