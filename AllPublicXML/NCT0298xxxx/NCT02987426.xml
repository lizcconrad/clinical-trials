  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mindfulness-based interventions have gained increasing popularity in recent years as
      effective treatment for mental illness. Mindfulness is defined as paying attention in a
      particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgmentally: &quot;Being&quot;, rather than
      &quot;Doing&quot;. Such mental states can improve emotional regulation through frontal cortex
      inhibition of otherwise dysregulated subcortical emotion-related circuits. Formal mindfulness
      approaches such as mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) and mindfulness-based stress
      reduction, have been highly effective in a broad range of psychiatric disorders.

      Mindfulness-oriented interventions, are potentially useful in acute psychiatric
      hospitalizations, since they can be delivered as group therapies and are be both
      cost-effective and scalable. However, such interventions have rarely been provided to
      patients during psychiatric hospitalizations, where patients are treated for a variety of
      psychiatric diagnoses, and may have unpredictable lengths of stay. Additionally, there had
      been concerns that longer traditional mindfulness based interventions (e.g. 30 minute silent
      meditation) may exacerbate acute psychosis. However, strong evidence suggests that patients
      with psychotic symptoms appear to be largely unaffected by shorter interventions. Similarly,
      MBCT have been helpful to treat other major reasons for hospitalization such as: bipolar
      disorder, severe anxiety, substance use disorders, and major depressive disorder.

      Few studies have examined mindfulness-oriented treatments in inpatient settings, including
      two small studies involving mindfulness groups on an acute psychiatric inpatient ward (n&lt;10)
      . Another study (n=23) offered inpatients with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder
      mindfulness-based activities. All studies concluded that mindfulness-oriented approaches in
      inpatient settings were feasible, although these needed to be brief interventions, given the
      risks and lack of efficacy of longer MBI (e.g. 40-minute silent meditation) in severe mental
      illness.

      A cross-sectional study conducted by our team (n=40) demonstrated that brief group
      mindfulness-oriented lasting 10 minutes were very well tolerated by 92.5% of psychiatric
      inpatients. The remaining 7.5% of patients left the session before 10-minutes, but had no
      symptomatic exacerbations or adverse effects. Moreover, the 50% of patients self- reported
      improvements in general well-being and mood after a single 10-minute session. Having been
      recently admitted to the psychiatric inpatient or having a diagnosis of acute psychosis (75%
      of inpatients) did not affect patients' capacity to tolerate and benefit from the
      intervention. In this inpatient psychiatric population, we found that mindfulness-oriented
      interventions that were brief and involved physical movement (e.g. seated Tai Chi) were
      better enjoyed compared to other interventions.

      Despite the growing literature in this field, data is needed on the effectiveness and health
      service implications of brief group mindfulness-oriented interventions in inpatient
      psychiatry settings. Outcome studies conducted so far cannot be interpreted reliably due to
      methodological flaws, including inadequate control groups, very small sample sizes (often
      n&lt;10), and lack of randomization. In Canada, the direct cost of treatment for mental illness
      is estimated as 42.3 billion. Much of these costs are driven by psychiatric admissions. Thus,
      if brief mindfulness-oriented interventions are effective at lowering psychiatric symptom
      severity and shortening psychiatric hospitalizations, this could lead to significant
      cost-savings.
