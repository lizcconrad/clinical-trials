  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous research is equivocal concerning if high intensity interval training is viewed as
      more aversive versus moderate exercise. Our data in active men and women showed that interval
      training is viewed as more enjoyable than higher volume moderate exercise.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twelve men and women who were habitually active initially performed ramp exercise on a cycle
      ergometer to assess maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) and peak power output (PPO), which was
      used to determine workload for the subsequent 2 bouts. They returned at least 48 h later at
      the same time of day to complete high intensity interval training (HIIT consisting of
      repeated 1 min bouts at 85 %PPO) or moderate intensity continuous training (MICT consisting
      of 25 min at 40 %PPO). During exercise, heart rate, oxygen uptake, perceived exertion,
      pleasure:displeasure, and blood lactate concentration were continuously assessed. Ten minutes
      post-exercise, physical activity enjoyment was measured. Data showed that despite higher
      oxygen uptake, heart rate, blood lactate concentration, and perceived exertion in HIIT,
      enjoyment was higher in HIIT versus MICT.
