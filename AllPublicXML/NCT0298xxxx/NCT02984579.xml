      This is a multi-center, blinded study to determine the performance of the YD Diagnostic
      Corporation (YD) REBA MTB-MDR® and Hain Genotype MTBDRplus V2 kit in a total of 600 clinical
      isolates and 900 residual sputum samples from patients with symptoms of pulmonary TB (PTB)
      and at risk of drug resistance. All testing was done on stored, de-identified leftover
      samples.

      The study involved three World Health Organization (WHO) Supranational Reference Laboratories
      with well-characterized strain collections and access to sputum samples with significant
      rates of drug resistance.

    <description>Conducted on stored, de-identified leftover samples. A line probe assay designed for detection of Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). The REBA MTB-MDR® assay is a qualitative in vitro test for the identification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) complex and its susceptibility to rifampin and isoniazid from cultured samples and smear positive specimens.</description>

    <description>Conducted on stored, de-identified leftover samples. There is only one Line Probe Assay for molecular MTB drug resistance globally available, the GenoType® MTBDRplus V.1 from Hain Lifescience. This assay includes rpoB gene probes for Rifampin (RIF) resistance, katG gene probes for high level Isoniazid (INH) resistance, and inhA gene probes for determination of low level INH resistance</description>

        The study consisted of two phases. In phase 1, each site was sent a different set of 200
        clinical isolates from the Research and Training in Tropical Diseases and Institute for
        Tropical Medicine collections (ITM).

        In phase 2, samples from 274 patients recruited between Azerbaijan and Moldova were tested
        in Germany, while samples from 214 (locally-recruited) patients were tested in South
        Africa.
