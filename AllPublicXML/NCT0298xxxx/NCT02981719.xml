    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to observe the survival status, recurrence and death time of
      patients with pancreatic cancer treated by chemotherapy combined with IRE. The survival and
      overall survival of the patients were evaluated respectively.

      Irreversible electroporation (Irreversible Electroporation IRE) ablation as a new minimally
      invasive therapy in inhibiting tumor growth, improve survival rate and achieved remarkable
      results, and chemotherapy as traditional treatment methods,at the same time with adjuvant
      chemotherapy in ablation of irreversible electroporation can improve chemotherapy perforation
      area to the spread of cancer cells in reversibility, and has selectivity to tumor cells,
      avoiding normal tissue damage. The combination of the two aims to improve the quality of life
      and prolong the survival time. The aim of this study was to observe the survival status,
      recurrence and death time of patients with pancreatic cancer treated by chemotherapy combined
      with IRE. The survival and overall survival of the patients were evaluated respectively.
