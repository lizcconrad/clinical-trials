  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research device study is to learn more about the autonomic nervous
      system. This system uses nerves to send information from the brain to the rest of the body by
      electrical signaling and has two divisions, the sympathetic and the parasympathetic branches.
      It has been thought that electrical stimulation devices could be used to restore balance to
      the nervous system. Because most of the imbalance seems to happen due to too much sympathetic
      activity, the investigator plans to focus on the parasympathetic branch. Specifically, the
      investigator hopes to restore balance by targeting the vagus nerve, which is the main
      communicator of the parasympathetic branch. The study will examine whether the investigator
      can decrease sympathetic activity and chronic inflammation by increasing parasympathetic
      activity. This is a device study that will examine the use of non-invasive vagal nerve
      stimulation to attenuate inflammatory stress and sympathetic hyperactivity in persons with
      Spinal Cord Injury and Non-Disabled Controls.
