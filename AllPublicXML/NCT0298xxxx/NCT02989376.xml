    <intervention_name>After detection of occluded vessels by vascular imaging using carotid duplex ultrasound, digital subtraction angiography is immediately performed before acute endovascular treatment.</intervention_name>
    <description>When the ratio of the end diastolic velocity in the common carotid arteries is greater than 1.4 or the diastolic flow in the internal carotid artery is not detected by vascular imaging using carotid duplex ultrasound, digital subtraction angiography is immediately performed before acute endovascular treatment. If vessel occlusion is not detected by carotid duplex ultrasound, additional vascular imaging including MR angiography or CT angiography is considered.</description>
