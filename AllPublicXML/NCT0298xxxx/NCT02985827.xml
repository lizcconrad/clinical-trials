      The purpose of the study is to analyze the sensation to eye drops containing menthol in
      people with healthy eyes and in people with dry eyes. This study also examines the
      temperature of your eye using an Infrared Camera.

      Dry eye disease (DED) has been defined as a multifactorial disease of the tears and ocular
      surface that results in symptoms of discomfort, visual disturbance, and tear film instability
      with potential damage to the ocular surface. It is accompanied by increased osmolarity of the
      tear film and inflammation of the ocular surface1. An estimated 25 million Americans are
      reported to have dry eye disease (DED)2, which is a number that will only increase with the
      U.S. aging population3. The only treatment currently available in the U.S. targets
      inflammation on the ocular surface. Because dry eye is a complicated disease that encompasses
      many conditions of the eye, diversified ways to treating the disease are necessary. Some
      recent studies suggests that some Dry Eye symptoms are caused by corneal cold thermoreceptors
      (such as TRPM8) chronically firing at below-normal thresholds. It thus logically follows that
      dry eye patients could be distinguished from normal patients by possessing higher symptom
      responses secondary to topical application of menthol, a potent agonist of TRPM8. If dry eye
      patients indeed have lower threshold firing of TRPM8, agonizing TRPM8 with menthol will
      elicit a more severe symptom response, given equal concentrations across populations.

      To fully elucidate this relationship between TRPM8 agonists, sensation, and tear film
      cooling, two dry eye populations will be tested - one population which has exhibited symptom
      response to a previous dry eye agent, and one population with no symptom response to the same
      agent.

          1. Be male or female of any race, at least 18 years of age at Visit 1.

          2. Have provided verbal and written informed consent.

          3. Have a best corrected visual acuity of +0.70 logMAR or better in both eyes at Visit 1,
             as assessed by Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart.

          4. Qualify for exactly one of the three cohorts.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Have any contraindications to the use of Systane® Ultra, or Rohto® Hyrda, or its
             components (including Menthol).

          2. Have a known allergy to the study medications or their components.

          3. Have any clinically significant slit lamp findings at Visit 1, including active
             blepharitis, meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD), lid margin inflammation or ocular
             allergies that requires therapeutic treatment and/or, in the opinion of the
             investigator, may interfere with the study parameters.

          4. Be diagnosed with an ongoing ocular infection (bacterial, viral or fungal), or active
             ocular inflammation (e.g., follicular conjunctivitis) at Visit 1.

          5. Have a history of laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) surgery in either eye.

          6. Have had any ocular surgical procedure within 12 months prior to Visit 1.

          7. Have used contact lenses within 30 days prior to Visit 1 and for the duration of the

             put the patient at significant risk, may confound the study results, or may interfere
             significantly with the patients' participation in the study.

         12. Be currently enrolled in an investigational drug or device study or have used an
