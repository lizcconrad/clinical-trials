  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prior study in a tightly controlled clinical research environment found individuals with an
      alcohol use disorder (AUD) benefited more from inpatient (IP) than outpatient (OP) care, if
      they presented with high alcohol involvement and/or low cognitive functioning. This study
      sought to: (a) validate and extend these findings within the uncontrolled environment of a
      community-based treatment center, and (b) test whether inpatients had fewer days of
      involuntary abstinence (e.g., incarcerations) relative to outpatients. Based on their need
      for inpatient treatment, using prior cut-points for alcohol involvement and cognitive
      functioning, participants were randomly assigned within inpatient need group (No Need for IP;
      Needs IP) to either 21-days of inpatient substance misuse treatment or 21-days of outpatient
      treatment, all followed by 6 months of continuing outpatient care. Follow-up were conducted
      an 90-day intervals across 18 months.
