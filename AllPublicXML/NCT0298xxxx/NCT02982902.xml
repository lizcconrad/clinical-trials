  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a specific type of cell-based immunotherapy,
      using T-cells from a donor that are specific against cytomegalovirus (CMV) is feasible to
      treat infections by CMV.

      Adoptive T-cell therapy is an investigational (experimental) therapy that works by using the
      blood of a donor and selecting the T-cells that can respond against a specific infectious
      entity. These selected T-cells are then infused to the patient, to try to give the immune
      system the ability to fight the infection. Adoptive T-cell therapy is experimental because it
      is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the feasibility of the treatment of
      opportunistic cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections after hematopoietic stem cell transplant
      (HSCT) with virus-specific, antigen-selected T-cells, selected using the CliniMACS prodigy
      system.

      Secondary Objective(s)

        -  To describe the safety profile of the infusion of CMV- specific, antigen selected
           T-cells.

        -  To describe the toxicities related to infusion of CMV- specific, antigen selected
           T-cells.

        -  To describe the rate of eradication of opportunistic CMV infections after HSCT and and
           treatment with CMV-specific, antigen-selected T-cells using the CliniMACS Prodigy
           System.

      This feasibility study will include a single treatment cohort.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Eradication rate of opportunistic CMV infections</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 100 days after transplant</time_frame>
    <description>The eradication rate will be the disappearance of opportunistic CMV infections with the use of CMV-specific, antigen-selected T cells using the CliniMACS Prodigy System over the total number CMV infections.</description>
