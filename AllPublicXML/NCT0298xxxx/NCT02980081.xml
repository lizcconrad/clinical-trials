      There are only few recognized indications for the realization of plain abdominal X-rays in
      the emergency departement.

      The objective of this study is to explore the reasons for abdominal plain X-rays prescription
      in the Emergency departments (EDs) of two hospitals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All abdominal plain x-rays prescription will be reviewed in order to identify reasons for
      prescribing this exam. The indications will be compared to international guidelines in order
      to identify whether abdominal plain x-rays are overprescribed. Reasons for overprescription
      will be identify by chart review.
