  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of USI has eased practical application of interventional procedures, and reduced
      complications and procedure durations. For vascular interventions with ultrasound imaging,
      short- or long-section imaging of vascular structures is performed. Both techniques have
      their own advantages and disadvantages.

      This study aims to compare the success rates of femoral artery catheterization using both
      imaging techniques.

      The research will include newborns undergoing open heart surgery and patients requiring
      arterial monitoring in the neonatal intensive care unit. Eighty patients requiring femoral
      artery cannulation will be randomized with the closed envelope method and separated into two
      groups as USI with the in-plane technique (Group A) and USI with the out-of-plane technique
      (Group B). The intervention will be performed by a single experienced individual. The
      preparation duration, puncture duration, number of punctures, number of unsuccessful arterial
      punctures, development of hematoma and other complications will be recorded and the groups
      will be compared. If there are 3 unsuccessful attempts the procedure will be ended.1.
      Patients undergoing KVC surgery and patients requiring arterial catheterization in the
      neonatal intensive care unit (cases with pulmonary disease, electrolyte disorders, metabolic
      disease, or sepsis requiring frequent blood sampling) EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR STUDY VOLUNTEERS

        1. Local infection

        2. Coagulopathy CLINICAL END-POINTS (MEASURED VARIABLES)

      1. Distance of femoral artery to skin, distance of femoral artery to inguinal ligament,
      femoral artery diameter, femoral artery and vein location properties 2. Preparation duration,
      number of punctures, complications developing during the procedure
