    <textblock>
      The purpose of the BEAM study is to compare the effects of a low-carbohydrate diet and a
      lowfat diet for adults with mild memory loss and adults with pre-diabetes. The data collected
      will help determine changes in cognitive function, brain structure and function, and levels
      of certain proteins and hormones in body fluids.

      Participants will be enrolled into 1 of 3 study groups. Group 1 will include healthy
      volunteers with no apparent memory problems, memory complaints or family history of
      Alzheimer's disease or dementia. This group will complete cognitive assessments, blood and
      stool sample collection, neuroimaging, and lumbar puncture at week 0 only. Group 1 will NOT
      take part in the diet study.

      Group 2 will have pre-diabetes, but no apparent memory problems that can be observed during
      cognitive testing. Group 2 will complete an 18-week diet study, with follow-up assessment 6
      weeks after final diet completion. Throughout the study the following will also be completed;
      cognitive assessments, blood and stool sample collection, neuroimaging, and lumbar puncture.

      Group 3 will have mild memory problems that are observed during cognitive testing. Group 3
      will complete an 18-week diet study, with follow-up assessment 6 weeks after diet final
      completion. Throughout the study the following will also be completed; cognitive assessments,
      blood and stool sample collection, neuroimaging, and lumbar puncture.

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The low-carbohydrate diet will consist of a meal plan of less than 20 grams of carbohydrates per day to be consumed over 6 weeks. Foods that provide high levels of healthy fats (preferably low in saturated fats) will be generously included in the diet plan. Various lean meats, fish, and nutrient rich foods that meet the requirement of less than 20 grams total carbohydrates per day will be included in the meal plans. Carbohydrates will be expected to make up less than 10% of total caloric intake. Participants in the low-carbohydrate diet group will receive a supply of extra virgin olive oil at study visits to incorporate into their individualized meal plans.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The low-fat diet will consist of a low-fat, higher-carbohydrate meal plan to be consumed over 6 weeks. Participants will be encouraged to limit their amount of fat intake to less than 40 grams per day, while eating plentiful fruits, vegetables, and carbohydrates containing adequate fiber. Various lean meats and other sources of protein will be included in the diet plan. Carbohydrates will be expected to make up 50-60% of total caloric intake.</description>
