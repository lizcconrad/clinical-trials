  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single arm, multi-site phase Ib/II clinical trial of standard doses of High
      Dose Interleukin-2 (HD IL2) (600,000 IU/kg/dose intravenously during two 5-day cycles 9 days
      apart) in IL-2 eligible clear cell metastatic RCC (Renal Cell Carcinoma) subjects in
      combination with Nivolumab.

      Investigators hypothesize that concurrent PD-1 inhibition synergistically enhances the
      anti-tumor immune response to HD IL-2 in metastatic clear cell RCC. Investigators postulate
      that the combination of the two therapies would result in an increase in the overall response
      rate, complete response rate, and improved survival outcomes compared to either of the
      individual therapies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must have a histologic diagnosis of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (pure or
             mixed) with radiologic or histologic or cytologic evidence of metastatic disease.

          -  Subjects may have received up to 2 prior lines of systemic therapy (excluding any
             neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy) including anti-VEGF or VEGFR inhibitor (e.g. sorafenib,
             pazopanib, sunitinib, bevacizumab, axitinib) or mTOR inhibitor (e.g. everolimus or
             temsirolimus) for metastatic disease.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years at the time of consent.

          -  ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status (an attempt to quantify
             cancer patients' general well-being and activities of daily life. The score ranges
             from 0 to 5 where 0 is asymptomatic and 5 is death.) of 0 or 1
