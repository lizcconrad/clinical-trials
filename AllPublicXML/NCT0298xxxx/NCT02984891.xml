  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Both intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) are standardly
      used and have been extensively studied separately to guide percutaneous coronary intervention
      and improve long-term outcomes. In this study, the investigators aim to directly compare
      high-definition IVUS images to OCT in the same patients to determine the differences between
      each modality as they relate to imaging coronary pathology, with the goal of determining
      which modality is most appropriate in particular clinical scenarios.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is an imaging modality that uses ultrasound waves to allow
      for detailed evaluation of coronary atherosclerotic plaques and the vascular response to
      coronary interventional devices to guide stent placement during percutaneous coronary
      intervention. Current conventional IVUS catheters emit ultrasound waves ranging from 20-40
      megahertz (mHz), and more recently released high-definition IVUS catheters emit sound waves
      at 60 mHz, allowing for better image quality, quantitative accuracy, and precision in
      measurements.

      Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an alternative imaging modality used for similar
      purposes as IVUS, using a single optical fiber that emits infrared light to image the
      coronary artery. OCT uses light in the infrared spectrum with a central wavelength between
      1,250 and 1,350 nm. Axial resolution with OCT is 10-20 microns, whereas it is typically
      100-200 microns with IVUS. Thus, OCT allows for better image resolution, but this comes at
      the expense of tissue penetration.

    <description>Procedure will be performed using the IVUS Kodama catheter is a hydrophilic-coated catheter that used high-fidelity ultrasound transmission to capture high-definition images of coronary artery anatomy. It uses ultrasound waves with a frequency of 40 or 60 MHz, as opposed to 20 MHz in conventional IVUS, to improve resolution while optimizing tissue penetration. It provides axial resolution of &lt; 40 microns and tissue penetration of 10 mm.</description>
