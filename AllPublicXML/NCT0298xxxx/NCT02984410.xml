  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OPSCC) arises in the soft palate, tonsils, base of
      tongue, pharyngeal wall, and the vallecula. Most of the patients with early stage OPSCC are
      usually cured. Treatment of early stage OPSCC can be successfully achieved with primary
      surgery including neck dissection, as indicated, or with definitive radiotherapy. The current
      standard treatment for OPSCC is therefore based on either surgery and/or radiotherapy, both
      associated with comparable, high tumor control rates but with different side effects profiles
      and technical constraints.

      In order to decrease the potential morbidity of surgery, transoral approaches have been
      developed within the last decades, including transoral robotic surgery (TORS), transoral
      laser microsurgery (TLM) or conventional transoral techniques. On the other hand, patients
      with head and neck cancer treated with IMRT experienced significant improvements in cause
      specific survival (CSS) compared with patients treated with non-IMRT techniques thus
      suggesting that IMRT may be beneficial in terms of patient's outcomes and toxicity profile.
      It is as yet unclear however, which one of the new techniques is superior to the other in
      terms of function preservation. Given that the functional outcome of most importance is
      swallowing function, the preservation of swallowing is thus of major importance.

      The main objective of the study is to assess and compare the patient-reported swallowing
      function over the first year after randomization to either IMRT or TOS among patients with
      early stage OPSCC.

      Eligible patients will be randomized 1 to 1 to radiotherapy (Arm 1) or surgery (Arm 2).

      ARM 1: Radiotherapy

      Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) with Simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) will be
      applied to all patients in this arm. PTV prescription to tumor and high risk areas will be
      delivered daily for 5 days per week to a total dose of 66-70Gy in 2 Gy/fraction over 6 weeks,
      elective/prophylactic mucosal and nodal areas will receive a total dose of 54.25- 54.45 Gy in
      33-35 fractions of 1.55-1.65 Gy over 6 weeks.

      ARM 2: Surgery

      Trans-oral surgery (any trans-oral approach such as trans-oral laser microsurgery
      conventional trans-oral surgery (only for OPC of the tonsil) or trans-oral robotic surgery)
      will be applied to all patients in this arm.

      A surgical margin is defined to be clear (R0), if found to be &gt;/=3mm in the final specimen
      (except deep margin for tonsillar resection, that is either R1 or R0), is defined to be
      close, if 1-&lt;3mm, and considered to be involved (R1), if &lt;1mm in the final specimen. Clearly
      defined marginal biopsies are required for each TOS-technique. Trans-oral re-resections are
      required in case of R1 or close-margin to convert the patient to an R0-status.Postoperative
      RT or chemo-RT will be given within 5-6 weeks of surgery in case of positive.
