  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label study in which eligible IPF subjects who are using supplemental oxygen
      at rest will receive GBT440 orally daily.

  </brief_summary>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    While the GBT440 IPF results noted an improvement in oxygen saturation, they did not translate
    into a clinically meaningful benefit.
