  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to create a registry (collect data and keep it in a research
      database) to learn more about two methods of taking small tissue samples from your esophagus
      (the esophagus is the tube that carries food and liquid from your mouth to your stomach.).
      The two methods of sampling are: 1) Using forceps that take biopsies (small tissue samples)
      from your esophagus, and 2) Using a brush that also takes biopsies from your esophagus.

      By recording the results of all of your biopsies over many years, it may be possible to find
      out if the brush biopsy, forceps biopsy, or both can predict which patients with heartburn
      develop Barrett's esophagus, (an abnormality in the esophagus that may lead to cancer), and
      which patients with Barrett's esophagus develop precancer and cancer. The data from your
      biopsies will be used to determine the best way to diagnose esophageal disease.

      You are being asked to participate in the study because you are receiving an upper endoscopy
      (a procedure where a tube with a light and camera are inserted in your mouth and down your
      throat) with forceps and brush biopsies of your esophagus as part of your standard clinical
      care, and you are between the ages of 18 and 80.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  English speaking

          -  Able to read, comprehend, and complete the consent form

          -  Aged 18 to 80, and,

          -  Meet one of the following:

          -  Patients with heartburn or regurgitation undergoing a screening EGD, who undergo
             WATS3D sampling and forceps biopsies for suspicion of BE, or

          -  Patients with known BE with or without dysplasia undergoing a surveillance EGD with
             WATS3D biopsies and forceps biopsies, or

          -  Patients who have undergone endoscopic eradication therapy(including, but not limited
             to endoscopic mucosal resection, endoscopic submucosal dissection, radiofrequency
             ablation and/orcryoablation/spray cryotherapy)who are undergoing surveillance EGD
             following the establishment of complete eradication of intestinal metaplasia (CEIM)
             with accompanying WATS3D sampling and forceps biopsies.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients meeting any of the following criteria will be excluded from this study:

          -  Patients who on their enrollment endoscopy have a visible highly suspicious lesion,
             such as a nodule or ulcer, (noted while undergoing endoscopy) that requires targeted
             biopsy will be excluded from the study.Patients requiring a targeted biopsy on
             follow-up endoscopies will be allowed to remain in the study.

          -  Patients who do not undergo both biopsy forceps and WATS3D biopsy of the esophagus on
             their initial evaluationfor routine care will be excluded from this study. Subsequent
             endoscopicevaluation may include forceps biopsies alone, WATS3D biopsies alone, or
             both forceps and WATS3D biopsies.
