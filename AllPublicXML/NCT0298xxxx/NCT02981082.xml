    <textblock>
      A double-blinded, placebo-controlled study of Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) in 34 Systemic
      Sclerosis-Pulmonary Hypertension (SSc‐PAH) patients. The study will determine safety and the
      primary outcome variability for DMF in treating SSc‐PAH; the primary outcome of clinical
      efficacy in this pilot trial will be improvement in 6‐minute walk distance (6MWD).

      A double-blinded, placebo-controlled study of Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) in 34 Systemic
      Sclerosis-Pulmonary Hypertension (SSc‐PAH) patients. The study medication will be added to
      stable background PAH medication(s). Subjects will be dosed for 24 weeks, will undergo
      examination every 8 weeks, and will be finally evaluated 12 weeks after completion of
      treatment. Dosage will be twice daily oral doses of 120mg for the first 7 days followed by
      the maintenance dose of 240mg twice a day.Participation will be for a total of 40 weeks,
      including a 4-week screening period, 24 weeks of drug, and a safety follow‐up 12 weeks after
      the last dose. The study will determine the safety and the primary outcome variability for
      DMF in treating SSc‐PAH; the primary outcome of clinical efficacy in this pilot trial will be
      improvement in 6‐minute walk distance (6MWD).
