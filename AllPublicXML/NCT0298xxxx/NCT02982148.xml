  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to compare the effectiveness of intradermal injection and subcutaneous
      injection with methylene blue for early-stage breast cancer patients who need sentinel lymph
      node biopsy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After fully informing and consent, patients recruited would be randomized 1:1 to intradermal
      injection group and subcutaneous injection group. Investigators aimed to find out the
      difference in sentinel lymph nodes detected rate, blue lymphatic detected rate and
      complication incidence between the two groups.

    <description>For patients randomized to intradermal injection before surgery began, 0.5ml 0.4% methylene blue(1ml methylene blue mixed up with 1.5ml saline) would be injected sub-areola (12 o'clock , 3 o'clock , 6 o'clock , 9 o'clock) intradermally, 0.1ml respectively, or peritumoral depending on the tumor location, 10-15 minutes before skin incision. The breast was massaged for 5 minutes to facilitate the identification of blue lymphatic vessels and the lymph nodes.</description>

    <description>Methylene blue has been prove to be effective and safe as a blue dye for sentinel lymph node biopsy in early breast cancer patient. But it was also reported by some article that adverse skin lesions appeared after methylene blue injections for sentinel lymph node localization. But the effectiveness and safety of methylene blue intradermal injection has not yet been investigated.</description>

    <description>Methylene blue subcutaneous injection has become one of the standard method for sentinel lymph node biopsy for breast cancer patients. In such case, we use this method to be an active comparator for the intradermal injection group.</description>
