  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares two types of care - Standard Oncology Care (SOC) and SOC with early
      palliative care (EPC) (started within 8 weeks after diagnosis of advanced disease) to see
      which is better for improving the quality of life of patients with advanced lung, pancreas,
      gastric and biliary tract cancer. The study will use FACT-G questionnaire to measure
      patients' quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patients will complete a baseline FACT-G questionnaire and then will be randomized to a
      study group.

      Subjects who are randomized to Standard Oncology Care (SOC) will follow up with their
      treating oncologist. They will consult with the palliative care team at their request or at
      the request of the treating oncologist or of the family. They will complete FACT-G
      questionnaire at 12 weeks after enrollment.

      Subjects who are randomized to the SOC with Early Palliative Care (EPC) will meet with a
      palliative care team (basically composed by a palliative care physician and a palliative care
      specialized nurse) at their next medical oncology or infusion visit. They will meet with the
      palliative care team at least every three weeks. They will complete FACT-G questionnaire at
      12 weeks after enrollment.
