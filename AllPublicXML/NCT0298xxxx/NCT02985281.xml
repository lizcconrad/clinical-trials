      Evaluation of Safety and Efficacy of Gratisovir (Sofosbuvir)- Ribavirin Therapy in Egyptian
      Pediatric Patients With Chronic Hepatitis C Infection aged 10- 18 years old.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Male or female child ≥ 10 years and ≤ 18 years of age chronically infected with hepatitis C
      virus, willing and able to complete all study visits and procedures. Acceptance from the
      parents will be recruited for giving a verbal and written informed consent. Patient with
      childs Pugh class B or C, compensated cirrhosis may be enrolled. Patient with cirrhosis with
      their alpha fetoprotein is more than 100 ng/ml and patient with coinfection of Hepatitis B
      virus or HIV will be excluded. Participation in the study procedures is anticipated to last
      up to 40 weeks including a screening and eligibility assessment phase (4 weeks duration), a
      24- week treatment phase, and 12- week post treatment follow up phase.

      A detailed treatment log of the returned investigational product will be established with the
      investigator (or the pharmacist) and countersigned by the investigator and the monitoring
      team.

      Compliance is assessed by counting the number of returned tablets at each visit.

      A discontinuation is defined as a period with at least seven consecutive days without study
      drug intake.

      Safety and efficacy will be compared between cirrhotic versus non-cirrhotic subjects in
      multivariate model to test the impact of this pretreatment characteristic on safety,
      tolerability and efficacy endpoints.

      Safety analysis:clinical adverse events will be displayed by body system (soc) for each study
      subject and by treatment group, using MedDRA coding. Summary of statistics of safety and
      efficacy endpoints will be displayed by stratification parameters.

    <description>Safety and tolerability are assessed by: the nature, severity and frequency of the adverse effects and absolute values and changes over time from pre-dose values for hematology clinical chemistry, urine analysis, vital signs and ECG parameters. Clinical adverse events will be displayed by body system (SOC) for each study subject and by treatment group, using MedDRA coding. Absolute laboratory values, changes and its graded abnormalities will be displayed) for each study subject and by treatment group. The proportions of subjects experiencing Clinical adverse events and laboratory abnormalities of a given type will be computed and presented along with descriptive statistics. Vital signs data will be similarly assessed, and any post baseline changes in physical examination findings will be summarized in tubular form, by subject and by treatment cohort.
Summary statistics of efficacy and safety end points will be displayed by stratification parameters</description>
