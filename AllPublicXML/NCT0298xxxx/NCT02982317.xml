    <textblock>
      A novel automated ultrasound software system has been developed which identifies for the
      practitioner the intervertebral spaces in the lumbar area. This study aims to investigate
      whether this new technology has a greater accuracy of identifying intervertebral spaces that
      manual palpation.

      The use of ultrasound is one of the most accurate ways to identify the correct vertebral
      level for needle insertion in spinal/epidural anesthetics, however this is not commonly used.
      A novel automated ultrasound software system has been developed by the UBC Department of
      Engineering which identifies for the practitioner the intervertebral spaces in the lumbar
      area. This study aim to investigate whether this new technology has a greater accuracy of
      identifying intervertebral spaces that manual palpation.

    <description>All patients recruited will undergo the same protocol. An anesthesiologist will perform manual palpation of the patients lumbar spine and identification of the intervertebral spaces from L1-S1. A member of the UBC Department of Engineering will perform the US scanning and level identification using the novel US technology. In addition, freehand US will be used by two practitioners to determine the participant's lumbar level locations as per gold standard.</description>
