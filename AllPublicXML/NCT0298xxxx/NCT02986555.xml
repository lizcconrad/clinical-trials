    <textblock>
      Current virtual reality device makes motion sickness and visual fatigue having limitation for
      recreation and other clinical approaches. Still there is no standardized quantification of
      motion sickness and visual fatigue measurement with objective approach. Current biofeedback
      accompanied with virtual reality would be promising tool for stress relief.

      Current virtual reality device makes motion sickness and visual fatigue having limitation for
      recreation and other clinical approaches. Still there is no standardized quantification of
      motion sickness and visual fatigue measurement with objective approach. After quantification
      and improvement with these shortcomings, current biofeedback accompanied with virtual reality
      would be promising tool for stress relief. This research aims to measure objective motion
      sickness and visual fatigue with psychological stress in highly stressed group, and to
      compare between stress relief with existing biofeedback only approach and relief with mixed
      biofeedback and virtual reality relaxation.
