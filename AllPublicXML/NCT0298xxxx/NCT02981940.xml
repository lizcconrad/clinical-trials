      This research study is studying a targeted therapy as a possible treatment for recurrent
      glioblastoma (GBM).

      The following intervention will be used in this study:

      -Abemaciclib

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved abemaciclib as a treatment
      for any disease.

      Many brain cancers show over expression of a protein called cyclin D1. That means that the
      body makes too much cyclin D1, which affects enzymes called CDK 4 and CDK 6. Enzymes are
      substances in the body that help reactions between cells happen. Too much cyclin D1 triggers
      CDK 4 and CDK 6 to make more cells than normal. This extra cell production leads to the
      growth of tumors.

      In laboratory studies, Abemaciclib was able to enter the brain, stop CDK 4 and CDK 6 from
      making cells, and slow growth of mice Glioblastoma.

      In this research study, the investigators are looking to see how safe and effect Abemaciclib
      is with the participant type of cancer. In the surgical participants, the investigators are
      looking to see if Abemaciclib reached the brain tumor.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must be able to understand and willing to sign a written informed consent
             document.

          -  Participants must be able to adhere to the dosing and visit schedules, and agree to
             record medication times accurately and consistently in a daily diary.

          -  Participants must be at least 18 years old on day of signing informed consent.

          -  Participants must have a Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) ≥ 60

          -  Participants must be able to swallow capsules. Nature of illness and treatment history

          -  Participants must undergo central pathology review to histologically confirm the
             diagnosis of glioblastoma or variants (1 unstained slide or 1 H&amp;E slide must be
             submitted to and reviewed by a pathologist at the DFCI Coordinating Center prior to
             enrollment of the participant for central pathology review). Participants will not be
             eligible if the prior diagnosis was low-grade glioma and a subsequent histological
             diagnosis of glioblastoma or variants was made (e.g. secondary GBM).

          -  To be eligible for the study all participants (Cohort 1 and 2) are required to provide
             genomic profiling data from assays performed in a CLIA-certified lab that demonstrate
             the following with respect to relevant biomarkers required for enrollment to the study
             as listed below. Results from genomic profiling must be sent to the DFCI Coordinating
             Center prior to enrollment of the participant for central pathology review.

               -  Inactivation of CDKN2A/B or C in the tumor by homozygous deletion (evidence for
                  more than single copy loss for any of the genes defined as array CGH log2 ratio
                  of &lt;0.3 by array CGH; or from sequencing data with sufficient coverage for
                  evaluation).

        AND

          -  Validation of wild-type RB status (no deletion/losses more than single copy by copy
             number or sequencing data; and/or no inactivating mutations by sequencing).

               -  Participants must be at first relapse of GBM. Relapse is defined as progression
                  following initial therapy (i.e. radiation+/- chemo if that was used as initial
                  therapy). The intent therefore is that patients had no more than 1 prior therapy
                  (initial treatment). If the patient had a surgical resection for relapsed disease
                  and no anti-cancer therapy was instituted for up to 12 weeks, and the patient
                  undergoes another surgical resection, this is considered to constitute 1 relapse.

               -  Participants must have shown unequivocal evidence for tumor progression by MRI or
                  CT scan.

          -  For Cohort 2 subjects, CT or MRI within 14 days prior to study registration. For
             Cohort 2, corticosteroid dose must be stable or decreasing for at least 5 days prior
             to the scan. If steroids are added or the steroid dose is increased between the date
             of the screening MRI or CT scan and the start of treatment, a new baseline MRI or CT
             is required.

          -  For Cohort 1 subjects, CT or MRI should be performed ideally within 14 days prior to
             study registration, but because the screening MRI for this subset of subjects will not
             be used for evaluation of response, it is acceptable for this MRI/CT to have been
             performed greater than 14 days prior to registration if unavoidable. Furthermore, for
             this same reason, fluctuation in corticosteroid dose around this MRI does not warrant
             repeat scan so long as there is documented unequivocal evidence of tumor progression
             available.

               -  Confirmation of availability of sufficient tissue from a prior surgery for
                  correlative studies is required prior to enrollment; these samples must be sent
                  to the DFCI Coordinating Center within 60 days of registration. Cohort 1
                  participants must have sufficient FFPE tissue from any surgery. Cohort 2
                  participants must have tissue from biopsy or resection from the most recent
                  recurrence surgery.

        The following amount of tissue is required:

          -  25 unstained formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) sections (standard 4-5 micrometer
             thickness)

          -  AND 1 H&amp;E stained slide (or 1 additional unstained 4-5 um slide for staining)

          -  AND one of the following for genomics/nucleic acid extraction:

          -  At least 10 (preferably 20) unstained FFPE sections of 10 micrometer thickness OR

          -  At least 8 tissue cores from an FFPE block (200 micrometer total thickness of tissue
             from a block with a total surface area of 0.5 cm2) OR

          -  At least 200 mg of frozen tissue

               -  An interval of at least 12 weeks from the completion of radiation therapy to
                  start of study drug unless there is a new area of enhancement consistent with
                  recurrent tumor outside the radiation field (defined as the region outside the
                  high-dose region or 80% isodose line) or there is unequivocal histologic
                  confirmation of tumor progression.

               -  Participants must have recovered to grade 0 or 1 or pre-treatment baseline from
                  clinically significant toxic effects of prior therapy (including but not limited
                  to exceptions of alopecia, laboratory values listed per inclusion criteria, and
                  lymphopenia which is common after therapy with temozolomide).

               -  From the projected start of scheduled study treatment, the following time periods
                  must have elapsed:

          -  4 weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever is shorter) from any investigational agent;

          -  4 weeks from cytotoxic therapy (except 23 days for temozolomide; 6 weeks from
             nitrosoureas);

          -  6 weeks from antibodies;

          -  4 weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever is shorter) from other anti-tumor therapies.

          -  2 days from Novo-TTF

               -  Participants with prior therapy that included interstitial brachytherapy or
                  stereotactic radiosurgery must have confirmation of progressive disease based
                  upon nuclear imaging, MR spectroscopy, perfusion imaging or histopathology.

               -  Participants having undergone recent resection or open biopsy or stereotactic
                  biopsy of recurrent or progressive tumor will be eligible for Cohort 2 as long as
                  the following conditions apply:

          -  They have recovered from the effects of surgery.

          -  Residual disease following resection of recurrent tumor is not mandated for
             eligibility. To best assess the extent of residual disease post-operatively, an MRI or
             CT scan should ideally have been performed no later than 96 hours following surgery,
             or at least 28 days post-operatively, but scans performed outside of this window are
             considered acceptable if no alternative is available. In either case, the
             baseline/screening MRI must be performed within 14 days prior to registration. If the
             participant is taking corticosteroids, the dose must be stable or decreasing for at
             least 5 days prior to the scan. If steroids are added or the steroid dose is increased
             between the date of the screening MRI or CT scan and the start of treatment, a new
             baseline MRI or CT is required.

             abemaciclib. Contraceptive methods may include an intrauterine device [IUD] or barrier
             method. If condoms are used as a barrier method, a spermicidal agent should be added
             as a double barrier protection.

             --NOTE: Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if
             they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate
