  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of Bone Marrow Autologous Collection (BMAC) in musculoskeletal conditions including
      osteoarthritis and tendon injuries has been growing. Outcome evidence continues to be sparse.
      The purpose of this study is collect a longitudinal case series of patient reported outcomes
      following BMAC injections for musculoskeletal conditions including osteoarthritis,
      tendinopathy and injuries to ligaments, tendons and muscles.

    <description>BMAC will be collected in the outpatient setting with local anesthesia. The collection site will be the Posterior Superior Iliac Spine (PSIS). This will be visualized under ultrasound prior to collection. Local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine will be performed prior to the harvest. BMAC harvest will be performed using the Arthrex Angel BMAC System using the Arthrex collection protocol. The Arthrex Angel machine will be used to separate BMAC contents for injection based on Arthrex collection protocol. Machine settings, volume of collection and volume of output have not been standardized and will be based upon harvest and the condition treated. These will be variables recorded for consideration of optimal settings based on the patient-reported outcomes.</description>

        Patients with a musculoskeletal condition amenable to BMAC or PRP treatment will be
        enrolled upon registration for the selected procedure. Proper counseling regarding the
        selected procedure and alternatives will be done prior to enrollment. Patients with
        contraindications for the procedure will not undergo the procedure and therefore will not
        be enrolled. The study will be non-randomized; therefore, patient selection will be based
        upon patient request for the procedure after proper counseling. Counseling regarding cost
        of each procedure will also be provided. All costs for the procedure will be the
        responsibility of the patient. Proper documentation will also be signed by the patient
        indicating that procedure is elective and PRP/BMAC injections will not be billed to their
        insurance carriers. Upon enrollment, patients will be consented for the procedure and
        longitudinal data collection.
