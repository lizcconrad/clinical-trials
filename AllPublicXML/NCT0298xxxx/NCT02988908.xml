  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study 1:

      Investigators evaluated the short-term and longer-term efficacy and effectiveness of a
      pharmacologic augmentation strategy for a nonpharmacologic treatment to improve memory
      performance in nondemented older adults. Investigators used a randomized controlled trial
      with parallel groups design that compares two Treatments: DONEPEZIL + COGNITIVE TRAINING
      versus PLACEBO + COGNITIVE TRAINING.

      Study 2:

      The second study looked more closely at dosage. Investigators hoped to determine the best
      dosage of the drug donepezil for enhancing the effects of the memory training program.

    <description>Each participant was given a list of 16 words. Participants had 4 minutes to memorize the words in order. Short-term recall was tested after 5 minutes exposure to a distractor task and delayed recall was tested after 30 minutes. At recall participants were asked to recall as many words as they could remember in the order the words were presented.</description>
