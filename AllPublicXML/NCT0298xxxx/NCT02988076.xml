  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled study to evaluate
      the effectiveness of Psychiatric Electroencephalogram Registry (PEER) Interactive to inform
      medication prescription in subjects with a primary diagnosis of depression with comorbidity
      of non-psychotic behavioral disorders versus treatment as usual, as determined by the
      investigator. The primary measurement for improvement of the subjects depression will be a
      self-evaluation questionnaire, the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report
      16 , but the investigators will also collect information on their clinical global improvement
      and any reduction in adverse events.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is prospective in nature. Subjects in the control group will be treated according
      to treatment as usual and best judgment of the treating physician. For the experimental group
      the treating physician will follow the guidance of the subject's PEER Interactive Report as
      regards sensitivity to on-label medications and classes of medication.

      The subjects will be washed out of all current medications prior to having an
      electroencephalogram (EEG), which is necessary to generate the PEER Interactive Report. The
      wash out period for outpatients is no longer than 14 days.

      The subjects will be followed for 3 months after the initial treatment. The patient will be
      seen on a routine basis and assessments will be made at each interaction to evaluate the
      patient's improvement in mental health. The subjects will also be closely evaluated to
      determine if they are experiencing any psychiatric specific adverse events. The investigator
      is allowed to treat the patient according to their best medical judgment, which may include
      adding or changing medications, seeing the patient more frequently, or other interventions
      such as the use of sleep aids.
