    <textblock>
      The objective of this randomized, single-center, examiner-blind, controlled, parallel group,
      six-month clinical study is to compare the antiplaque/antigingivitis potential of a
      no-alcohol essential oil containing mouthrinse and an alcohol essential oil containing
      mouthrinse. A negative control group using only an ADA Accepted anticavity toothpaste will be
      included.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males and females 18 years of age or older, in good general and oral health, except
             gingivitis.

          2. Able to comprehend and follow the requirements of the study (including availability on
             scheduled visit dates) based upon research site personnel's assessment;

          3. Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating the
             subject (or legally acceptable representative) has been informed of all pertinent
             aspects of the trial.

          4. A minimum of 20 natural teeth with scorable facial and lingual surfaces. Teeth that
             are grossly carious, extensively restored, orthodontically banded, abutments,
             exhibiting severe generalized cervical and/or enamel abrasion, or third molars will
             not be included in the tooth count.

          5. A mean gingival index ≥ 1.75 according to the Modified Gingival Index.

          6. A mean plaque index ≥ 1.95 according to the Turesky modification of the Quigley-Hein
             Plaque Index scored on six surfaces per tooth.

          7. Absence of significant oral soft tissue pathology, excluding plaque-induced
             gingivitis, based on a visual examination and at the discretion of the Investigator.

          8. Absence of moderate/advanced periodontitis based on a clinical examination (ADA Type
             III, IV).

          9. Absence of fixed or removable orthodontic appliance or removable partial dentures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of significant adverse effects, including sensitivities or suspected
             allergies, following use of oral hygiene products such as toothpastes and mouthrinses
             and red food dye.

          2. History of serious medical conditions that, at the discretion of the Investigator,
             will disqualify the subject.

          3. History of rheumatic fever, heart murmur, mitral valve prolapse or other conditions
             requiring prophylactic antibiotic coverage prior to invasive dental procedures.

          4. Antibiotic, anti-inflammatory or anticoagulant therapy during the study or within the
             2 weeks prior to the baseline exam.

          5. Regular use of chemotherapeutic antiplaque/antigingivitis products such as triclosan,
             essential oil, cetylpyridinium chloride, or chlorhexidine containing mouthrinses
             within the 2 weeks prior to baseline.

          6. Current or history of alcohol or drug abuse.

          7. Self reported pregnancy or lactation (this is an exclusion criterion due to oral
             tissue changes related to pregnancy and nursing which can affect interpretation of
             study results).
