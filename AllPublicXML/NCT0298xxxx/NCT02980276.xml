  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of the EMERGE trial is to determine whether metformin + usual care,
      compared to placebo + usual care (introduced at the time of initial diagnosis of GDM),
      reduces a) the need for insulin use, or hyperglycemia (primary outcome measure); b) excessive
      maternal weight gain; c) maternal and neonatal morbidities and, d) cost of treatment for
      women with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus.
