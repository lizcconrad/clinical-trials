  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is an increasing demand for digital tools to empower young people with mental health
      difficulties (NHS England, 2015). Digital information, advice and mood tracking tools are
      increasingly being used to support child mental health. Evidence suggests that young people
      want to be active participants in their care and involved in decisions about their treatment.
      However, there is a lack of digital shared decision making tools available to support young
      people in Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS). This study aims to develop
      Power Up, a smartphone app to empower young people in CAMHS to make their voice heard and to
      participate more in decisions around their care.

      The project will involve two phases:

        -  Development Phase -Developing Power Up according to the views and ideas expressed by
           young people, their parents/ carers, and clinicians in Patient and Public Involvement
           (PPI) sessions. -Conducting interviews and focus groups with 10 young people in CAMHS,
           10 parents/ carers and 10 clinicians to review the acceptability of the content and
           format of Power Up.

        -  Feasibility testing Phase -Conducting a feasibility trial with 120 young people with
           emotional difficulties, aged 11-19 years, from three London CAMHS. 60 young people will
           receive treatment as usual and 60 will use Power Up alongside treatment as usual.
           Participant's ratings of empowerment, activation, and symptoms will be measured soon
           after their referral to the service. The same measures plus shared decision making
           questionnaires will be administered three months later.

      The findings will inform the planning of a prospective cluster controlled trial. More broadly
      this trial will contribute an understanding of the feasibility and acceptability of
      developing and implementing a shared decision making app into CAMHS.
