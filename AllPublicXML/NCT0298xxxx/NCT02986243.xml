      The goal of this study is to prepare subjects for kidney transplant. Patients who are in need
      of a kidney transplant but are unable to be place on the wait list due to weight will be
      enrolled in a six month workout program. The workout program will consist of counseling from
      a registered dietician, personal training from certified trainers and constant health
      monitoring.
