  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sport concussions are among the most commonly occurring injuries in sport and recreation and
      pose significant public health implications for Canadians. Many individuals who sustain a
      concussion recover in the initial 7-10 days but up to 74% of youth and 31% of adults may
      suffer from persistent symptoms. Little research is currently available evaluating the
      effects of treatment for individuals who are slower to recover following sport-related
      concussion. An initial RCT identified a significant treatment effect in individuals with
      persistent symptoms of dizziness, neck pain and/or headaches following sport-related
      concussion when treated with a combination of cervical and vestibular physiotherapy compared
      to a typical protocol of rest followed by graded exertion (Schneider et al, 2014). Low level
      aerobic exercise in combination with sport specific training may also be of benefit to
      facilitate recovery in children and youth following concussion (Gagnon et al, 2009, 2016).
      Further evaluation of these treatments is required to better understand the effects of each
      treatment in isolation and in combination. This trial will have the ability to inform future
      multifaceted clinical trials as well as clinical practice. Ultimately, identification of
      optimal treatment paradigms will lead to a decrease in persistent symptoms and functional
      alterations in children and youth from this commonly occurring injury.

      Although awareness regarding sport-related concussion is growing, rehabilitative strategies
      for this commonly occuring injury have been a focus of very little research. With the
      exception of our pilot RCT, no RCTs to date have evaluated the efficacy of cervical spine
      physiotherapy in combination with vestibular rehabilitation in sport-related concussion.
      Current evidence has suggested positive effects of low-level aerobic exercise in youth and
      adults who are slow to recover following a concussion (Gagnon et al, 2016). However,
      low-level aerobic exercise has not yet been compared to cervicovestibular physiotherapy. A
      shift in clinical practice (to implement cervicovestibular physiotherapy or low level aerobic
      exercise) is occurring, but a direct comparison of the effects of low level aerobic exercise
      and multimodal physiotherapy treatment has not yet been conducted. A combination of these two
      forms of treatment may be more beneficial than either in isolation. Thus, the combination of
      physiotherapy and low level aerobic exercise treatment also requires evaluation.
      Identification of management strategies for individuals with persistent symptoms following
      concussion is urgently required to inform practice and optimize treatment strategies in this
      commonly occuring health problem.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary Research Question:

      1. Does cervical and vestibular rehabilitation (CVPT) 1) result in a greater proportion of
      individuals medically cleared to return to sport (yes/no); 2) improve quality of life
      compared to a control group of low level aerobic exercise (LLAE) (following an 8-week
      intervention in individuals with persistent symptoms of dizziness, neck pain and/or headaches
      following concussion)?

      Secondary Research Questions:

      1. Does a combination of CVPT and LLAE 1) result in a greater proportion of individuals
      medically cleared to return to sport; 2) Improve quality of life compared to CVPT or LLAE
      alone (following an 8-week intervention in individuals with persistent symptoms of dizziness,
      neck pain and/or headaches following concussion)?

      Exploratory Research Questions:

        1. Does cervical and vestibular rehabilitation (CVPT) result in a greater proportion of
           individuals medically cleared to return to sport compared to a control group of low
           level aerobic exercise (LLAE) (following an 8-week intervention in individuals with
           persistent symptoms of dizziness, neck pain and/or headaches following concussion) when
           stratified by subgroups based on time since injury, previous history of concussion, sex
           and age?

        2. Does a combination of CVPT and LLAE result in a greater proportion of individuals
           medically cleared to return to sport compared to CVPT or LLAE alone when stratified by
           subgroups based on time since injury, previous history of concussion, sex and age?

        3. What clinical characteristics predict response to treatment?

        4. What changes in symptoms and clinical measures of cervical and vestibular function occur
           with treatment?

        5. What changes in measures of disability, self-efficacy, neuropsychological and
           psychosocial function occur with treatment?

        6. What other factors may affect treatment outcome (i.e. medical clearance) and quality of
           life in youth with persisting symptoms following concussion?

      METHODS:

      The study design is a single blind randomized controlled trial (RCT). Participants will be
      recruited through the University of Calgary Acute Sport Concussion Clinic and through
      community sport medicine offices, family physicians and allied health in the City of Calgary
      and surrounding areas.

      All participants will undergo an initial physiotherapy assessment at inclusion into the
      study. This assessment will be repeated at the time of medical clearance to return to sport
      (if less than 8 weeks) or at 8 weeks following initiation of treatment. Participants will be
      randomized into a cervicovestibular physiotherapy intervention (CVPT) group, a low level
      aerobic exercise group (LLAE), or a combination of cervicovestibular physiotherapy and low
      level aerobic exercise group (combination). All study participants will meet weekly (30
      minute appointment) with a study physiotherapist for eight weeks (or until the time of
      medical clearance to return to sport if clearance occurs prior to 8 weeks). All groups will
      follow a protocol of graded exertion as per the 4th International Consensus Guidelines
      (Zurich 2012, McCrory et al, 2013).

    <description>The primary outcomes of interest will be: 1) Medical clearance to return to sport by 8-weeks (as per the 4th International Consensus Guidelines on Concussion in Sport). Medical clearance was selected because it is the most clinically relevant measure and will reflect not only symptom resolution but also functional improvement. We have chosen to further standardize this outcome as follows to minimize risk of bias:
Asymptomatic a rest
Able to complete all steps of the return to play protocol with no recurrence of symptoms
Able to return to school full time without accommodations
No other clinical findings suggesting an inability to return to play Some individuals may choose not to return to sport (i.e. retire) or to have coaching decisions influence their return to sport (i.e. may return prior to medical clearance). Therefore, medical clearance to return to sport (as opposed to actual return) is felt to most accurately reflect recovery.</description>

    <description>In addition to the standard protocol of rest followed by exertion, the CV PT group will participate in a combination of cervical spine and vestibular rehabilitation as per a standardized treatment algorithm based on individual assessment findings. This form of therapy combines treatment techniques for both the cervical spine and vestibular system that are commonly used in physiotherapy practice. Cervical spine treatments may include neuromotor retraining, sensorimotor retraining, manual therapy, soft tissue techniques, and range of motion exercises. Vestibular rehabilitation may include gaze stabilization, habituation, standing balance, dynamic balance and canalith repositioning maneouvers.</description>

    <description>Participants will exercise at 60% maximum heart rate for 15 minutes. This heart rate will be calculated by taking 220-age (in years) and multiplying by 0.6 to determine the target heart rate while performing the low level aerobic exercise. Aerobic exercises may include treadmill, walking or stationary cycling. Exercise will be performed 5-6 times per week independently at home and monitored by their parents. Individuals will be taught how to monitor their heart rate. This protocol has previously been found to be feasible and of minimal risk to participants.</description>
