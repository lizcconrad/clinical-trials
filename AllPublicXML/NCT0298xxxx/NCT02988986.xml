  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label phase II clinical trial to determine the efficacy, toxicity, and safety
      of TAK-228 plus tamoxifen in patients with newly diagnosed ER-positive, HER2-negative breast
      cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The mTOR pathway is commonly dysregulated in ER-positive breast cancers and represents a key
      resistance mechanism to endocrine therapy such as tamoxifen. We plan to target the mTOR
      pathway with mTORC1/2 inhibitor TAK-228 to overcome tamoxifen resistance in early-stage
      ER-positive breast cancer. An open label phase II clinical trial will be conducted to
      determine the efficacy, toxicity, and safety of TAK-228 plus tamoxifen in patients with newly
      diagnosed ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer. TAK-228 (30 mg weekly) plus tamoxifen (20
      mg daily) will be administered for 16 weeks. Patients will undergo tumor biopsy before
      starting the study treatment and after 6 weeks of study treatment. Blood samples for
      pharmacokinetics analysis will be obtained 1 hour before and after TAK-228 dosing on days 1
      and 15 of the study.

    <ipd_description>Data and materials on human subjects will be shared with other eligible investigators through appropriate means in accordance with the NIH policy on Sharing Research Data (NIH Guide, February 26, 2003). Data will be also shared with the funding agency and regulatory agencies as required. Data will be shared with other investigators within the limits of HIPAA and other patient confidentiality requirements. This will generally require removal of all patient identifiers for all source documents and the use of arbitrarily assigned one-way identifiers. In some cases, requestors will be asked to sign a formal data sharing agreement that will provide for a commitment to use data only for research purposes and not to identify individuals, keep the data secure, and destroy or return data after analyses are complete. Prior approval will be obtained from collaborating investigators, research sponsors, and/or other stake-holders before sharing if proprietary information or products are involved.</ipd_description>
