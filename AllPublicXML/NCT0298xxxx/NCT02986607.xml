  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesise that parathyroid hormon (PTH) depletion interferes with normal
      activity of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis and the
      renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS), which in turn may impact morbidity and quality
      of life. The main objective of the current study is to test if PTH deficiency influences the
      secretion of corticosteroids and whether any abnormalities in the HPA-axis and the
      RAAS-system can be reversed by PTH infusion.

      Visit 1: Optimizing conventional treatment regarding s-magnesium, s-calcium, s-phosphorous
      and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D)-levels.

      Visit 2 (In-hospital 4-7 days): Day one: 24h microdialysis sampling, venous blood sampling
      and 24h urine will be collected. Day 2: Start of PTH pump-treatment. Day 3-x: dose adjustment
      of PTH pump therapy according to Calcium Levels, the first two days after started PTH six
      daily venous blood-samplings will be performed. Day x: 24h microdialysis sampling and 24h
      urine-sampling and a venous blood sampling. Restart of conventional treatment.

      The Control patients (healthy volunteers and patients with hyperparathyroidism) will perform
      24h microdialysis-sampling only.

    <description>Subcutaneous 24h microdialysis before PTH treatment and during continous subcutaneous PTH treatment. PTH, Natpara (parathyroid hormone 1-84) 50 µg doses with a concentration of 800 µg/ml, will be delivered by an insulin-pump (OmniPod) which delivers the infusion gear continous subcutaneously based on units (U) of insulin. 1 µg Natpara equals 0.125 U of infusion. The starting dose for pump treatment will be 0.50 µg per kilo per day and adjusted according to Calcium levels.
Controls: patients With hyperparathyroidism and healthy volunteers will perform 24h microdialysis.</description>

          -  Patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, defined as simultaneous increased PTH and
             serum calcium levels, normal or increased urine calcium to exclude hypocalciuric
             hypercalcemia, normal kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)
             above 60), aged 18-60 years

        Exclusion Criteria:

             disease, epilepsy, pregnancy or lactation, significant hepatic or kidney disease
             (alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) and or aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT) &gt; 2 times
             upper limit of normal, eGFR &lt; 30 ml/min), pharmacological treatment with PTH the last
             3 months, treatment with other drugs that could interfere with interpretation of the
             results. Allergy to metacresol, lidocaine or multiple allergies.
