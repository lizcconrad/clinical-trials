  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if an investigational treatment (teduglutide) is
      safe and effective in Japanese children (age 1 through 15 years of age) with SBS who are
      dependent on parenteral support. This study will also evaluate how teduglutide moves through
      the body (pharmacokinetics) and how it affects the body (pharmacodynamics).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Informed consent by a parent or legally-authorized representative prior to any
             study-related procedures.

          2. When applicable, informed assent (as deemed appropriate by the Institutional Review
             Board) by the subject prior to any study-related procedures.

          3. Male or female child or adolescent aged 1 year through 15 years.

          4. Current history of SBS as a result of major intestinal resection (example [e.g.] due
             to necrotizing enterocolitis, midgut volvulus, intestinal atresia, or gastroschisis).

          5. SBS that requires PN/IV support that provides at least 30% of caloric and/or
             fluid/electrolyte needs.

          6. Stable PN/IV support, defined as inability to significantly reduce PN/IV support,
             usually associated with minimal or no advance in enteral feeds (that is (i.e), 10% or
             less change in PN or advance in feeds) for at least 3 months prior to and during
             screening, as assessed by the investigator. Transient instability for events such as
             interruption of central access or treatment of sepsis is allowed if the PN/IV support
             returns to within 10% of baseline prior to the event.

          7. Sexually active female subjects of childbearing potential must use medically
             acceptable methods of birth control during and for 4 weeks following the last dose of
             investigational product.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who are not expected to be able to advance oral or tube feeding regimens.

             abnormalities (e.g, Familial Adenomatous Polyposis, Fanconi-Bickel syndrome).

          5. Severe, known dysmotility syndrome such as pseudo-obstruction or persistent, severe,
             active gastroschisis-related dysmotility; that is the primary contributing factor to
             feeding intolerance and inability to reduce parenteral support, prior to screening.
             Dysmotility is defined as severe if it is expected to limit the advancement of enteral
             feeding.

         11. Participation in a clinical study using an experimental drug (other than glutamine or
             Omegaven) within 3 months or 5.5 half-lives of the experimental drug, whichever is
             longer, prior to screening and for the duration of the study.

         12. Previous use of teduglutide or native/synthetic glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2).

             infection-related catheter sepsis, clots, bowel obstruction, severe water-electrolyte
             disturbances) within 3 months prior to the screening visit.

             within 1 month prior to or during screening, excluding uncomplicated treatment of
             bacteremia, central line replacement/repair, or issues of similar magnitude in an
             otherwise stable subject.
