      The aim of this study was to assess the frequency of PD-L1 expression in stage III-IV ECs and
      to investigate its correlation impact with progression-free survival (PFS), and
      clinicopathological features including microsatellite instability and quantified stromal and
      intraepithelial tumor-infiltrating CD8+ lymphocytes (TILs)
