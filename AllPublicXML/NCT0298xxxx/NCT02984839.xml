    <textblock>
      The aim of this prospective, observational study is to determine the incidence of
      post-operative residual neuromuscular blockade (PRNB) in patients undergoing intra-abdominal
      procedures compared to patients undergoing other noncardiac/non intra-thoracic procedures
      that also require non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA) administration. As
      intra-abdominal surgeries are independently associated with post-operative pulmonary
      complications (PPCs), it is important to highlight other factors, such as PRNB, that could
      contribute to these complications.Although it has been shown that the risk of adverse
      respiratory events can be reduced by intra-operative quantitative neuromuscular monitoring,
      such monitoring is not in widespread use.This study will incorporate quantitative monitoring
      in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) setting by using the Stimpod NMS450® in an effort to
      show a disparity in the incidence of residual paralysis between these two patient populations
      and to emphasize the need to implement more accurate neuromuscular monitoring, especially for
      those that are already at increased risk for respiratory complications.

    <textblock>
      Residual paralysis from non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) is a common
      problem that contributes to adverse outcomes in the post-anesthesia care unit
      (PACU).Unidentified residual neuromuscular blockade (defined as a train-of-four (TOF) ratio
      &lt;0.9) has been reported in up to 30-42% of patients in the recovery room.Though current
      literature supports the use of quantitative monitoring of neuromuscular blockade,
      conventional qualitative TOF count monitoring and clinical signs (head lift, grip strength)
      continue to be used.There is strong evidence that shows reduction of clinically significant
      post-operative residual neuromuscular blockade (PRNB) after implementation of quantitative
      monitoring. Post-operative pulmonary complications (PPCs) are notable adverse outcomes of
      residual neuromuscular blockade. The implementation of quantitative monitoring may be
      particularly beneficial to patients who are already predisposed to PPCs secondary to the site
      of surgery.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the incidence of PRNB with use of quantitative
      neuromuscular monitoring in patients undergoing intra-abdominal procedures compared to
      patients undergoing other surgical procedures that also require NMBA administration.

        The study population will include all patients age 18 or older with American Society of
        Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I-IV presenting for elective or non-elective
        surgery requiring general anesthesia with neuromuscular blockade.While previous studies
        have found that up to 30-42% of patients experience PRNB in the PACU, no previous studies
        have estimated the incidence of PRNB by surgical procedure (i.e., intra-abdominal versus
        other surgical procedures).Therefore, this study will be more descriptive in nature.A
        difference of at least 10% in the incidence of PRNB between the two groups will be
        considered clinically significant.A maximum number of 120 (approximately 60 patients who
        undergo intra-abdominal surgery and 60 patients who undergo non intra-abdominal surgical
        procedures) will be enrolled during the course of the study.
