    <textblock>
      The research aims to investigate whether trimebutine maleate combined with rabeprazole can
      improve the clinical efficacy in patients With refractory Los Angeles grade A or B reflux
      esophagitis . A total of 500 patients with Grade A or B reflux esophagitis refractory to
      rabeprazole will be randomly divided into two groups.One will continue to receive rabeprazole
      treatment,and the other group will receive extra oral trimebutine maleate 200 mg three times
      daily for 4 weeks. The end of the study for every patient is the improvement of main
      symptoms. The primary and secondary analyses are the main symptoms score, endoscopy results,
      Gastroesophageal reflux disease questionnaire（GerdQ) score,Hospital Anxiety and Depression
      Scale(HADS) score, Athens insomnia scale and World Health Organization Quality of
      Life-Bref(WHOQOL-BREF)scale scores at the baseline and final assessments.
