      The aim of this project is to test and evaluate a nursing intervention, Time Together (TT),
      created to enable quality interactions between patients and staff in psychiatric inpatient
      care. The research questions are:

      Does TT influence the quality of interactions between staff and patients? Does TT influence
      patients' levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms? Does TT influence staffs' levels of
      perceived stress and levels of stress of conscience? Does TT influence the prevalence of
      coercive measures, mean length of hospital stay and the use of PRN medication?

      In parallel, a process evaluation will be conducted, answering questions such as:

      How do staff and patients describe their experiences of the intervention and how do
      contextual factors influence the effects of the intervention? What are the relationship
      between the outcome variables and the degree of compliance with the intended intervention?
      What problems are there with recruitment and dropouts?

      BACKGROUND:

      Despite the long known significance of the nurse-patient relationship, research in
      psychiatric inpatient care still reports on unfulfilled expectations of, and difficulties in
      interactions and relationships between patients and staff. As one solution to the
      contemporary circumstances, interventions that creates structures that allow quality
      interactions between patients and staff are needed.

      INTERVENTION TT is an intervention, developed from the intervention Protected Engagement
      Time. The structure of TT is that staff, for a fixed time during the day, dedicates their
      time to exclusively engage with the patients. Other duties of more administrative nature,
      visits and meetings are organized to be performed at other times during the day. This
      structure will be tested at three psychiatric inpatient care wards in the north of Sweden.

      DESIGN AND METHODS An experimental single system design (A-B-Follow-up) will be used. As TT
      will be introduced as a routine ward activity during the B phase, all patients and staff on
      the participating wards will be participating in TT. However, participating in the evaluation
      will be voluntary. Data will be collected through questionnaires once every seventh weekday
      during 5 weeks for the A phase, and 12 weeks during B phase.

      In parallel, a process evaluation will be conducted using semi structured interviews and
      participating observations.

    <description>For a fixed time during the day, staff dedicates their time to exclusively engage with the patients. Different activities will be offered to both patients and staff, such as playing board games, taking a walk, or having individual conversations. Other duties of more administrative nature, visits and meetings will be performed at other times during the day. Through this, opportunities for interaction are both created and protected.</description>
