  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lumbar spinal stenosis with neurogenic claudication is a common condition in the elderly
      population and is characterized by bilateral buttock, thigh, or calf discomfort and/or pain,
      as well as by weakness precipitated by walking and prolonged standing. Self-management
      options include physical therapy, which includes exercise as a core component for improving
      the flexibility and mobility of the spine and hips. A Williams flexion protocol has
      historically been used to treat low-back pain following degenerative changes to the posterior
      elements of the lumbar spine. However, few studies have been done to validate the efficacy of
      this protocol. A more focused treatment protocol may be more efficacious. Patients in this
      study will be randomized to receive either the generic physical therapy protocol (15
      sessions) or the focused rehabilitation program (5 sessions). The sessions will take place
      over the course of 6 months. Outcomes will be assessed using validated questionnaires and
      physical function tests.
