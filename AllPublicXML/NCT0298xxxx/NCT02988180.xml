  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children in extreme poverty lack adequate care and face increased health risks. The earlier
      poverty strikes in the developmental process, the more deleterious and long-lasting its
      effects. There is, however, growing evidence that early interventions can prevent the
      negative consequences. Such interventions are effective, particularly when they are of high
      quality, organized at home and parents are involved. Recently, baseline assessment of
      developmental and nutritional status of SOS children and children in extreme poverty in Jimma
      region of South-West Ethiopia revealed that these children have developmental problems in
      language, motor, social-emotional skills and nutritional status. The impact of play-oriented
      stimulation activities integrated into the existing SOS basic program, on developmental
      outcomes, has never been investigated in this context. The main objective of the study is,
      therefore, to evaluate the impact of play-oriented stimulation integrated into the basic SOS
      program on the developmental outcomes of children living with foster families. This was done
      by comparing the intervention children with their age-matched children (control), not
      receiving the stimulation package. It was hypothesized that this package would significantly
      improve the developmental skills of these children.
