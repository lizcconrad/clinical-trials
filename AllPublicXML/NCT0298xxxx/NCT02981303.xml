      Objective: To determine the Overall Response Rate (ORR) to Imprime PGG + pembrolizumab in
      subjects with advanced melanoma or metastatic TNBC

      Safety: To characterize the safety of Imprime PGG + pembrolizumab given in combination

      Hypothesis: Restore (for melanoma) or enhance (for TNBC) sensitivity to checkpoint inhibitors
      (CPI) by appropriate and effective stimulation of the subject's innate and adaptive immune
      systems in those subjects who have failed 1st line therapy

      The study will incorporate Simon's optimal 2-stage design with sample size fixed at 12
      subjects each in Stage 1 for advanced melanoma and for Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC)
      subjects. The safety criterion of ≤ 4 (or ≤ 33%) subjects with Grade 3/4 adverse events in
      Cycle 1 within either tumor type must be met in order to proceed to Stage 2. The starting
      dose is 4 mg/kg for Imprime PGG. In the event there are a total of &gt; 4 (or &gt; 33%) of subjects
      with Grade 3/4 adverse events in Cycle 1, the dose of Imprime PGG will be reduced to 2 mg/kg,
      and Stage 1 will be repeated at a dose of 2 mg/kg with an additional cohort of n=12 subjects.
      For the dose that meets the safety criterion in Stage 1, at least 1 response in melanoma
      subjects and 2 responses in TNBC subjects amongst the 12 subjects within each tumor type must
      be observed in order to proceed to Stage 2.

      Stage 2 will enroll an additional 17 subjects with melanoma, and 30 subjects with TNBC. For
      the dose that meets the Stage 1 safety criterion, success will be declared if at least 4
      amongst the total of up to 29 subjects with melanoma, and 13 amongst the total of up to 42
      subjects with TNBC achieve an objective response.

          1. Have signed an informed document prior to any study-specific procedures or treatment

          2. Be ≥ 18 years of age at time of consent

          3. For Melanoma Subjects: Have histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of
             unresectable Stage III or metastatic (Stage IV) melanoma not amenable to local
             therapy, and irrespective of PD-L1 status

          4. For TNBC Subjects: Have histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of
             metastatic (Stage IV) TNBC, and irrespective of PD-L1 status. TNBC is defined as
             negative immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays for Estrogen Receptor (ER), and
             Progesterone Receptor (PR), and HER2 negative (IHC 0 or 1+, or 2+ by IHC confirmed
             negative by FISH)

          5. Have documented objective radiographic or clinical disease progression after
             PD-1/PD-L1 +/- anti-CTLA-4 inhibitor therapy (melanoma) or after at least 1 line of
             chemotherapy for metastatic disease (TNBC)

          6. Have resolution of all previous treatment-related toxicities to Grade 1 severity or
             lower, except for stable sensory neuropathy (less than or equal to Grade 2) or
             alopecia. If subject received major surgery or radiation therapy of &gt; 30 Gy, must have

             lesion that is at least 10 mm in longest diameter or lymph node that is at least 15 mm
             in short axis imaged by CT scan or MRI and obtained by imaging within 28 days prior to
             start of study treatment. Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area are
             considered measurable if progression has been demonstrated in such lesions.

             the adequacy of the tissue sample quality, for assessment of biomarker status. Repeat
             samples may be required if adequate tissue is not provided. Newly obtained biopsy
             specimens are preferred to archived samples and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
             block specimens are preferred to slides.

             Note: Information on 1 tumor biopsy sample is mandatory and is as follows: (1) To
             determine eligibility, historical (diagnostic) tumor biopsy official pathology report
             +/- an archival sample. Additional biopsy samples, preferably obtained from the same
             localized region, are highly desirable when feasible at the following time points: (2)
             Sample before the first dose of study treatment, (3) Sample after completion of Cycle
             2 but before the start of Cycle 3 dosing, and (4) Sample either at the time of
             response or at the End of Study Visit (if no response).
