      The purpose of this study is to compare the impact of two combination of two tablets once
      daily: dolutegravir associated with emtricitabine / tenofovir versus darunavir / cobicistat
      associated with emtricitabine / tenofovir on DNA HIV measured in PBMC at 48 weeks in patients
      with primary HIV-1 infection.

      Phase III, randomized (1: 1), comparative, superiority, open-label, parallel assignment,
      national multicenter trial evaluating two treatments in patients with primary HIV-1
      infection.

      Comparison of the two combinations regarding:

        -  Viral reservoir at W48

        -  Early inhibition of viral replication,

        -  Plasmatic and cellular cumulative viremia at W48,

        -  Immune reconstitution with CD4, CD8 levels and CD4 / CD8 ratio,

        -  Activation parameters decrease,

        -  Adherence to treatments,

        -  Treatments tolerance,

        -  Adverse events,

        -  Quality of life (by self-administered questionnaires). Study of the pharmacokinetics /
           dynamics relationship of the decay of plasma, cellular, rectal and spermatic
           compartments' viral loads.

           50 participants per group will be enrolled in 40 sites in France. Co- inclusion in ANRS
           CO 06 PRIMO cohort will be offered

             screening will be taken into account. If the Enzyme Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA)
             test result does not dissociate the signals antibodies and p24 antigen:

               -  Negative ELISA and positive HIV-1 RNA confirmed by a second positive HIV-1 RNA.

               -  Positive ELISA and WB-HIV1 [0-5] band (s) or IB-HIV-1 [0-3] band(s) confirmed by
                  a positive HIV-1 RNA.

        If the ELISA test result dissociated p24 antigen and antibodies signals:

          -  ELISA Ac - / p24 - and positive HIV-1 RNA confirmed by a second positive HIV-1 RNA.

          -  ELISA Ac - / p24 + confirmed by a positive HIV-1 RNA.

          -  Co-administration of prohibited treatments (see § 9.5).

          -  History or presence of allergy to the study drugs or their components;

             coagulopathy, hypoalbuminemia, esophageal or gastric varices, or persistent jaundice),
             known biliary abnormalities (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic
             gallstones).

          -  Subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Class C) as determined by Child-Pugh
             classification.

          -  Any symptoms or laboratory values suggesting a systemic disorder (renal, hepatic,
             cardiovascular, pulmonary) or other medical conditions that could interfere with the
             interpretation of trial results or compromise the health of patients.
