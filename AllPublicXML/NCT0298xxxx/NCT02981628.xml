  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well inotuzumab ozogamicin works in treating younger patients
      with CD22 positive B acute lymphoblastic leukemia that has come back or does not respond to
      treatment. Immunotoxins, such as inotuzumab ozogamicin, are antibodies linked to a toxic
      substance and may help find cancer cells that express CD22 and kill them without harming
      normal cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the morphologic response rate (complete response [CR] + complete response
      with incomplete hematologic recovery [CRi]) following one cycle of treatment with inotuzumab
      ozogamicin (InO) in children with relapsed or refractory CD22+ B acute lymphoblastic leukemia
      (B-ALL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the CR/CRi rate following 2 cycles of InO therapy.

      II. To determine the safety of single agent InO administered at the adult recommended phase 2
      dose (RP2D) to pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory CD22+ B-ALL.

      III. To determine the level of minimal residual disease (MRD) by flow cytometry in responding
      patients.

      IV. To determine the incidence, severity, and outcomes of sinusoidal obstruction
      syndrome/veno-occlusive disease (SOS/VOD) of the liver in patients during InO therapy and
      following subsequent treatment, including myeloablative hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation (HSCT).

      V. To estimate the 3-year event-free survival (EFS), 3-year overall survival (OS), and among
      responders duration of CR/CRi for pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory B-ALL
      treated with InO.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive inotuzumab ozogamicin intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, and
      15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 3 months for
      1 year, and then yearly for 4 years.
