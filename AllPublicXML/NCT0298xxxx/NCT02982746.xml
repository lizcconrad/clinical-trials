    <textblock>
      At all of the follow-ups, including the worst period (between four and ten weeks), the
      intervention group reported higher scores than the control group, suggesting in this RCT that
      adopting the person-centred-care concept was a promising way to improve function and
      wellbeing in patients with HNC.

      Background: The incidence of head and neck cancer (HNC) is increasing slightly. HNC and its
      treatment may affect general domains of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and provoke a
      variety of adverse symptoms and side effects, both during and after treatment. The objective
      of this study was to compare a person-centred care intervention in terms of HRQoL,
      disease-specific symptoms or problems, with traditional care as a control group for patients
      with HNC. Methods: The intervention and control groups comprised 54 and 42 patients,
      respectively. Outcome measures used were: the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the EORTC QLQ-C35. Both
      groups answered the questionnaires at baseline and after 4, 10, 18 and 52 weeks from start of
      treatment. The questionnaires' scores were compared between groups by using independent
      samples test (Student's t-test) and non-parametric test (Mann-Whitney U Test) for continuous
      variables. For categorical data, Fisher's exact test was used. Longitudinal data were
      analysed using repeated measures in covariance pattern models. Results: At baseline, the
      intervention and control groups were comparable in terms of medical and sociodemographic
      variables, clinical characteristics, HRQoL and disease-specific symptoms or problems. At all
      the follow-up points, even during the worst period for the patients, the person-centred-care
      group consistently reported higher scores than the control group. The differences were
      numerically but not always statistically significant. When using repeated measures in
      covariance pattern models, statistically significant results were found for HNC-specific
      problems, swallowing (p= 0.014), social eating (p=0.048) and feeling ill (p=0.021).
