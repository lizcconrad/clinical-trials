  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Pancreatogenic diabetes resulted from total pancreatectomy(TP) is one of the
      reason why this form of surgery technique is seldom performed. However, with the progress of
      medical and surgical care nowadays, patients undergone TP could receive better care in
      endocrine and exocrine insufficiency. In addition, with better understanding of benign
      pancreatic tumors and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, more patients with diffused
      pancreatic disease are diagnosed; hence, the performance of TP may rise. Nevertheless, the
      quality of life of patients with pancreatogenic diabetes after TP is still currently
      controversial.

      Purpose: The purpose of this study is to (1) explore the association of fatigue, self-care
      activities and quality of life in patients with pancreatogenic diabetes after total
      pancreatectomy; (2) compare the data with diabetic patients after pancreaticoduodenectomy.

      Method: A correlational and comparative cross-sectional approach will be used. The data will
      be collected with a structured questionnaire via purposive sampling of 120 subjects in an
      outpatient pancreatic surgical department. Inclusion criteria will be the patients with: (1)
      age 20 or above, (2) conscious clear, can communicate in Mandarin or Taiwanese, (3) agree to
      participate in the study and sign informed consent. Exclusion criteria will be the patients
      diagnosed with cancer other than pancreatic cancer and under active treatment. Data will go
      through propensity score matching and will be analyzed by using descriptive statistics,
      paired t-test, Chi square test, Pearson's correlation, and conditional logistic regression.

      Anticipated achievement: The anticipated achievement of this study is to understand the
      relationships between fatigue, self-care activities, and quality of life in patients with
      pancreatogenic diabetes after pancreas surgery. In addition, through this study, the
      influence of diabetes to patients after pancreatic tumor resection can be explored; and the
      factors that influence the population's quality of life can be examined. By the filling of
      this knowledge gap, intervention can be planned accordingly to help improve the population's
      quality of life.
