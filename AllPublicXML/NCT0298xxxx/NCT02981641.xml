      The purpose of this study is to find the better radiation therapy between intraoperative
      radiotherapy (IORT) and concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT).

      The trial is funded by National High-tech R&amp;D Program (863 Program). The trial is prepared to
      be registered on the clinicaltrail.gov.

      Quality assurance plan: Every participant is enrolled or excluded by two practiced
      investigators. And two investigators participated in all steps of the trail, including the
      record of the data, and the investigators will compare the data. If the data is consistent,
      the investigators would record the data; if not, the data would be checked and decided by the
      two investigators. All the steps and data are site monitored and audited by the workers of
      research and financial department of The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical
      University Data check: The investigators compare data entered into the registry against
      predefined rules for range or consistency with other data fields in the registry. Source data
      verification to assess the accuracy, completeness, or representativeness of registry data by
      comparing the data to external data sources, including medical records and electronic case
      report forms. Data dictionary that contains detailed descriptions of each variable used by
      the registry, including the source of the variable, coding information, and normal ranges if
      relevant. Standard Operating Procedures to address registry operations and analysis
      activities, such as participants recruitment, data collection, data management, data
      analysis, reporting for adverse events, and change management. All registry operations would
      be done according to specific steps, and by two practiced investigators. Sample size
      assessment to specify the number of participants or participant years necessary to
      demonstrate an effect. According to the formula to differ advantages and disadvantages, the
      investigators need at least 100 participants to take part in the trail. The investigators can
      recruit about 120 participants every year according to previous experiences, so the
      investigators should recruit at least for one years.

      Plan for missing data: The investigators would collect as much data as possible, and the
      investigators exclude the participants who cannot cooperate on recruitment. And the
      investigators manage situations according to statistical principles where variables are
      reported as missing, unavailable, &quot;non-reported,&quot; uninterpretable, or considered missing
      because of data inconsistency or out-of-range results.

      Statistical analysis plan: Kaplan-Meier method would be used to analyze the difference of
      survival time between the two groups, and the local control rate of the two groups would be
      compared by chi square test. Statistical analyses would be performed by using IBM SPSS
      Statistics(version 20; IBM, Chicago, USA). The level of significance is defined as P &lt; 0.05.
