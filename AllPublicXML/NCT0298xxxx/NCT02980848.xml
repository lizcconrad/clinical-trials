    <textblock>
      This Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) ADVANCE study is a large, observational
      pragmatic comparative effectiveness research study using high-quality, prospectively
      collected data from BCSC registries to generate evidence on how breast density should be
      integrated into decision making around breast cancer screening and preoperative diagnostic
      work-up. We will augment existing BCSC registry infrastructure with additional prospective
      data collection and collection of patient reported outcomes (PROs), CISNET modeling of
      long-term screening outcomes, and qualitative data from focus groups with women represented
      in two aims.

      Aim 1: Compare the effectiveness of breast cancer screening using digital mammography alone
      versus digital mammography plus supplemental screening (digital breast tomosynthesis or MRI)
      by extent of breast density.

      Sub aim 1: Evaluate whether the performance of tomosynthesis improves with years of
      experience, and whether any &quot;learning curve&quot; depends on radiologist specialty (i.e., breast
      imaging specialist vs. general radiologist).

      Aim 2: Compare the effectiveness of preoperative MRI versus no MRI by extent of breast
      density among women with an initial, pathologically confirmed diagnosis of DCIS or invasive
      breast cancer.

        This study will include women age 40-74 undergoing screening mammography (Aim 1) and women
        age ≥18 with a first breast cancer diagnosis (Aim 2). We will include women in the BCSC
        cohort with mammography from 2005-2017. BCSC participants are identified from six BCSC
        breast imaging registries. The BCSC prospectively collects data during routine clinical
        practice through voluntary partnerships with radiology facilities. Women enter the BCSC
        cohort when they receive a breast-imaging exam at a participating facility.
