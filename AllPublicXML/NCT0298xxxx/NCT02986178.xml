      This is a randomized phase 2 study of oncolytic polio/rhinovirus recombinant (PVSRIPO) alone
      or in combination with the chemotherapy drug lomustine in adult patients with recurrent World
      Health Organization (WHO) grade IV malignant glioma at the Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor
      Center (PRTBTC) at Duke. The primary objective of this study is to assess the survival of
      subjects receiving PVSRIPO with or without a single dose of lomustine relative to the
      survival observed in a historical control group. The secondary objective is to assess the
      safety of PVSRIPO in combination with lomustine. Subjects will be randomized to receive
      either PVSRIPO alone, or PVSRIPO in combination with a single dose of lomustine 8 weeks after
      PVSRIPO infusion, to evaluate the impact of these treatment regimens on 24-month survival
      relative to historical controls. PVSRIPO will be delivered intratumorally by
      convection-enhanced delivery (CED) using an intracerebral catheter placed within the
      enhancing portion of the tumor. Subjects randomized to the lomustine arm will receive a
      single oral dose of 110 mg/m2 lomustine 8 weeks after PVSRIPO administration. If a subject
      has been treated with bevacizumab in the time since PVSRIPO infusion, the lomustine dose will
      be dispensed as an oral therapy at 90 mg/m2 one time only 8 weeks after PVSRIPO infusion. The
      target accrual for the study is 62 patients, 31 patients per arm. All patients who are
      randomized and receive PVSRIPO treatment will be included in efficacy and safety analyses.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have a recurrent supratentorial WHO grade IV malignant glioma based on
             imaging studies with measurable disease (≥ 1 cm and ≤ 5.5 cm of contrast-enhancing
             tumor). Prior histopathology consistent with a World Health Organization (WHO) grade
             IV malignant glioma confirmed by the study pathologist.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years of age at the time of entry into the study.

          -  Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) ≥ 70%.

          -  Prothrombin and Partial Thromboplastin Times ≤ 1.2 x normal prior to biopsy.

          -  Total bilirubin, serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamic
             pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x normal prior to biopsy.

          -  Neutrophil count ≥ 1000 prior to biopsy.

          -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9 prior to biopsy.

          -  Platelet count ≥ 125,000/µl prior to biopsy; Platelet count ≥ 100,000/µl prior to
             infusion.

          -  Creatinine ≤ 1.2 x normal range prior to biopsy.

          -  Positive serum anti-poliovirus titer prior to biopsy.

          -  The patient must have received a boost immunization with trivalent inactivated IPOL™
             (Sanofi-Pasteur) at least 1 week prior to administration of the study agent.

          -  At the time of biopsy, prior to administration of virus, the presence of recurrent
             tumor must be confirmed by histopathological analysis.

          -  A signed informed consent form approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) will
             be required for patient enrollment into the study. Patients must be able to read and
             understand the informed consent document and must sign the informed consent indicating
             that they are aware of the investigational nature of this study.

          -  Able to undergo brain MRI with and without contrast.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Females who are pregnant or breast-feeding. Female patients of child-bearing potential
             or female sexual partners (who are of child-bearing potential) of male patients must
             use at least one of the following methods of medically acceptable contraceptives:
             approved hormonal contraceptives (such as birth control pills, patches, implants or
             infusions), an intrauterine device (IUD), or a barrier method of contraception (such
             as a condom or diaphragm) used with spermicide. Because all patients are required to
             have a boost immunization of trivalent inactivated IPOL™, there should be no risk of
             transmission of a mother to her fetus after receiving intracranial PVSRIPO. As such,
             patients who become pregnant after receiving PVSRIPO will continue to be monitored in
             the same manner, i.e. per protocol, unless the assessment is contra-indicated during
             pregnancy. Partners who become pregnant will sign a Pregnant Partner Information Form
             and information regarding the pregnancy and its outcome may be collected.

          -  Patients with an impending, life-threatening cerebral herniation syndrome, based on
             the assessment of the study neurosurgeons or their designate.

          -  Patients with severe, active co-morbidity, defined as follow:

               -  Patients with an active infection requiring treatment or having an unexplained
                  febrile illness (Tmax &gt; 99.5°F/37.5°C).

                  virus infection.

               -  Patients with impaired cardiac function or clinically significant cardiac
                  disease, such as congestive heart failure requiring treatment (New York Heart
                  Association Class ≥ 2), uncontrolled hypertension or clinically significant
                  arrhythmia; QTcF &gt; 470 msec on electrocardiogram (ECG) if performed or congenital
                  long QT syndrome; acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina pectoris &lt; 3
                  months prior to study.

               -  Patients with known lung (FEV1 &lt; 50%) disease or uncontrolled diabetes mellitus.

               -  Patients with albumin allergy.

          -  Patients may not have received chemotherapy or bevacizumab ≤ 4 weeks [except for
             nitrosourea (6 weeks) or metronomic dosed chemotherapy such as daily etoposide or
             cyclophosphamide (1 week)] prior to starting the study drug unless patients have
             recovered from side effects of such therapy.

          -  Patients may not have received immunotherapy ≤ 4 weeks prior to starting the study
             drug unless patients have recovered from side effects of such therapy.

          -  Patients may not be less than 12 weeks from radiation therapy, unless progressive
             disease outside of the radiation field or 2 progressive scans at least 4 weeks apart
             or histopathologic confirmation.

          -  Patients who have not completed all standard of care treatments, including surgical

                  prior to participating in this trial.

               -  If the MGMT promoter in their tumor is known to be methylated or the MGMT
                  promoter methylation status is unknown at time of screening, patients must have
                  received at least one chemotherapy regimen prior to participating in this trial.

          -  Patients with neoplastic lesions in the brainstem, cerebellum, or spinal cord,
             radiological evidence of active (growing) multifocal disease, subependymal or
             leptomeningeal disease.

          -  Patients with undetectable anti-tetanus toxoid IgG (Immunoglobulin G).

          -  Patients with known history of agammaglobulinemia.

          -  Patients on greater than 4 mg per day of dexamethasone within the 2 weeks prior to
             admission for PVSRIPO infusion.

          -  Patients with worsening steroid myopathy (history of gradual progression of bilateral
             proximal muscle weakness, and atrophy of proximal muscle groups).

          -  Patients with prior, unrelated malignancy requiring current active treatment with the
             exception of cervical carcinoma in situ and adequately treated basal cell or squamous
             cell carcinoma of the skin.

          -  Patients with a known history of hypersensitivity to lomustine, dacarbazine, or any
