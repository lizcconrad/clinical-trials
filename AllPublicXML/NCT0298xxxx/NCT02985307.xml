  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy of a mobile telehealth short message service as a
      facilitator for weight management. Half of the participants will receive a standard care
      weight management group intervention, while the other half will receive daily text messages
      via their mobile phone to help facilitate weight loss. It is hypothesized that the
      intervention group receiving text messages will be as successful as the control group at
      achieving weight loss over a 3-month period.

    <textblock>
      Obesity, a chronic progressive disease, has become a major public health concern due to its
      increasing prevalence and association with many adverse health conditions including type 2
      diabetes, many cancers and heart disease. The number of individuals requiring weight
      management intervention is increasing necessitating the need to explore other initiatives.

      Developments in health technology are growing in popularity and there is increasing evidence
      that this type of intervention for obesity can significantly improve clinical outcomes.
      Mobile phones are a popular means of communication that provide a convenient, inexpensive
      means to deliver a health technology intervention.Short message service (SMS) by mobile phone
      has the potential to serve as an intervention medium to promote weight loss that is
      accessible and easy to use.
