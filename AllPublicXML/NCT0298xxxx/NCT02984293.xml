  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Statins are widely used drugs to treat hypercholesterolaemia. In general, they are very safe
      drugs. However, up to one third of statin users can experience muscle symptoms, which are
      most commonly mild without any conventional laboratory signs of muscle damage. However, these
      muscle symptoms can often lead to poor compliance to the cholesterol-lowering therapy,
      reducing its effectiveness. Recent data has highlighted the potential role of immune system
      in development of statin-induced muscle pain. Variation in the LILRB5 gene has been
      associated with statin intolerance. We aim to investigate the impact of LILRB5 genetic
      variability in tolerability and immune response to atorvastatin in healthy volunteers.

      The study is being undertaken at the Tayside Institute for Cardiovascular Research (TICR) in
      Ninewells Hospital, Dundee. We will recruit participants who have donated a sample to GoSHARE
      study. The participants will be healthy, and recruited according to their genotype of LILRB5
      (information available from GoSHARE). The volunteers will then enter a randomised cross-over
      study with two treatment periods. During treatment period one, all participants will be
      commenced on atorvastatin or placebo (a dummy drug). Before and at the end of the treatment
      period, blood and urine samples will be taken and a muscle symptoms questionnaire will be
      completed to assess the tolerability and immune response to the study drug exposure. After
      four weeks, the study drug is stopped for a washout period of three weeks before cross-over
      commences. Thereafter, during treatment period two, the alternate study drug will be started,
      and tolerability will be assessed similar to that in period one. The study will last
      approximately 11 weeks. The volunteers have a total of 5 visits to the TICR.
