  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I study of BTK inhibitor CT-1530 in patients with relapsed or refractory B
      cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or Waldenstrom's
      macroglobulinemia (WM).

      The purpose of the study is to determine the MTD/RP2D of CT-1530, and evaluate its safety and
      tolerability as monotherapy in subjects with relapsed or refractory B cell non-Hodgkin
      lymphoma (B-NHL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM).
