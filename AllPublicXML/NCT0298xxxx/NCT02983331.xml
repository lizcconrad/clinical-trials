  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators aimed to overview patients with specific and non-specific
      complications who admitted to intensive care unit following endoscopic retrograde
      cholangiopancreatography and had fatal course in the facility
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent elective or emergent
      endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography at semi-prone position under pharyngeal
      anesthesia (lidocaine spray) with routine monitoring (including electrocardiography,
      non-invasive blood pressure, peripheral capillary oxygen saturation) and standard sedation
      protocol (midazolam 0.02 mgkg-1; fentanyl, 1 mgkg-1; propofol 1 mgkg-1) between 2011 and 2016
      after approval of local ethics committee of Umraniye Training Hospital.
