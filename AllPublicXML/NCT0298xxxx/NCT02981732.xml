  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For nearly 112 million patients with osteoporosis in China, it is of great significance for
      preventing and treating by clearly understanding the molecular mechanism of kidney
      deficiency. Thus, the research group has demonstrated in the earlier research that CLCF1 is
      an associated gene that can regulate JAK2/STAT3 signal pathway and impact bone metabolism for
      kidney yin deficiency of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMOP). To make clear understanding of
      the direct-acting mechanism of CLCF1 for bone metabolism, this study intends to: ①observe
      impacts of low expression of CLCF1 upon immunities in mice and OPG/RANKL/RANK signal system
      using the technology of adenovirus associated virus. ②explore impacts of over-expression and
      silencing of CLCF1 on B lymphocytes by culcuturing the cells together with osteoblasts. ③
      analyze the impacts of treating kidney yin deficiency of PMOP by Liuwei Dihuang pill upon
      immunities and OPG/RANKL/RANK system, and discuss the mechanism of regulating bone metabolism
      by CLCF1 by OPG/RANKL/RANK system via the bridge between immune system and bone metabolism,
      so as to demonstrate if the hypothesis of this study that &quot;the molecular osteoimmunological
      mechanism of kidney yin deficiency of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMOP) is possibly closely
      related to the impacts of CLCF1 regulation of OPG/RANKL/RANK signal system on bone
      metabolism&quot; is right or not.
