  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this project the investigators will be using non-invasive brain stimulation on people with
      multiple sclerosis (PwMS) to improve leg muscle function. Two groups of participants will be
      recruited. One group will perform strength testing with and without the brain stimulation.
      After completing the strength testing the participants will walk for six minutes to see if
      any increases in strength translate into improve mobility. The second group of participants
      will perform a fatigue task, pulling against a wire at a low level of force, with and without
      the brain stimulation. This type of brain stimulation has been shown to transiently improve
      strength and fatigue measures in other populations, e.g. aged, Parkinson's, and improve
      cognitive abilities in people with multiple sclerosis. It is the investigator's hope that the
      increases in performance seen in other patient groups will also occur in people with multiple
      sclerosis. Future investigations will look to apply the non-invasive brain stimulation
      technique during physical rehabilitation to improve short and long term outcomes related to
      physical function.

    <description>Participants will perform leg muscle strength testing with tDCS. On a separate day they will repeat the leg muscle strength testing with Sham stimulation.
Leg strength testing will be measured by performing a series of maximal effort knee extension, knee flexion, plantar/dorsi-flexion trials. Furthermore, participants perform a 6 minute walk.</description>
