  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and radiological outcomes of iRoot SP
      as a root canal sealer in comparison with AH Plus sealer within 1-year follow up.Patients
      needing root canal treatment were enrolled and allotted into either iRoot SP group or AH Plus
      arm randomly. After root canal shaping and cleaning, the teeth were obturated according to
      their arms. Assessment of postoperative pain was done 1 week after root canal obturation
      using visual analog scale. After 1-year follow-up, clinical and radiographic evaluations were
      carried out. Statistical analysis at P &lt; 0.05 was conducted to measure difference between the
      arms.

    <description>The periapical status was assessed in the radiographs.Teeth with complete restitution of the periodontal contours were judged as &quot;healed&quot;. Teeth with a clearly decreased size of the periapical radiolucency were judged as &quot;healing&quot;. Teeth with unchanged, increased, or new periapical radiolucency were judged as &quot;failed&quot;.</description>

    <description>The root filled tooth was considered clinically successful if there was absence of clinical sign or symptom such as spontaneous pain, sensitivity to percussion or palpation, abnormal mobility, signs of pathology like abscess or sinus tract.</description>

    <description>Patients who required root canal therapy were enrolled and allotted into either iRoot SP arm or AH Plus arm randomly.For Test Arm: iRoot SP was used as a sealer. Obturation was performed with Gutta-percha cones and root canal sealer by continuous-wave condensation technique. For Control Arm: AH Plus was used as root canal sealer. The same steps were followed for obturation as in Test Arm.</description>
