      The investigators aims to evaluate the safety of in utero hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation in fetuses with alpha-thalassemia major performed at the time of in utero
      transfusion of red blood cells.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alpha thalassemia major (ATM) is almost universally fatal in utero and represents an orphan
      disease with an unmet need for effective therapies. The only current treatment to allow the
      fetus to be born is to perform in utero transfusions (IUT) of red blood cells to treat the
      anemia and avoid the complications of hydrops and fetal demise. Often, affected pregnancies
      undergo elective termination after diagnosis. Cases with prenatal diagnosis of ATM who
      receive IUT and survive to birth will ultimately require lifelong monthly blood transfusions
      or bone marrow transplant, if a suitable donor is identified.

      This is a phase 1 clinical trial to demonstrate the safety, feasibility and efficacy of
      performing in utero stem cell transplantation on fetuses affected with ATM. The investigators
      aim to recruit ten participants with a prenatal diagnosis of ATM. Participants will undergo
      bone marrow harvest and an in utero transfusion combined with maternal stem cells.
      Transplanting maternal cells into the fetus takes advantage of existing maternal-fetal
      tolerance during pregnancy. Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation into the fetus
      takes advantage of the developing fetal immune system to induce tolerance to the transplanted
      cells without using conditioning or immunosuppression. Performing stem cell transplantation
      at the same time as IUT minimizes any additional procedural risk to the fetus.

      The investigators hope to demonstrate that it is safe and feasible to perform in utero stem
      cell transplantation. Additionally, the investigators want to demonstrate postnatal chimerism
      of maternal cells so that, if a bone marrow transplant remains necessary after delivery,
      conditioning and immune suppression will not be required.

    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint is successful engraftment of maternal bone marrow- derived CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells measured by establishment of maternal participant donor cell chimerism equal to or greater than 1% donor cells in the circulation of the fetal recipient. Chimerism will be determined in cord blood at birth, or at a corrected gestational age of 40 weeks, if there is preterm delivery, followed weekly for the first 4 weeks of life, and monthly for one year in the infant to monitor the stability of engraftment.</description>
