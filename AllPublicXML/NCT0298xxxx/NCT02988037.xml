    <textblock>
      The investigators conducted a pre-post naturalistic study regarding changes observed
      associated with a 15-week course of an adapted form of dialectical behaviour therapy for
      adolescents. We measured frequency of self-harm prior to treatment and after treatment using
      the Self-Injurious Thoughts and Behaviors Interview. We also measured changes using the
      Suicide Ideation Questionnaire, Life Problems Inventory, Resiliency Scale for Children and
      Adolescents.
