  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective biomarker study on prostate cancer patients receiving Radium 223 as
      standard of care.

      Participants will take part in this research study because they have chosen Radium 223
      treatment for their prostate cancer that has spread to the bone and causing pain.
      Investigators want to find out if a blood test performed before and after the Radium 223
      treatment will help to understand how prostate cancer cells react to this therapy.

      In this pilot study, researchers want to find out if Radium 223 given as part of standard
      treatment for prostate cancer can decrease the number of circulating prostate cancer cells.
      Radium 223 kills prostate cancer cells by damaging their DNA. Other than looking at the
      changes in the number of circulating prostate cancer cells before and after Radium 223,
      researchers would also like to look at the changes in a DNA damage marker, called gamma H2AX,
      in the circulating prostate cancer cells before and after treatment with Radium 223.
      Assessing the DNA damage marker gamma H2AX is investigational. It is performed in the same
      tube of blood that is used for assessing the changes in the number of circulating prostate
      cancer cells.

    <description>Standard of Care and Blood Collection for Baseline Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) Numeration and H2AX Assay. Participants who have chosen Radium 223 treatment for their prostate cancer that has spread to the bone and causing pain. Week 1 starts with the first Radium 223 treatment and week 24 ends 4 weeks after the last or sixth Radium 223 treatment. The circulating prostate cancer cell analysis will be performed within 24 hours of blood draw. Any unused blood samples for circulating prostate cancer cell analysis will be disposed per lab protocol.</description>

    <intervention_name>Blood Collection During Standard of Care Treatment</intervention_name>
    <description>Blood collection for baseline CTC numeration and H2AX assay. Circulating prostate cancer cell analysis requires blood draw of 7.5 ml (about 1 Â½ teaspoons) of blood, to be performed at the screening, 1-2 hours before the third and sixth dose of radium 223 and 24 hours after the first, third, sixth dose of Radium 223. Standard of care Radium 223 treatment is given every 4 weeks for a total of 6 treatments and post Radium 223 follow up at week 24 is also considered standard of care. Other than these standard clinic visits and treatments, the study only requires 3 extra trips to the cancer center for blood draw at 24 hours after the first, third, sixth dose of Radium 223. Blood draws other than circulating tumor cell analysis is considered standard of care and doesn't require extra visits.</description>
