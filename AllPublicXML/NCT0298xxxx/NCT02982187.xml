  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, multi-centre, open-label, placebo-device, cross-over study, with a 2x2
      complete block design in subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) to assess
      the benefits of delivering triple therapy using a single ELLIPTA dry powder inhaler (DPI)
      (closed triple therapy) versus delivering triple therapy using two different types of DPI
      (open triple therapy). The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the proportion of
      COPD subjects who make critical errors when using a single ELLIPTA DPI versus those using
      combinations of DISKUS® with HANDIHALER®, or TURBUHALER® with HANDIHALER. At Visit 1, all
      subjects will demonstrate the use of ELLIPTA DPI, and HANDIHALER DPI in combination with
      either DISKUS DPI (in sub-study 1) or TURBUHALER DPI (in sub-study 2), based on the treatment
      sequences. At the end Visit 1, subjects will complete the inhaler preference questionnaire
      (PQ). There is no active treatment and subjects will continue to take their own prescribed
      COPD medication for the duration of the study. ELLIPTA and DISKUS are registered trademarks
      of the GSK group of companies; TURBUHALER is a registered trademark of AstraZeneca and

    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>For each inhaler to be tested in each sub-study, subjects will be asked to read the patient instruction leaflet (PIL) for the inhaler and then demonstrate inhaler use. Critical errors made by the subject while using each inhaler will be recorded by the HCP on the checklists provided. A critical error is defined as an error that is most likely to result in no or significantly reduced medication being inhaled.</description>

    <description>n each sub-study, if the subject makes any error while demonstrating the use of the inhaler after reading the PIL, the HCP will demonstrate the correct usage of the inhaler to the subject. The subject will then be asked to demonstrate inhaler use again. Any errors will be recorded by the HCP, and the process will be repeated one more time. In total, the HCP will instruct on the use of the inhaler up to two times after which there will be no further assessment. Number of HCP instructions needed to demonstrate correct inhaler use will be recorded.</description>

    <description>The inhaler preference questionnaire will be used to assesses inhaler preference based on the number of steps needed to take the medication. Subjects can check one response among 'ELLIPTA', 'DISKUS and HANDIHALER', 'TURBUHALER and HANDIHALER' and 'No preference'</description>

             years=[number of cigarettes per day ÷ 20] x number of years smoked [e.g., 10
             pack-years is equal to 20 cigarettes per day for 10 years, or 10 cigarettes per day

          -  Subjects with a current diagnosis of asthma. Subjects with a prior history of asthma
             are eligible if they have a current diagnosis of COPD.

          -  Subjects who used any ELLIPTA inhaler (participated in a clinical study of GW685698,
             GW642444, GSK573719 [fluticasone furoate, vilanterol, umeclidinium bromide], or any
             combination thereof, or placebo in an ELLIPTA inhaler study) within 24 months prior to
             Visit 0.

          -  Subjects who used any capsule system inhaler (e.g. Spiriva HANDIHALER,
             SEEBRI®/ULTIBRO® BREEZHALER®, or participated in a clinical studies of these,
             including placebo inhalers) within 24 months prior to Visit 0. SEEBRI, ULTIBRO, and
             BREEZHALER are registered trademarks of Novartis AG.

          -  Dependent on which sub-study a subject is included on they should not have any recent
             experience, within 24 months of V 0 of the following inhaler for the sub study
             included on: Sub Study 1: DISKUS inhaler (e.g., Seretide DISKUS or placebo DISKUS) and
             Sub Study 2:TURBUHALER (e.g. Symbicort TURBUHALER or placebo TURBUHALER)

          -  Subjects with a known or suspected alcohol or drug abuse at Visit 1 which in the
             opinion of the investigator could interfere with the subject's proper completion of
             the protocol requirement

          -  A history of hypersensitivity to any components of the study inhaler (e.g., lactose,
             magnesium stearate). In addition, subjects with a history of severe milk protein
             allergy that, in the opinion of the study physician, contraindicates participation
             will also be excluded.

          -  Subjects who have received an investigational drug and/or medical device within 30
             days of entry into this study (Screening/Visit 1), or within five drug half-lives of
             the investigational drug, whichever is longer

          -  In the opinion of the investigator, any subject who is unable to read and/or would not
             be able to complete a questionnaire and understand verbal instructions.
