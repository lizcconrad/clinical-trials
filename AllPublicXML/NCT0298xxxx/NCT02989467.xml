  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Gastric Emptying Half-Time of Solids as Measured by Scintigraphy</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 3, approximately 2 hours after radiolabeled meal is ingested</time_frame>
    <description>The time for half of the ingested solids to leave the stomach.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Satiation Expressed as Volume to Fullness</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 4, approximately 30 minutes after liquid meal</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will do a satiation/nutrient drink test, consuming Ensure at a relatively constant rate of 30 ml/min. Subjects will record their sensations every 5 minutes using a numerical scale from 0-5, with level 0 being no symptoms, level 3 corresponding to fullness sensation after a typical meal, and level 5 corresponding to the maximal tolerated volume (maximum or unbearable fullness/satiation). This measure is the volume consumed when the fullness sensation reaches level 3.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fasting Gastric Volume as Measured by Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 5, approximately 15 minutes after radioactive marker is administered</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will arrive to the Clinical Research and Trials Unit (CRTU) fasting. A radioactive marker will be administered intravenously. After a 10-15 minute wait period a fasting scan will be acquired using a dual-head gamma camera.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Postprandial Gastric Volume as Measured by SPECT</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 5, approximately 30 minutes after liquid meal</time_frame>
    <description>At the completion of the fasting scan, the subject will consume 300 ml of Ensure followed by a postprandial scan using a dual-head gamma camera.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Accommodation Volume as Measured by SPECT</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 5, approximately 30 minutes after liquid meal</time_frame>
    <description>This variable is calculated as postprandial gastric volume minus fasting volume.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Solid Gastric Emptying: Proportion of Meal Emptied at 2 Hours</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 3, approximately 2 hours after radiolabeled meal is ingested</time_frame>
    <description>On Day 3, subjects will take part in a gastric emptying by scintigraphy test. Subjects will be given a scrambled egg breakfast with toast and a glass of milk. The eggs and milk contain a small amount of radioactive substance. At the completion of the meal, subjects will stand in front of a special camera and pictures were taken at specific intervals. This outcome measure is the proportion of the radiolabeled meal emptied at 2 hours.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Solid Gastric Emptying: Proportion of Meal Emptied at 4 Hours</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 3, approximately 4 hours after radiolabeled meal is ingested</time_frame>
    <description>On Day 3, subjects will take part in a gastric emptying by scintigraphy test. Subjects will be given a scrambled egg breakfast with toast and a glass of milk. The eggs and milk contain a small amount of radioactive substance. At the completion of the meal, subjects will stand in front of a special camera and pictures were taken at specific intervals. This outcome measure is the proportion of the radiolabeled meal emptied at 4 hours.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximum Tolerated Volume on Satiation Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 4, approximately 30 minutes after liquid meal</time_frame>
    <description>On Day 4, subjects will do a satiation/nutrient drink test. Participants will record their sensations every 5 minutes using a numerical scale from 0-5, with level 0 being no symptoms, level 3 corresponding to fullness sensation after a typical meal, and level 5 corresponding to the maximal tolerated volume (maximum or unbearable fullness/satiation). This measure is the volume consumed when the fullness sensation reaches level 5.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Individual Symptom Scores (Nausea, Bloating, Fullness, Pain) on Satiation Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 4, approximately 30 minutes after liquid meal</time_frame>
    <description>Postprandial symptoms of nausea, bloating, fullness, and pain will be measured using 100 mm horizontal visual analog scales, with the words &quot;none&quot; and &quot;worst ever&quot; anchored at each end.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Aggregate Symptoms Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 4, approximately 1 hour after liquid meal</time_frame>
    <description>Postprandial symptoms of nausea, bloating, fullness, and pain will be measured using 100 mm horizontal visual analog scales, with the words &quot;none&quot; and &quot;worst ever&quot; anchored at each end. The aggregate symptoms score is calculated by adding the mean individual scores. The lowest possible score would be 0 (none) and the highest maximum score possible is 400 (worst ever).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Gastric Volume Ratio</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 5, approximately 1 hour after radioactive marker is administered</time_frame>
    <description>Postprandial/fasting gastric volume</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Absolute postprandial gastric volume</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 5, approximately 1 hour after radioactive marker is administered</time_frame>
    <description>This is the total postprandial gastric volume</description>
