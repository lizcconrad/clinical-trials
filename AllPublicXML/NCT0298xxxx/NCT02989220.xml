  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some women experience the pain of miscarriage on numerous occasions. Studies show that these
      women experience feelings of anxiety and distress during the early stages of a new pregnancy
      as they worry another miscarriage will occur. This study will investigate whether a coping
      strategy, developed for a similar group of women, would be acceptable and useful to women
      suffering recurrent miscarriage, and reduce the anxiety and worry they experience. A
      secondary aim of the study is to develop a deeper understanding of the experiences and
      feelings of women in the early stages of a new pregnancy, following multiple miscarriages.
