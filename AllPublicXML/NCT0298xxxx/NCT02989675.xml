      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of dextrose administration in severely
      sick children admitted to hospital with low-glycaemia.

      The problem: Mortality in children remains high in sub-Saharan African hospitals. While
      antimalarial drugs, antibiotics and other definitive treatments are well understood, the role
      of emergency care with supportive therapies such as maintaining normal glucose and
      electrolyte balances, has been given limited attention. Hypoglycaemia is common in children
      admitted to hospital in low-income settings. The current definition of hypoglycaemia is a
      blood glucose level of less than 2.5mmol/l. Outcomes for these children are poor, with a
      mortality rate of up to 42%. An increased mortality has also been reported among acutely ill
      children with low-glycaemia, defined as a blood glucose level of 2.5-5.0mmol/l. The reason
      for increased mortality rates is not fully understood.

      Study objective: To determine the impact on mortality of a raised treatment cut-off level for
      paediatric hypoglycaemia, from 2.5mmol/l to 5.0mmol/l.

      Methodology: Severely ill children admitted to two central Malawian hospitals; Queen
      Elisabeth Central Hospital, Blantyre and Zomba Central Hospital, with low-glycaemia
      (2.5-5.0mmol/l) will be randomised into intervention or control groups. The intervention
      group will be treated with an intravenous bolus of 10% dextrose 5ml/kg followed by a dextrose
      infusion in addition to standard care while the control group will receive standard care
      only. Children will be followed until discharge from hospital or death. Primary end-point is
      in-hospital mortality.

      Enrolment started at Queen Elisabeth Central Hospital on Dec 5th 2016. Due to a slow
      enrolment rate a second site at Zomba Central Hospital has been opened to start enrolment on
      October 17th, 2017 in order for the project to be completed in December 2019.
