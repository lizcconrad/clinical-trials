  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of the transdisciplinary team of Human Immunology Virus (HIV) and
      Tobacco funded researchers is to test if tailoring nicotine replacement doses to temper these
      excessive levels will enhance the efficacy of the intervention. To test researchers proposed
      model 600 people living with HIV (PLWH) ready to quit smokers will be enrolled in a
      double-blind randomized clinical trial intent-to-treat design, comparing a standard
      well-validated brief smoking intervention, that following national guidelines + nicotine
      replacement therapy (NRT), versus the tailored one (brief smoking intervention + personalized
      doses of nicotine replacement therapy). The primary outcome for this study will be rates of
      smoking cessation, point prevalence abstinence (prior 7 and prior 30 days), and verified
      continuous abstinence 3-, 6-, and 12-months post scheduled quit day.

      The overall objective of the transdisciplinary team of Human Immunology Virus (HIV) and
      Tobacco funded researchers is to test if tailoring nicotine replacement doses to temper these
      excessive levels will enhance the efficacy of the intervention. This will be accomplished by
      assessing: 1) pre-trial plasma levels, 2) doing genotyping, which to researchers knowledge
      has not been used in cessation studies among people living with HIV (PLWH), and 3) providing
      tailored feedback to the participants, based on the assumption that the higher the knowledge
      and perception of risk, the higher the interest in modifying a risky behavior(s). To test
      researchers proposed model based in proven smoking prevention and control methods 600 PLWH
      ready to quit smokers will be enrolled in a double-blind randomized clinical trial
      intent-to-treat design, comparing a standard well-validated brief smoking intervention, that
      following national guidelines will consist on brief advice + nicotine replacement therapy,
      versus the tailored one (brief smoking intervention + personalized doses of nicotine
      replacement therapy (NRT). The primary outcome for this study will be rates of smoking
      cessation, point prevalence abstinence (prior 7 and prior 30 days), and verified continuous
      abstinence 3-, 6-, and 12-months post scheduled quit day. The knowledge gained here has the
      potential to provide a more complete bio-behavioral model to the intervention field. The
      proposed study if successful will provide a new tailored, replicable, and manual-based
      intervention for people living with HIV. It can also provide much need it information in
      regards to key mediators and moderators of smoking cessation interventions in this vulnerable
      population. Researchers long term goal is to reduce the burden of one of the most devastating
      causes of morbi-mortality in researchers time and improve their quality of life. The study
      could also pave the path to use a similar model to tailor smoking interventions for other
      populations (e.g., menthol users, older women, adolescents, older adults).
