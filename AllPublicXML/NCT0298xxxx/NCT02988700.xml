    <textblock>
      Caudal analgesia along with general anesthesia is a very popular regional technique for
      prolonged postoperative analgesia in different pediatric surgical procedures where the
      surgical site is sub-umbilical. Caudal anesthetics usually provide analgesia for
      approximately 4-6 hours.

      Recently, the use of spinal anesthesia in infants and children requiring surgeries of
      sub-umbilical region is gaining considerable popularity worldwide.

      - The ease of performance and the safety regarding cardio-respiratory functions makes spinal
      anesthesia as an alternative to general anesthesia in infants and children undergoing
      surgeries of sub-umbilical regions.

      The historic view that young children neither respond to, nor remember, painful experiences
      to the same degree as adults is no longer thought to be true. About 40% of pediatric surgical
      patients experienced moderate or severe postoperative pain and 75% had insufficient
      analgesia.

      -Pediatric acute pain services use techniques of concurrent or co-analgesia based on four
      classes of analgesics, namely local anesthetics, opioids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
      drugs (NSAIDs), and acetaminophen (paracetamol).
