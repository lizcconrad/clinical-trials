      The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of a one-month supplementation with
      Phytostandard® Eschscholtzia and valerian on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), in insomniac
      so-called adjustment subjects (occasional or short-term insomnia)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For this study, 40 patients are going to be included. They will have a supplementation of
      Phytostandard® Eschscholtzia and valerian, from 2 to 4 tablets per day during 28 days.

      on the one hand, during the two visits (inclusion and follow-up), the investigator completes
      the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A). During the inclusion visit, he completes with his patient
      the epworth scale.

      on the other hand, patients complete ISI twice : just after the inclusion visit and just
      before the follow-up visit. He completes two sleep schedules, the first one during the first
      week of complement and the second one during the fourth.
