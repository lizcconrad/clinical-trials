  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this explorative randomized clinical study, the investigators aim to study metabolic,
      cellular, and molecular changes that occur during weight loss in obese subjects with and
      without type 2 diabetes. Using novel &quot;imiomics&quot; (imaging technique using PET/MR
      bioinformatics) analyses to examine possible metabolic differences between energy restricted
      diet and gastric by-pass surgery on whole-body and tissue specific insulin sensitivity,
      glucose tolerance, metabolite and protein profiles, fatty acid metabolism, ectopic fat
      content, and gene expression in adipose tissue. This study aims to identify novel biomarkers
      and drug targets for type 2 diabetes as well as validate promising and established biomarkers
      in an interventional model for improved glucose metabolism.

    <textblock>
      By using omics platforms such as genomics, proteomics and metabolomics we can have large
      amount of information about metabolic changes at both tissue and whole body level. In
      parallel to this, clinical imaging modalities such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and
      Positron Emission Tomography (PET) have developed rapidly, allowing for whole-body studies of
      how different tissues are involved in systemic diseases. Furthermore, new hybrid systems such
      as integrated PET-MRI provide combined information of human morphology and function. The
      integration of PET with MRI reduces the radiation dose compared with PET-CT to acceptable
      levels for metabolic studies. To handle the large amounts of data from these examinations we
      are currently developing an image analysis concept, &quot;Imiomics&quot;, that allows holistic analysis
      of whole-body imaging data with integration of non-imaging data. In the current study, we
      plan to use PET-MRI as well as imiomics methodology, together with gold standard methodology
      to assess insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance in vivo. We aim to conduct a randomized
      study (CRUDOS study; Caloric Restriction Using Diet Or Surgery) to study glycometabolic
      effects before and after gastric bypass surgery and low-calorie diet in subjects at different
      stages of glucose tolerance (i.e. obese subjects with and without T2D).
