    <textblock>
      The UPnRIDE Powered Wheelchair device is a product which changes people position from sitting
      to standing and standing to sitting. The product provides indoor and outdoor mobility.

      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of the UPnRIDE powered wheelchair as
      an outdoor and indoor mobility device by individuals with walking impairment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A new powered wheelchair has recently been developed to address the ability of the user to be
      able to position them in an upright, standing position. This new device is called the UPnRIDE
      powered wheelchair and is different from other upright wheelchairs because current standing
      wheelchair models have limited mobility in the standing position. The UPnRIDE is an upright
      or seated mobility device that is intended to provide full upright standing posture in a
      mobile powered wheelchair. The UPnRIDE powered wheelchair provides wheelchair and scooter
      users the ability to engage in society in either a standing (upright mobility) or seated
      position (seated mobility). Additionally, the option to have upright posture throughout the
      day may have the potential to improve some of the secondary medical conditions associated
      with the extreme sedentary lifestyle that paralysis from SCI imposes. This wheeled, motorized
      device can provide mobility to most urban environment situations by being able to be
      navigated indoors and outdoors and over different surfaces in both the standing or seated
      positions.
