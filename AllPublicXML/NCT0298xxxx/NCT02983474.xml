    <textblock>
      The member of National Evidence-based Healthcare Collaborating Agency and the planning
      committee of Korean Association of hepato-biliary pancreatic Surgery established the protocol
      of Korean Surgical Quality Improvement Program (KSQIP) with verifying variables of American
      College of Surgeons - National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP and National
      Clinical Database (NCD) of Japan; demographics, preoperative information, laboratory values,
      operation finding, general occurrences, postoperative occurrences, and follow-up data to
      develop post cholecystectomy complication risk model.

      The 50 surgeons from 20 hospitals have decided to participated in the primary prospective
      study to apply KSQIP to cholecystectomy. The investigators developed web-based database
      system (http://www.ksqip.org/gb) and surgical clinical reviewer of each hospital will fill
      out the case report form. Finally, the investigators will provide a risk-adjusted surgical
      risk calculator and feedback system for reducing complication.
