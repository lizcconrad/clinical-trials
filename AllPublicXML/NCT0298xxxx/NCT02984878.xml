      To compare improvement with retreatment for all subjects undergoing correction of nasolabial
      folds (NLFs) in the initial SYM2014-02 study, who were retreated with Revanesse Ultra at
      Visit 6/Week 24 and to determine the safety of repeat injections of Revanesse Ultra. The
      retreatment phase was optional.

      The subjects completing the initial phase of the SYM2014-02 study (NCT02987205) who had
      returned to baseline Wrinkle Severity Rating Scale (WSRS) score or as needed for optimal
      correction if WSRS scores had not returned to baseline, were offered the option for
      retreatment with Revanesse Ultra

      Visit 6/Week 24 (± 7 days) optional open-label retreatment with Revanesse Ultra for subjects
      who had returned to baseline Wrinkle Severity Rating Scale (WSRS) score or as needed for
      optimal correction if WSRS scores had not returned to baseline; End of Study for subjects not
      being retreated

      Visit 7/Week 28 (± 7 days) follow-up for retreated subjects

      Visit 8/Week 52 (± 7 days) End of Study for retreated subjects

      A telephone contact was performed at Week 40 (± 7 days) for retreated subjects to assess
      adverse events (AEs) and concomitant medications.

      This report presents the results for all subjects who received optional open-label
      retreatment with Revanesse Ultra at Visit 6/Week 24.

      This study was performed in compliance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP), including the
      archiving of essential documents.

      Number of Subjects (Planned and Analyzed): Seventy-one subjects received retreatment.

    <description>Change in the Wrinkle Severity Rating Scale (WSRS) With Subjects From Both the Retreatment and the Optimal Correction Groups Achieving Similar WSRS Scores at Visit 8/Week 52 - WSRS Score categories: 1. Absent - No visible fold; continuous skin line. 2. Mild - Shallow but visible fold with a slight indentation; minor facial feature; implant is expected to produce a slight improvement in appearance. 3. Moderate - Moderately deep folds; clear facial feature visible at normal appearance but not when stretched; excellent correction is expected from injectable implant. 4. Severe - Very long and deep folds; prominent facial feature; less than 2 mm visible when stretched; significant improvement is expected from injectable implant. 5. Extreme - Extremely deep and long folds, detrimental to facial appearance; 2 to 4 mm visible V-shaped fold when stretched; unlikely to have satisfactory correction with injectable implant alone. An increase in the WSRS score indicates a worsening of severity.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects from the SYM2014-02 initial study who were:

          -  Men or women at least 22 years of age with two fully visible bilateral nasolabial
             folds each with a WSRS score of 3 or 4 (moderate or severe) that may have been
             corrected with an injectable dermal filler.

          -  Subjects were eligible for retreatment when WSRS scores had returned to baseline for
             either or both NLFs (retreatment group).

          -  If scores had not returned to baseline, subjects were also eligible to be injected for
             either one or both NLFs as needed to achieve optimal correction (optimal correction
             group).

        <title>Change in the Wrinkle Severity Rating Scale (WSRS) With Subjects From Both the Retreatment and the Optimal Correction Groups - WSRS Scores at Visit 8/Week 52</title>
        <description>Change in the Wrinkle Severity Rating Scale (WSRS) With Subjects From Both the Retreatment and the Optimal Correction Groups Achieving Similar WSRS Scores at Visit 8/Week 52 - WSRS Score categories: 1. Absent - No visible fold; continuous skin line. 2. Mild - Shallow but visible fold with a slight indentation; minor facial feature; implant is expected to produce a slight improvement in appearance. 3. Moderate - Moderately deep folds; clear facial feature visible at normal appearance but not when stretched; excellent correction is expected from injectable implant. 4. Severe - Very long and deep folds; prominent facial feature; less than 2 mm visible when stretched; significant improvement is expected from injectable implant. 5. Extreme - Extremely deep and long folds, detrimental to facial appearance; 2 to 4 mm visible V-shaped fold when stretched; unlikely to have satisfactory correction with injectable implant alone. An increase in the WSRS score indicates a worsening of severity.</description>
