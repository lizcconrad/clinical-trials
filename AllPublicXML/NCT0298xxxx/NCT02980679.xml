  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A 99mTc Pertechnetate (G-PERT) scan is a nuclear medicine test that can create an image of
      the thyroid gland and other organs. G-PERT is approved by Health Canada for the direct
      imaging and measurement of thyroid uptake.

      Doctors and researchers at the University of Alberta have developed a new method of producing
      99mTc Pertechnetate (called CTC). It is made in a cyclotron at the Medical Isotope and
      Cyclotron Facility (MICF) at the University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta. This new
      production method will provide another source of 99mTc Pertechnetate. The aim of this study
      is to confirm that CTC is safe and can be used interchangeably with G-PERT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The clinical trial will be a Phase III, prospective, crossover, image interpretation blinded,
      single site study. All subjects will receive Tc-99m pertechnetate (one CTC and one G-PERT
      administration separated by at least 48 hours) and subsequently be imaged for thyroid uptake
      and whole body biodistribution. The order of the scans will be randomized. The thyroid image
      will be interpreted for uptake / no uptake in the thyroid, and the whole body biodistribution
      image will be interpreted for uptake / no uptake in selected anatomical sites. Interpretation
      of thyroid imaging results will be compared with other clinical findings (such as
      pre-surgical ultrasound, fine needle aspirate, and post-surgical pathology results, when
      available). All imaging assessments will be conducted by 1 blinded Nuclear Medicine
      physician. A safety evaluation will be conducted on all subjects receiving CTC, consisting of
      vital signs, haematology and SMA-12 serum biochemistry profile (pre-injection and
      post-imaging), and, for both CTC and G-PERT, an adverse event assessment (until the subject
      leaves the Nuclear Medicine department) after each administration.
