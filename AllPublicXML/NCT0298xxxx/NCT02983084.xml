  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized clinical trial (RCT) is to compare traditional CuNiTi
      archwires and a recently marketed multiforce version of the same material for the initial
      alignment and leveling of dental arches, as well as the expression of EARR in adult
      orthodontic patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized clinical trial utilizing multiforce and CuNiTi orthodontic archwires to
      align and level dental arches and compare their results. A three group double blind parallel
      single site study at IUSD will be used.

      Patients that meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be recruited from the IUSD
      orthodontic clinic. The subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the three groups by the
      study statistician. Subjects, examiners providing subject treatment, and examiners measuring
      study outcomes will be blinded to treatment assignment.

      Study population indicates a sample size of 105 subjects, each group containing 35 clinical
      subjects.

      Patients will be treated with Ormco Titanium Orthos fixed appliances and defined archwire
      sequence according to a clinical protocol. During the six-month study period, subjects will
      be seen approximately every 4 (four) weeks for regular standard of care appointments that
      will include archwire monitoring, photography and questionnaire completions. Final study
      records will be taken at the end of the study period.
