    <textblock>
      The aim is to assess if physiotherapists attending inpatients at elective orthopaedic wards
      can predict the future course (post hospitalisation) of recovery of patients undergoing KA.
      The prediction is made at hospital discharge using a 1-10 numerical rating scale (1=poor
      prognosis; 10=best prognosis).

      To identify candidate prognostic factors, the therapist are asked to qualify their prognosis
      narratively, by listing at least 3-5 factors that they consider important for their projected
      prognosis score. There will be no maximum number of factors the physiotherapist can list.

    <measure>Questionnaire regarding postoperative rehabilitation</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 12 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>This is a questionnaire that includes questions regarding the postoperative rehabilitation (i.e., setting, participation, type, duration, frequency, and degree of supervision). Details from post-operative rehabilitation provided at one of the investigational sites will be obtained from the patients' hospital records</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Transition ratings of global perceived effect</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 12 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>This is a transition questionnaire on which the participants initially answers if their current state is &quot;unchanged, worse&quot; or &quot;better&quot; compared to pre-surgery. An &quot;unchanged&quot; equals a transition score of 0. If the participant answers &quot;worse&quot;, the participant is asked to rate the degree of worsening on a 7 point Likert scale, and the corresponding scores range from -1 to -7. Correspondingly, if a participant answers &quot;better&quot;, the participant is asked to rate the degree of improvement on a 7 point Likert scale, and the corresponding scores range from 1 to 7. Thus the global perceived effect score range from -7 (worsening) to 7 (improvement), with the mid-point - 0 - representing no change.</description>

    <measure>Adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 12 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Survey of the participants for events that patients have experienced during the observation period. These events will be self-reported using a questionnaire with ample space for free text. An event will be defined as causing limitations in daily activities, Sports/Recreational activities or work limitations together with symptoms causing participants to seek medical care. The events may be unrelated to the knee (such as development or exacerbation of comorbidities) and the events are not necessarily causally linked to the knee surgery</description>

        Patients undergoing primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) for treatment of knee
        osteoarthritis. All patients from december 2016 to december 2017 will be invited to
        participate.

        If it is not possible to reach the set sample size within the set timeframe, recruitment
        will continue until the numbers specified in the a priori sample size calculation are
        reached. Should the set sample size be reached ahead of time, recruitment will stop.
