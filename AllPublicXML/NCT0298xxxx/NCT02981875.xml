      Children with reading eye movement problems were recruited for this study. The treatment
      group was provided with oculomotor training for 8 weeks, the control group was given placebo
      exercises.

      Purpose of study Reading is one of the integral elements for learning and poor readers were
      reported to have less efficient reading eye movements. They were typically characterized by
      having higher number in fixation and regression, reduced reading speed and perceptual span.
      The purpose of this study was to investigate if vision therapy which limited to training of
      oculomotor skills can improve reading eye movement.

      Methodology This was a randomized, prospective study. 30 subjects aged from 8-9 years of age
      with reading difficulties and reading eye movement problems were recruited. They all have
      normal intelligence and ocular health, but failed to meet the Taylor reading eye movement
      norms when tested with the Visagraph III. The subjects were randomly assigned into either the
      treatment group (15) or the control group (15). The treatment group had to go through a
      course of oculomotor vision therapy and the control group was given placebo exercises. Vision
      therapy for the treatment group involved 8 weeks of training (office training - 3 times a
      week, 30 min per session; home training - 4 times a week, 30 min per session). Office
      training involved the use of Vis-Flex (Visual Flexibility Trainer - an electronic device with
      L.E.D. lights which can display various flashing patterns at variable speeds). Home training
      involved several saccadic eye movement exercises. Subjects and parents were also asked to
      grade the reading symptoms checklist before and after the training.
