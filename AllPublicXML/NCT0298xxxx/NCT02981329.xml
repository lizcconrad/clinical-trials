  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether metformin is effective in the treatment for
      sickle cell anemia (SCA) and non-transfusion dependent thalassemia (NTDT).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose escalation, pilot study for subjects with sickle cell anemia (SCA) disease and
      non-transfusion dependent thalassemia (NTDT) to determine if metformin has a beneficial
      effect on the treatment of SCA and NTDT patients.

      In addition the following items will also occur:

      Data Collection will occur from subject's medical records in regards to their SCA or NTDT
      medical history.

      Subjects will be asked to completed questionnaires to access increase or decrease of quality
      of life.

      Biological samples (blood and urine) will be collected throughout the study to access the
      effects the study drug has on SCA and NTDT disease treatment, general health, and genetic
      analysis.

    <ipd_description>The leftover blood samples for genetic analysis will be banked indefinitely for future ancillary studies. Investigator who desires access to these samples must present their research idea prior to receiving access to the samples. The samples will be shared with researchers affiliated with Texas Children's Hospital, Baylor College of Medicine and/or other hematology collaborators for future studies associated with hematologic diseases and drugs used to treat such diseases. The recipient investigators are required to provide proof of IRB approval or exemption as per local IRB guidelines before the sample can be released for research purposes. After receipt of IRB approval, coded samples will be distributed to the recipient investigator.</ipd_description>
