  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Loss of elbow range of motion can significantly affect activities of daily living. Measuring
      elbow range of motion is critical for tracking post surgical outcomes. This study seeks to
      validate the ability to validate self photography as a means of followup through long
      distance correspondence.

    <textblock>
      Loss of elbow range of motion is common after trauma and can significantly affect activities
      of daily living. Patients across the country travel to tertiary referral centers to have this
      problem addressed. Followup is critical and can often be difficult given distances between
      patients home and their healthcare provider. Measuring postoperative outcomes requires
      accurate and reliable documentation of range of motion. Previously, the investigators have
      validated digital photography as a means of accurately measuring elbow range of motion. In
      that study, photographs were taken by a non-professional photographer. With the advance in
      personal technology, patients now have the ability to take photos themselves. This study
      seeks to validate self photography, which will ultimately improve patient follow up and
      improve clinical monitoring

    <measure>Digital photo-based elbow range of motion measurement compared to traditional goniometry</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will follow instructions to take a photograph of themselves capturing elbow range of motion (flexion, extension, supination and pronation). Elbow range of motion will then be measured clinically with a goniometer. Patient's active participation will be 1 day. Range of motion will be measured off of photographs 1 month after capturing pictures and repeated 2 weeks later</description>
