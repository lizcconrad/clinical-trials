        Patients with advanced cancer, who have not received chemo- or radiotherapy in the last 4
        weeks prior to screening, will be screened for nausea and/or vomiting following evaluation
        of the primary inclusion-/exclusion criteria. The patients can be located either in the
        hospital departments, at home or in a hospice.
