      recanalization by mechanical endovascular treatment in patients with acute ischemic stroke
      and proximal arterial occlusion.

      The current clinical trial is an investigator-initiated one, and it is conducted under the
      multi-center, randomized, open-label, prospective design. The subjects meeting
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be assigned to the treatment group or the control group.
      The randomization ratio is 1:1. The subjects of the treatment group will receive a 2-day
      hypothermia therapy followed by the process of recovery of temperature within 30 hours (the
      recovery phase). After 3 months of the onset of symptoms, mRS scores are measured. This is
      followed by the closure of the clinical trial.

    <description>All the patients receive standard treatment modalities for stroke, which are applicable to the international treatment guidelines.
In all the patients, neurological assessments and NIHSS scoring are performed on a daily basis for 4 days with the help of board-certified nurses or specialists in stroke.
Blood pressure, respiratory rate and heart rate are measured at least once at a 4-hour interval for 4 days.
Using an esophageal thermometer, the central temperature is measured at a 2-hour interval for 5 days.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who submitted a written informed consent prior to the participation in the
             current clinical trial (If the subjects have conditions that they cannot decide on
             study participation according to their own will, they would participate in the study
             after their legal representatives submitted a written informed consent form. During
             the period of study participation, if patients' medical conditions are improved, the
             written informed consent should be submitted again.)

          2. Patients with ischemic stroke attributed to carotid artery or middle cerebral artery
             occlusion achieved successful recanalization (TICI 2b or 3) immediately after
             endovascular treatment within 8 hours of symptom onset: Onset time was defined as the
