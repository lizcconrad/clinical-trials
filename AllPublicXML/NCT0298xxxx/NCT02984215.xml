  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Plasma-cell post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorders (PC-PTLD) are rare monomorphic
      PTLD divided into plasma cell myeloma (PCM) and plasmacytoma-like lesion (PLL) PTLD. To date,
      there is no exhaustive published cytogenetic data on PC-PTLD. The investigators report
      array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) of 10 cases of PCM and PLL-PTLD.

        We conducted a retrospective analysis between 1990 and 2012 of all consecutive cases of PCM
        and PLL-PTLD collected in the Centre Hospitalier Lyon Sud (CHLS, 6 cases) and in Necker -
        Enfants Malades Hospital in Paris (4 cases). There were 4 females and 6 males. Among the 8
        adults, 6 had received a kidney transplant, 1 a heart transplant and one a lung transplant.
        Among the 2 children, one had received a heart transplant and one an allogeneic stem cell
        transplantation with a matched unrelated donor. Immunosuppressive regimens were
        heterogeneous.
