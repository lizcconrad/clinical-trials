    <textblock>
      Obesity is associated with a decrease in skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity. Aerobic
      exercise can increase insulin sensitivity in the few hours following exercise, however the
      cellular mechanisms are not completely understood. The current project is to investigate
      mechanisms of exercise improvements to skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity.

      Study Overview: We are investigating the mechanisms by which exercise improves the response
      of skeletal muscle to insulin in lean and obese adults. Participants will complete 4 study
      visits consisting of: 1) screening visit, 2) maximal exercise test visit, and then a
      randomized order of 3) a resting metabolic study visit, and 4) an exercise metabolic study
      visit. Metabolic study visits for resting and exercise conditions will be identical, other
      than remaining sedentary or performing exercise. Skeletal muscle biopsy samples will be
      collected during resting, immediately post-exercise and during insulin stimulated conditions.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males or Females

          -  Aged 18-45 years

          -  Normal weight (body mass index [BMI] 18-26 kg/m2) or obese (BMI 30-46 kg/m2)

          -  Sedentary (&lt; 1 hour of planned physical activity per week for ≥ 6 months)

          -  Weight stable (&lt; 2 kg change in body mass for ≥ 6 months)

          -  Non-smokers (no tobacco or nicotine use for ≥ 1 year)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Hypertension (systolic blood pressure &gt;140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90mmHg)

          -  Chronic health condition including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, treated
             hypertension, cancer, anemia, uncontrolled hyper- or hypothyroidism.

          -  Pregnant, nursing, irregular menses or post-menopausal (if female)

          -  Hyperglycemia (fasting glucose &gt;126 mg/dl)

          -  Hypercholesterolemia (fasting LDL&gt;140mg/dl)

          -  Hemoglobin &lt; 13.0 g/dl (males), &lt; 11.5 g/dl (females)

          -  Compromised renal function (outside 135-145 mmol/L sodium, 3.5-5.1 mmol/L potassium)

          -  Lidocaine allergy

          -  Medications including β-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, insulin,
             thiazolidinediones, metformin, sulfonylureas, chronic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
             use, anti-coagulant (e.g. warfarin), current antibiotics, opiates, monoamine oxidase
             inhibitors, benzodiazepines, or others that may impact the study outcomes

          -  Any physical limitation that prevents a participant from safely completing the
             exercise test

          -  Due to the risks associated with the current protocol, individuals with a diminished
             capacity to consent will be excluded. Similarly, due to the need for constant,
             accurate participant monitoring during metabolic study activities, participants will
             need to clearly understand verbal and written English. Participants who cannot clearly
             understand verbal and written English will be excluded.
