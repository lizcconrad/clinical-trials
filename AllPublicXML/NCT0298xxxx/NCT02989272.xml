  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is a prospective, comparative, randomized, double-blind clinical trial whose hypothesis is
      that pre-treatment with magnesium sulfate, due to its action at the neuromuscular
      junction,potentiate the duration of deep neuromuscular block following rocuronium
      curarization in patients undergoing general anesthesia. Magnesium sulphate has gained
      prominence as an adjuvant drug in anesthesia. Its use is associated with potentiation of
      neuromuscular blockade among other functions.

      The deep neuromuscular block is defined as the one obtained by the absence of response to the
      sequence of four Stimuli and the presence of one or more simple stimuli in post-tetanic
      counts . There is no literature description of the role of magnesium sulphate in Duration of
      the deep neuromuscular block obtained after the muscle relaxation of patients with rocuronium
      This study is justified because extending the clinical duration of neuromuscular blockers may
      translate into gains for surgeries that require deep and long-lasting muscle relaxation as in
      laparoscopic and robotic surgeries. This block allows lower inflation pressures of the
      pneumoperitoneum to be obtained, as a result, there is a lower inflammatory and
      cardiorespiratory repercussion for the patient

      Patients will be selected from those who use the General Surgery Service of the Federal
      Hospital of Bonsucesso for medical indication or own will, obeying the inclusion and
      exclusion criteria. After signing the informed consent, they will be evaluated clinically and
      laboratorially, according to the routine of preoperative exams and pre-anesthetic outpatient
      evaluation. Patients will be allocated to one of two groups: control group (30 patients), who
      will receive pretreatment by venous infusion of saline solution; And magnesium group (30
      patients) who will receive pretreatment by intravenous infusion of magnesium sulfate 60 mg /
      kg according to the random number sequence generated electronically through the QuickCalcs
      program (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) Because it is a double-blind study, both the
      researcher and the patient will not know which of the groups will be studied.

      The principal investigator will be responsible for the delivery of sealed envelope containing
      the sequence of cases allocated in each of the groups to another anesthesiologist who will
      prepare the solution (saline or magnesium sulphate) and will record in a specific file in
      which group the volunteer was Allocated. Again the envelope will be sealed for tabulation
      later, without the knowledge of the researcher. The same principal investigator will be in
      charge of the measurement and recording of the data collected.
