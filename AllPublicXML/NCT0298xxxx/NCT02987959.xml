  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label phase II study of TAK-228 for patients â‰¥ 18 years of age with complex
      genomic sarcomas exhibiting Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase (PI3K) pathway dysregulation. Patients
      must have surgically unresectable or metastatic disease that is refractory to at least one
      prior line of therapy (not including neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy in a curative setting).
      Patients disease must also have evidence of progression prior to enrollment. The purpose of
      this study is to determine the antitumor activity in this group of patients. Patients must
      meet all eligibility criteria as detailed in section 10. A total of up to 33 patients will be
      included in the study. Patients will undergo screening evaluations to determine eligibility
      within 28 days of the first dose. All patients will be required to submit baseline tumor
      samples for analysis. Patients who have had their tumors tested commercially for PI3K/
      AKT/mechanistic Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) alterations will be assessed on a case by case
      basis for eligibility and for determination as to whether additional tissue is required.

      TAK-228 will be administered orally at 3 mg daily for a 21 day cycle. Clinical and laboratory
      assessments will be made on day 1 of each cycle. Disease will be assessed by comparing
      unidimensional tumor measurements on pre and peritreatment imaging (CT or MRI) after weeks 6,
      12, 18 and every 12 weeks thereafter. Response will be assessed according to RECIST 1.1.
      Therapy will continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of
      consent.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  This trial has two step inclusion criteria.

        Step 1 Inclusion Criteria

          1. Male or female patients 18 years or older.

          2. Patients must have a diagnosis of a locally advanced or metastatic sarcoma that is
             progressing. The following subtypes (considered genomically complex) will be eligible:
             leiomyosarcoma (well differentiated or poorly differentiated), undifferentiated
             pleomorphic sarcoma, myxofibrosarcoma, pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma, pleomorphic
             liposarcoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, angiosarcoma or extraskeletal
             osteosarcoma. Other potentially genomically complex Soft Tissue Sarcomas (STS)
             subtypes may be included on a case-by-case basis after discussion with the principal
             investigator.

          3. Measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 criteria (at least one target lesion outside of
             previous radiation fields or progressed within a previous radiation field), described
             in detail in section 15.

          4. Progression of disease by radiographic imaging (10% increase in size by RECIST v1.1
             within 6 months of registration) or presence of new lesions.

          5. Must have received at least 1 prior systemic therapy for advanced disease (does not
             include adjuvant/neoadjuvant therapy in a curative setting).

             Characteristics (SmPC), etc;]) after the last dose of study drug OR agree to practice
             true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the
             patient (Periodic abstinence [e.g, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation
             methods] and withdrawal, spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea are not
             acceptable methods of contraception. Female and male condoms should not be used
             together.)

             Highly effective methods:

             For men, even if surgically sterilized (ie, status post-vasectomy), they must:

             Agree to practice highly effective barrier contraception during the entire study
             treatment period and through 120 days after the last dose of study drug, OR agree to
             practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle
             of the patient (Periodic abstinence [e.g, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
             postovulation methods for the female partner] and withdrawal, spermicides only, and
             lactational amenorrhea are not acceptable methods of contraception. Female and male
             condoms should not be used together.)

                  dose of TAK-228

               4. No ongoing requirement for dexamethasone or anti-epileptic drugs

        Step 2 Inclusion Criteria: Must be met after meeting step1inclusion and exclusion criteria.

        Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) mutation. Patients must be willing to provide
        sufficient archival tissue. If this is not available fresh tumor for biopsy is required. In
        the event that a patient has had tumor analyzed for PTEN/PIK3CA status through commercial
        means, their eligibility and need for additional tissue will be determined on a case by
        case basis by the principle investigator.
