  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to determine that sort term calorie restriction will affect
      tumor biology in biopsy proven breast, endometrial or prostate cancers, which will positively
      impact biomarkers including miR-21, an onco-miR known to impact cancer outcomes.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      1) Investigate if caloric restriction will change serum micro ribonucleic acid (RNA) 21
      (miR-21) expression in patients with prostate, endometrial or breast cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        1. Investigate measurable changes induced by caloric restriction on both patient (host) and
           tumor characteristics from caloric restriction.

        2. Investigate the adherence of the patient to the diet.

      4) Weight, height, and body composition will be assessed via BodyMetrix. BodyMetrix uses
      ultrasound technology to measure subcutaneous fat.

      5) Patients will have psycho-social evaluation using the Functional Assessment of Cancer
      Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) test (prostate cancer), FACT-Breast (B) test (breast cancer), or
      the FACT-Endometrial Cancer (En) test (endometrial cancer) and the Patient Reported Outcomes
      Measurement Information System (PROMIS) cancer fatigue short form at baseline, midway through
      diet, and at the conclusion of the diet.

      6) Patient's nutritional status (Mini Nutritional Assessment [MNA] form) will be assessed,
      and their caloric needs will be calculated.

      7) Local recurrence, progression free survival, distant metastases and overall survival will
      be assessed.
