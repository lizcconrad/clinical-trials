  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Performing anesthetic induction for appendicectomy has two main risks : first aspiraion of
      gastric content causing pneumonia. Otherwise, anaphylactic risk to drugs used during
      anesthetic induction. Indeed, the guidelines recommend an anesthetic induction protocol
      qualified &quot;full stomach&quot; whatever the patient and the preoperative fasting period are. This
      protocol provides the use of fast-acting neuromuscular blocking agents (succinylcholine or
      rocuronium). However, these neuromuscular blocking agents are ten times more at allergic risk
      than others. Ultrasound assessment of gastric content before rapid sequence induction of
      anesthesia is a reproducible, non-invasive, inexpensive and quickly achievable bedside
      technique. Furthermore, the correlations between gastric volume and risk of a full stomach
      and also between the cross-section antral area (CSA) and the risk of a full stomach have been
      validated on several patient cohorts. We formulate the hypothesis that the achievement of a
      gastric ultrasound before anesthetic induction for appendectomy could allow to identify &quot;full
      stomach&quot; patients who actually justify rapid sequence induction of anesthesia with exposure
      to fast-acting neuromuscular blocking agents that implies.

      Primary endpoint is to determine te percentage of patients who have a gastric content before
      appendectomy. Secondary endpoint is to determine the incidenc of aspiration pneumonia and
      anaphylactic shock. Another secondary endpoint is to determine the percentage of patient with
      gastric content with the antral grading system (Perlas method) and to evaluate the
      concordance between this methode and the cross-section antral area.

    <description>Ultrasonography exam of the stomach is used to evaluate the CSA. A CSA greater than 340mm² defines a full stomach. The calculation of the CSA is : CSA = AP x CC x π / 4 (in mm²). With AP - antero-posterior gastric antrum diameter and CC - cranio-caudal gastric antrum diameter</description>

    <description>Achievement of gastric ultrasound (specific procedure) :
Gastric ultrasound is performed specifically for the study by a senior anesthetist physician in a patient placed supine, semi-sitting by an angle of 45 ° relative to the horizontal.
Standardised achievement of the antral ultrasound by the following method:
First, a qualitative assessment of antral contents in 3 grades according to the &quot;Perlas&quot; method [24].
Second, performing a quantitative analysis of antral contents calculating the CSA.
Then, volume of gastric contents calculation as from the CSA.</description>
