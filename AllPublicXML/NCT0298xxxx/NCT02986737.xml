      Trial of ACURATE neo(TM) Aortic Bioprosthesis for Implantation using the ACURATE TA(TM) LP
      Transapical Delivery System in Patients with Severe Aortic Stenosis for evaluating the Safety
      and performance of the study device

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, prospective, multicenter non randomised and open trial of the treatment
      of patients with severe aortic stenosis where conventional aortic valve replacement (AVR) via
      open heart surgery is considered to be high risk. All patients will be followed up to 5 years
      after the intervention.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and performance of the study device in
      patients presenting with severe aortic stenosis considered to be high risk for surgery
      Secondary objective is to evaluate adverse events and study device performance.
