  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The traditional approach to physical activity promotion in people with stroke has always
      emphasized activities of a moderate-to-vigorous intensity (i.e. moving enough to breathe fast
      and break a sweat). For many people with stroke who often have difficulty with walking,
      achieving that intensity of activity is difficult. The result is that people with stroke
      spend over 80% of their day in sedentary behaviours (too much sitting). A growing body of
      research shows that too much sitting has negative effects on health including larger waist
      circumference, unhealthy levels of blood glucose and insulin, heart disease, lower levels of
      functioning, and premature death.

      This project tests a new approach to activity promotion that focuses on increasing
      light-intensity activity throughout the whole day while reducing sitting time. The new
      intervention is titled &quot;STand Up Frequently From Stroke (STUFFS)&quot; and is aimed at increasing
      self-confidence among people with stroke to sit less, stand up and walk around at frequent
      intervals during the day. Studies in the general population have shown that standing up and
      walking around frequently are beneficially associated with health indicators (lower waist
      circumference, lower blood fat and glucose levels). Encouraging people with stroke to reduce
      sitting and increase light-intensity activities appears feasible and sustainable and might be
      a first step to increase their daily energy expenditure.

      Background: Stroke is a leading cause of adult disability among Canadians, with about 405,000
      individuals living with the effects of stroke and this number is expected to rise by 80% in
      the next 20 years [1]. Guidelines on activity promotion in people with stroke emphasize the
      attainment of 150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous intensity activity per week [2].

      Moving fast enough to 'break a sweat' is challenging for people with stroke who often have
      mobility deficits. Stroke survivors spend over 80% of their day in sedentary behaviours (too
      much sitting) [3-5]. Accumulating evidence indicates that sedentary behaviour has deleterious
      effects on health, regardless of exercise levels [6]. Targeting sedentary behaviour might be
      a feasible and sustainable way to change activity behaviour in people with stroke.

      Purpose: This research aims to test the feasibility of a social cognitive theory-based
      intervention to reduce sedentary behaviour and improve light-intensity activity (such as
      standing and walking around frequently). The focus is on improving activity behaviour and
      will allow a systematic and staged reduction of contact with organised hospital care.

      Methodological approach: Thirty-five persons with stroke will be enrolled. Outcomes including
      sedentary behaviour, physical activity and function will be measured at baseline (week 0),
      post-intervention (week 9) and follow-up (week 16). Activity behaviour (i.e. time sedentary,
      standing, and stepping) will be recorded for 7 days at each time point using activPAL
      activity monitor, validated in people with stroke [7]. Impairment from stroke will be
      assessed using Chedoke McMaster Stroke Assessment, which is a valid and reliable tool to
      measure impairment after stroke [8]. Cognitive status will be assessed using Montreal
      Cognitive Assessment scale, validated in stroke [9].

      At the end of the intervention, feasibility outcomes such as reach (number enrolled / number
      eligible), retention (% enrolled who complete study), and satisfaction (exit interviews) with
      the program will be determined. Changes in sedentary, physical activity and functional
      outcomes across time (weeks 0, 9 and 16) will be tested.

      Intervention: For the intervention, output from baseline activity monitoring (using activPAL
      activity monitor) will provide data on usual activity behaviour. Action plans targeting areas
      of high sedentary behaviour throughout the day will be developed. A wrist-worn activity
      Misfit monitor - a motivational tool that will track adherence to the intervention will be
      used throughout the intervention period (i.e. 8 weeks). This device provides activity
      feedback for the user in real time. A checklist will be used to address: 1) use of walking
      aids; 2) incidence of falls; 3) review and progression of home exercise program; and 4)
      quality of walking.

      Analysis: Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize baseline data. Feasibility
      measurements (reach, retention, and satisfaction) will be evaluated as percentages. Changes
      in activity and functional outcomes across time (weeks 0, 9 and 16) will be tested using
      repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). All analysis will be done with STATA and
      significance level set at P &lt; 0.05.

    <description>Participants will undergo a sedentary behaviour intervention which includes breaking up prolonged sitting by standing and walking around for 5 minutes every half-hour, standing and walking during television commercial breaks, doing 2 sets of 10 sit-to-stand transitions three times per day, and going to the kitchen to grab some drink every hour. A wrist-worn Misfit activity monitor - a motivational tool that will track adherence to the intervention will be used throughout the intervention period (i.e. 8 weeks). This device which is commercially available provides activity feedback for the user in real time.</description>

    <description>The intervention is based on socio-cognitive theory and focuses on building and increasing confidence (self-efficacy) to make a behaviour change. Output from the activity monitor (i.e. activPAL) will provide visual feedback of usual activity. Action plans targeting areas of high sedentary behaviour will be developed. A wrist-worn Misfit activity monitor is used as a self-monitoring tool throughout the intervention. This commercially available device provides activity information in real time, and sets daily targets for physical activity. A checklist will be used to address: 1) use of walking aids; 2) incidence of falls; 3) review and progression of home exercise program; and 4) quality of walking. The intervention visits will be conducted by a physical therapist.</description>
