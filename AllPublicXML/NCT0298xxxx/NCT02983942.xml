    <textblock>
      Ketogenic diet has shown auxiliary effect on treatment of malignant tumors require high
      glucose consumption. This study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ketogenic
      diet adjunctive to high dose methotrexate(HD-MTX) chemotherapy for primary central nervous
      system lymphoma (PCNSL).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a pilot study of primary central nervous system(CNS) lymphoma patients, ketogenic diet was
      given in adjunction with standard HD-MTX chemotherapy as interventional group; standard
      HD-MTX is given with routine diet as control group. The primary endpoint is the safety of
      ketogenic diet in PCNSL patients receiving chemotherapy, secondary endpoints include rate of
      complete remission, remission time, rate of tumor relapse and overall survival.
