  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Remote monitoring of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) for patients has led to
      efficient, safe, and satisfying analysis of their device and cardiac status; resulting in an
      overall improvement in the quality of care for such patients. Despite the efficacy of remote
      monitoring of ICDs and the satisfaction of patients and providers with the process, there is
      a desire from patients to have access and view ability of the data their ICD is transmitting.
      However, methods for making ICD device data directly available to the patients are not
      currently in place. This study aims to elicit the impact of standardized remote monitoring
      ICD data to patients through an electronic personal health record (ePHR) on patient
      engagement, healthcare utilization, and patient-provider communication. For this study,
      patients with an ICD manufactured by St. Jude Medical and that are undergoing remote
      monitoring through the remote management system, Merlin.net™, will receive a standardized
      format of their electronic remote monitoring ICD data in MyChart, the ePHR used at Parkview
      Health. The standard format for the electronic remote monitoring ICD data, as it is delivered
      to the patient, will be termed the ICD Patient Notification Summary. Additionally, provider
      attitudes and perceptions regarding the value of the Patient Notification Summary, its impact
      on clinic workflow, and patient-provider communication will be collected.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, patients receive a letter by postal mail from their physician's office with a
      statement about their ICD status. The St. Jude Medical ICD data is managed by the Merlin.net™
      remote monitoring system and maintained in the database with periodic transfer to the
      healthcare providers EHR system.

      This is the first large study that will evaluate the impact of transferring information from
      the ICD manufacturer's remote monitoring system directly into a patient's ePHR for the
      purpose of making select information readily available to patients in the form of a report,
      called the ICD Patient Notification Summary.

      The ICD Patient Notification Summary will be transmitted to the healthcare providers' EHR
      system (Epic) from Merlin.net™ as part of the data flow pathway to the patients' ePHR
      (MyChart). This will ensure that the Arrhythmia Diagnostic Center (ADC) clinic and other
      healthcare providers will be able to view the same information that the patients will
      receive.

      MATERIALS AND METHODS

      1) SELECTION AND ENROLLMENT OF PATIENTS

      a. Study Population: The study population is comprised of all adult, ambulatory
      PPG-Cardiology patients who are being remotely monitored for their St. Jude Medical ICD
      through the Merlin.net™ system.

      The study will include three groups; one intervention group (Group A) and two control groups
      (Group B and Group C). Patients who are willing to have an active MyChart account will be
      randomized into one of the two groups (Group A or Group B). Those patients who initially
      declined a MyChart account at enrollment or do not have computer and/or Internet access will
      be enrolled into the third group (Group C). Each study group will comprise of approximately
      100 patients for a total N=300. The research staff will identify patients satisfying the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria for the study.

      c. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria: Inclusion Criteria

        2. Physically and mentally capable of providing an informed consent

        3. Patient of PPG-Cardiology

        4. Implanted with a St. Jude Medical ICD

        5. Undergoing remote monitoring by the Merlin.net™ system

        6. Ability to read, write and understand English

        7. Have access to computer and/or Internet (Group A and B only)

        8. Patient has a scheduled ICD download within the study period at the time of enrollment.

      Exclusion Criteria

        1. Does not meet inclusion criteria

        2. Unable to physically or cognitively carry out the tasks necessary for activating and/or
           utilizing an ePHR such as; blindness, loss of function of arms, cognitive impairments
           (per chart review) that would interfere in learning a new task

        3. Designated as part of a vulnerable subject population that the investigator or designee
           identifies to have compromised autonomy related to potential study participation

        4. Currently participating in another Parkview study that involves other ePHR use.

      Intervention Component i. Feasibility: The investigators will assess intervention feasibility
      by monitoring successful delivery of remote monitoring ICD data via the ePHRs of the
      intervention group patients.

      ii. Data Collection:

        1. Group A- Intervention Group:

           Data will include the number of ICD reports from Merlin.net™ (per standard of care)
           during the study period and the number of reports processed by the ADC. The number of
           transmissions of the ICD Patient Notification Summaries to the ePHR as well as the
           number of patient views (electronic access) will be provided by Epic.

           Additional data may be obtained from MyChart regarding patient ePHR usage including:

             1. Number of successful ePHR logins

             2. Number of unsuccessful ePHR logins

        2. Group B- Control Group:

           Data will include the number of ICD reports from Merlin.net™ (per standard of care)
           during the study period and the number of reports processed by the ADC. Data will also
           include the number of ICD Patient Notification Summaries mailed to the participant by
           research staff.

           Additional data may be obtained from MyChart regarding patient ePHR usage including:

             1. Number of successful ePHR logins

             2. Number of unsuccessful ePHR logins

        3. Group C- Control Group:

      Data will include the number of ICD reports from Merlin.net™ (per standard of care) during
      the study period and the number of reports processed by the ADC. The number of ICD reports
      will be provided by the ADC at PPG-Cardiology.

      No data will be obtained from MyChart because these patients have either declined or do not
      have computer and/or Internet access to have an active MyChart account.

      Quantitative Component i. Patient Interaction:

      Baseline:

      Patients from the intervention group and control groups will answer a baseline survey. The
      baseline survey will assess socio-demographic characteristics, patient engagement, and
      patient satisfaction with the current standard of care as well as patient perceptions about
      receiving remote monitoring ICD data in their ePHR. The survey will be administered either
      paper-based or online, using a secure online survey program, Survey Monkey. Patient
      engagement will be assessed using the short form Patient Activation Measure (PAM) survey
      copyrighted by Insignia Health.

      The Patient Activation Measure (PAM) is a validated survey tool developed by Judith Hibbard,
      PhD, MPH of the University of Oregon, which assesses the degree a patient acts as an active
      agent in their own health care. PAM is associated with improved health outcomes6.

      Follow-up:

      Patients will respond to two follow up surveys in approximately 3 months and 6 months from
      the baseline survey. The follow up surveys will assess patient engagement, patient
      satisfaction and perceptions with the ICD Patient Notification Summary or current standard of
      care as well as technology acceptance, depending on the group randomization. Technology
      acceptance will be assessed using the Technology Acceptance Model as a framework and will
      explore patient attitudes regarding ease of use, usefulness and intentions to use the ePHR
      and ICD Patient Notification Summary.

      The Technology Acceptance Model is a commonly used model, originally developed by Fred Davis
      and Richard Bagozzi, which predicts technology acceptance based on the user's perceived
      usefulness and perceived ease of use of the technology for a specific purpose 7,8.

      Data Collection:

      Chart review will be performed to collect past and current data regarding patient's
      socio-demographic characteristics, comorbidities, laboratory and interventions, and
      healthcare utilization. These data points will help provide background and descriptive
      information to supplement the other components of the study. ICD-related data and events as
      well as measurement and classification of clinic calls will be assessed starting six months
      prior to the study period and continuing throughout the study period. The amount and type of
      healthcare utilization in relation to cardiac care will be collected. Data related to the use
      of MyChart will also be collected.

      2) SELECTION AND ENROLLMENT OF PROVIDERS

        1. Study Population: The study population is comprised of PPG-Cardiology providers who are
           involved in the care of PPG-Cardiology patients undergoing remote monitoring of their
           St. Jude Medical ICD through the Merlin.net™ system.

        2. Sample Size: A convenience sample of approximately 90-120 providers, including
           physicians, nurses and ADC technologists will be in this component of the study.

        3. Inclusion Criteria:

      Inclusion Criteria:

        1. 18 years of age and older

        2. Physically and mentally capable of providing an informed consent

        3. Currently an employee of PPG-Cardiology

        4. Currently involved in the care of patients who have ICDs and are undergoing remote
           monitoring

        5. Ability to read, write and understand English

      3) PROVIDER STUDY DESIGN

      The provider survey will be administered via Survey Monkey to evaluate providers' attitudes
      and perceptions about the ICD Patient Notification Summary, including the following:

        -  the value of the ICD Patient Notification Summary for patients

        -  the impact of the ICD Patient Notification Summary on clinic workflow

        -  the effect of the ICD Patient Notification Summary on patient-provider communication.
