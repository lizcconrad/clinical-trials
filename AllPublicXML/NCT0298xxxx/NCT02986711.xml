  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to pilot a method of collecting the post-discharge follow-up data required by
      the Joint Commission Tobacco Measure Set, using text messages sent to and received from
      patients' cellular-telephones. It also aims to assess whether specially designed relapse
      prevention text messages designed to encourage abstinence from smoking, can increase the
      proportion of smokers who remain abstinent during the first month after discharge from
      hospital.
