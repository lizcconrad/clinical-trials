  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, active control, two-arm parallel, double-blind, monocenter
      phase IV clinical trial. The trial compares empagliflozin to glimepiride in patients with
      type 2 diabetes mellitus in addition to standard of care treatment.

      Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who are between 18 and 80 years of age will be
      recruited for the clinical trial and randomly allocated to either receive empagliflozin or
      glimepiride.

      The assumption of the study is that empagliflozin slows down diabetic retinopathy progression
      rate and thus a lower microaneurysm formation rate compared to subjects treated with
      glimepiride by substantially decreased cellular glucotoxicity will be achieved.
