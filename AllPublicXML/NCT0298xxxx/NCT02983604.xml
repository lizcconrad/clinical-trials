    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of the Phase 1b Dose Escalation part of this study are to characterize
      the safety and tolerability of GS-5829 in combination with exemestane or fulvestrant in women
      with advanced estrogen receptor positive Her2-negative (ER+/HER2-) breast cancer and to
      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) (if not already determined) or the recommended
      dose for the Phase 2 part of this study.

      The primary objectives of the Randomized Phase 2 Dose Expansion portion of this study are to
      evaluate the efficacy of GS-5829 in combination with fulvestrant compared to fulvestrant
      alone in women with advanced ER+/HER2- breast cancer.
