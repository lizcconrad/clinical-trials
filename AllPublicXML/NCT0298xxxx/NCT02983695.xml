  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 trial to determine the tolerability and optimal dose of CBD rich cannabis
      extract as an adjunct treatment in children with severe drug resistant epilepsy due to Dravet
      Syndrome. This is an open label intervention. Study duration is 20 weeks to primary analysis
      with continued follow-up until 64 weeks completed.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Establishment of tolerability of TIL-TC150 by measuring the number of participants with adverse events and / or abnormal laboratory values that are related to treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>20-64 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>During this study, the dose of TIL-TC150 will be titrated according to study protocol and participant tolerance. Tolerance will be assessed as documented in title, by evaluating for adverse events clinically and by parent report of adverse event every week during the first 20 weeks of the study, also by blood work at weeks 0, 4, and between 8-16 weeks.
For those choose to continue the study drug after 20 week period of assessment, tolerance will be evaluated by assessing for adverse events at weeks 28, 40,52 and 64.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Establishment of tolerability of TIL-TC150 by standardised side effects questionnaire -pediatric epilepsy side effects questionnaire (PESQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>16-64 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>During this study, tolerance will also be assessed by the standardised side effects questionnaire- PESQ in clinic at weeks 2,4,8,12 and 16. For those choosing to continue therapy will be reassessed by PESQ in clinic at week 28,40,52 and 64.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The impact of therapy on quality of life using the Quality of Life in Childhood Epilepsy (QOLCE) questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>16-52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The QOLCE will be completed by parents at clinic at first visit or baseline(week 0), at maximal dose (8 weeks) and at 16 weeks for primary analysis. For those choosing to continue therapy will be reassessed at 28 weeks and 52 weeks. Parents will be provided with a research report detailing the assessment findings at study completion.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The impact of therapy on everyday behaviours using the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Second Edition.</measure>
    <time_frame>20-64 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scale, Second Edition: is a standardized parent interview to complete either in person at the clinic or by telephone on week 0, prior to starting the TIL-TC150. The interview will also be completed again at the primary evaluation period anytime between weeks 16 and 20 and again for those choosing to continue the therapy will be reassessed during the longitudinal follow-up anytime between 52 and 64 weeks. This will be done by study team. Parents will be provided with a research report detailing the assessment findings at study completion.</description>
