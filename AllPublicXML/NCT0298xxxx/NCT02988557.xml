  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The adaptations in kinematics and muscle activity, investigated by 3D gait analysis and
      dynamic electromyography recordings, will be studied in children with bilateral spastic
      cerebral palsy during level walking, and before and after a training on a treadmill with a
      sloped surface (7Â°). Data will be compared with those obtained in a sample of typically
      developing (TD) children (controls)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      15 CP children and 15 TD children aged 6 to 14 years will take part in this study. Dynamic
      EMG recordings will be performed as well as kinematic data assessments through a gait
      analysis system. Three different slopes will be assessed, using a treadmill. The primary
      outcome measure will be the minimal knee extension value in the stance phase. The changes in
      kinematics will be overall assessed through the Gait Profile Score (Baker et al.). The
      details in changes will be assessed through statistical parametric mapping (SPM). The changes
      in muscle activity induced by the slope will be investigated by statistical parametric
      mapping of the EMG or kinematic data.
