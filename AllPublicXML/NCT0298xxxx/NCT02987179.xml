    <textblock>
      The clinical diagnosis of sleep apnea is difficult among ESRD patients since the
      characteristic clinical features of sleep apnea may be absent and since sleep-related
      symptoms, such as fatigue and sleepiness, may be attributed to kidney failure. However, the
      evaluation of patients with possible sleep apnea is the same among ESRD patients as in the
      general population.
