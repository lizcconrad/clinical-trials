      This is an open-label, single-center study recruiting approximately 15 male or female
      pediatric (ages 2-15, inclusive) patients with, intractable epilepsy, on stable doses of
      antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). The study comprised of the following period: 4 weeks observation
      period, followed by a 2-week dose titration period, 10-week maintenance treatment period, and
      a 2-week follow-up of which 1 week is a tapering-off period. Seizures will be recorded by the
      legal guardian/caregiver in seizure diaries throughout the first 16 weeks of the study.
