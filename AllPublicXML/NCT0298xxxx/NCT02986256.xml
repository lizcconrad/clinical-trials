  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The TELEPIED project aims to show that it is possible to reduce the number of hospitalization
      days of a patient with ulcers of the foot thanks to a new organization of care, based on the
      intervention of a coordinating nurse interacting with the nurse in charge of the patient
      thanks to a telemedicine tool allowing the transfer of photos and ensuring itself a regular
      follow-up of the evolution of the wound and adapting the support nurse to the home if
      necessary.

      It is a monocenter, randomized, in parallel study, in 180 diabetic patients with ulcers of
      the foot.

      Patients included in the conventional group will be followed according to the usual practice
      Patients included in the &quot;telepied&quot; group will benefit from a personalized accompaniment by a
      nurse referring to diabetic foot ulcers who will guide and advise the nurse at home by acting
      by delegating tasks of the investigator.

      The patient will be visited by the referring nurse every 15 days. During these visits, the
      referring nurse will have the objective to evaluate the evolution of the ulcer as well as the
      care performed. This visit also allows a close personalized accompaniment for the patient,
      who will benefit from an education adapted to the characteristics of ulcer (discharge
      modalities for example ..) and its way of life.

      Every patients will be followed for one year (12 months).
