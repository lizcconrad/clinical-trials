    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center phase II study of brentuximab vedotin in combination with bevacizumab
      for the treatment of refractory CD-30+ germ cell tumors (GCT) after disease progression on
      imaging and/or tumor marker progression documented by serially rising alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)
      or beta human chorionic gonadotropin (bHCG) measured on at least 2 consecutive visits and
      determined by treating physician to be clinically significant. Patients unable to receive 2nd
      line of platinum-based chemotherapy due to toxicity or refusal would also be eligible.

          -  Diagnosis of CD-30 positive germ cell tumor. CD30 expression will be tested by
             immunohistochemistry (IHC) in archival or fresh tumor tissue as is routinely done for
             diagnosis.

          -  Disease progression on imaging or tumor marker progression (clinical significance of
             tumor marker progression to be decided per the discretion of treating physician) after
             at least 2 lines of platinum-based chemotherapies unless patient is ineligible for
             further platinum based chemotherapy or refuses 2nd line platinum based chemotherapy
             due to toxicity. For primary mediastinal germ cell tumors, failure of first-line
             chemotherapy will be accepted. Prior high dose chemotherapy with hematopoietic stem
             cell rescue is allowed. Prior treatment with bevacizumab is allowed.

          -  At least 3 weeks should have elapsed since the last treatment (e.g. chemotherapy,
             targeted small molecule therapy, immunotherapy or radiation) and must have recovered
             to grade 1 or better from the acute effects of prior therapy.

                  enrollment.

                  mL/min/1.73m2

               -  INR: &lt;1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal OR &lt; 3 if on warfarin or other
                  anticoagulants. There should be no evidence of active bleeding while on
                  anticoagulants.

                  institutional guidelines). If proteinuria is 2+ or greater (≥ 100 mg/dl per
                  institutional guidelines), patients should undergo a 24- hour urine collection
                  and 24 hour urinary protein should be less than &lt; 2 grams.

          -  Sexually active men with partners of women of childbearing potential must agree to
             practice effective methods of contraception during the study and for 6 months after
