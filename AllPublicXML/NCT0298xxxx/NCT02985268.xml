    <textblock>
      At present, the optimal treatment strategy for heart failure patients and moderate-to-severe
      (3+) or severe (4+) mitral regurgitation with a class IIa recommendation for CRT is
      uncertain.Whether these patents should also be treated for functional mitral regurgitation or
      with CRT also remains unclear. We therefore propose a randomized 2x2 factorial design in this
      patient population to understand the the impact of both CRT and transcatheter mitral valve
      repair with the MitraClip on their functional status and quality of life.
