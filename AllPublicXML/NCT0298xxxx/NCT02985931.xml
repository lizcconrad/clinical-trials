      The investigators aim to address this issue with novel image quantification methods using
      CZT-based SPECT, which is capable of dynamic data acquisition and therefore feasible for the
      quantification of the coronary flow. The investigators will use kinetic modeling techniques
      to design a study that allows the absolute flow quantification. To make this study practical,
      the investigators will develop a protocol that includes the acquisition of both the rest and
      stress scan within the same scan that is shorter than 30 minutes. The SPECT-measured flow
      will be validated against the flow measured with cardiac MRI scans. Patients with high CAD
      risk will be recruited for the clinical trial. Data from these human subjects will be used
      for determination of the performance of the developed algorithm. With the proposed rapid scan
      with absolute quantification capabilities, the investigators expect to increase the diagnosis
      accuracy while maintaining the patient throughput.
