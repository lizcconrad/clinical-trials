  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of this research is to advance the investigators knowledge of how the
      brain combines the information of multiple sensory systems coding for spatial oriention and
      how adaptation to vestibular imbalance influences spatial orientation. In healthy human
      subjects verticality perception is accurate while upright. After prolonged roll-tilt, humans
      show a systematic bias in perceived direction towards the previous roll-tilted position
      (so-called &quot;post-tilt bias&quot;). This effect could either be related to adaptation to the
      roll-tilted position (shifting the &quot;null&quot; position) or it could be related to changes in
      torsional eye position due to prolonged static roll-tilt (ocular counter-roll). While in the
      first case a post-tilt bias is predicted independently of the experimental paradigm used, the
      second hypothesis predicts a post-tilt bias only if retinal cues are integrated. In order to
      evaluate these hypotheses, the investigators will assess perceived vertical using both
      vision-dependent and vision-independent paradigms.

    <description>In each participant the investigators will assess verticality perception in whole-body upright position by use of the SVV, the SPV and the SHV after static roll-tilt at ±90deg over 5min. Measurements will be obtained on a motor-driven turntable and two different roll-tilt positions will be applied (±90°). A visual line (SVV), a rod (SHV) or the turntable itself will be adjusted to indicate perceived direction of vertical. A total of three measuring sessions, each lasting about 60 minutes are scheduled.</description>
