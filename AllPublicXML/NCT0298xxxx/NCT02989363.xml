      Evaluation of the use of resources and costs with O-arm in deep brain stimulation (DBS)
      surgeries and complex back surgeries
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To measure the use of health resources in application A (with DBS) and in application B
      (vertebral fusions), in patients in the intervention group with O-arm and in the control
      group (usual care without O-arm) with the cost in each phase (pre-surgical, surgical,
      post-surgical and follow-up at 6 months (RAQUIS) and at 12 months (DBS))
