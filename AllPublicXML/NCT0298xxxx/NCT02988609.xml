  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study assess the putative persistence of neural damage using resting state fMRI after
      concussion in rugby player once they have clinically recovered. The hypothesis is that
      despite a clinical recovery (absence of symptoms; neurological and neuropsychological
      examination returned to normal) connectivity map obtained using resting state fMRI are
      significantly different from a group of control subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Resting state fMRI has shown to be a sensitive tool to assess neural damage after concussion.
      It seems more sensible than structural MRI including DTI. the study goal will be to assess
      rugby players using fMRI at 3 different times after concussion: just after concussion (V1),
      once players have clinically recovered (V2) and 3 months after V2 (V3). The study would
      specifically like to challenge clinical examination supposed to be normal at V2 to
      connectivity maps using resting state fMRI preformed at the same time. fMRI performed at V1
      and V3 will serve as comparators (respectively very altered at V1 and back to normal at V3).

    <description>Players with a recent (&lt;72 hours) history of concussion will be assessed 3 times. just after concussion, after disappearance of clinical symptoms and 3 months after the previous visit. During each visit, participant will undergo a neurological and a neuropsychological assessment and a structural and resting state fMRI.</description>

    <description>a control group with no history of concussion will be the comparator. Participants will be assessed 3 times. Visits will be the same for the control group and duration between visits in this group will be matched to the concussion group. During each visit, participant will undergo a neurological and a neuropsychological assessment and a structural and resting state fMRI.</description>
