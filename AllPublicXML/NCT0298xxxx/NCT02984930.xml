  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The gastric acid pocket is believed to be the reservoir from which acid reflux events
      originate. The risk for acidic reflux is mainly determined by the position of the gastric
      acid pocket. Little is known about how changes in position and size of the acid pocket
      contribute to the therapeutic effect of proton pump inhibitors(PPI) plus mosapride in
      patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease. Investigators will conduct a prospective
      randomized, single blind and placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the hypothesis
      that mosapride affecting gastric motility might reduce gastro-esophageal reflux by changing
      the acid pocket position and size.
