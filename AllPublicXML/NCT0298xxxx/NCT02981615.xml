  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infections are a major and prevalent life-threatening complication among patients with
      myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Currently, the role of prophylactic antibacterial agents
      after chemotherapy in MDS patients remains controversial and there are no clinical guidelines
      for infection prophylaxis in this clinical setting. We will conduct a prospective study to
      evaluate the potential benefit of prophylactic antibacterial (Levofloxacin) on the rate of
      febrile episodes/infections in Azacytidine treated MDS patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a national, multicenter, phase III, randomized, parallel arms, double blind, placebo
      controlled clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of antibacterial prophylaxis -
      Levofloxacin 500mg/d given p.o.in newly diagnosed MDS patients who are more than 18 years of
      age and fulfil an indication for Azacytidine treatment. Patients will be treated for up to 4
      cycles of Levofloxacin, or placebo. Subjects allocated to the treatment arm of the study will
      be administrated Levofloxacin 500mg/d given p.o. once a day, starting on day 10 from
      beginning of each cycle until day 28. Subject allocated to the placebo arm will be treated
      with placebo once a day, starting on day 10 from beginning of each cycle until day 28.
      Levofloxacin and placebo treatment will be continued in the first 4 Azacytidine cycles. This
      study consists of 3 periods for each study subject: pre-treatment period, treatment period
      and follow up period. Expected duration of subject participation is 6 months Pre-treatment
      period: Assessments: MDS evaluation by bone marrow examination including cytogenetics/ FISH
      must be performed within half a year of the first dose of study drug.
