  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators goal is to develop medical treatments for stress/mixed urinary
      incontinence. Sildenafil has been shown to improve blood flow as well as muscle mass and
      strength and to decrease muscle fatigue. The investigators believe that it will improve
      muscular atrophy in the pelvic floor, thus improving symptoms of urinary incontinence related
      to pelvic floor dysfunction.

      Aim: To determine the effect of sildenafil on urinary incontinence.

        1. Episodes of urinary incontinence will be recorded using a 3 day bladder diary.

        2. Quantitative assessment of urinary incontinence will be performed at baseline and after
           treatment using a Pad Test.

        3. Muscle strength will be assessed through use of a perineometer.

        4. To evaluate macrocirculatory blood flow in pelvic organs, women will be assessed with
           noninvasive imaging before and after randomization to sildenafil.

        5. Secondary outcomes will include evaluation of muscle and vaginal mucosal thickness.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Postmenopausal females, 50-80 years of age, at the time of consent

          -  Willing and able to comply with study procedures

          -  Willing and able to provide written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Significant heart, liver, kidney, pulmonary, blood, autoimmune or peripheral vascular
             disease (history of Hashimoto's thyroiditis is not exclusionary if stable and thyroid

             as needed during study visits. )

          -  Systolic blood pressure &lt;100 or &gt;150, diastolic blood pressure &lt;60 or &gt;90 after
             repeated evaluation with proper cuff. This range is smaller than the acceptable range
             stated in the prescribing information for sildenafil (&gt;90/50 and &lt;170/110)

          -  Diabetes mellitus or other untreated endocrine disease

          -  Active cancer

          -  Currently using and planning to continue use of urinary incontinence medications
             during study period

          -  BMI &gt; 40

          -  HIV, Hepatitis B, or Hepatitis C

             subject at increased risk for participation.

          -  Known allergic reaction to any agent under investigation or required by the protocol.

          -  History of prior non-compliance or the presence or history of psychiatric condition
             (including drug or alcohol addiction) that would, in the opinion of the investigator,
             make it difficult for the subject to comply with the study procedures or follow the
             investigators instructions.

          -  Females who are pregnant or lactating.
