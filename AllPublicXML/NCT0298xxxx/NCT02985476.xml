  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluated the extent to which a shared health record facilitated better
      communication, increase individual responsibility for health care and reduce demand for
      health resources.

      The study made individualised reports available to patients and General Practitioners and
      gave much more detail about participants chronic disease and treatments, and evaluated its
      effectiveness in a randomised controlled feasibility trial.

      One third of patients received care as usual, two thirds of patients received the
      intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic illness is a major cause of health problems. Self-management programmes can improve
      care and reduce healthcare resource use, but rely on well educated patients who are able to
      take responsibility for their care, have effective communication with health care providers,
      and easy access to appropriately triaged services.

      This study utilised Inflammatory Bowel Disease as an exemplar of chronic disease management.

      To inform the intervention the investigators held a focus group with patients who told the
      investigators about their concerns relating to education, care planning and communication
      about their condition. The participants expressed a preference for individualised information
      about their care, and plans of what to do if symptoms increase.

      The investigators departmental electronic patient record (GeneCIS), was extended to provide
      personalised, educationally enriched information to each participant about their Inflammatory
      Bowel Disease. The investigators customised GeneCIS to develop output reports i.e.: &quot;My
      History&quot;, &quot;My plan&quot; and &quot;My Update&quot;, that attach specific educational information to the
      detailed, structured clinical data held on the system, and shared this with participants and
      their General Practitioner.

    <description>The number of participants with adverse events leading to a hospital admission or otherwise, threatening the health and well being of participating patients and reported to a health professional graded according to causality and seriousness of event. Access to General Practitioner and secondary care hospital based data for the participant in paper and electronic form will provide details of relevant primary and secondary care attendances, acute admissions and outpatient appointments.</description>

    <measure>Effectiveness: The cost of National Health Services resources used by participants in primary and secondary care.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The indirect costs of participant use of National Health services across primary and secondary care including General Practitioner visits, in-patient stays, operations, outpatient visits, investigations, Accident and Emergency attendances, open access service use and medication use will be compared. A direct cost of the intervention i.e.: the time taken by the clinician to formulate the elements of the ELIJAH intervention will be assessed. Both indirect and direct costs will be formulated via a comparrison of the PSSRU and National Schedule of reference Costs.</description>
