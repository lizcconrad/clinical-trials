      VENIM is a multicenter, open-label, parallel-group randomized controlled trial of studying
      the initial ventilation strategy for adult immunocompromised patients with acute respiratory
      failure.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The VENIM is a multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing the effects of NIV
      compared with IMV in adult immunocompromised patients with moderate to severe acute
      respiratory failure (ARF). Patients who meet the indications for both ventilatory supports
      will be included. The intervention will consist of randomly allocation, treatment with NIV or
      IMV, concomitant medication. Primary outcome is 30-day hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes
      include in-hospital mortality, length of stay in hospital, improvement of oxygenation,
      nosocomial infections, seven-day organ failure, adverse events of intervention, et al.
      Subgroups with different disease severity, causes of immunodeficiency and types of ARF will
      also be analyzed.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult (18 years old ≤ age ≤ 80 years old) immunocompromised patients admitted to
             hospital with moderate to severe ARF diagnosed within the last 72 hours, which meets
             the indications for ventilatory support.

          -  Patients are considered as moderate to severe ARF when the ratio of the partial
             pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) is between
             85 and 170 while the patient is breathing oxygen through a Venturi mask, or clinically
             diagnosed as the following:

               1. 30 mmHg &lt; PaO2 &lt; 50 mmHg on room air;

               2. Clinical evidence of respiratory distress (intercostal recession, polypnea
                  &gt;35/min or dyspnea at rest).

             surgery within the previous 3 months; systolic arterial pressure &lt;90 mmHg after
             optimal fluid therapy; history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or
             asthma; impaired consciousness (Glasgow Coma Scale score &lt;13); postoperative acute
             respiratory failure; pregnancy or breastfeeding;
