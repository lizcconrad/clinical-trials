  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During exercise in the heat, there is a need to replenish fluids in order to avoid
      dehydration and decrease the risk for heat illness. What drives this urge to drink is the
      thirst mechanism. Following ingestion of fluids, there is an inhibition of thirst before
      there is a replenishing of fluids. However, there is little scientific evidence of where
      thirst is inhibited, if this thirst inhibition is augmented by exercise and how thirst itself
      influence exercise performance. Further, during rehydration studies, it is very difficult to
      successfully blind a subject to their drinking/hydration protocol. Previous studies that have
      blinded a subject to their drinking have used various methods such as intravenous fluid
      administration and/or nasogastric tubes. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to
      examine the mechanistic roles thirst inhibition plays while exercising in the heat while
      undergoing intravenous fluid administration. Specific attention will be directed to the
      cardiovascular and thermoregulatory function of the individuals. All blood, cardiovascular,
      thermoregulatory, and perceptual measures are shown in the diagram below.
