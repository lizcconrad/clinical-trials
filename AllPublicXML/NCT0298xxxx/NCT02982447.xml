    <textblock>
      It is a randomized controlled trial with tandem colonoscopy.Participants were randomized for
      use of either blue laser imaging or conventional White Light Colonoscopy on withdrawal
      method.comparison of detection and miss rates of BLI group Versus conventional White Light
      Colonoscopy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      blue laser imaging (BLI) are a new imaging systems used in endoscopy which are recently
      developed. According to three recently published reports, the diagnostic ability of adenoma
      characterization using blue laser imaging compares favorably with narrow band imaging. No
      published data are available to date regarding adenoma detection with blue laser imaging.BLI
      has the possibility to increase the detection of colorectal polyps by sufficient brightness
      and clearer endoscopic images.The investigators recruited participants who underwent
      colonoscopy for symptoms,screening,or surveillance.Participants were randomized for use of
      either blue laser imaging (BLI) or conventional white light colonoscopy on withdrawal
      method.Lesions detected on first-pass and second-pass examination were used for adenoma
      detection and miss rates,respectively.The primary outcomes is to compare the adenoma and poly
      detection rates of BLI with conventional white light Colonoscopy.
