      PURPOSE The purpose of this case series is to clinically, radiographically and histologically
      evaluate the treatment of dehiscence defects in extraction sockets using a minimally-invasive
      GBR technique that involves the application of a particulate bone allograft and a
      non-resorbable PTFE membrane.

      METHODS Subjects with single-rooted teeth indicated for extraction and interested in future
      implant therapy for tooth replacement will be recruited on the basis of an eligibility
      criteria. A buccal or lingual dehiscence defect must strongly be suspected or confirmed upon
      clinical examination in order for the subject to qualify for study inclusion. A cone-beam
      computer tomography (CBCT) scan of the arch containing the tooth to be extracted will be
      obtained prior to tooth extraction. Following minimally invasive tooth extraction and
      debridement, the socket will be evaluated to verify the presence of a dehiscence defect
      affecting at least 50% of the bony plate height. After creating a soft tissue 'pouch' using
      tunneling instruments, a non-absorbable dense-PTFE (dPTFE) barrier membrane that will be
      trimmed to a size and shape that would allow for complete extension over the existing defect
      will be tucked between the mucosa and the alveolar bone. Then, the extraction socket will be
      grafted with particulate allograft and the access to the socket will be sealed with an
      extension of the membrane and an external cross mattress suture. Subjects will be recalled at
      1, 2 and 5 weeks to monitor healing and assess the level of discomfort using a visual analog
      scale at the end of each visit. At the 5-week visit, the membrane will be gently removed and
      the exposed area will be left to heal by secondary intention. At 20 weeks after tooth
      extraction a second CBCT will be obtained to radiographically evaluate the site for implant
      placement. Bone volumetric reconstructions of the alveolar ridge at baseline and at 20 weeks
      will be made using the CBCT data to assess changes affecting the bone housing. If the site
      has healed adequately, implant placement will be planned at 24 weeks after tooth extraction.
      A bone core biopsy will be obtained at the time of implant placement in order to
      histologically analyze the characteristics of the grafted substrate. Upon implant placement
      with primary stability a healing abutment will be placed and sutures will be given to achieve
      primary wound closure, as necessary. Subjects will return for the final study visit at 2
      weeks following implant placement to evaluate the healing prior to being referred back to the
      restorative dentist.

    <description>Tooth extraction will be attempted in minimally traumatic, flapless, fashion. Following tooth extraction, the existence of the suspected dehiscence defect will be confirmed; absence of a defect will result in subject exclusion from the study and the case will be considered an intent-to-treat. Horizontal and vertical dimensions of the defect will be measured using a UNC-15 probe. After creating a soft tissue 'pouch' using tunneling instruments, a non-absorbable dense-PTFE (dPTFE) [Cytoplast TXT-200, Osteogenics Biomedical] barrier membrane, trimmed to the size and shape that would allow for complete extension over the existing defect, will be tucked between the mucosa and the alveolar bone. The socket will then be grafted using a particulate bone allograft [EnCore, Osteogenics Biomedical] and the socket access will be sealed with an extension of the dPTFE membrane to ensure complete coverage of the bone graft and the crestal bone.</description>
