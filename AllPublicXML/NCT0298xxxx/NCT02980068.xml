  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-center study to examine distinguishing features of the
      structure and function of the oral and gut microbiome in healthy adult normal volunteers
      compared to volunteers with PH-HFpEF in the breakdown of oral nitrate.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will enroll 60 Group II PH (PH-HFpEF) patients and 60 matched healthy controls over three
      years. The Subjects will receive a single dose of one of the two study drugs, determined by
      whether they will participate in one study visit or two: 15N nitrate (1,000 mg) or 14N Sodium
      Nitrate: standard sodium nitrate, and all will receive one dose of CLA 3g. Twenty of the
      Group II PH subjects and 20 of the control subjects willing to return for a follow up visit
      24 hours after drug administration will receive 15N nitrate. All others will receive standard
      sodium nitrate. CLA will be obtained from GNC (General Nutrition Corporation) and given once.

      Throughout the experiment, we will measure blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate
      as well as co-oximetry. Plasma samples are collected at approximate times 0, 2, and 6 hrs
      post-drug administration. Urine will be collected at approximate times 0 and 6 hrs. We will
      examine plasma and urine nitrate and nitrite. The 40 subjects who return for a second visit
      24 hours post-drug administration will provide an additional plasma and urine sample.
