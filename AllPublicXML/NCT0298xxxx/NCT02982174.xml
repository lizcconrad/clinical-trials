        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female patients &gt; 18 years old who have full legal capacity to volunteer on
             the date the informed consent is signed.

          2. Subjects who can follow the instructions by the clinical staff at the clinical site,
             and can attend examinations on the scheduled examination date.

          3. Subjects who agree to participate in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of cataract or ocular surgical procedures that render the cornea opaque or
             otherwise impact its ability to be imaged using the investigational device.

          2. Fixation problems which may prevent obtaining good quality images in either eye.
