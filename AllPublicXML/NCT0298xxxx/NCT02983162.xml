  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Retrospectively reviewing the participants of the GODDAF database, revealed a
      significant association between the weighted genetic risk score and Dupuytren disease
      recurrence. However, a significant dose-response relation was not found. This might be caused
      by underestimating the recurrence rate, due to the retrospective nature of determining
      recurrence. Therefore, we want to do a follow-up measurement of the GODDAF participants, to
      see whether they suffered from recurrent disease.

      Objective: We aim to determine whether the wGRS is associated with recurrent DD.

      Study design: An observational study, in which the participants of the GODDAF study are
      followed up.

      Study population: Patients affected by Dupuytren disease, aged 18-96 years, who were
      previously included in another study on the genetic basis of Dupuytren disease.

      Intervention (if applicable): NA Main study parameters/endpoints: The main study parameter is
      the presence of recurrent Dupuytren disease.

        Participants are selected among those who participated in a previous study on the genetic
        basis of Dupuytren disease (GODDAF). In this study, patients with Dupuytren disease,
        Peyronie disease or Ledderhose disease and their family members were included. To answer
        the current research question, only the DD patients are required. The GODDAF study was a
        multi-center study. For practical reasons, we only want to include patients who were
        admitted to the UMCG.

        1098 participants were included in the GODDAF study in the Netherlands. Of them 797 were DD
        patients. Of these 797 patients, we estimate that approximately 85% (677) were admitted to
        the UMCG. These patients will be approached for participation.
