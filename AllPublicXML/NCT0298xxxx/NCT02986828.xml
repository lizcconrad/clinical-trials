  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common peripheral entrapment neuropathy with
      involving compression of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel. Rather than other progressive
      disease, CTS is characterized by remission and recurrence. Although many conservative
      managements of CTS, the effectiveness of these methods is insignificant or only persist for a
      short duration. The platelet rich plasma (PRP) is a new and potential treatment for patients
      with kinds of musculoskeletal disorders and recent reports showed being beneficial for
      peripheral neuropathy in animal studies. Since 2014, three small clinical trials showed the
      positive effect of PRP in peripheral neuropathy included CTSin a pilot research. However,
      these studies have not entirely proved the effects of PRP on peripheral neuropathy because
      these studies enrolled small number of patients and lacked controlled design. The
      investigators design a randomized, double-blind, controlled trail to assess the effect after
      ultrasound-guided PRP injection in patients with CTS.

      After obtaining written informed consent, patients with bilateral CTS will been randomized
      into intervention and control side. Participants in intervention group received one-dose
      ultrasound-guided PRP injection and control side received one-dose ultrasound-guided normal
      saline injection. No additional treatment after injection through the study period. The
      primary outcome is visual analog scale (VAS) and secondary outcomes include Boston Carpal
      Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire (BCTQ), cross-sectional area (CSA) of the median nerve, sensory
      nerve conduction velocity of the median nerve, and finger pinch strength. The evaluation was
      performed pretreatment as well as on the 2nd week, 1st, 3rd, 6th month and one year after the
      treatment.
