  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      India has the world's highest prevalence of diabetes, expected to rise to 80 million by 2030.
      This includes many patients with lean diabetes, with low body mass index (BMI) and severe
      complications of diabetes. Despite its prevalence in India and other countries and its dire
      health consequences to individuals with the disease, little is known about the
      aetiopathogenesis and the genotype-phenotype relationship, lean diabetes being a cluster of
      low birth weight individuals, MODY, lipododystrophic disease, type 1 diabetes and
      fibrocalcific disease. While rudimentary tests have suggested defects in both insulin
      secretion and action, no comprehensive metabolic studies have been performed. It is therefore
      unclear as to how these patients should be treated. The optimal therapeutic adjunct whether a
      suitable oralantidiabetic agent or insulin is not yet determined. Defining the metabolic
      defects of 'lean' diabetes should have tremendous therapeutic benefit for millions of
      patients with this elusive condition.

      These studies will define the body composition and metabolic features of lean diabetes and
      enable us to explore a novel frontier in the intriguing dynamic between fat metabolism and
      insulin sensitivity.

        outpatient diabetes practice at CMC India, Jacobi Medical Center and North Central Bronx
        hospital. Subjects with diabetes mellitus will meet the following criteria: ages 19-45
        years, diabetes duration at least one year, negative GAD antibodies, present (&gt;1.0 pmol/l)
