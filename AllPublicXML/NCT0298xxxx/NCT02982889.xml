  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to assess and characterize the safety and tolerability profile of
      LIQ865A and LIQ865B formulations compared to diluent or aqueous bupivacaine hydrochloride
      when infiltrated into a defined area of the medial calf, and to characterize bupivacaine
      plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles after a single dose of LIQ865A
      or LIQ865B, and to determine the individual plasma concentration/time curves and mean PK
      parameters of each product.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infiltration of an aqueous local anesthetic, for example, bupivacaine, into surgical sites at
      closure provides temporary analgesia, typically lasting up to 6 hours, and is one aspect of
      the multimodal approach to postsurgical analgesia or fast-track surgery. However, the limited
      duration of action of local anesthetics, even longer acting agents such as bupivacaine,
      result in patients who are likely to experience end of duration breakthrough pain before they
      are able to take or tolerate oral analgesics, thus necessitating the use of strong parenteral
      analgesics in the immediate postsurgical period. LIQ865A and LIQ865B are two distinct
      formulations of bupivacaine manufactured via Liquidia Technologies PRINT (Particle
      Replication In Non-wetting Templates), which Liquidia intends to pursue for product approval.
      Both formulations being tested have the potential for producing long-lasting control of
      post-surgical incisional pain.
