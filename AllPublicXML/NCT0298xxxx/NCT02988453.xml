      A single blind, randomized controlled trial to investigate the efficacy of a newly manualized
      psychotherapy &quot;Mentalization-Based Training for Adolescents with Conduct Disorder (MBT-CD)&quot;
      in comparison with Treatment As Usual (TAU).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Conduct Disorder is a severe and complex mental disorder with the highest
      incidence in adolescence. Previous studies have shown that family-oriented interventions are
      effective in the treatment of Conduct Disorder. However, most therapies focus rather on
      symptom management and less on etiological causes without inclusion of the family in the
      therapeutic process. Previous research has linked specific symptoms of Conduct Disorder with
      deficits in mentalization ability. Mentalization is the ability to perceive one's own and
      other's behavior as the product of affective and cognitive mental states. Low or missing
      mentalization abilities are regarded as a risk factor for the development and chronification
      of Conduct Disorder.

      Aims: The study aims to investigate the efficacy of a newly manualized psychotherapy
      &quot;Mentalization-Based Training for Adolescents with Conduct Disorder (MBT-CD)&quot; that strives to
      decrease symptoms associated with Conduct Disorder by increasing mentalization in adolescents
      and their families.

      Methods: The study is a single blind, randomized controlled trial, carried out in Heidelberg
      (Germany), Klagenfurt (Austria) and Mainz (Germany). 102 adolescents aged between 12-18, who
      meet the DSM-5 criteria for Conduct Disorder will be randomized to either MBT or TAU. Times
      of measurement: t0 (Screening), T1 (Baseline, at the beginning of therapy), T2 (6 months
      after the beginning of therapy), T3 (at the end of therapy, after 12 months), T4 (follow-up,
      after 18 months).
