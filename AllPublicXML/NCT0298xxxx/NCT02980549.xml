    <textblock>
      Emergence delirium (ED), also called emergence agitation or post-anesthetic excitement, is
      defined as a dissociated state of consciousness, occurring on awakening from general
      anesthesia, in which children exhibit psychomotor agitation, crying and thrashing and are not
      consolable for a period of time, usually 5-15 minutes. Emergence delirium is a common problem
      in pre-school children, with estimates of the incidence ranging from 10-70% of children in
      this age group. These children are agitated, seemingly unaware of their surroundings, and
      typically do not respond to parents or caregivers. They are therefore at risk for
      self-inflicted traumatic injury and complications secondary to disruptions of intravenous
      lines, surgical incisions, or drains. Children with ED typically require more resources in
      the postoperative period than children who do not exhibit ED. Predicting the likelihood of ED
      would allow for better allocation of resources in the post-anesthetic care unit (PACU).

      The peak incidence of ED in children occurs in the same age range at which the peak incidence
      of parasomnias (PS) occurs. The description of parasomnias is strikingly similar to the
      description of ED; the American Academy of Sleep Medicine defines parasomnias as &quot;undesirable
      physical events or experiences that occur during entry into sleep, within sleep or during
      arousals from sleep.&quot; Parasomnias can be diagnosed using a sleep questionnaire.

      The purpose of this pilot study is to determine the incidence of ED and PS in our population,
      in order to determine the number of patients necessary to enroll in a larger study to either
      confirm or reject the hypothesis that ED and PS are correlated.

        One hundred children age 1-6, ASA PS I or II, undergoing surgery by either elective
        otolaryngology (ENT) (including but not limited to: tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy, and lymph
        node biopsy) or elective urologic surgery (including but not limited to: circumcision,
        cystoscopy and related procedures, orchidopexy or hernia), requiring intravenous line
        placement, at American Family children's Hospital at the University of Wisconsin will be
        enrolled in the study. The child's caregiver will complete a sleep questionnaire prior to
        anesthesia and surgery. From the time the anesthetic is discontinued, after surgery, a
        study coordinator will observe the child's emergence from anesthesia and rate emergence
        using the PAED scale every 5 minutes until the child is awake.
