      The study is designed as a single center, post-market, non-randomized, open-label,
      observational clinical study with retrospective and prospective enrollment to evaluate the
      2-year post implantation survivorship of the PyroTITAN™ HRA device following the
      implementation of a new proof test to identify and eliminate devices with sub-standard
      mechanical integrity.

      The study is designed as a single center, post-market, non-randomized, open-label,
      observational clinical study with retrospective and prospective enrollment to evaluate the
      2-year post implantation survivorship of the PyroTITAN™ HRA device following the
      implementation of a new proof test to identify and eliminate devices with sub-standard
      mechanical integrity. The results will be compared to data collected in a prior study
      conducted before implementing the new proof test. The PyroTITAN™ HRA Shoulder prosthesis
      device configuration will include humeral resurfacing CAP without cement. Patients will be
      selected retrospectively and prospectively for recruitment into the study based upon the
      normally accepted criteria for primary shoulder resurfacing arthroplasty.

      137 subjects with PyroTITAN™ HRA Shoulder prosthesis arthroplasties will be implanted and
      followed for up to 60 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients of either sex will be included, if they:

          1. Present (prospective cohort) or presented (retrospective cohort) for primary shoulder
             surface replacement or arthroplasty with any of the following diagnoses:

               1. Osteoarthritis

               2. Rheumatoid / Inflammatory Arthritis

               3. Post-traumatic arthritis.

               4. Focal and large (Hill-Sachs) osteochondral defects.

          2. Subject receives (prospective cohort) the PyroTITAN HRA device after the re-release of
             the product or received (retrospective cohort) the PyroTITAN HRA device after the re-
             release of the product and is enrolled in the study prior to their one-year follow-up
             visit.

          3. Subject is able to or capable of providing consent to participate in the clinical
             investigation.

          4. Subject agrees to comply with this protocol, including participating in required
             follow-up visits at the investigations site and completing study questionnaires.

          5. Subject is at least 21 years of age and skeletally mature at the time of surgery.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients will be excluded from participation if they:

          1. Has/had destruction of the proximal humerus to preclude rigid fixation of the humeral
             component.

          2. Has/had insufficient bone quality as determined by intra- operative evaluation.

          3. Has/had arthritis with defective rotator cuff.

          4. Has/had had a failed rotator cuff surgery.

          5. Has/had loss of musculature, neuromuscular compromise or vascular deficiency in the
             affected limb rendering the procedure unjustified.

          6. Has/had evidence of active infection.

          7. Present/presented with a condition of neuromuscular compromise of the shoulder (e.g.,
             neuropathic joints or brachioplexus injury with a flail shoulder joint).

          8. Are unwilling or unable to comply with a rehabilitation program or would fail to
             return for the postoperative follow- up visits prescribed by the protocol.

          9. Are/were skeletally immature.

         10. Has/had a known allergic reaction to PyroCarbon.

         11. Has/had other conditions such as central nervous system disturbances, alcohol or drug
             addiction, etc. that may make effective evaluation of the joint replacement difficult
             or impossible.

         12. Has/had known, active metastatic or neoplastic disease.

         13. Are/were taking &gt; 10mg/day corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone) excluding inhalers,
             within 3 months prior to surgery.

         14. Are/were under 21 years of age or over 75.

         15. Require/required glenoid replacement.

         16. Retrospective patients cannot be enrolled if they are one year or greater out from the
             index surgery.

         17. Women, who are pregnant or are planning to become pregnant.
