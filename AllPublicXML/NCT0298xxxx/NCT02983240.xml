  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore a new method to stop preterm uterine contractions
      using an electrical device. The device, an &quot;electrical pacemaker for the uterus,&quot; has been
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical research in pregnant women.
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of the device. The
      investigators hypothesize that human preterm uterine contractions can be safely and
      objectively inhibited with a weak electrical current provided by an electrical inhibition
      (EI)/uterine pacemaker device, and that this effect relates to the timing and length of EI
      exposure.

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a new method of preventing the
      human preterm uterine contractions of labor during electrical monitoring. The objective is to
      test a method for the inhibition of human preterm uterine contractions with an electrical
      pacemaker, electrical inhibition (EI). The study will investigate EI associated changes in
      preterm uterine contraction frequency as monitored by objective uterine tocodynamometry and
      adjunct electromyography (EMG) and electrohysterogram (EHG). The endpoint is the
      statistically significant EI induced decrease in the gold standard tocodynamometric monitored
      preterm uterine contraction frequency. The adjunct EMG and EHG monitoring provides valuable
      adjunct data about the electrical activity of the preterm uterine contractions and the effect
      of EI on this activity.

      The investigators hypothesize that human preterm uterine contractions can be safely and
      objectively inhibited with a weak electrical current provided by an electrical inhibition
      (EI)/uterine pacemaker device. This effect can be assessed by the use of a non-invasive
      tocodynamometer. It has been previously been shown that the frequency of contractions during
      preterm labor can be lowered by EI applied by the use of an intravaginal catheter carrying
      electrodes similar to a cardiac pacemaker (Karsdon et al). The investigators hypothesize that
      this effect relates to the timing and length of EI exposure.

    <description>After a 20-minute pre-intervention control period the electrical inhibition will be used intermittently, only when there is monitored contraction, during the 20-minute intervention study period. At the end of the intervention period there will be a 20-minute post-intervention control period. The FHR patterns, tocogram, EMG and EHG, and fECG recordings will be compared to before and after the use of the electrical uterine pacemaker device.</description>

    <description>The catheter is placed under ultrasound guidance into the posterior vaginal fornix next to the external cervical os. The electrode connectors are attached to the EI device. Activating the EI device involves: 1) turning the current pulse duration rotary dial clockwise to the desired setting; this is an important setting and should be set at 20ms; 2) turning the current frequency rotary dial clockwise to the desired setting; 3) turn on the EI device on with the on/off toggle switch; 4) SLOWLY turning the current strength rotary dial clockwise to the desired setting, at this time the red light should be flashing. Usually 5-10mA of current is sufficient, but 20 mA is a maximum. Based on the tocometer recordings the least amount of EI current is given to inhibit the uterine contractions.</description>
