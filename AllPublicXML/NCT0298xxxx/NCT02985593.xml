      The objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single
      intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous (SC) dose of KHK4083 in Japanese or White healthy men in a
      placebo-controlled, single-blind comparative study, and to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of multiple IV doses of KHK4083 in subjects with ulcerative colitis in an
      open-label study.
