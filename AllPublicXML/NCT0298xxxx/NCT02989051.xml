  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Fluid overload is a common complication in children who are admitted to the
      pediatric intensive care for mechanical ventilation. Acute lung infection is a frequent cause
      for admission to the PICU and forms an uniform group with a single organ failure. In these
      critically ill children, fluid overload is associated with adverse outcome. Restricting the
      volume of fluids already in an early stage of ICU admission may prevent fluid overload during
      mechanical ventilation and thus improve clinical outcome. However, at the same time fluid
      restriction may interfere with appropriate energy and macronutrient intake that is needed for
      recovery.

      Objective: The main goal of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility of a restrictive
      fluid management protocol and investigate its effect on the occurrence of fluid overload in
      mechanically ventilated children with acute infectious lung disease.

      Study design: Single-center prospective randomized feasibility and pilot study in preparation
      of a multi-center randomized controlled trial (RCT).

      Study population: Mechanically ventilated children with (suspicion of) acute infectious lung
      disease admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of the Emma Children's Hospital,
      Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam.

      Intervention: Patients receive either liberal (control group) or a restrictive (experimental
      group) fluid treatment, while ensuring appropriate caloric intake.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: Primary outcomes are cumulative fluid balance and body
      weight during the first week of mechanical ventilation. Secondary outcomes (in preparation of
      the larger multi-center RCT) include: mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation and
      oxygenation indices. To determine the feasibility, in- and exclusion rate, adherence to
      treatment arms, need for fluid bolus, need for diuretics and hemodynamic indices as well as
      energy and protein intake are studied.

      Both fluid management protocols reflect a variant of current clinical practice, hence will
      not provide extra burden or risk to patients included in the study. Patients will be
      randomized to either of the fluid protocol arms on admission to the PICU (at start of
      mechanical ventilation). Patients included in the restrictive fluid treatment arm might have
      direct benefit from the study if indeed fluid overload is less common in this group.
