      1. To understand the treatment patterns of OACs and baseline patient characteristics of
           Japanese Non-Valvular Atrial Fibrillation (NVAF) patients

        2. To determine whether warfarin and dabigatran new user group can be balanced using
           propensity score matching using pre-specified baseline covariates.

        3. As an exploratory analysis, to assess mean duration of on-therapy follow-up time in
           database
