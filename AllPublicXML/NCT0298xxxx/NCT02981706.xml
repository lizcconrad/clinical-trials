  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot, single-center, randomized trial of 90 subjects to evaluate complication
      rates and functional status decline in subjects age 70 years and older referred for vascular
      access placement. Subjects will be randomized to arteriovenous fistula (AVF) (n = 45) versus
      arteriovenous graft (AVG) (n = 45), placed in a vascular access monitoring protocol, and
      undergo measurements of functional status including gait speed, grip strength, and
      self-reported function over 6 months. The primary hypothesis to be tested is that AVF
      placement will result in a higher proportion of primary access failure as defined by a binary
      composite primary endpoint of an unsalvageable access or an immature access or a
      non-functional access measured at 6 months compared to AVG placement. In addition, the study
      will evaluate whether AVF placement and a greater number of access procedures will result in
      a greater decline in functional status as measured by the average change over 6 months in
      gait speed, grip strength, and self-reported function as assessed by the Disabilities in Arm,
      Shoulder and Hand Survey.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The elderly population is the fastest growing segment of the dialysis population. A vascular
      access is required to perform dialysis and current guidelines support arteriovenous fistulas
      (AVFs) over arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) as the preferred vascular access for dialysis.
      However, the preferred choice of vascular access in the elderly is unclear. Older adults have
      higher rates of complications from AVF placement compared to AVG placement. Placement of a
      dialysis access and the procedures subsequently required to achieve and maintain access
      functionality could result in further declines of function in this already frail population
      and potentially reduce quality of life. High burdens of cardiovascular disease, heterogeneous
      life expectancy and variable health goals may make the ideal choice of vascular access
      different in the elderly population than the general dialysis population.

    <description>Primary access failure as defined by a binary composite primary endpoint of an unsalvageable access or an immature access or a non-functional access measured at 6 months.
An access determined to be unsalvageable by the vascular surgeon and requiring a new access placement will meet the primary endpoint. For subjects on HD at 6 months, self-report of successful use of the vascular access three times will be considered functional and will not meet the primary endpoint. For all subjects not on HD at 6 months, ultrasound will be performed and interpreted by the vascular surgeon, and a mature, functioning access will be defined as meeting the following criteria:1) 600ml/min blood flow, 2) 6mm diameter dilation of the access, and 3) 6mm or less depth from the skin to the access. Any vascular access that does not fulfill all three criteria will meet the primary endpoint.</description>

    <description>A time to event analysis will be performed looking at the time to successful use of the vascular access. This will be defined either as self-report of being used at dialysis three times successfully or an ultrasound showing a mature, functioning access defined as meeting the following criteria: 1) 600ml/min blood flow, 2) 6mm diameter dilation of the access, and 3) 6mm or less depth from the skin to the access.</description>
