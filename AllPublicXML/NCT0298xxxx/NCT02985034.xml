  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been widely used for small liver lesion detection and
      characterization. In patients who undergo RFA, MRI is often performed before RFA, whereas
      immediate technical success is usually assessed by CT. Conventional visual assessment of two
      modalities may be more challenging than being anticipated, because acquisition position,
      respiration, and spatial resolution differ between the two. Therefore, the study purpose is
      to evaluate the results of software-assisted ablative margin assessment using registration of
      different pre-and post-RFA modalities compared with the conventional method of side-by-side
      MRI-CT comparison in patients with HCCs.
