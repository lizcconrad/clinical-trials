  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histological or cytological diagnosis of ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.

          -  Metastatic disease with documented disease progression following previous treatment
             with at least one, but no more than 2 prior therapies, with one of the prior therapies
             having been either gemcitabine-based or fluoropyrimidine-based therapy. Neoadjuvant
             and/or adjuvant therapies for localized resectable or unresectable PDAC each count as
             a line of therapy if multiagent chemotherapy regimens were administered (and
             neoadjuvant regimen was different than adjuvant regimen) and if the participant
             progressed with metastatic disease while taking or within 6 months of completion of
             (neo)adjuvant therapy.

          -  Measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.

          -  Participant for whom treatment with monotherapy chemotherapy such as gemcitabine or
             capecitabine is a reasonable choice.

          -  Discontinued all prior treatment for cancer at least 14 days prior to initial dose of
             study treatment.

          -  Adequate organ function.

               -  allow alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) up to 5x
                  upper limit of normal (ULN) if liver metastases.

               -  allow bilirubin up to 2.5 times ULN if elevation is not associated with other
                  signs of liver toxicity or can be explained by mechanical obstruction - requires
                  clinical research physician approval.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a personal history of any of the following conditions: syncope of either
             unexplained or cardiovascular etiology, ventricular arrhythmia (including but not
             limited to ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation), or sudden cardiac
             arrest. Exception: Participants with controlled atrial fibrillation for &gt;30 days prior
             to study treatment initiation are eligible.

          -  Have insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus
             are eligible if adequate control of blood glucose level is obtained by oral
             anti-diabetics as documented by hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) &lt;7%.

          -  Have symptomatic central nervous system metastasis. Screening of asymptomatic
             participants is not required for enrollment.

          -  Have had major surgery within 7 days prior to initiation of study drug to allow for
             postoperative healing of the surgical wound and site(s).

          -  Have previously received treatment with any cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 and 6
             inhibitor or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and/or mammalian target of rapamycin
             (mTOR) inhibitor or have a known hypersensitivity to any component of the
             investigational products in this study.

          -  Have a known hypersensitivity to investigator's choice of standard of care
             (gemcitabine or capecitabine).
