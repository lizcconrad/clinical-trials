  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with heart failure, elevated filling pressures may contribute to symptoms while
      not improving cardiac output. The current study is focused on evaluating the relationship
      between exercise capacity, pulmonary pressures, cardiopulmonary parameters, and symptoms of
      dyspnea in patients with heart failure during exercise.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have suggested that intracardiac pressures can be decreased without
      compromising cardiac function. During an invasive cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET),
      catheters are placed within the heart and pulmonary vasculature to evaluate cardiopulmonary
      function in response to exercise. We will be testing whether pulmonary hypertension can be
      prevented during exercise by adjusting right ventricular pre-load. We will also be evaluating
      parameters of cardiopulmonary function during the study.
