      Evidence suggests that student athletes frequently experience sleep problems and are aware of
      the impact of sleep loss on mental and physical outcomes. As such, student athletes are
      motivated to improve sleep quality in order to improve their outcomes for overall athletic
      performance. This study will consist of two parts. The first part will be a survey. Fall
      athletes arrive in the summer, and Part 1 will invite 200 of these athletes to complete a
      survey within the first week of their arrival on campus. The survey will assess multiple
      domains of student-athlete health, namely, sleep duration and quality, mood and depression,
      stress, and mental and physical well-being. The responses to the survey will be confidential,
      and students will be compensated for the survey. At the end of the semester, students will be
      invited to complete the survey again.

      Part 2 is an intervention. 40 of the 200 students will be chosen to participate in the
      intervention, based on predetermined criteria. The intervention will include an information
      session where students may ask questions. Students will be sent text message reminders about
      adherence to the program and will be asked to monitor their sleep quality with sleep diaries.
      The intervention will consist of the half of the 40 chosen students, (20 students), who will
      be provided with blue blocking glasses, a bright light-emitting diode (LED) light, and a fit
      bit. Please note that all of these items are commercially available and are not meant to be
      used to treat or prevent human illness nor injury and do not require FDA oversight. The
      blue-blocking glasses will ensure that blue light from electronic devices will not interfere
      with circadian rhythm or sleep onset, and allow students to fall asleep earlier. The bright
      LED light will provide bright blue light in the morning to help students wake and an amber
      light to promote earlier bedtimes. The Fitbit will estimate sleep and physical activity as
      well as adherence to the program.

      Student athletes face many challenges to their ability to maintain healthy mental and
      physical well-being. The college experience is associated with a number of physiologic,
      social, and environmental stressors that can exert long-term effects on an individual's
      future health and quality of life. In addition, unique demands of student-athletes, including
      academic, physical performance, scheduling, and travel demands, all represent additional
      stressors that interact to produce in poorer outcomes.

      Insufficient sleep duration and poor sleep quality have been increasingly identified as
      important risk factors for physical and mental well-being, especially among young adults. For
      example, insufficient and/or poor quality sleep is strongly associated with the development
      of cardiometabolic disease risk factors, obesity, depression, anxiety disorders, alcohol use,
      other substance use, poorer academic performance, and reduced mental well-being, in addition
      to poorer athletic performance.

      Data from a recent PAC12 report shows that 2/3 of students indicated that lack of flexible
      time is the hardest thing about being an athlete, more than academic work. Further, students
      identified sleep as the first thing that their athletic time commitments kept them from
      doing, 77% felt that they got less sleep than non-athletes, and &gt;50% indicated that they
      would use an extra hour to catch up on sleep. In 2015 data from the American College Health
      Association, (1) 29% of student athletes report significant sleep difficulties, (2) 40%
      reported getting enough sleep on only ≤3 nights, (3) 10% reported no problems with daytime
      sleepiness, (4) &gt;15% reported sleepiness to be at least &quot;a big problem,&quot; (5) &gt;25% reported
      extreme difficulty falling asleep ≥3 nights/week (consistent with a diagnosis of insomnia),
      and (6) &gt;50% reported that sleep problems impacted academic performance. Thus,
      student-athletes frequently experience sleep problems, they recognize the impact of sleep
      loss, and they are likely motivated to improve sleep. These data are consistent with data
      from professional athletes, whose overall sleep quality is poorer than non-athletes.

      Taken together, sleep is an aspect of health that is implicated in many of the most salient
      mental and physical outcomes among college athletes. Despite this, obtaining sufficient sleep
      represents one of the greatest challenges facing student athletes. No programmatic approaches
      have been able to address this problem.

      Accordingly, the proposed study aims to develop and assess the benefits of a novel sleep
      health intervention targeted at student-athletes. This intervention will be assessed with and
      without the assistance of tools to aid in tracking sleep and adjusting to difficult schedules
      in order to evaluate the utility of those approaches.

      The purpose of this research study is to develop and assess the benefits of a novel sleep
      health intervention targeted at student-athletes.

      Overall objectives AIM 1: Assess cross-sectional relationships among sleep, circadian
      preference, and outcomes including overall mental health, stress, mood, anxiety, social
      functioning, and physical well-being.

      AIM 2: Determine whether a simple sleep health intervention, with and without the aid of
      technology, is associated with improvements in mental and physical well-being.

      Primary outcome variable(s) AIM 1: depression score, stress score, mental well-being score,
      anxiety score, and physical well-being score AIM 2: changes in AIM 1 outcomes Secondary
      outcome variable(s) Academic stress, physical performance, substance use, health behaviors,
      soft tissue injuries, missed practices, academic performance

The intervention will consist of an information session, 1-hour training session for recruited per educators,intermittent text messages that will include adherence reminders, encouraging statements, and tips for improving sleep. Messages will be randomized, with no more than 3 messages of any type per week.
