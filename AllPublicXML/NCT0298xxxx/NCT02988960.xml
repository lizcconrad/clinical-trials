    <textblock>
      This is a dose-escalation study designed to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and
      pharmacodynamics of ABBV-927, and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or
      recommended Phase 2 dose (RPTD) for ABBV-927 when administered as monotherapy or as
      combination therapy with ABBV-181 in participants with advanced solid tumors.

             transplantation, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, solid organ transplantation, previous
             clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis, inflammatory bowel disease, or immune-mediated
             pneumonitis.

          -  Participant must not have a history of a coagulopathy or a platelet disorder.

          -  Participant must not have a prior grade greater than or equal to 3 immune-mediated
             neurotoxicity or pneumonitis while receiving immunotherapy.

          -  Participant must not have a known uncontrolled malignancy of the central nervous
             system.

          -  Participants in all combination therapy arms must not have a history of exposure to an
             immunotherapy experiencing an immune-mediated adverse event that required permanent
             discontinuation of the immunotherapy.

          -  Female participants must not be pregnant, breastfeeding or considering becoming
             pregnant during the study or for at least 5 or 6 months (for monotherapy and
             combination therapy participants, respectively) after the last dose of study drug.

          -  Male participants must not be considering fathering a child or donating sperm during
             the study or for at least 3 or 6 months (for monotherapy and combination therapy
