      1. To design and develop a prospective, randomized pilot study utilizing information from
           electronic medical records to address follow-up adherence and reduce the gap between
           recommended and actual follow-up adherence in patients with glaucoma.

        2. To evaluate the impact of a telephone-based intervention on follow-up adherence in
           patients with glaucoma using a randomly assigned comparison with usual care.

      The Wills Eye Health System (WEHS) proposes to conduct a pilot study to evaluate the
      feasibility and effectiveness of a telephone-based intervention to improve rates of follow-up
      exams in patients with glaucoma. The prospective, randomized, controlled trial entitled
      &quot;Improving Access to Eye Care in Patients with Glaucoma&quot; will utilize cohort data from 2013
      electronic medical record information to reduce the gap between recommended and actual
      follow-up utilization of eye care services in glaucoma patients. Patients with glaucoma will
      be recruited from the Wills Eye Glaucoma clinic who were seen between 3/1/13 and 10/31/13. A
      recall list will be generated for patients who have scheduled follow-up appointments from
      9/1/13 to 11/30/13. These patients will be randomly assigned to the &quot;Usual Care&quot; group or
      &quot;Intervention&quot; group. The primary outcome will be successful attendance at a follow-up
      appointment within an appropriate time frame. This intervention is based on a CDC funded
      project at Wills to improve access to eye care in patients with diabetes. Thus, this pilot
      study will test the efficacy of a telephone-based intervention to improve follow-up adherence
      in patients with glaucoma by improving access to eye care.
