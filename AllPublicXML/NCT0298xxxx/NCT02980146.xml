  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Accumulating evidences suggest that colorectal cancer (CRC) progression is not solely
      determined by the genetic abnormalities of the tumor cells but also by the host response.
      Indeed, recent studies in CRC have associated improved survival with a high number of
      tumor-infiltrating (TIL) memory and cytotoxic T lymphocytes, suggesting a link between tumor
      progression and in situ T cell response. Gene expression profiling studies have clearly
      isolated a well-known subgroup of CRC characterized by microsatellite instability (MSI) CRC,
      associated with a strong immune response signature involving both Th1/cytotoxic and immune
      evasion pathways. Moreover, the investigators have previously shown that HLA-E/β2m is
      overexpressed by tumor cells in roughly 20% of CRC and is associated with a worse prognosis,
      most likely due to NK and T effector cell functions upon engagement with the inhibitory NK
      receptor CD94/NKG2A. However, our recent results on an enlarger cohort of patients suggest
      that if this observation holds true for MSS CRC, HLA-E over-expression is inversely
      associated with a good prognosis in MSI CRC. Thus, the phenotype and function of TIL,
      depending on the MSI/MSS status of CRC have to be precised. The investigators hypothesized
      that in MSI CRC, known to express a high number of MSI-H related frameshift peptides which
      represent a pool of tumor specific antigens, HLA-E could present peptides to TCR of non
      conventional CD8+ HLA-E-restricted alpha-betaT cells (also expressing CD94), then inducing a
      strong antitumor cytolytic activity. Therefore, the aim of this project is to determine the
      exact phenotype, function and specificity of the CD94+ TIL in CRC, depending on both the
      HLA-E and the MSI/MSS status of tumor cells. These results could impact the clinical practice
      as anti-NKG2A monoclonal antibodies or frameshift peptide based immunotherapy that could be
      promising new therapeutic options in CRC patients.
