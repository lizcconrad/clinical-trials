      The purpose of this study was to assess and compare the feasibility, success and safety of
      Transradial approach (TRA) verses Transfemoral approach (TFA) for diagnostic and therapeutic
      coronary angiography and coronary interventions, in terms of procedural time, access time,
      fluoroscopy time, procedural failure, , length of hospital stay in terms of days in hospital,
      Complications in terms of thrombophlebitis, hematoma, ecchymosis, infections thrombosis of
      vessel, MACE, Stroke and others.

      Background: PCI has been done traditionally through transfemoral route. But now transradial
      and transbrachial routes are also coming up in practice. We compared transradial versus
      transfemoral routes for ease of operability, time for procedure, complications, and failure
      rates through a prospective study. Methods: 400 Patients admitted in department of cardiology
      for percutaneous interventions were enrolled in the study. 200 patients were assigned to each
      group randomly. A single team did all the procedures. Pre procedure, intra procedure and post
      procedure data of all the patients was collected, tabulated and analysed properly.

      The variables studied include Access time ,Fluoroscopy time and overall procedure time, post
      procedure complications( ecchymosis ,Thrombophelibites, Hematoma, procedure access bleed),
      Failure rates,post procedure myocardial infarction, stroke, acute renal failure and
      infections.

    <description>in case of transfemoral approach our preference was to use right femoral route. The groin was prepared and draped and the site was punctured for femoral access after anesthetizing the skin with 2-4 ml of 1% lignocaine. Once the femoral puncture was done 6F sheath of Cordis variety was introduced and 6F Judkins, catheter was introduced and it was guided under fluoroscopic guidance through the aortic route.</description>

    <description>Our preference was to use the right radial and right femoral routes as they are nearest to operator while facing cardiac monitors, in our hospital. For the radial approach, the wrist was sterilized and draped in usual fashion. Hyperextension over an arm board was done and skin over the puncture site was anesthetized with 2 - 3 ml of 1% lignocaine. A small scaled incision was performed 1 cm proximal to styloid process of radius where arterial pulse was best felt. The radial artery was punctured with a 21 G needle and 6 F sheath (Cardis, Terumo) were introduced into the artery, using Seldinger technique. All patients received verapamil (5mg) to reduce radial artery spasm. Heparin (weight adjusted) was used only in PCIs to prevent artery occlusion and not in elective diagnostic coronary studies. Long 0.038 Terumo guide wire was used under fluoroscopic guidance.</description>
