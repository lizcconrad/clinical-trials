      The aim of the study is to evaluate the errors that may occur during inhalation of two
      devices in patients with asthma, as well as to study whether it relates to the degree of
      control of patient symptoms and the degree of compliance of medication symptoms. Finally, we
      also want to study the degree of patient satisfaction with each of the inhalers studied

        Patients diagnosed as asthma with indication for treatment with an inhaled steroid (IC) and
        long-acting beta agonist (LABA), over 18 years of age, will be consecutively included
        according to the criteria of the GINA 2015 (Global Strategy for Asthma Management and
        Prevention), who have never used dry-powder inhalers, and whose doctor has prescribed one
        of the inhalation systems to be studied in the normal practice of the consultation.
        Patients will be recruited consecutively to complete the sample size established with each
        type of device, in each of the participating centers.
