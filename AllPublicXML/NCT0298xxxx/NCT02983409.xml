  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study based on retrospectively collected data of ureter stone
      patients between 2011 and 2014. Aim of study is to determine radiologic findings of
      non-contrast abdominal computerized tomography as predicting clinical outcomes of suspect
      ureter stone patients in emergency department (ED).

      Gennerally, non-contrast abdominal computerized tomography is a choice of diagnosis for a
      ureter stone patient.There was no known well of efficacy of CT for predicting the outcomes in
      ureter stone patient in ED.

      Hypothesis of this study are some findings of non-contrast CT may be helpful to predict the
      clinical outcomes of pain severity (multidose of painkiller), admission and revisit to ED
      within 5 days after discharge. Investigators analyzed multiple variables including age, sex,
      initial clinical findings, and various CT findings to assess their association with outcomes;
      multidose of painkiller in ED, admission at ED and revisit to ED within 5 days.
