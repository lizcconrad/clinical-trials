    <description>Proceed according to the Intervention Protocol developed by the Nutrition Committee of the Korean Diabetes Association. Aim to lose more than 5% of weight within 6 months, and then aim to keep weight loss constantly. After randomization, the diabetes educator team (physician / nurse / dietician) applies the intervention program for exercise therapy and diet therapy, and manages it through online education (telephone visit) and offline education (institution visit).
Exercise: Moderate or abnormal exercise for more than 150 minutes per week (moderate or abnormal exercise for 30 minutes or more per day)
Diet remedies: Train Calorie intake, nutrient intake and Monitoring.</description>

    <description>After randomization, take 250 mg once a day for 2 weeks. If there is no side effect, take 500 mg once a day for 2 weeks. If there are no side effects, the maximum dose can be increased to 1000mg.</description>
