  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ASP1517 when converted
      from recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) or darbepoetin alfa (DA), compared to DA in
      the treatment of anemia in non-dialysis chronic kidney disease patients. Another uncontrolled
      cohort will be included to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ASP1517 in patients converted
      from epoetin beta pegol (CERA). This study will also assess the safety/efficacy of long term
      treatment of ASP1517 (52 weeks).

  <detailed_description>

      This study consists of the following three cohorts. Cohort 1; subjects converted from rHuEPO
      or DA to ASP1517, Cohort 2; subjects converted from rHuEPO or DA to DA, Cohort 3; subjects
      converted from epoetin beta pegol (CERA) to ASP1517. In Cohort 1 and 3, ASP1517 will be
      administered orally for 52 weeks. In Cohort 2, DA will be administered subcutaneously for 24
      weeks.
