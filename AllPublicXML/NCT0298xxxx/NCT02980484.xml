  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study aims to investigate the efficacy of fMRI-targeted repetitive transcranial
      magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in treatment of major depression associated with traumatic brain
      injury (TBI). Half of patients will receive active treatment, while the other will receive a
      sham treatment with the option of receiving open-label active treatment afterwards.

    <textblock>
      rTMS is an FDA-approved treatment for major depressive disorder, but its utility has not yet
      been investigated for major depression associated with traumatic brain injury.

      This will be a prospective double-blind randomized sham-controlled crossover study. Patients
      in the treatment group will receive 20 sessions of high-frequency rTMS over the left
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and low-frequency rTMS over the right DLPFC. The DLPFC
      will be identified as target by using individual subject-level resting state network
      estimation (Hacker et al, 2013). Patients in the control group will receive 20 sham
      treatments designed to be visibly indistinguishable from active treatment, and will
      subsequently have the option to be crossed over to receive active treatment with the
      aforementioned protocol. A subgroup of patients in each group will receive more detailed
      diffusion imaging (diffusion tensor and diffusion kurtosis imaging) and resting state fMRI
      scans before and after the treatment in order to assess for changes in white matter integrity
      and functional connectivity associated with the treatment.

    <description>Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) will be applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (4000 pulses, 10 Hz, 5-sec trains, 25-sec inter-train interval) followed by the right DLPFC (1000 pulses, 1 Hz frequency, single train). The DLPFC will be identified using individual subject-level resting-state network estimation (Hacker et al, 2013). Each treatment will be completed over the course of 1 hour, and each subject will receive a total of 20 treatments over the course of 20 consecutive weekdays.</description>
