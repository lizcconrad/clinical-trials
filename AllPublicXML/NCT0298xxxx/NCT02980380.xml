      Despite partial success, communication has remained impossible for persons suffering from
      complete motor paralysis but intact cognitive and emotional processing, a state called
      complete locked-in state (CLIS).Very recently NIRS was successfully used to investigate the
      functional activations in the cortex of a CLIS patient in response to auditorily presented
      stimuli containing correct or incorrect statements and open questions. The hemodynamic change
      in the motor cortex of the CLIS patient was recorded across many sessions spread over more
      than a year and was used to train a classifier to predict the &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; answering
      pattern of the CLIS patient who was previously trained to use an electroencephalography (EEG)
      based brain computer interface (BCI) without success. The trained classifier was able to
      provide online feedback (&quot;your answer was classified as (in) correct&quot;) to the patient with
      performance rate of 71.76%. This is the first carefully documented case of communication in a
      CLIS patient with BCI, which holds promise and raises the hope for communication in CLIS.
      Hence, to further validate the preliminary findings of our lab and refine the technology of
      functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)-based BCI for communication in CLIS-patients
      extensive studies will be carried out on CLIS patients using fNIRS based BCIs.

      Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a progressive motor disease of unknown etiology resulting
      eventually in a complete paralysis of the motor system but affecting sensory or cognitive
      functions to a minor degree. There is no treatment available; patients have to decide to
      accept artificial respiration and feeding after the disease destroys respiratory and bulbar
      functions or to die of respiratory or related problems. If they opt for life and accept
      artificial respiration, the disease progresses until the patient loses control of the last
      muscular response, usually the eye muscles. If rudimentary voluntary control of at least one
      muscle is present the syndrome is called locked-in state (LIS); ultimately as the disease
      progresses most ALS patients lose the control of all muscles, the resulting condition is
      called completely locked-in state (CLIS). Patients in CLIS are unable to communicate with the
      external world because all assistive communication aids are based on some remaining motor
      control; hence there is a vital need for an assistive technology to help patients in CLIS to
      communicate needs and feelings to their family members/caregivers. Brain computer interface
      (BCI) represents a promising strategy to establish communication with paralyzed ALS patients,
      as it does not need muscle control. BCI research includes invasive (implantable electrodes on
      or in the neocortex) and noninvasive means (including electroencephalography (EEG),
      magnetoencephalography (MEG), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and near-infrared
      spectroscopy (NIRS)) to record brain activity for conveying the user's intent to devices such
      as simple word-processing programs. Non-invasive methods have been utilized more frequently
      than invasive methods for people with disabilities (such as those with ALS).

      For these conditions (LIS and CLIS) Brain-Computer-Interface were developed and tested
      extensively since the first publication of Birbaumer, 1999 of two LIS patients suffering from
      ALS. Patients select letters or words after learning self-regulation of the particular brain
      signal or by focusing their attention to the desired letter or a letter-matrix and the
      attention related brain potential selects the desired letter. While healthy people and ALS
      patients up to the LIS showed successful EEG-BCI control and communication, completely
      paralyzed ALS patients in CLIS did not learn sufficient EEG-based BCI control for brain
      communication. A single case report by Gallegos Ayala et al., 2014 for the first time
      described a CLIS patient with ALS achieving BCI-control and &quot;yes&quot; - &quot;no&quot; communication to
      simple questions with known positive answers or negative answers and some open questions over
      an extensive time period. NIRS was used to measure and classify cortical oxygenation and
      deoxygenation following the questions. The BCI methodology used in this report departed
      radically from the previous BCI-procedures: a more &quot;reflexive&quot; mode based on learning
      principles of classical conditioning to simple questions was used. This &quot;reflexive&quot; mode
      served to train the classifier separating &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; brain answers silently imagined by
      the patient instead of neuroelectric recording (EEG), functional NIRS (fNIRS) was used.

      Gallegos Ayala et al., 2014 was the first single case report of auditory BCI control by an
      ALS patient in CLIS and to this date no study has reported the successful &quot;yes&quot;- &quot;no&quot;
      communication in several ALS patient in CLIS. In order to replicate and generalize the
      results of Gallegos-Ayala et al., 2014 in the present study fNIRS based BCI will be employed
      for communication in ALS patients in CLIS. The hemodynamic change in the motor cortex of the
      CLIS patient will be recorded across many sessions spread over more than a year and will be
      used to train a classifier to predict the &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; answering pattern of the CLIS
      patient.
