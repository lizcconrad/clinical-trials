  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate whether there is a population-level association between
      circulating respiratory viruses and NHS hospital admissions for acute vascular events using
      data from national infection surveillance and Hospital Episode Statistics.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will conduct a time series study correlating anonymised population level data on all
      samples from NHS laboratories testing positive for six common respiratory viruses with
      admissions to NHS hospitals in England for a range of cardiac and vascular outcomes over the
      time period 01/01/2004 to 31/12/2014. This will involve generating Poisson regression models
      controlling for factors such as seasonal and long-term trends, environmental temperature and
      humidity.

      This study is funded by an Academy of Medical Sciences Starter Grant for Clinical Lecturers.
