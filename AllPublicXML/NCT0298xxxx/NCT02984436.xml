  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational cohort study of ED patients with acute chest pain or
      other symptoms suggestive of ACS. Blood samples will be collected from study participants for
      High-Sensitivity Cardiac Troponin T (hs-cTnT) analysis. Results from hs-cTnT will be used for
      research purposes only.

      Providers will be blinded to results and participants will be treated by their healthcare
      providers per the standard of care. Participants will have 30 and 90 day phone follow-ups to
      ascertain study outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 8 million - 10 million patients complaining of chest pain present to an
      Emergency Department (ED) annually in the United States. To avoid missing the diagnosis of
      acute coronary syndrome (ACS), physicians use a liberal testing strategy. Thus, &gt;50% of ED
      patients with acute chest pain are hospitalized for a comprehensive cardiac evaluation
      (serial cardiac biomarkers and stress testing or angiography). However, &lt;10% of these
      patients are ultimately diagnosed with ACS, and this pervasive over-triage costs an estimated
      $10 billion - $13 billion annually. Current care patterns for acute chest pain fail to focus
      health system resources, such as hospitalization and stress testing, on patients most likely
      to benefit.

      It has demonstrated that an accelerated diagnostic protocol (ADP), called the HEART Pathway,
      which utilizes a clinical decision aid (the HEART score) and serial Cardiac Troponin (cTn)
      measures are sensitive for ACS (&gt;99%) and can substantially reduce hospitalizations, stress
      testing, and cost compared to usual care. The HEART Pathway uses contemporary serial cTn
      measurements at 0 and 3 hours to exclude index myocardial infarction (MI) and relies on
      clinical features (history, ECG, age, and risk factors) to identify patients likely to have
      downstream events. However, the HEART Pathway has limitations: a) It identifies only 20 - 40%
      of patients for early discharge and b) it was developed before high-sensitivity cTn assays
      became available. Able to detect MI earlier and with greater accuracy than contemporary
      assays, hs-cTn assays have the potential to be integrated into decision aids to improve chest
      pain risk stratification. In the near future, hs-cTn assays will replace contemporary assays
      in the United States.
