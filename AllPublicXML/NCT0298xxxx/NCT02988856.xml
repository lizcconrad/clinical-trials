    <textblock>
      Objective 1: Determine the safety and feasibility of externally mounted magnets for extended
      management of chronic eyelid movement disorders by measuring visual acuity and corneal and
      skin integrity and comfort over 8 weeks of wear. Objective 2: Collect preliminary data on the
      relative efficacy of external magnetic devices by comparing them to externally mounted lid
      weights and ptosis crutches using rating scales and video analysis of blink biomechanics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two major types of eye lid movement disorders include lagophthalmos (incomplete closure of
      the eyelids) and blepharoptosis (incomplete opening of the eyelids). Both of these conditions
      occur because of a disruption in the normal agonist-antagonist neuro-muscular complex
      balance. Generally paralysis of the eyelid or facial muscles is responsible for the
      abnormality (the eyelids can close but not open, or open but not close). An external device,
      if able to generate an appropriately balanced force, could restore eyelid movement by
      performing the paralyzed function; for example, a ptotic (droopy) eyelid could be opened, and
      the functioning eyelid closure muscle could overcome the device's force. In prior work the
      investigators established proof-of-concept data demonstrating safety and efficacy for
      temporary management of ptosis up to 2 hour per day for 2 weeks. Preliminary data suggest
      similar safety for lagophthalmos. This study will expand on this preliminary work to examine
      longer wear times, home use, and feasibility for a wider range of eye lid disorders.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of an eyelid movement disorder for at least one eye, moderate cognitive
             function or better defined as greater than or equal to 18 out of 30 on a pre-screening
             of the Mini-Mental State Exam, age 5 or older.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Absence of an eyelid movement disorder or presence of a corneal ulcer. Those with a
             corneal ulcer are at risk for permanent loss of vision and should be managed with
             proven methods. Age less than 5, Severe Cognitive impairment defined as Mini-mental
             score &lt;18, behaviors consistent with delirium (combinations of disorientation,
             hallucinations, delusions, and incoherent speech), or lethargy. These individuals must
             be excluded since participation requires competent self-care, reliable responses and
             cooperation during fitting of the devices.
