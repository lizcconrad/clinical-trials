  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, multicenter, double blind, split-face study in subjects seeking NLF correction.
      Subjects were treated with Revanesse Ultra in the NLF on one side of the face and Restylane
      in the NLF on the other side of the face. The side of the face for each product was randomly
      assigned. The investigator performing the evaluations and the subject were blinded to the
      treatment; injections of the study product were performed by an unblinded injecting
      investigator.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was a randomized, double-blind prospective, comparative study of the efficacy and
      safety of Revanesse Ultra versus the approved product Restylane in the cutaneous correction
      of NLFs. Randomization followed a 1:1 within-subject control model of augmentation correction
      of NLFs. Given that the implants have been shown to not migrate, the within-subject model was
      ideal and had already been shown in previous studies to detect differences. Subjects with
      signs of NLFs who met the entry criteria were enrolled. All subjects were followed for
      efficacy and safety for 6 months. Subjects could have open-label retreatment as needed with
      Revanesse Ultra at 6 months if their baseline WSRS scores had returned to baseline, or as
      needed to achieve optimal correction if their baseline WSRS scores had not returned to
      baseline and were followed for a total of 12 months. The study design was appropriate for the
      indication studied.

    <description>Primary efficacy variable is change from Baseline to Visit 6/Week 24 in Wrinkle Severity Rating Scale (WSRS) - Treatment success is defined as at least a 1-grade improvement in WSRS from baseline to Week 24
WSRS Score categories:
Absent - No visible fold; continuous skin line.
Mild - Shallow but visible fold with a slight indentation; minor facial feature; implant is expected to produce a slight improvement in appearance.
Moderate - Moderately deep folds; clear facial feature visible at normal appearance but not when stretched; excellent correction is expected from injectable implant.
Severe - Very long and deep folds; prominent facial feature; less than 2 mm visible when stretched; significant improvement is expected from injectable implant.
Extreme - Extremely deep and long folds, detrimental to facial appearance; 2 to 4 mm visible V-shaped fold when stretched; unlikely to have satisfactory correction with injectable implant alone.</description>

WSRS Score categories:
Absent - No visible fold; continuous skin line.
Mild - Shallow but visible fold with a slight indentation; minor facial feature; implant is expected to produce a slight improvement in appearance.
Moderate - Moderately deep folds; clear facial feature visible at normal appearance but not when stretched; excellent correction is expected from injectable implant.
Severe - Very long and deep folds; prominent facial feature; less than 2 mm visible when stretched; significant improvement is expected from injectable implant.
Extreme - Extremely deep and long folds, detrimental to facial appearance; 2 to 4 mm visible V-shaped fold when stretched; unlikely to have satisfactory correction with injectable implant alone.</description>
