  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an 8-week pilot trial with oxytocin nasal spray (Syntocinon) as a treatment for
      social impairment in children and adults with high functioning autism spectrum disorders
      (ASD). The investigators hypothesize that oxytocin will be safe, tolerable, and effective in
      improving social deficits in individuals with ASD.

          -  Males and females between 12 and 55 years of age.

          -  Meets the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) as established
             by clinical diagnostic interview

          -  At least moderate severity of ASD impairment as measured by a raw score of â‰¥85 on the
             SRS

          -  Participants and their parent/guardian must be able to speak and understand English
             sufficiently to comprehend the nature of the study and to allow for the completion of

             understand the nature of the study and must sign an IRB-approved informed consent form
             before initiation of any study procedures. Subjects and their parent/guardian must
             have a level of understanding sufficient to communicate with the investigator and
             study coordinator, and to cooperate with all tests and examinations required by the
             protocol.

          -  Each subject and their parent/guardian must understand the nature of the study and
             provide written informed assent/consent.

          -  Subjects with mood, anxiety, or disruptive behavior disorders will be allowed to
             participate in the study provided they do not meet any exclusionary criteria.

          -  Abstinence (no sexual contact)

          -  A barrier method (diaphragm plus spermicide or a condom plus spermicide) in addition
             to one of the following methods:

             be assessed by study clinicians during the psychiatric interview and medical history
             review. If the clinical assessment suggests a psychiatric or medical condition
             demanding acute clinical attention, then the subject will be excluded from
             participating in the trial.

          -  Clinically unstable psychiatric conditions.

          -  Subjects with significant nasal pathology (including atrophic rhinitis, recurrent nose
             bleeds, and history of hypophysectomy).

          -  Clinically abnormal baseline laboratory values falling significantly outside of the
             standard reference ranges for a basic metabolic screen.
