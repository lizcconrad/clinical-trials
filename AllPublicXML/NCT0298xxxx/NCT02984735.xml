      The purpose of this study is to determine the association between gross motor function and
      chewing performance level in children with cerebral palsy (CP). A cross-sectional study was
      conducted in 152 children (ages 2-10y, 51.3% male) with a diagnosis of spastic CP. The Gross
      Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) was used to determine gross motor function
      levels of children. Chewing performance level was determined by using the Karaduman Chewing
      Performance Scale (KCPS).

      Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) was used to determine gross motor function
      levels of children. Chewing performance level was determined by using the Karaduman Chewing
      Performance Scale (KCPS).Children with a diagnosis of spastic CP aged 2 to 12 years who were
      referred due to chewing/swallowing problems by pediatric neurologists were included. The
      inclusion criteria were above the age of 24 months, and had complaints about chewing
      function. Children under the age of 24 months, requiring tube feeding or taking any oral
      nutritional supplements, and used any medicine and/or oral appliances that could affect the
      chewing performance, were excluded.

    <description>Descriptive characteristics including age, height and weight were recorded. Chewing performance level was determined with the Karaduman Chewing Performance Scale (KCPS). Each child was placed in a sitting position (either on a chair or on his/her mother's arm) with the head upright and with the midline position and arms and legs supported, and required to bite and chew a standardized biscuit, and no clue was given on how to chew. The physical therapist rated the chewing performance according to the KCPS. All children underwent a physical examination by a physical therapist to determine gross motor function by applying the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS). In addition to GMFCS, number of affected limbs of the children was also noted.</description>
