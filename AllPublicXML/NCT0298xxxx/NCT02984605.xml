      This study evaluates the nutritional meal replacement and individualized exercise
      prescription intervention on overweight and obese type 2 diabetes mellitus. Half of
      participants will receive nutritional meal replacement and individualized exercise
      prescription on the basis of conventional glucose-lowering treatment, while the other half
      will only receive conventional glucose-lowering treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disease which seriously threatens people's health at
      present. Although new drugs for the treatment of diabetes continue to emerge, but the effect
      of diabetes treatment is still not satisfactory. Medical nutrition therapy (nutrition therapy
      medical, MNT) and exercise therapy are essential measures for prevention and control of
      diabetes at any stage of the natural course of the disease, especially for the overweight and
      obese patients with type 2 diabetes. However, at present, the majority of patients could not
      get the guide from nutrition specialist and sports specialist. In addition, the existing diet
      programs are often more complex, difficult to implement and adhere to in daily life, and
      exercise programs are often lack of targeted. In view of this, the Shanghai peak Sports
      Management Co., Ltd. developed a kind of nutritional meal replacement for weight loss. The
      nutritional powder has the characteristics of high nutrition, low calorie, low glycemic and
      strong satiety, and the heat is only 126kcal, and have a good sense of satiety. Studies have
      shown that 1 times a day with bags of nutritional meal replacement instead of 1 meals for
      obese people have a role in weight loss. In theory, the meal is also suitable for diabetes
      patients, especially overweight and obese type 2 diabetes, such as the combination of
      individual exercise prescription may be better, but there is still a lack of relevant
      research. In view of this, we proposed a joint sports workers, explore nutritional and
      individualized exercise prescription intervention on overweight and obese type 2 diabetes
      mellitus, to explore suitable for China's diabetes lifestyle intervention measures, improve
      the level of prevention and treatment of diabetes in China.
