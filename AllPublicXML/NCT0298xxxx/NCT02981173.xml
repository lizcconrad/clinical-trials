    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of an oral psilocybin pulse regimen
      in cluster headache. Subjects will be randomized to receive oral placebo, low dose
      psilocybin, or high dose psilocybin in three experimental sessions, each separated by 5 days.
      Subjects will maintain a headache diary prior to, during, and after the pulse regimen in
      order to document headache frequency and intensity before, during, and after the pulse
      regimen.
