  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 420 professional and amateur athletes will participate in rehabilitation during
      recovery after sports-related concussion. Participants will be cluster randomized, by study
      site, to a specific study arm. Participants will complete post-injury assessments and the
      intervention of their randomized group aimed at understanding the effects of a
      multidimensional rehabilitation protocol versus enhanced graded exertion on clinical
      recovery, return to play, and patient outcomes after sport related concussion
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 6,600 athletes will complete baseline assessments and 420 of these individuals
      who suffer a concussion during the course of study will be directed through the post-injury
      protocol. Following injury, participants will complete post-injury assessments and follow the
      specific intervention of their randomized group. Post-injury assessments will focus on the
      following: postural stability, neuro-cognitive function, symptom presence and severity,
      fatigue, vision, dual-task ability, and mental status. Participants will complete outcome
      assessments at the following time points: time of injury, 24-48 hours post-injury,
      asymptomatic, and one month post return to play. Symptoms and physical and cognitive activity
      will be assessed daily from the first assessment point to 7 days post return to play. Session
      logs will be kept by the supervising clinician at each study site regardless of study arm.
      Baseline and outcome assessments will be entered into a secure online platform, each study
      site will have the option for paper records of outcomes and session logs to be double entered
      into the electronic system at a later date.

    <time_frame>Baseline, time of injury (within 6 hrs), 24-48 hrs post injury, asymptomatic (1 to approximately 240 days), 1 month post return to play</time_frame>
    <description>The Balance Error Scoring System (BESS) is a commonly used measure of static balance and postural stability. A combination of three stances (narrow double leg stance, single leg stance, and tandem stance) and two footing surfaces (firm surface/floor or medium density foam) are used for the test. Each stance is held, with hands on hips and eyes closed, for 20 seconds. Points are given for specific behaviors (&quot;errors&quot;), including opening eyes, lifting hands off hips, or stepping, stumbling, or falling. It will be conducted by a trained study team member. Safety issue: Fall related injuries.</description>

    <description>At the time of the injury, participants will be given guided activity instructions regarding what activities to consider and how to observe for increases in symptoms. The focus will be on guided activity and not on restriction. Symptoms will be assessed at the end of each day. Once the patient has been asymptomatic for 24 hours or within 85% of their baseline symptom score (BSS) they will begin the enhanced graded exertion progression (Zurich protocol). This protocol will follow the Zurich guidelines, but will be enhanced to include sports and skill specific activities. Each step will be completed on a separate day. A medical professional will determine the symptom status of the athlete and when the graded exertion will begin.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>At injury, participants are given instructions regarding guided activities to consider and how to observe for symptom increase. Focus is on guided activity, not restriction. The intervention consists of 5 phases designed to facilitate an active approach to concussion rehabilitation. Phases are symptom stabilization, impairment reduction, activity integration, recovery acceleration, and sport specific application. Participants complete phase specific activities under direction of a clinical professional, and progress upon meeting specific requirements. Participants are required to spend at least 2 days in Phase 1; subsequent phases are completed on separate days. Once asymptomatic for 24 hours or within 85% of their BSS they begin the enhanced graded exertion progression (Zurich protocol).</description>

             men's/women's basketball or other sports designated at the site).

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Individuals who are at least 13 years of age and those not rostered in a sport at
             his/her school.

        PROFESSIONAL COHORT:

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Individuals who are 18 years of age or older and rostered on one of the participating
             professional teams.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Individuals under 18 years of age and those not rostered on one of the participating
             professional teams.

        ELIGIBILITY FOR THE STUDY INTERVENTION: ALL COHORTS

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Only those athletes with a concussion, guided by the following definition will engage
             in their respective intervention arms following concussion. The study definition is
             one from the Department of Defense (DOD). This definition was chosen, as it is s a
             guiding definition in the NCAA-DOD grand alliance Concussion Assessment, Research and
             Education (CARE) consortium, the largest concussion study to date
             (http://www.careconsortium.net/about/).

          -  Concussion will be defined as a change in brain function following a force to the
             head, which may (or may not) be accompanied by temporary loss of consciousness (LOC)
             (if LOC, temporary is study defined as &lt; 30 minutes based on the Mayo traumatic brain
             injury (TBI) severity guidelines), but is identified in awake individuals with
             measures of neurologic and cognitive dysfunction, as indicated by 1 or more the
             symptoms listed below.

        Symptoms: headache, 'pressure in the head', neck pain, nausea/vomiting, dizziness, blurred
        vision, balance problems, sensitivity to light, sensitivity to noise, feeling slowed down,
        felling like 'in a fog', 'don't feel right, difficulty concentrating, difficulty
        remembering, fatigue/low energy, confusion, drowsiness, trouble falling asleep, more
        emotional, irritability, sadness, nervous/anxious.

          -  These symptoms are from the international consensus document on concussion in sport
             and represent the most common 22 symptoms of concussion (McCroy &amp; Concussion in Sport
             Group, 2013). All concussions are, by general definition, mild TBIs with Glasgow Coma
             Score (GCS) scores of 13-15 (with the majority being 14-15). No athlete with a GCS &lt;13
             will be started in the intervention progression of either arm.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Individuals with any positive/abnormal clinical neuroimaging finding(s) following
             injury WILL NOT enter the intervention or will discontinue the intervention should
             these findings be observed after intervention has begun.

          -  In addition, any individual presenting with any of the moderate-severe TBI
             presentation as defined in the Mayo definitions (Malec, 2007) will not enter the
             intervention or will be withdrawn if observed at a later time. Although these
             individuals will be discontinued from the intervention, the investigators will
             continue to collect assessment time point data on these individuals and documentation
             for their overall care.
