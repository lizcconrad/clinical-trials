      This study evaluates an agenda-setting checklist for patients with cognitive impairment and
      their family companions that is completed in the waiting room in advance of a primary care
      visit. The study team will conduct a two-group randomized trial to examine feasibility of the
      protocol and to compare medical communication (from visit audiotapes) during visits of
      patient-companion dyads who complete the checklist (n=50) with patient-companion dyads who
      receive usual care (n=50)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study team has established proof of concept for a paper-pencil checklist to be used by
      older patients and their companions in the waiting room prior to medical visits. The
      checklist is designed to elicit and align patient and companion perspectives regarding
      patient health issues to discuss with the doctor, and to stimulate discussion about the
      companion's role in the visit. The premise for the checklist is that companions are typically
      motivated to support patients during medical visits, but that they often lack knowledge of
      the patient's health concerns and preferences for communication assistance.

      The study team will conduct a two group pilot randomized trial of up to 100 (50 per group)
      patients ages 65+ with cognitive impairment and their unpaid companion to test the effects of
      the refined checklist for medical communication. Each patient-companion dyad will be
      randomized to the intervention (to receive the checklist) or to a control protocol. The study
      will evaluate the feasibility of delivering the study protocol to patients with cognitive
      impairment and their companions in primary care, and to generate preliminary evidence
      regarding the effect of the checklist on medical communication. For these reasons, the
      control group protocol will comprise usual care which is in this case existing clinical
      practice. Patients (when feasible), companions, and doctors in both intervention and control
      groups will complete in-person post-visit surveys immediately after the visit. Patients (when
      feasible) and companions will separately complete follow-up surveys by telephone two weeks
      after the doctor visit conducted by a research staff member.
