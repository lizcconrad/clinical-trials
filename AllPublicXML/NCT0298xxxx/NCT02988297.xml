        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Probable, probable-laboratory supported, or definite ALS, either sporadic or familial
             according to modified El Escorial criteria

          -  Disease duration &lt; 3 years

          -  Age 18 to 80

          -  Able to provide informed consent and to comply with study procedures

          -  Subjects must not have taken riluzole for at least 30 days, or be on a stable dose of
             riluzole for at least 30 days, prior to screening (riluzole-na√Øve participants are
             permitted in the study)

          -  Women must not be lactating or able to become pregnant (e.g. post menopausal,
             surgically sterile, or using adequate birth control) for the duration of the study,
             and for 3 months after study completion

          -  Men should practice contraception for the duration of the study and for 3 months after
             completion

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of a motor neuron disease other than ALS (e.g., primary lateral sclerosis,
             progressive muscular atrophy, progressive bulbar palsy)

          -  Clinically significant unstable medical condition (other than ALS) that would pose a
             risk to the participant if they were to participate in the study or that would impact
             survival or functional disability in the next 12 months

          -  Abnormal liver function defined as aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine
             aminotransferase (ALT) &gt; 3 times the upper limit of the normal

          -  Renal insufficiency (Glomerular Filtration Rate &lt; 60)

          -  Active pulmonary disease

          -  Prior poor compliance with an inhalation device

          -  The presence of unstable psychiatric disease, cognitive impairment, or dementia that
             would impair ability of the participant to provide informed consent, according to
             judgment by the principal investigator.

          -  History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, clinically significant
             chronic hepatitis, or other active infection.

          -  Active participation in another ALS clinical trial within 30 days of the Screening
             Visit

          -  Other experimental treatments or anti-inflammatory/immunomodulatory medications used
             in the preceding 3 months
