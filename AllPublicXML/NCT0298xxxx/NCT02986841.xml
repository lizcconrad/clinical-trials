  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 4-phase study to implement the NIDA (Common Data Elements) Common Data Elements
      (CDEs) in primary care settings. The study will be conducted at three adult primary care
      clinics, in two large health systems. Each phase will include deliverables essential to move
      to the next phase, and an independent Advisory Committee will review progress and make
      recommendations at each transition about how best to progress to each subsequent phase. Based
      on progress during earlier phases, the Advisory Committee may recommend expansion to
      additional clinics or health systems during the second part of Phase 4.

      Phase 2 prepares for implementation of the screening and CDS tools as part of routine
      clinical practice. A key component of this phase is tailoring the screening and CDS tools
      through an iterative process of usability testing and adaptation of their design. In the KTA
      framework, this phase corresponds to the 'select, tailor, and implement interventions' step.
      Simultaneously, investigators will plan for implementation in one clinic of the MSHS system
      by identifying clinical champions, educating clinic leadership and staff, and conducting a
      workflow analysis to identify barriers and facilitators of implementation.

             screening, using the CDS, and carrying out clinical interventions and referrals to
             address unhealthy substance use. One or two primary care providers will be identified
             from each clinic site to advise the research team on implementation and to serve as a
             resource for their colleagues.
