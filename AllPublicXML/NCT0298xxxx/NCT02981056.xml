      The objective of the study is to investigate the effects of different skincare regimens on
      infants (0-6 months old at the start of the study), specifically focusing on moisturization
      effect. Outcome measures include moisturization, skin pH, skin barrier, physiological
      parameters, reactivity and skin microbiome.

      infants aged 0-6 months at the start of the study. The objective of the study is to
      investigate the effects of different skincare regimens on infants (0-6 months old at the
      start of the study), specifically focusing on moisturization effect. Outcome measures include
      moisturization, skin pH, skin barrier, physiological parameters, reactivity and skin

          1. Any disease or condition of the skin (i.e. dermatitis, eczema, psoriasis, rosacea)
             that the Investigator deems inappropriate for participation.

          2. Any newborn with clinically determined moderate to severe dryness (&gt;2.0) or clinically
             determined erythema (&gt;0.5), rash (&gt;0.5), or an overall skin condition which, in the
             Investigator's judgment, makes the subject ineligible or places the subject at risk
             will not be enrolled in the study.

          3. Any condition requiring use of a topical or oral OTC or prescription medication,
             which, in the investigator's judgment, makes the subject ineligible or places the
             subject at risk (e.g. antibiotics or any other medications that may cause
             gastrointestinal distress/diarrhea that will affect skin condition/cause
             irritation/rash of genital/buttocks area). Child vitamins are allowed and should be
             listed on the Medical Information sheet under the Concurrent Medications section.

             place the newborn at undue risk.

          6. Newborn participant or parent/legal guardian who has experienced unusual
             hypersensitivity or allergic reactivity to fragrances and/or reaction/irritation to
             skin care toiletry products, or who has known allergies/sensitivities to ingredients
             in the provided test products.

          7. Newborn participant or parent/legal guardian with a known condition of asthma or any
             related breathing problems and/or for whom there is a family history of asthma.

          8. Newborn participant with chronic medical conditions or treatments that could interfere
             with the study or pose a risk to the newborn (including known immunodeficiency or lung
             related conditions).

          9. Newborn participant with active localized or general infections including upper
             respiratory infections (ear, nose, throat, fever, cough, etc.).

         10. Conditions that may interfere with the evaluation of the trial results, e.g., medical
             characteristics, diseases, or therapy that may interfere with the effect of the
             investigational product or with the evaluation of efficacy or safety variables. The
             conditions may also include concurrent use of another investigational product or prior
             use of an investigational product or approved medication or other drug within a
             defined period prior to trial enrollment.

         11. Conditions for which subjects should be excluded for safety reasons, e.g., medical
             characteristics, disease, or therapy that may constitute contraindications or risks in
             connection with the use of the investigational product or the specified methods of
             evaluation.

         12. Participation in other clinical trials within 30 days before the current trial begins
             and/or during trial participation

         13. Other medical conditions that may increase the risk associated with trial
             participation or may interfere with the interpretation of trial results and, in the
             judgment of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this
             trial.

         14. Parent/Legal guardian of the newborn is an employee of the investigator or study
             center or is a family member of the employees or the investigator.
