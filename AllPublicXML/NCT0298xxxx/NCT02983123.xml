  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates if the 1-hour rule-in/rule-out algorithm for a high-sensitivity cardiac
      troponin T (hs-cTnT) is safe and effective in patients with a lower pretest probability of an
      acute myocardial infarction (MI). During this study troponins will be collected at 0-, 1- and
      4/6-hours, where absolute changes in the values will decide whether the patient need
      hospitalization or not. Can the time interval to the second troponin test be reduced by using
      an 1-hour high-sensitivity assay?

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many patients seek Oslo Accident and Emergency Outpatient Clinic (OAEOC) with chest pain. The
      majority of these patients have symptoms suggestive of a benign non-cardiac chest pain. These
      patients do not need a directly transfer to the hospital, but can be admitted to the
      Observation Unit at the OAEOC for further pre-hospital testing, including serial troponins
      for a safe rule-out of acute MI. The main goal of this study is to change the current routine
      at the Observation Unit at OAEOC by introducing the 1-hour algorithm for hs-cTnT for a faster
      rule-in/rule-out of acute MI.

      All recruited patients will have serial troponins tested after 0, 1- and 4/6 hours, with the
      main hypothesis that the absolute changes within 1 hour can be used as surrogates for the
      changes and conclusions drawn after 4/6 hours. The cutoff levels used within the 0/1-hour
      algorithm are assay specific as specified in the 2015 European Society of Cardiology
      Guidelines for the management of acute NSTEMI.
