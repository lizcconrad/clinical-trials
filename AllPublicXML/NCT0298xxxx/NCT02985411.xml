      Gardening interventions yield a multitude of measurable benefits that are evaluable within
      the context of a clinical trial. Harvest for Health forges new inroads in the delivery of
      holistic interventions to high risk populations, in this case, older cancer survivors. Since
      the intervention banks on an existing organization's infrastructure, it can easily be
      disseminated nationwide. The next step is to prove efficacy - an essential step in
      contributing to the science in this area, and one which is crucial for future dissemination.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are roughly 15 million cancer survivors in the US, comprising 4% of the populace. The
      number of cancer survivors is skyrocketing due to a confluence of the following factors: 1)
      Americans are aging; 2) cancer is an age-related disease (&gt;60% of cancer survivors are age
      65+); and 3) improvements in early detection and treatment have resulted in many common
      cancers having 5-year cure rates that surpass 90%. Rising numbers of cancer survivors is good
      news, but over $130 billion annually is needed to address subjects long-term health and
      psychosocial needs.113 Compared to others, cancer survivors are at higher risk for other
      cancers, CVD, osteoporosis, and diabetes. Accelerated functional decline also is a major
      problem for cancer survivors, especially those who are older. Baker et al. found that
      compared to age-matched controls, cancer cases (n=45,494) had significantly lower physical
      and social functioning, vitality, mental health, and HRQoL (p&lt;0.001). Results of others are
      similar and suggest that cancer survivors face functional decline that threatens subject
      ability to live independently, posing a burden to themselves, subject families and the health
      care system. Programs exist in land grant universities in all 50 United States. Certified MGs
      complete &gt; 100 hrs. of training and community service (CS) and 25 hrs./year of CS to maintain
      active status. In surveying 184 MGs in AL, the investigators found that 71% were &quot;extremely
      interested&quot; in mentoring a cancer survivor on vegetable gardening for subject CS, and an
      extra 26% stated that &quot;they were interested and wanted to learn more.&quot; Thus, the project is
      of great interest and builds on an extant infrastructure for sustainability. Ultimately, this
      intervention could be disseminated to states with 3 growing seasons and adapted to colder
      weather in those with 2 growing seasons (36 states where 10.8 million older cancer survivors
      reside). The intervention also could be adapted for persons with other chronic diseases in
      which physical functioning and lifestyle behaviors are key. Finally, this project is
      significant because the intervention has great potential for sustainability since gardening:
      (a) involves many activities which prevent burn-out common with other forms of exercise, and
      allows participants to pursue PA outdoors which is related to greater enjoyment; (b) provides
      a sense of achievement and zest for life that come from nurturing and observing new life and
      growth; and (c) imparts natural prompts since plants require regular care (watering) and
      attention (harvesting) and serve as continual and dynamic behavioral cues.

    <measure>Mean physical performance (senior fitness battery) score</measure>

    <description>The Senior Fitness Test Battery tests several physical function domains: i.e., lower and upper body strength (using the 30-second chair stand and arm curl), endurance (using the 2-minute step test), flexibility (using the chair sit-and-reach and back scratch), and agility/dynamic balance (using the 8-ft Get Up &amp; Go). Each test is backed by age and gender appropriate population-based norms; cutpoints denoting high risk for low function are as follows:
30-second chair stand: &lt;8 unassisted stands
Arm curl: &lt;11 curls
2-minute step test: &lt;65 steps

    <description>The number of daily ½ cup servings of vegetables and fruits will be measured by the Eating at America's Table Screener (EATS) questionnaire; this 10-item NCI-developed questionnaire will be able to assess whether individuals meet the goal (2.5 cups per day) or not.</description>

    <measure>Mean plasma alpha carotene value in each group</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma α-carotene will be quantified via high-performance liquid chromatography methods using a Hitachi 911clinical analyzer with standard chemistries by Roche (Indianapolis, IN). The range of α-Carotene varies from 0.1 to 0.90 μmol/ with a mean score of 0.5. This test is conducted for research purposes only. Thus, while a range between 0.50 and 0.90 is desirable, there are no clinically agreed guidelines to provide patients with information on lower levels.</description>

    <measure>Mean rate of physical activity (self report via the CHAMPS and accelerometry</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity will be measured via self-report, using the Community Healthy Activities Models Program for Seniors (CHAMPS), a validated and sensitive tool that captures physical activities specific to older adults. This instrument will be used to assess minutes of moderate to vigorous activity per week. Objective levels of physical activity, will be captured via accelerometry. All participants will be asked to wear an activity monitor on their waist for 7 days at baseline, 1- and 2- year follow-up. Readings obtained from accelerometry also will be used to assess the minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity.</description>
