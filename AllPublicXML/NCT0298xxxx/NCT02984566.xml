      Primary and secondary liver cancer patients will receive liver SABR with or without KIM
      intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, phase II, two stage study designed to evaluate cancer targeting
      accuracy, treatment outcomes and treatment efficiency in 46 patients eligible for SABR for
      either primary or secondary liver malignancy with the incorporation of KIM.

    <description>All patients will receive liver SABR. Kilovoltage Intrafraction Monitoring (KIM) tracking will be trialed during mock treatment. If KIM is successful, it will be used throughout treatment. If unsuccessful, cone beam CT will be used instead.</description>

    <intervention_name>Kilovoltage Intrafraction Monitoring</intervention_name>
    <description>KIM is a novel intrafraction real-time tumour localization method. It involves a single gantry-mounted kV x-ray imager acquiring 2D projections of implanted fiducial markers. 3D positions are then reconstructed by maximum likelihood estimation of a 3D probability density function.</description>
