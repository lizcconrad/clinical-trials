    <measure>Diabetes Self-efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Self-efficacy will be assessed using an 8-item measure developed by Sarkar and colleagues asking respondents to rate their confidence in their ability to perform individual diabetes self-care activities, such as monitoring their blood glucose, getting medical attention, and taking care of their health.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Diabetes Distress</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Diabetes Distress Scale (DDS) is a 17-item measure of diabetes-related emotional distress. It has four subscales corresponding to emotional burden, physician-related distress, regimen distress, and diabetes interpersonal distress.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Health Status</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) is a national resource providing state-of-the-art tools for assessing patient symptoms and health outcomes. Short form measures of physical health (function) and emotional health (depression, anxiety) will be collected.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Outcomes</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months before baseline to 3 months after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and LDL cholesterol lab values, along with systolic and diastolic blood pressure values are collected as part of routine clinical care at every 3 months, and will be recorded from the medical record from the most recent visit.</description>
