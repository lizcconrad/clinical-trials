    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the safety and tolerability of MAGE A10ᶜ⁷⁹⁶T cell therapy in
      subjects who have the appropriate HLA-A2 tissue marker and whose melanoma or bladder or head
      and neck tumor has the MAGE-A10 protein expressed. This study will take a subject's T cells
      and give them a T cell receptor protein that recognizes and attacks the tumors.

      This Phase 1 study is designed as a cell dose escalation trial in HLA-A2*02:01 and -A*02:06
      subjects with MAGE-A10 positive urothelial, melanoma or head and neck tumors. 16-22 subjects
      with inoperable or metastatic (advanced) urothelial cancer, head and neck cancer, or melanoma
      will be treated in this study. The study will enroll subjects using a modified 3+3 cell dose
      escalation design to evaluate dose limiting toxicities and determine the target cell dose
      range. Following the dose escalation phase additional subjects will be enrolled until 10
      subjects are treated at the target cell dose range to further characterize safety,
      tolerability and anti-tumor activity.

      Subjects may be screened in the Screening Protocol (ADP-0000-001) for the presence of
      HLA-A2*02:01 and/or HLA-A*02:06 and have MAGE-A10 expression in the tumor. The absence of
      HLA-A*02:05 in either allele, HLA-B*15:01 or HLA-B*46:01 will also be assessed. The presence
      of HLA A*02 null allele (designated with an &quot;N&quot;, e.g. A*02:32N) as the sole HLA-A*02 allele
      will also be assessed as these are study exclusion criteria.

      Leukapheresis is performed to obtain cells for the manufacture of autologous MAGE-A10ᶜ⁷⁹⁶T
      cell receptor (TCR) bearing T cells. Leukapheresis should be performed as soon as possible
      after the subject is determined to be eligible for study participation.

      When the manufactured MAGE-A10ᶜ⁷⁹⁶T cells are available, subjects will undergo
      lymphodepleting chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine followed by infusion of
      MAGE-A10ᶜ⁷⁹⁶T on Day 1.

      Safety and tolerability as well as anti-tumor activity and biomarker assessments to be
      conducted at each visit are outlined in the Schedule of Procedures. Anti-tumor activity will
      be assessed using RECIST v1.1 criteria.

      All subjects, completing or withdrawing from the interventional portion of the study, will be
      rolled over to a long term follow-up (LTFU) protocol for observation of delayed adverse
      events for 15 years post-infusion in accordance with FDA and EMA requirements for gene
      therapy clinical trials as well as for overall survival. FDA and EMA follow-up requirements
      for gene therapy clinical trials, continues after the subject has been confirmed to have
      progression of disease.

        hormonal contraception, oral contraception, or 2 adequate barrier methods (e.g. diaphragm
        with spermicide, cervical cap with spermicide, or female condom with spermicide -
        spermicides alone are not an adequate method of contraception).

        Or

        Male subject must be surgically sterile or agree to use a double barrier contraception
        method or abstain from heterosexual activity with a female of childbearing potential

        study:

          1. Subject is HLA-A*02:05 in either allele, HLA-B*15:01 and/or HLA-B*46:01 positive.
             Subject has any A*02 null allele (designated with an &quot;N&quot;, e.g. A*02:32N) as the sole

          2. Subject has received or plans to receive the excluded therapy/treatment prior to
             leukapheresis or lymphodepleting chemotherapy (see protocol)

          3. Subject that has toxicity from previous anti-cancer therapy must have recovered to ≤
             Grade 1 prior to enrollment (except for non-clinically significant toxicities, e.g.,
             alopecia, vitiligo). Subjects with Grade 2 toxicities that are deemed stable or
             irreversible e.g. peripheral neuropathy) can be enrolled.

          4. Subject has history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical
             or biologic composition to fludarabine, cyclophosphamide or other agents used in the
             study.

          5. Subject has history of chronic or recurrent (within the last year prior to screening)
             severe autoimmune or immune mediated disease requiring steroids or other
             immunosuppressive treatments.

          6. Subject had major surgery within 4 weeks prior to lymphodepletion; subjects should
             have been fully recovered from any surgical related toxicities.

          7. Subject has symptomatic CNS metastases. Subject with a prior history of symptomatic
             CNS metastases must have received treatment (i.e., stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS),
             whole brain radiation (WBRT) or surgery) and be neurologically stable for at least 1
             month, not requiring anti-seizure medications and off of steroids for at least 14 days
             prior to leukapheresis and lymphodepletion. Subject who has asymptomatic CNS
             metastatic disease without associated edema, shift, requirement for steroids or
             anti-seizure medications are eligible. If such a subject receives SRS or WBRT, a
             minimum period of 2 weeks needs to lapse between the therapy and lymphodepletion.
             Patients with leptomeningeal disease or carcinomatous meningitis are NOT eligible.

          8. Subject has any other active malignancy besides the tumor under study within 3 years
             prior to Screening (prior to leukapheresis and prior to lymphodepletion). Exceptions:
             adequately treated malignancies not likely to require therapy (e.g., completely
             resected non-melanomatous skin carcinoma or successfully treated in situ carcinoma).

             females (≥480 msec for subjects with bundle branch block [BBB]) over 3 consecutive
             ECGs. Either Fridericia's or Bazett's formula may be used to correct the QT interval.

         10. Subject has uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to:

               -  Ongoing or active infection

               -  Clinically significant cardiac disease defined by CHF New York Heart Association

               -  Interstitial lung disease (subjects with existing pneumonitis as a result of
                  radiation are not excluded, however, subjects cannot be oxygen dependent).

             protocol requirements.

         12. Subject has active infection with HIV, HBV, HCV or HTLV as defined below:

               -  Positive serology for HIV

               -  Positive HBV surface antigen test. Positive HBV DNA test. Subjects who are
                  hepatitis B surface antigen negative but are hepatitis B core antibody positive
                  must have undetectable hepatitis B DNA and receive prophylaxis against viral
                  reactivation. Prophylaxis should be initiated prior to lymphodepleting therapy
                  and continued for 6 months.

               -  Positive hepatitis C RNA test. Subjects who are HCV antibody positive will be
                  screened for HCV RNA by any RT PCR or bDNA assay. If HCV antibody is positive,
                  eligibility will be determined based on a negative screening RNA value

               -  Positive serology for HTLV 1 or 2

         13. Subject is pregnant or breastfeeding.
