  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In people diagnosed with chronic kidney disease (CKD) anaemia is a common problem and is
      often treated with EPO (Erythropoietin). One form of EPO used is Darbepoetin (Aranesp®). EPO
      is safe to use but it has been associated with a rise in blood pressure (BP) in some
      individuals. The reasons for this are not clear. To try to explain this, this study will look
      at how EPO affects certain substances in the blood that influence how blood vessels contract
      and relax. This will be conducted by infusing small amounts of Acetylcholine, BQ123 and
      Noradrenaline into the arm vessels of volunteers using an established method called Forearm
      blood flow (plethysmography). Volunteers recruited for this study will include CKD patients
      undergoing therapy with Darbepoetin as part of their normal NHS care as well as healthy
      people not on treatment, who will act as controls. This is an observational pilot study of
      changes in physiology before and after Darbepoetin. It will provide valuable data for a later
      study comparing Darbepoetin to novel agents which work via different pathways to treat
      anaemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot proposal to understand the changes in physiology in patients undergoing
      scheduled therapy with Darbepoetin as part of their normal NHS care. It is therefore an
      observational pilot study of changes in physiology before and after Darbepoetin. Conventional
      erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) are widely used to improve haemoglobin production
      and reduce anaemia in subjects with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, ESAs are
      associated with the development of hypertension and increased cardiovascular morbidity and
      mortality. A number of potential underlying pathophysiological mechanisms have been
      postulated, mostly concerning around altered sensitivity to, or circulating levels of,
      endogenous vasoactive mediators. However, the existing data are inconsistent. Hand et al.
      found that short-term therapy with recombinant erythropoietin was associated with a rise in
      blood pressure, and an increase in vasoconstrictor responsiveness to infused noradrenaline,
      but not to endothelin-1. Serum endothelin-1 levels were elevated compared to controls at
      baseline, but did not change after erythropoietin therapy. Other groups have reported that
      ESA administration increases plasma levels of endothelin-1, and that this is strongly
      correlated with the increase in mean arterial pressure (MAP). Human endothelial cells
      incubated in ESAs show decreased eNOS expression and endothelial nitric oxide (NO)
      production. Ex-vivo studies in resistance vessels of subjects with CKD found impaired
      endothelial function, as assessed by acetylcholine mediated vasodilatation, which was
      partially reversed by blockade of the endothelin receptor (ET-A). In vivo acute and chronic
      ESA administration also impairs endothelial function, which is often considered as a
      surrogate of nitric oxide bioavailability.

      Recently, newer agents have been postulated as a novel alternative to ESAs for treating renal
      anaemia. However, cardiovascular effects are incompletely characterised. Studies elucidating
      the mechanisms for ESA induced vasoconstriction and possible effects that promote
      cardiovascular disease are necessary and it would be imperative to study whether the use of
      these novel agents avoids these effects, potentially making them a better alternative to
      ESAs.

      This pilot study aims to determine the putative mechanisms which may be involved in the BP
      response to ESA use in patients with anaemia associated with CKD who are EPO naïve within the
      last 12 months. Information gained from this study will inform a larger clinical trial that
      is being planned. Healthy volunteers will be recruited to provide a baseline of normal
      responses to compare against.
