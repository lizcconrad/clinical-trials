  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients labeled as penicillin allergic, rarely have this confirmed and being labeled as
      &quot;penicillin allergic&quot; is associated with increased health care costs, adverse effects and
      antibiotic resistance. The investigators will recruit participants from primary care
      practices labeled as penicillin allergic and offer allergy testing. The aim of this study is
      to develop a community, outpatient program for evaluation of penicillin allergy.

    <description>Follow-up questionnaire will be sent to participants to evaluate whether they have needed any antibiotics and if so, whether they've had any reactions. This will be two yes/no questions to assess the incidence of development of new allergic reaction following negative testing.</description>
