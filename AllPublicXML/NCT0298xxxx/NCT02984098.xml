  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the safe of 40% Dextrose oral administration on blood
      glucose concentration and to reducing of pain before painful procedures on healthy term
      neonate 72 hours aged.

    <textblock>
      During the study period around 2000 term neonates were born in the university affiliated
      hospital. Five to 7 term neonates were assessed weekly by the principal investigator (PI) for
      study eligibility. The parents of neonates who met the inclusion criteria received
      information about the study after which they were invited to participate. Written informed
      consent from parent was obtained. The PI entered data into the online Research Randomizer
      which provided a randomization number corresponding to a numbered treatment pack containing
      two syringes, each containing 2ml of an identical and therefore blinded liquid. Study
      investigators, clinical staff, parents and monitors remained blinded to treatment allocation
      until data analysis was completed. To ensure standardization the included term infants were
      not breastfeed 30' prior to the heel stick and a standardized heel lance was used.Each infant
      was taken to a separate room with the mother by the assigned nurse to provide a quite
      environment. All infants were awake at the time of the procedure. Their clothes were removed
      and wet diapers were changed. In both groups, the infants were placed in a supine position on
      a changing table. Dextrose administration and the heel stick were undertaken by an
      experienced staff neonatal nurse. The heel was warmed with a warm wet towel up 2' minutes
      before the procedure. The heel was disinfected shortly before the procedure started.

    <measure>Pain reactivity changes after orally administered 0.5 ml/ kg body 40% dextrose gel or 25% dextrose as procedural pain relief in term neonates requiring a routine heel stick 72 hours after birth.</measure>
    <time_frame>one routine heel stick 72 hours after birth</time_frame>
    <description>Pain reactivity changes were assessed using the Premature Infant Pain Profile-revised (PIPP-R scale) which is composed of three behavioral, two physiological and two contextual pain indicators. Five measurements were undertaken during one routine heel stick which took place 72 hours after birth, on the bed side and coded through direct observation during 15 seconds at 5 different time points:
t0: before the heel lance (= baseline 30 minutes without stimuli before heel stick);
t1: at the end of the heel lance (after the ending of the squeezing of the heel and successful collection of blood drops);
t2: at 1 minute recovery time;
t3: at 2 minutes recovery time;
t4: at 5' minutes recovery time.</description>

    <time_frame>one routine heel stick 72 hours after birth and at 30 minutes after orally 0.5 ml/kg body 40% dextrose gel or 25% dextrose</time_frame>
    <description>Blood glucose levels were measured at two different time points:
First glucose level measurement was performed during heel stick by means of the last drop of collected blood
Second glucose level measurement was performed 30 minutes after the heel stick.</description>
