  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, multi-center, non-comparative study that will be conducted
      on female subjects between 30 and 75 years of age, diagnosed with stress urinary incontinence
      (SUI).

      Following the screening period, including urodynamic assessment to confirm SUI, each subject
      will undergo three FemiLiftTM treatment sessions, and will be followed up for a period of one
      year. The main efficacy endpoint in this study is defined as significant improvement (score
      of 6 or 7) in the urinary incontinence measured with PGI-I score at the 6 months visit.
      Various subjective and objective measures of incontinence severity, quality of life, sexual
      function and tissue effects will be performed at follow up.

      Improvement in SUI symptoms as measured by the following parameters:

      Objective parameters:

        -  Change from baseline in 3 days Urinary Diary - at 1, 2, 6 and 12 months:

             -  Number of incontinence episodes per day

             -  Number of pads used per day

        -  Change from baseline in 1 hour pad test 1, 2, 6 and 12 months

        -  Change from baseline as assessed with Vaginal Biopsy

      Subjective parameters:

        -  Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGI-S) - 4-point Likert scale - at screening, 1,
           2, 6 and 12 months

        -  Change from baseline in Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory Questionnaire (PFDI) - at 1, 2,
           6 and 12 months

        -  Change from baseline in Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire
           (PISQ) - at 1, 2, 6 and 12 months

        -  Change from baseline in Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire (PFIQ) - at 1, 2, 6 and 12
           months

    <description>The Alma Lasers Pixel carbon dioxide laser system delivers fractionated laser energy through a special lens that divides the energy into a 9 x 9 (81) matrix of 1 cm square area. The fractional laser rays cause thermal damage that reaches the vaginal sub - epithelium to stimulate the growth of new collagen.
Intervention: FemiLift vaginal handpiece is inserted into the vagina, to deliver CO2 laser energy. The vaginal epithelium is covered by rotation of vaginal handpiece in 360 degrees, releasing laser energy at 6-8 points, and than withdrawn 1 cm each time to perform the same process, to cover the the total vaginal length.</description>

    <description>The vaginal handpiece sheath is lubricated with baby oil. Set the initial energy level (startup set up recommendations: High mode, 40 millijoule/pixel; according to the patient reaction you can increase up to 120 max. Pulse mode or Repeat mode). The handpiece is inserted as distally as possible, with the laser energy's window oriented to the 12:00 o'clock position. There are position markings on the handpiece. Trigger a laser pulse by pressing the footswitch. Shoot the laser and rotate the probe by one hour at a time. When you reach the 12:00 o'clock position again, withdrawal the headpiece back by one centimeter and repeat the rotational treatment process.</description>
