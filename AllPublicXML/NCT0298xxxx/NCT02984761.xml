  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer have been historically treated with surgery
      whenever they are fit for an operation. However, an alternative treatment known as
      stereotactic radiotherapy now appears to offer an equally effective alternative. Doctors
      believe both are good treatments and are therefore conducting this study to determine if one
      may be possibly better than the other.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The standard of care for stage I non-small cell lung cancer has historically been surgical
      resection in patients who are medically fit to tolerate an operation. Recent data now
      suggests that stereotactic radiotherapy may be a suitable alternative. This includes the
      results from a pooled analysis of two incomplete phase III studies that reported a 15%
      overall survival advantage with stereotactic radiotherapy at 3 years. While these data are
      promising, the median follow-up period was short, the results underpowered, and the findings
      were in contradiction to multiple retrospective studies that demonstrate the outcomes with
      surgery are likely equal or superior. Therefore, the herein trial aims to evaluate these two
      treatments in a prospective randomized fashion with a goal to compare the overall survival
      beyond 5 years. It has been designed to enroll patients who have a long life-expectancy, and
      are fit enough to tolerate an anatomic pulmonary resection with intraoperative lymph node
      sampling.

      This study is designed to open at Veterans Affairs medical centers with expertise in both
      treatments. The recruitment process includes shared decision making and multi-disciplinary
      evaluations with lung cancer specialists. Mandatory evaluations before randomization include
      tissue confirmation of NSCLC, staging with FDG-PET/CT, and biopsies of all hilar and/or
      mediastinal lymph nodes &gt;10mm that have a SUV &gt;2.5. Pre-randomization elective lymph node
      sampling is strongly encouraged, but not required. Following treatment, patients will be
      followed for a minimum of 5 years.

    <description>Stereotactic radiotherapy is an FDA approved treatment for lung cancer. However, for purposes of this study, it is being delivered to an operable population that is typically treated with surgical resection. Participants randomized to stereotactic radiotherapy will be treated according to the location of the tumor. Peripheral tumors will receive either 18 Gy x 3, 14 Gy x 4, or 11.5 Gy x 5 fractions, while central tumors will be treated with 10 Gy x 5. There will not be any elective coverage of local microscopic spread or regional lymph nodes.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to surgery will undergo a standard lobectomy or limited anatomic pulmonary resection (segmentectomy) under general anesthesia. Non-anatomic (wedge) resections are not permitted. Pathological specimens must contain a separately divided pulmonary artery and bronchus, as well as sampled lymph nodes from mediastinal lymph node stations. Participants found to have incidental nodal involvement after surgery will be referred for adjuvant chemotherapy, with our without postoperative radiotherapy.</description>

    <description>An anatomic pulmonary resection is an oncologic procedure that dissects out an anatomically defined segment of the lung to remove all of the lung tissue around a lung tumor. It requires an operation with general anesthesia, with a short hospital stay. The procedure entails removal of lymph nodes inside the chest that might not be easily accessible without an operation.</description>
