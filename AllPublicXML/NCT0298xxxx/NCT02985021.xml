  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, patients who have metastatic prostate cancer that does not respond to hormone
      treatment and who have mutations in certain cancer-related genes will be treated with
      docetaxel and carboplatin chemotherapy.
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 study of the combination of docetaxel and carboplatin in patients with
      germline inactivation of genes in the homologous recombination pathway, including BRCA1,
      BRCA2, and ATM.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE To assess rate of 50% Prostate Specific Androgen (PSA) decline to docetaxel
      and carboplatin

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES To assess PSA response duration to docetaxel and carboplatin To assess
      response of measurable disease To assess time to progression of bone lesions or measurable
      disease (RECIST) To assess response to docetaxel and carboplatin in patients with germline
      alterations or somatic alterations of DNA repair pathway genes (BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM)

        Inclusion Criteria

        Patients meeting the following inclusion criteria will be eligible to participate in this
        study:

             schedule, report for all trial visits and authorization, use and release of health and
             research trial information.

             measurement of &lt; 35 % at baseline, if done.

          7. Treatment with an investigational therapeutic within 30 days of Cycle 1.
