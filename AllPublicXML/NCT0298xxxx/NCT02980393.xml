    <textblock>
      This study is to assess whether a lifestyle intervention with diet, exercise and counselling
      in young patients will have a positive influence on their weight and overall well-being. This
      study will enrol patients between the ages of 7 to 17 years of age, who have congenital heart
      disease, and have been identified being overweight or obese. A total of 40 individuals will
      participate in this study. The study duration will last for 1 year.

    <description>Participants are guided by a fitness specialist who will help the participants to incorporate physical activity into their daily life. Based on the cardiologist assessment, an individual home-based exercise program will be developed. Participants are also guided and advised on nutrition with emphasis on low fat content and increased fiber. The nutrition counseling will focus on sustainable changes and will help participants to make healthy food choices.</description>

  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Lifestyle intervention</intervention_name>
    <description>The structured lifestyle intervention involves alternating weekly phone calls with two health coaches: a registered dietitian and a fitness specialist. A total of 50 phone calls (25 nutrition-related and 25 physical activity-related) are delivered over the one-year study. After six months in the program, participants are introduced to supporting program-specific software that they can access online, as an additional way to interact with the program, set goals, and record their progress. Client and family-centred nutrition and physical activity counselling includes an initial and regular behavioural assessment, and subsequent conversations (i.e., phone calls) using motivational interviewing techniques intended to increase knowledge or skills, and improve behaviours.</description>
