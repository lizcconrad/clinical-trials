  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Meditation is an approach that focuses on the connection between mind and body that uses
      techniques with breath, sound, or movement. It has been the focus of research because of its
      possible benefit for lowering distress and improving health and quality of life. The
      meditation techniques in this study are already used in clinical practice. They are based on
      the Tibetan tradition and focus on use of sound and breathing techniques.

      The goal of this research study is to learn how self-administered meditation (meditation you
      complete on your own) can improve your mood-related symptoms, such as depression and anxiety.
      Researchers also want to learn how to deliver pre-recorded meditations using a computer-based
      application (program, or &quot;app&quot;).

      This is an investigational study. The use of meditation for anxiety in cancer patients is
      considered investigational. The lead researcher can explain how meditation is designed to
      work.

      Up to 30 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Baseline Visit:

      You have already had assessments as part of your routine care that helped show that you were
      eligible to take part in this study. If you agree to take part in this study, the following
      tests and procedures will be performed at your first study visit:

        -  Your vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and breathing rate) will be
           measured.

        -  Your medical history will be collected.

        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and any side effects you may be
           having.

        -  You will complete a questionnaire about how you feel about meditation. This
           questionnaire should take about 5 minutes to complete.

        -  You will complete a basic demographic information (ethnicity, gender, age, and so on)
           questionnaire. This questionnaire should take about 5 minutes to complete.

        -  You will complete 4 questionnaires about any symptoms you may have. The questionnaires
           should take about 15-20 minutes total to complete.

      Study Groups:

      After the baseline visit has been completed, you will be randomly assigned (as in the toss of
      a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups.

        -  If you are enrolled in Group 1, you will be given access to a computer-based meditation
           program for 2 weeks.

        -  If you are enrolled in Group 2, you will be in the control group and will receive access
           to social workers, support groups, spiritual care, and other patient services.

      Meditation Group (Group 1):

      If you are in Group 1, you will be given an iPod that has the meditation app already
      installed on it. You will complete an iPod agreement form and return the iPod on the date
      that is noted in the agreement. If the device is lost, damaged, or stolen please tell the
      research staff as soon as possible. If the device is stolen, please file a police report. A
      copy of this report need to be shared with the study coordinator.

      On your first day, you will watch a pre-recorded video in the app that tells you about the
      practice of meditation and what to expect during meditation (for example, you will do deep
      breathing and visualization exercises). You will return the device at the end of your
      participation.

      You will be encouraged to meditate at least 1 time every day for up to 2 weeks using the
      meditation app. You will be able to set a reminders for yourself through the meditation app.

      Each day, you will open the app and select a 5-, 10-, or 15-minute long meditation session
      that you will follow along with. You will complete a questionnaire about your mood before and
      after each meditation session through the app which will take less than 1 minute to complete
      each time.

      The app will track how many times you meditate each day, how long you meditate for, and when
      you meditate. This information, including your mood questionnaire responses, will be sent to
      the study staff.

      Control Group (Group 2):

      If you are assigned to the waitlist control group you will not receive the meditation app for
      the first 2 weeks. You will have access to your doctor as well as access to social workers,
      support groups, spiritual care, and other patient services.

      All Participants:

      At the end of the study period, all participants may have permanent access to the meditation
      guidance recordings (audio files only), if requested.

      Length of Study:

      Your participation on this study will last up to 2 weeks.You will no longer be able to take
      part in meditation if your symptoms gets worse or if you are unable to follow study
      directions.

      Your participation in this study will be over after you have completed the end-of-study
      visit.

      End-of-Study:

      After you have completed the meditation program for Group 1 or after 2 weeks for Group 2:

        -  Your vital signs will be measured.

        -  Your medical history will be recorded.

        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and any side effects you may be
           having.

        -  You will complete the same 4 questionnaires that you completed at screening.

        -  You will have an interview with a member of the study staff. You will be asked questions
           about your opinions on meditation and if you think you benefitted from meditation. This
           interview should take about 10 minutes to complete.
