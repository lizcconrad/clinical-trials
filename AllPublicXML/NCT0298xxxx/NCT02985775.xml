  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections remain an important cause of morbidity and mortality in
      allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HSCT) recipients, especially in patients received
      haploidentical transplantation. During the past decades, prophylactic or preemptive treatment
      with antiviral drugs has significantly reduce the incidence of early-onset CMV infection.
      Unfortunately, prolonged antiviral treatment is associated with substantial toxicity and may
      delay recovery of virus specific immune responses, resulting in an increasing of late-onset
      CMV disease.

      To date, adoptive immunotherapies have been developed as treatment alternatives to antiviral
      agents for CMV infection after HSCT. Studies have demonstrated that prophylactic or
      preemptive therapy with donor CMV-specific T cells can restore antiviral immunity and clear
      CMV viremia after transplantation. In this prospective clinical phase I/II trial, we propose
      to reconstitute antiviral immunity against CMV by preemptive transfer of CMV-specific T cells
      at an early time point after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. We also propose to
      demonstrate whether protect against CMV is associated with recovery of CMV-specific T cells.

      Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients enrolled into this clinical trial are standard
      risk patients diagnosed with acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and received
      haploidentical blood and marrow transplantation. When patients develop acute graft versus
      host disease (aGVHD), CMVpp65-specific T cells will be generated and transferred to the aGVHD
      controlled patients(patients who do not develop aGVHD are at low risk of refractory CMV
      infection, and are not include in treated group). Physical exams and blood tests will be
      performed -2w, -0d before and +1d, +2w, +4w, +8w, +12w, +24w after adoptive CMV-CTL
      transfusion. The end points were safety and clinical and immunologic response. Following time
      is 12 months.
