  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study involves a course of radiation to up to 5 tumors in the participant's liver
      followed by systemic therapy. (Treatment using substances that travel through the
      bloodstream, reaching and affecting cells all over the body.) The type of radiation is called
      stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). The purpose of this study is to compare the
      effects, good and/or bad, of different doses of SBRT given along with the systemic therapies,
      sorafenib and bavituximab. The researchers want to see which dose of radiation will work best
      in stimulating the immune response and provide local control to the participant's liver. The
      usual treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma that is unresectable can be transarterial
      therapy, sorafenib alone and/or clinical trial.

    <time_frame>From beginning of treatment to 30 days post-treatment, approximately 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Safety and tolerability, as assessed by presence of adverse events, serious adverse events, dose limiting toxicity (DLTs), abnormal laboratory parameters, vital signs. A DLT is defined as any toxicity not attributable to the disease or disease-related processes under investigation, which occurs from the start of radiation up to 42 days and is considered by the Investigators to be definitely, probably, or possibly related to the treatment. A DLT will be defined as any Grade 3 or higher treatment-related toxicity that occurs during the DLT evaluation period.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor response data will be summarized for dosed participants with measurable disease at baseline. Response will be evaluated using the international criteria proposed by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1). Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria. Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. In addition, the immune response criteria will be utilized.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>PFS following SBRT, sorafenib, and bavituximab, will be summarized in the expansion phase arm. Progression will be evaluated using the international criteria proposed by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1). Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria. Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression.) In addition, the immune response criteria will be utilized.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive 3-5 fractions of radiation as determined by the dose level at time of enrollment. The starting dose level will be Dose Level 1: 8 Gy x 3 fractions for a total of 24 Gy. If sufficient treatment related toxicity is observed at the &quot;initial starting dose&quot;, then the dose will be reduced to 16 Gy in 2 fractions of 8 Gy. The dose per fraction for each participant will be provided at the time of registration based on the toxicity experience of the previous participants on study. This will be escalated to 40 Gy in 5 fractions of 8 Gy.</description>
