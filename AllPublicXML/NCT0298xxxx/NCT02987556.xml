  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in crossover trial, with two 12-weeks periods separated by a
      Wash-out period of at least one month. According to randomization ,patients will be provided
      with either Diabeloop system or the usual system.

      Patients will be trained for the use of blood glucose meter, of external Insulin Pump and
      Diabeloop system.

      In both treatment periods, the same blood glucose meter will be used throughout the duration
      of the study.

      In two centers (Centre Hospitalier Sud-Francilien and Grenoble), a pre-study will be
      performed during four weeks to improve the efficacy of Diabeloop system with data collection,
      to test the manual settings by health care providers and patients and to check the
      good-working of the follow-up platform.
