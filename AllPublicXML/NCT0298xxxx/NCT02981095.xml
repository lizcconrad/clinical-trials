    <textblock>
      Investigators aimed to evaluate the impact of bupivacaine administration into the surgical
      field after total thyroidectomy on post-operative pain and analgesic requirement with a
      double-blind, prospective, clinical, randomized study.

      Pain assessment was performed with the visual analog score (VAS). Participants were
      pre-operatively, divided into two groups randomly to receive either bupivacaine or not. One
      group received a 10 ml of bupivacaine solution while the other group was treated with the
      same volume of 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl) through the drain after completion of total
      thyroidectomy procedure. All participants were anesthetized and operated with the same
      anesthesia and surgical team.
