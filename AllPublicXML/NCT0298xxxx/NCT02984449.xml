  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale:

      Patients undergoing cardiac surgery are at risk of developing perioperative complications and
      major adverse cardiac events, mainly related to both their preoperative status and type of
      surgical procedure. Postoperative exercise based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is an effective
      therapy to prolong survival and improve quality of life. However, little is known about the
      effect on post-operative complications, quality of life and return to work of a combined pre-
      and post-operative CR program encompassing physical therapy, dietary counseling,
      psychological support and life style management compared to a CR program, which is provided
      only after cardiac surgery.

      Objective:

      to determine whether a pre- and postoperative (PRE+POST) CR program improves the short (up to
      three months) and long term outcomes (up to one year) of the cardiac surgery (i.e. reduction
      in postoperative surgical complications, readmissions to hospital and major adverse cardiac
      events in conjunction with improvements in the physical component of health related quality
      of life), when compared to postoperative CR only (POST).

      Study design:

      A Prospective Randomized Open controlled trial, Blinded End-point. Patients are randomized
      between two standard care CR programs. One group will start a the POST CR program after
      surgery. The other group will be randomized to a combined PRE+POST CR program.

      Study population:

      Patients (age &gt; 18 years) admitted for elective coronary bypass surgery, valve surgery and/or
      aortic surgery

      Main study parameters/endpoints:

      The primary outcome is a composite weighted endpoint of postoperative surgical complications,
      re-admissions to hospital, major adverse cardiac events and health related quality of life
      (two domains: physical functioning and physical problem), at three months and one year after
      surgery. Endpoints are determined by an independent endpoint committee, blinded to the group
      allocation. Secondary, the study focuses on physical health (cardiorespiratory fitness,
      muscle strength and functional status), psychological health (feelings of anxiety and
      depression), work participation, economics, lifestyle risk factors (physical activity and
      smoking behavior), self-efficacy and illness representations.

    <description>receive a cardiac rehabilitation program consisting of three phases. 1) A preoperative optimization phase (3x p/wk, 4-6 weeks, before surgery), 2) a postoperative in-patient phase (15 to 18 days in rehabilitation center, weekend at home) and, 3) an outpatient patient clinical rehabilitation phase (2x p/wk, 4 weeks). During each phase, patients will visit a physical therapist (group sessions of inspiratory muscle training (IMT), strength training, aerobic cycling and breath, cough and relaxation sessions), a dietician and a psychologist to optimize general health and receive advice on lifestyle, anxiety and stress management. Two additional components are coaching to stop smoking</description>

    <description>Patients who are randomized to the POST group receive an out-patient cardiac rehabilitation program after surgery. In general, this program starts three to six weeks after discharge (phase ǀǀ) and patients always start with an exercise program, which is supervised by a physical therapist for about six weeks (twice a week). On indication support of psychological and/or dietary consult is added.</description>
