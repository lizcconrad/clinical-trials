      Cohort A - neoadjuvant administration of IDH305 at 550 mg BID for 6 weeks followed by
      surgical resection at 6 weeks. If there is no evidence of progressive disease at 6 weeks
      (clinical, radiographic or histopathologic exam), the patient will continue on IDH305 at 550
      mg BID post-operatively for a maximum of 11 additional 28 day cycles. Subsequent assessment
      of disease will occur every 2 months starting in Cycle 2.

      Cohort B - patients who have inoperable tumors but measurable 2HG pre-treatment will be
      treated with IDH305 at 550 mg BID x 6 weeks. If there is adequate sustained knockdown of 2HG
      on MRS and disease is stable or improved, then the patient will continue on treatment for a
      maximum of 11 additional 28 day cycles.

    <textblock>
      IDH1 mutations are thought to be among the earliest mutations occurring during transformation
      of glial cells into gliomas and dependence on the IDH-2HG pathway for survival and growth may
      be most relevant during the indolent phase of low grade tumor growth. However, the
      preclinical workup of IDH inhibitors was technically unable to assess low grade gliomas
      because the cells do not grow in vitro and so cannot be cultured, and the cells have such a
      low proliferation rate that they do not grow in mouse in vivo models. Despite this, Dr. Maher
      and colleagues have studied low grade metabolism in low grade gliomas in vivo, in patients
      undergoing surgical resection and infused with 13C-glucose or 13C-acetate. 13C-labeled tumor
      can be studied by 13C-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) ex vivo. 13C-NMR data from IDH-mutated
      low grade gliomas demonstrate that these tumors are highly metabolically active, capable of
      oxidizing both glucose and acetate while these substrates also contribute carbon to actively
      making 2HG (manuscript in preparation). These data strongly suggest that the low grade tumors
      may be dependent on the IDH pathway for maintaining the altered metabolic state of the cell
      and altered epigenome necessary for tumor growth. Treating low grade gliomas during the
      period of indolent growth poses a challenge in terms of evaluating a molecular targeted
      therapy for response and survival. Standard MRI assessment for low grade gliomas based on
      T2/FLAIR signal can be difficult to quantitate and reflects additional non-specific changes
      in the tumor microenvironment including edema and reactive gliosis. This is exacerbated by
      the natural history of these tumors for which there may be no change in tumor size over
      years. Added to this is the uncertainty that a drug was able to penetrate the blood brain
      barrier, enter the tumor and inhibit the target. To date, there is no non-invasive way to
      determine target inhibition, leaving the patients on a drug that may not inhibit the target
      and the investigator unsure if data being obtained reflects true activity. The current
      clinical trial addresses these challenges through a neoadjuvant clinical trial that combines
      non-invasive evaluation of 2HG by MRS to assess target inhibition within 1 week of study
      entry and direct tumor tissue analysis after 6 weeks on study in the surgical cohort. The
      comprehensive planned tissue analysis is designed to assess the impact of IDH305 on metabolic
      pathways, the epigenome and transcriptome, in addition to standard assessment of cellular
      proliferation and cell kill. A second cohort of patients, the non-surgical cohort, will
      include patients with a presumptive diagnosis of IDH-mutated glioma based on elevated 2HG on
      screening 2HG MRS but without a surgical resection planned because of perceived high risk of
      the procedure. It is anticipated that ~ 93% of these patients will have an IDH1 mutation and
      thus treatment with the IDH1 selective inhibitor will knockdown 2HG. For patients with an
      IDH2 mutation (~7-8%), we anticipate that there will be no change in 2HG. These patients will
      come off study, sparing them any potential toxicity without potential benefit.

             effective contraception methods include:

               -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the patient). Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception.

               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without
                  hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or tubal ligation at least six weeks before
                  taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive
                  status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment Male
                  sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). The vasectomized male
                  partner should be the sole partner for that patient.

               -  Combination of any two of the following (a+b, a+c, or b+c):

                  a. Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or other
                  forms of hormonal, for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone
                  contraception.

               -  In case of use of oral contraception women should have been stable on the same
                  pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.

                  b. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS). c.
                  Barrier methods of contraception: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                  cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository

         16. Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have
             had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile
             (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral
             oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy), total hysterectomy or tubal ligation at
             least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive
             status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she
             considered not of child bearing potential.

         17. Sexually active males must use a condom during intercourse while taking the drug and
             for 30 days after stopping treatment and should not father a child in this period. A
             condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men as well as during intercourse
             with a male partner in order to prevent delivery of the drug via semen.
