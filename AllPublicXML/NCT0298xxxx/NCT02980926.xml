  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a shorter-acting spinal anesthetic called
      mepivacaine has advantages over a longer-acting medication called bupivacaine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Different medications last for different amounts of time and can be changed depending on the
      length of the procedure. A short acting spinal is generally used for procedures lasting less
      than 90 minutes. A longer acting medication would be any that lasts longer than 90 minutes.
      These medications not only block the signals that travel along the pain nerves, they also
      prevent the signals that tell the patients muscles to move. This means that after a total
      knee replacement a patient may delayed in their ability to get up and start walking early
      after surgery. Walking early in the recovery has been shown to decrease the rate of pulmonary
      embolism and death. Ambulating early is also important to prevent loss of strength,
      constipation, pneumonia and urinary retention.

    <time_frame>Exams will take place in 15 minute intervals beginning with arrival to the PACU and will be continued for a maximum of 6 hours or until the exam returns to baseline for 2 consecutive exams.</time_frame>
    <description>Times will be recorded in minutes from the administration of the spinal anesthetic. Normal exam will include intact sensation to light touch of the thigh, calf, foot and toes. Normal motor is defined as ability to perform a straight leg raise, active knee flexion, as well as wiggling of the ankle and toes.</description>

    <description>The total time between the administration of spinal anesthesia to the first episode of spontaneous urination will be recorded. Patients who require greater than 6 hours to urinate independently are followed per hospital protocol with serial bladder scans and straight catheterization for urinary retention as needed. Patients who exceed 6 hours to urinate will be defined as having urinary retention.</description>

    <description>Any episodes of transient radiating pain in the buttocks and thigh will be recorded in the hospital charts during routine post operative rounds. This is also be discussed at the first follow up visit scheduled 2 weeks after surgery.</description>
