  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      1. To develop brief informational videos, Vidscrips, that can be sent to women following
           their mammogram to provide personalized information that integrates breast density with
           overall breast cancer risk, and provides information about additional care
           recommendations and talking tips for conversations with the health care providers.

        2. To test the effectiveness of this tool in a trial of 300 women undergoing mammography.
           The investigators hypothesize that individuals in the intervention arm (vs. those in the
           standard care arm who receive a letter with the language required by the legislation)
           will have more accurate knowledge of their overall risk of breast cancer, their
           Mammographic Breast Density (MBD) result, more appropriate observed and intended use of
           additional screening [i.e., use of screening Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) will be
           reserved only for women at high risk of breast cancer], better satisfaction with their
           episode of breast cancer screening, less decisional conflict about their personal
           decision for any additional evaluation, and less worry about breast cancer.
