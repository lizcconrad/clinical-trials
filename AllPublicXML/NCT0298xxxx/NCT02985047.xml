  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to test a standardized version of brief admission (BA) through
      randomized controlled trial (RCT). The main objective is to evaluate if BA can serve as a
      crisis management model for individuals with recurrent self-harm, including suicide attempts
      and at least three symptoms of Borderline Personality disorder. Participants will be
      allocated to BA + Treatment as Usual (TAU) or TAU.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      When individuals with recurrent self-harm and suicidal behaviour seek acute admission to
      hospital due to a crisis and associated increased suicidal ideation, recommendations for
      clinical care are still conflicting. The risk for iatrogenic effects of inpatient care are
      considerable, and long hospital admissions without a clear treatment structure may predict
      decompensation in functioning. This has resulted in a clinical practice of avoiding admission
      for individuals diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD).

      Brief admission (BA) as an intervention has a longstanding history in the delivery of mental
      health services in the Netherlands. The core elements of brief admission were determined
      through consultation with Dutch researchers, interviews with individuals with experience,
      Dutch clinicians familiar with Brief Admission, and local guidelines from hospitals familiar
      with implementing this crisis management intervention. Core elements of the intervention were
      standardized into a protocol, and an educational manual was developed to train clinicians
      involved in the trial. An objectively rated fidelity measure was developed in order to ensure
      adherence.

    <description>Participants randomised to Brief admission (BA) will participate in a negotiation together with their out-patient clinician and a representative from the ward. The aim of the negotiation is to form an individualised contract defining how BA will work for them. After signing the contract, will have the possibility to admit themselves to hospital according to the procedure stated in the contract.</description>
