  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators select 40 postmenopausal women suffering from RA with 2.5&lt;DAS28&lt;5.5
      referring to rheumatology clinics of Mashhad university of medical sciences and randomly
      divide them into intervention group and placebo group. Evista tab 60mg/day and placebo are
      administered double blind. In the beginning, total bone mineral density (BMD) assessment is
      carried out from all patients and then Alendronate is discontinued in 2 groups. In first 3
      months, in addition to Evista and placebo, MTX tab 2.5mg is given to patients and they are
      allowed to consume NSAID with accurate record of its dosage. Patients visit rheumatologist
      monthly in these 3 months and NSAID should be discontinued 48 hours before every visit. At
      the end of month 3, disease activity and probable complications are evaluated and compared in
      2 groups. Classic regimen should be started for every patient who doesn't enter remission
      phase in first 3 months.

      In 4th month, DMARD regimen is administered and then patients are visited every 2 months.
      Clinical findings are collected in month 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 10, 12. After 12 months, another
      total BMD test is carried out and then data are analyzed including changes in BMD, DAS28,
      EULAR response criteria and HAQ-DI score.
