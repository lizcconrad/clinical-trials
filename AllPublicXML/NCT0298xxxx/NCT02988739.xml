  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is the aim of the present study to compare the immunogenicity induced by a laser-assisted
      epidermally administered seasonal influenza vaccine to an intradermally administered seasonal
      influenza vaccine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The skin is an attractive tissue for vaccination due to the impact of the cutaneous
      micro-environment on the adaptive and non-adaptive immune responses. Conventionally many
      vaccines are administered subcutaneously. Immune-competent cells however are not resident in
      the subcutaneous fat tissue, but instead are located in the epidermis and the dermis of the
      skin. Depending on the targeted skin layer and administration method, different immunological
      outcomes are thus anticipated following vaccination.

      In the present study, the immunogenicity (in terms of activation of B-cell mediated and
      T-cell mediated immune responses) of laser-assisted epidermally administered seasonal
      influenza vaccine will be compared to needle-based intradermal administration of the same
      seasonal influenza vaccine.
