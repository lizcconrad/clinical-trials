  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Twenty patients with gingival recession will be enrolled in this trial. Gingival recession
      will be treated in one side by applying Mucograft® with coronally advanced flap (CAF) while
      on the opposite side a connective tissue graft (from the palate) will be applied with a CAF.

      Patients will be followed for 3 and 6 months by measuring the clinical indexes and
      statistical analyses will be performed to compare the results and to assess the success of
      Mucograft®.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many surgical techniques have used to treat gingival recession such aas repositioned flaps,
      autologous soft tissue grafts (connective tissue graft or free gingival grafts) or allografts
      like acellular dermal which can be used as substitutes for palatal donor tissue. Mucograft®
      (3D collagen matrix) is also an allograft from porcine origin and is designed for soft tissue
      regeneration and considered the ideal solution to autogenous soft tissue grafts and it
      provides an ideal matrix for blood vessel and soft tissue ingrowth.
