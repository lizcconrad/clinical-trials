  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the single-dose pharmacokinetics and relative
      bioavailability of Darunavir (DRV) 800 milligram (mg), Cobicistat (COBI) 150 mg,
      Emtricitabine (FTC) 200 mg, and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) 10 mg when administered as a
      fixed-dose combination (FDC) (D/C/F/TAF) tablet in healthy adult participants when given as
      Treatment A (reference): a single dose of D/C/F/TAF (800/150/200/10 mg) FDC tablet swallowed
      as a whole, intact tablet with 240milliliter (mL) of noncarbonated water.Treatment B (test):
      a single dose of D/C/F/TAF (800/150/200/10 mg) FDC tablet as a split tablet swallowed with
      240 mL of noncarbonated water. Treatment C (test): a single dose of D/C/F/TAF (800/150/200/10
      mg) FDC tablet as a crushed tablet mixed in 4 ounces (oz) of applesauce.
