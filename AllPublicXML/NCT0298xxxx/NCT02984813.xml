    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-armed protocol designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of two
      different combinations of nutritional supplements (study drug) (Glauco-Health and
      Glauco-Select) chosen for their potential to protect retinal ganglion cells against oxidative
      stress, low-grade inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction in patients with open-angle
      glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy. Oxidative stress and retinal cellular dysfunction will be
      measured using a Retinal Metabolic Analyzer (RMA) in this randomized, single center, double
      masked study. Patients with glaucoma will be divided into three treatment arms randomized to
      receive either Glauco-Health, Glauco-Select, or placebo.

      This investigation is using over the counter supplements. The investigation is intended only
      to evaluate their effect on the structure or function of mitochondria as it relates to the
      autofluorescence imaging being conducted in the study. They are not being studied to evaluate
      their ability to diagnose, cure, mitigate, or treat disease.

      These ingredients in these combinations of nutritional supplements have also been reported
      beneficial in diabetic retinopathy. Patients with diabetic retinopathy will be added later as
      an additional arm and an amendment to this effect will be submitted when that portion of the
      study is ready to be initiated. That amendment will include background material, appropriate
      inclusion and exclusion criteria, informed consent, and references. At the current time, only
      the glaucoma proposal and glaucoma patients will be enrolled according to this submitted
      protocol.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female of any race, at least 18 years of age.

          2. Has provided verbal and written informed consent.

             assessments and visits.

          4. Eyes with moderate to severe primary open-angle glaucoma will be enrolled. Glaucoma
             severity will be graded using the WHO glaucoma staging system.

               1. OAG eyes are defined by clinical findings consistent with glaucomatous optic
                  neuropathy (Ex: thinning, excavation, rim erosion or notching of the neuroretinal
                  rim)
