  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TLIF is a popular lumbar interbody fusion technique to perform anterior interbody fusion.
      Pedicle screws providing initial stability have been developed to correct deformity, improve
      the rate of fusion and speed patient's postoperative recovery. Conventionally, an open
      approach is required, using bilateral pedicle screw fixation to provide stability as the gold
      standard. However, the increased stiffness of the fused segments will reduce the bone mineral
      content in adjacent vertebrae, and biomechanical studies have indicated that increased stress
      at the levels adjacent to the fusion may increase adjacent segment pathology. Therefore,
      unilateral pedicle screw fixation had been considered as a means to decrease the stiffness of
      the instrumented segment. Recently, researchers have shown that unilateral instrumented
      spinal fusion provides comparable results and is as effective as bilateral fixation. In
      addition, the cost-effectiveness of this approach is worthy of attention. To our knowledge,
      few randomized controlled studies comparing unilateral versus bilateral instrumented TLIF in
      lumbar degenerative diseases have been reported. The purpose of this study is to compare
      clinical and radiographic outcomes in a series of patients with lumbar degenerative diseases
      using instrumented TLIF with unilateral or bilateral pedicle screw fixation.
