      Introduction: The inspiratory muscle training (IMT) has showed great benefits to the
      respiratory, autonomic system, and mainly to the improvement of physical performance in
      healthy subjects. The latter is related to the improvement of respiratory muscle strength,
      decreased of dyspnoea, peripheral fatigue and delay in activation of muscle metaboreflex
      during exercise. However, there is no consensus about the best training load to IMT, because
      the prescription has been done only using percentage of the maximal inspiratory pressure
      (MIP), and 60% of MIP has been the most used. Therefore, the IMT prescription protocol that
      takes into account the respiratory muscle strength and endurance can provide additional
      benefits to protocols commonly applied, once that respiratory muscle differs from the other
      muscles due to its greater muscle endurance. In the sense, the IMT using inspiratory critical
      pressure (PThC) comes up with an alternative, since the PThC calculation considers these
      characteristics. Objective:To evaluate the effect of the IMT, using PThC, on cardiovascular,
      respiratory, metabolic and autonomic responses in recreational cyclists and compare it to a
      IMT using 60% of MIP. Methods: Thirty men recreational cyclists (20-40 years), will be
      randomized to placebo group (PG, n = 10), PThC group (PTHCG, n = 10) and 60% of MIP group
      (60G, n = 10), taking into account the age and functional aerobic capacity. All subjects will
      perform the following evaluations: cardiovascular autonomic tests [heart rate variability
      (HRV) and blood pressure variability (BPV) at rest and after active postural change],
      pulmonary function testing, respiratory muscle strength (RMS) test, cardiopulmonary exercise
      testing (CPET), incremental respiratory muscle endurance test (iRME) [maximum respiratory
      pressure sustained for 1 minute (PThMAX)] and constant respiratory loads test (95%, 100% and
      105% of PThMAX), both using an linear inspiratory load resistor (PowerBreathe K5). The PThC
      will be obtained from the linear regression using the time(TLIM) of and load of each constant
      test (95%, 100% and 105% PThMAX). During evaluations, the ECG (BioAmp FE132), blood pressure
      (BP), using Finometer Pro (Finapress Medical Systems) and respiration (Marazza) signals will
      be acquired. The signals will be coupled by data acquisition and analysis device (Power Lab
      8/35) and sampled at 1000 Hz. Moreover, the oxyhemoglobin, deoxyhemoglobin and total
      hemoglobin responses will be measured by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) (Oxymon MKIII),
      sampled at 250Hz. The IMT will be performed for 11 weeks (3 times/week, 1-hour duration). The
      session will consist of 5-min warm-up (50% of the training load) and 3 sets of 15 minutes
      (breathing against 100% of the training load) with 1-min interval between them. Heart rate
      and BP will be monitored in all training sessions. The RMS, iRME, respiratory constant load
      tests and CPET will be performed before and after the training, and in the 3rd and 7th week
      (for training load adjustment). The pulmonary function testing and the cardiovascular
      autonomic tests will be performed only before and after training. The data will be analyzed
      by specific statistical tests (parametric and nonparametric) according to the data
      distribution and their respective variances. Significance will be set at p&lt;0.05. Expected
      results: It is expected that the training performed by PTHCG, when compared to training
      performed by 60G and PG, promotes: greater improvementin workload (Watts) and peak oxygen
      uptake (VO2peak); increasing in MIP and iRME; decreasing of dyspnoea and peripheral fatigue;
      delay in activation of muscle metaboreflex in the CPET and iRME; improvement incardiac
      parasympathetic autonomic modulation and reducing cardiac and peripheral sympathetic
      modulation. Moreover, it is expected that the results can provide information for a better
      understanding of the responses obtained by the PThC training in the different evaluated
      systems. In addition, these results will allow the use of this method by health professionals
      as a new assessment tool and IMT prescription.

    <description>Inspiratory Critical Pressure will be used for training and will be determined, from a progressive inspiratory threshold-loading test will start with 50%MIP followed by 10%MIP increments, every 3min until subjects reached a load that there were unable to sustain for at least 1min (PThMAX). On another day, the subjects will perform a constant inspiratory loading test against a resistance of 95%, 100% and 105%PThMAX, for as long as they could tolerate. The intensity loads will be applied according the results of block randomization. The time elapsed until task failure was defined as inspiratory muscle endurance time, and will use to set the PThC. The respiratory work done (inspiratory pressure values) will be plotted in abscissa and the time-to-exhaustion in ordinate, and a linear regression going through the 3 points will be applied using the pressure-1/t relationship. The slope of the parallel line displaced downward projecting to the origin produce the PThC value.</description>
