      To prove that palliative therapy can be practised for congenital lethal malformations within
      the Islamic Code of Ethics.

      After defining lethal malformation no respiratory support is offered and newborns are
      provided with compassionate care.

      This is a prospective observational study where all abnormal antenatal ultrasounds are
      discussed in a weekly prenatal meeting and plans are drawn for management of these abnormal
      fetal findings. Lethal malformations are defined as conditions which will end in death
      regardless of supportive care. Cases are discussed extensively and parents are involved in
      management decisions. When a decision of non- intervention is reached for a lethal
      malformation consent of the family is obtained and a plan of non monitoring for the mother is
      documented together with no resuscitation for the newborn. Families who do not consent to
      such plan are offered full support for the pregnant mother and her newborn. A record of all
      cases is kept available together with the management plan so that the appropriate action is
      taken when the the pregnant lady presents for admission. All babies with lethal malformations
      are recorded whether stillborn or live born and their diagnosis is confirmed. Survival time
      is recorded for each case.

    <ipd_description>All the results of lethal malformations are discussed with participants and the management planned approved. The outcome is explained in terms of mortality and length of survival. The feasibility of applying palliative therapy to lethal congenital malformations will enable muslim doctors to take the decision to withhold respiratory support to these cases.
The results of the study have been sent to the Muslim Scholarly Council to review and evaluate them in relation to Islamic guidelines and hence share on the decision of withholding treatment for terminally sick patients. This will add weight to our decision to apply palliative therapy to babies with lethal congenital malformations.</ipd_description>
