  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of the study drug, atezolizumab, when
      combined with the standard chemotherapy drugs, gemcitabine and cisplatin (or GC). This study
      will help researchers begin to understand whether combining GC with atezolizumab is better,
      the same, or worse than the usual approach of using GC alone.

    <description>This is a two phase study with a single study arm for each phase.
For Phase 1: Following enrollment participants will be treated with combination therapy on a 21 day cycle x 6 cycles. Gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2 on Day 1 and Day 8), cisplatin (70 mg/m2 on Day 1), and atezolizumab (1200 mg on Day 8) will be administered intravenously.
Phase 2: Following enrollment participants will be treated with a single dose of atezolizumab alone followed by combination therapy on a 21-day cycle x 4 cycles, followed by a single dose of atezolizumab alone. Gemcitabine (Dose from Phase I on Day 1 and Day 8), cisplatin (70 mg/m2 on Day 1), and atezolizumab (1200 mg on Day 8) will be administered intravenously.</description>
