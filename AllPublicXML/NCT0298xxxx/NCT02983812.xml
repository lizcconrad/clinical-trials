      In this study, patients will be prospectively enrolled for data collection to design
      prediction models that integrate claims data (inpatient, outpatient, and pharmacy),
      electronic health record data (on clinical, social, and behavioral indicators), and
      patient-generated activity data. Patients will be randomized to use either a smartphone or a
      wearable activity tracking device to capture patient-generated health data.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many hospital readmissions could be prevented if higher risk patients were identified and
      effective interventions then targeted towards these individuals. However, most existing
      claims-based predictive models perform poorly and do not provide timely and actionable
      information. In this study, researchers will prospectively enroll patients for data
      collection to design prediction models that integrate claims data (inpatient, outpatient, and
      pharmacy), electronic health record data (on clinical, social, and behavioral indicators),
      and use wearable devices or smartphones to collect patient-generated data (physical activity
      and sleep patterns). Patients will be randomized to use either a smartphone or a wearable
      activity tracking device to capture patient-generated health data.

        The study population will be drawn from adults admitted to one of the University of
        Pennsylvania Health System hospitals. Patients will be invited to participate by a member
        of the research team prior to hospital discharge.
