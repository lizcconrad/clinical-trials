      Background:

      Tension Type Headache (TTH) is highly frequent and is of great socio-economic importance.
      Andersen et al. 2008 has shown that maximal muscle strength is reduced in women with
      trapezius myalgia. It is shown that specific strength training leads to prolonged pain
      relief.

      Aim:Test: To investigate the impact of TTH on shoulder, and neck muscle strength in patients
      with TTH compared to healthy controls.

      Intervention: To investigate the effect of specific strength training on patients with TTH
      compared with control group, receiving training in ergonomics.

      Method: Test part. 60 tension headache patients, 30 healthy. Muscle testing of neck and
      shoulder. Testing conducted by blinded research assistant.

      Intervention group: 60 patients with tension headache randomly assigned to the intervention
      group or control group. Intervention with specific strength training program runs for 10
      weeks. The control group will be trained in ergonomics. 3 months follow up.

    <description>The specific ST group trained and fulfilled a 10 week training diary. The ST consisted of 4 shoulder exercises. During the training the relative loading was progressively increased from 12 repetitions maximum (RM) (70% of maximal intensity) at the beginning to 8 RM (80 % of the maximal intensity). ST was performed with slow concentric and eccentric muscle contractions with resistance from the elastic bands.</description>

    <description>The control group was instructed in ergonomics and posture correction (EP). They were instructed to pay attention to their sitting posture, and how they used a computer or other working tools. Further they were asked to do a posture correction exercise 3 times a day with 10 repetitions. The EP were seen twice during the 10 week period, and had a phone call every 2 weeks. After 10 weeks they were instructed that they should stop the exercise but continue to be conscious of their ergonomics and sitting position.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Tension-type headache(TTH), inclusion criteria were age between 18 and 65 years and
             for patients a diagnosis of TTH ≥8 headache days per month, and ≤3 migraine days per
             month according to ICHD-II -criteria.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria were medication overuse headache (ICHD-II), previous whiplash or
             head trauma, other major physical or neurological diseases, depression, other mental
             illness, or being unable to understand and speak Danish. The patients were tested for
             cervicogenic headache according to Jull, et al 2007, and were excluded if the test was
             positive.
