    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the anti-tumor activity, as measured by
      overall response rate (ORR) of atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab in patients with
      chemotherapy resistant CRC and positivity for MSI-like molecular signature. This is an
      international, open-label single arm (non-randomized), one-stage phase II trial.
