      The purpose of this investigation is to determine the effects and ease of using hyperbaric
      oxygen therapy HBO2 for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis joint pain and prevention of
      disease progression. In this study it is our intention to not only evaluate effects and ease
      of treatment but time, cost, possible adverse events and effect size in an attempt to predict
      an appropriate sample size and improve on the study design prior to a more extensive study.

      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic, inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology
      that primarily involves synovial joints, typically symmetrically. If untreated and/or
      uncontrolled, joint destruction due to erosion of cartilage and bone can cause joint
      destruction, joint deformities, loss of physical function, severe disability, and
      difficulties maintaining employment.1 ACR/EULAR 2010 classification criteria2 is a
      score-based algorithm which adds scores of 4 categories including, joint involvement,
      serology, acute-phase reactants and duration of symptoms. A score of &gt;6/10 is needed for
      classification of a patient as having definite RA.

      Non-pharmacologic and supplementary therapies include patient education, rest, exercise,
      nutrition counseling, cardiovascular disease risk reduction, and immunizations to decrease
      risk of infectious complications of immunosuppression. These are important in the
      comprehensive management of RA in all stages of disease and are used in addition to drug
      therapy.

      Pharmacologic therapies typically start with a disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD),
      preferably as soon as possible after diagnosis. DMARDs are commonly used in combination with
      anti-inflammatory drugs such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and
      glucocorticoids which are often used as bridging therapies until the DMARDs become effective.
      The goal is disease remission. To assess response, disease activity scores are used along
      with inflammatory markers.

      Three patients with active RA treated in the multi-place hyperbaric facility at DGMC, Travis
      Air Force Base, CA, for non RA-related indications, all noted significant improvement in
      arthralgias, sleep patterns and overall well-being during the course of therapy. Two were
      treated at 2 atmospheres absolute (ATA) oxygen for 90 minutes daily Monday through Friday.
      One patient received 2 ATA air on the same treatment protocol as a participant in a research
      study, and a subsequent course of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) at 2 ATA.

      This is a pilot study. Patients will be recruited through the Rheumatologists, flyers in the
      Rheumatology Clinic or thru Commander Calls.

      During the first visit:

      The rheumatologist will discuss the trial and at this point the subject will be consented and
      the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be reviewed. If subject qualifies they will see the
      Hyperbaric physician who will do physical examination to determine if it is safe for the
      subject to receive HBO2. After this exam is done the subject will be scheduled for a trial
      Hyperbaric session.

      Baseline visit will be done after the subject has tolerated the trial hyperbaric session.
      This visit includes:

        1. A visit with the rheumatologist to do routine assessments to establish baseline
           measurement using the Disease Activity Scale (DAS28)

        2. Labs (CRP and ESR), will be completed. MRI with an without contrast and ultrasound will
           be done on both hands from wrists to proximal phalanges the wrist.

        3. Subjective patient reporting will be captured using the Multi-Dimensional Health
           Assessment Questionnaire (MDHAQ)9

        4. Sleep quality will be tracked using the Pain and Sleep Quality Questionnaire (PSQ-3)10 .
           Surveys will be done by a study team member,

      The subject at this time will be scheduled to start 30 HBO2 treatments. Treatments are daily,
      Monday through Friday

      At month 2, labs (ESR and CRP) will be repeated.

      At the month 3 and month 6 visit the subject will see the rheumatologist to track disease
      activity using the DAS-28. Labs, MRI and Ultrasound will be done. MDHAQ and PSQ-3 will be
      administered at this time.

      If the patient's RA symptoms worsen during the study,the physicians will institute measures
      to address the cause. The medical monitor will be notified and if any adverse events are
      involved, they will be recorded and reported to the IRB.

      Data:

      Data will be entered by authorized study personnel only. Demographic information will be
      collected including sex, age and ethnic background in accordance with HIPPA compliance.

      Data collected during this study will be analyzed at various points in time to include
      physician exams, labs, radiologic studies, joint inspection.

      Changes in joint pain will be determined by self-reporting and results of the standard
      outcome measures questionnaires. A separate sleep survey will be administered.
