      This study evaluates the statistics of influenza and acute respiratory viral infections
      (ARVI) management in outpatient sites in Russia, Armenia, Moldova and Georgia (epidemiology:
      disease severity and bacterial exacerbations; patients demography; treatment duration and
      timelines; safety; quality of treatment) in routine clinical practice with focus on drug
      therapy and usage of interferons' inducers.

    <textblock>
      This non-interventional study covers more than 15000 patients from outpatient sites in
      Russia, Armenia, Moldova and Georgia.

      Influenza and acute respiratory viral infections (ARVI) diagnosis validate according to
      &quot;World Health Organization (WHO) Guidelines for Pharmacological Management of Pandemic
      Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 and other Influenza Viruses&quot;. All patients' examinations are carried
      out according to the local routine clinical practice and local and international standards of
      care.

      The following data will be collected and analyzed after the end of treatment:

        -  demography

        -  disease severity

        -  body temperature

        -  chills and fever (no/mild/severe)

        -  weakness (no/mild/severe)

        -  muscle or joint pain (no/mild/severe)

        -  rhinitis (yes/no)

        -  throat irritation (no/mild/severe)

        -  headache (no/mild/severe)

        -  cough (no/mild/severe)

        -  conjunctivitis (no/mild/severe)

        -  timelines: disease onset, first visit to physician, start of treatment

        -  therapy (drug name, dose, with focus on interferons' inducers)

        -  bacterial exacerbations (yes/no)

        -  therapy of bacterial exacerbations (drug name)

        -  adverse events

        -  results of treatment satisfaction questionnaire for medication (TSQM-9), if completed by
           patient
