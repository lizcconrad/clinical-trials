  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the effects of vertebral manipulation and pain education on
      subjects with neck pain. For this purpose, 90 subjects who present chronic neck pain will be
      selected and allocated randomly into 2 groups: vertebral manipulation group and pain
      education group.
