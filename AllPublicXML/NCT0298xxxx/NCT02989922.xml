    <textblock>
      This a randomized controlled Phase 2/3 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SHR-1210
      in subjects with advanced HCC who failed or intolerable to prior systemic treatment. The
      primary study hypothesis is that SHR-1210 treatment improves Objective Response Rate and
      Overall Survival when compare with SOC.
