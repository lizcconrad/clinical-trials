  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bovine Lung Surfactant is used as standard therapy for reducing alveolar surface tension in
      preterm infants. Here the drug is administered via airways.

      The use on skin to stimulate the wound healing has not yet been tested in humans, i.e. it is
      not yet approved for the treatment of wound healing disorders. In the planned clinical trial
      Lung Surfactant is used the first time for the local treatment of skin lesions in humans. No
      substance related side effects were observed during the application via airways in neonates.

      The innovative idea to use lung surfactant for skin wound healing derived from two
      observations. First, when the skin is injured, the barrier protecting the moist body surface
      from the dry environment is discontinued and in part lost.

      Lung surfactant has several characteristics that might be beneficial for treatment of chronic
      cutaneous wounds.
