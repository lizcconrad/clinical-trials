  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effects of a laboratory-based hypnosis session
      compared to an attention control condition on peripheral blood flow, autonomic stress
      responses, and acute pain responses in adolescents (ages 12-18) with sickle cell disease, and
      examine how perceived disease-related stigma may affect these responses.

    <description>Stigma will be assessed via a questionnaire completed prior to the start of the laboratory session and will be compared to the change in effect, which is assessed by comparing levels of blood flow during the pre-intervention period (15 minutes prior to intervention to a minute before the start of intervention) from blood flow during the intervention period (from the start of the intervention until 30 minutes after the start of the intervention).</description>
