      This is a multi-center, phase II clinical trial to prevent relapse using interleukin-15
      (IL-15) super-agonist complex (ALT-803) maintenance after allogeneic hematopoietic cell
      transplantation (alloHCT) in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome
      (MDS).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) for
             whom an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant using a reduced intensity
             conditioning is planned or has been performed and patient is prior to day 100
             post-transplant.

          2. Able to begin study treatment between day +60 and day +100 after the transplant and
             meets the following transplant related requirements:

               -  Sustained neutrophil (ANC &gt; 1000/mcL) and platelet (&gt; 30,000/mcL) engraftment

               -  50% donor chimerism in blood or bone marrow on most recent bone marrow (BM)
                  evaluation

               -  No evidence of recurrent disease on most recent bone marrow evaluation (day 21 or
                  28 post-transplant is acceptable)

               -  No morphologic evidence of relapse (&lt; 5% bone marrow blasts) on most recent BM
                  evaluation (Day 21 or 28 post-transplant is acceptable)

               -  Ability to be

               -  Ability to be treated in the outpatient setting (not an inpatient)

          3. No history of acute GVHD or acute GVHD which is clinically improving in patients who
             are on topical steroids and/or on low dose systemic steroids (≤ 0.3 mg/kg/day) with
             clinical stability for at least 1 week prior to determination of eligibility

          4. One of the following donor graft sources:

               -  Group 1: sibling donor

               -  Group 2: haploidentical donor [with post-transplant cyclophosphamide]

               -  Group 3: unrelated donor

               -  Group 4: unrelated umbilical cord blood

          5. Karnofsky performance status ≥ 70%

          6. Adequate organ function within 14 days of study enrollment defined as:

               -  Renal: serum creatinine: ≤ 2.0 mg/dL

               -  Hepatic: SGOT or SGPT &lt; 3 x upper limit of institutional normal (ULN)

          7. Sexually active females of child-bearing potential and males with partners of child
             bearing potential must agree to use effective contraception during therapy and for 4
             months after completion of therapy.

          8. Voluntary written consent prior to the performance of any research related procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant or breastfeeding - ALT-803 is an investigational agent. Women of child
             bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at screening.

          2. Class II or greater New York Heart Association Functional Classification criteria or
             serious cardiac arrhythmias likely to increase the risk of cardiac complications of
             cytokine therapy (e.g. ventricular tachycardia, frequent ventricular ectopy, or
             supraventricular tachyarrhythmia requiring chronic therapy)

          3. Marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (e.g. demonstration of a QTc interval
             greater than 500 milliseconds)

          4. Active uncontrolled bacterial, fungal, or viral infections - all prior infections must
             have resolved following optimal therapy.

          5. Active autoimmune disease requiring immunosuppressive therapy

          6. History of severe asthma and currently on chronic medications (mild asthma requiring
             inhaled steroids only is eligible)

          7. Received any investigational agent within the 14 days before the start of study
             treatment (1st dose of ALT-803)
