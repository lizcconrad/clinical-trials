    <textblock>
      Neurokinin (NK) -1 antagonist will be administered to study patients in a double-blind
      placebo trial. Patients receive assessments including Anger Disorder Scale (ADS) and Modified
      Overt Aggression Scale (MOAS) and perform computerized study tasks during MRI before the
      trial begins. Patients receive either one week of the drug or one week of placebo and perform
      the same tasks and assessments. Then patients receive another week of the alternate pill,
      followed by another round of tasks during MRI and assessments.
