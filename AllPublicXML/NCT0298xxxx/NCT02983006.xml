  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety profile, tolerability, and
      immunoregulatory (pharmacodynamic; PD) activity of DS-8273a administered in combination with
      nivolumab (anti-PD-1 antibody) to subjects with unresectable Stage III or Stage IV melanoma.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Principal investigator hypothesize that TRAIL D5 antibody DS-8273a administered in
      combination with nivolumab will be well tolerated and that the addition of DS-8273a will
      augment the clinical efficacy of nivolumab.
