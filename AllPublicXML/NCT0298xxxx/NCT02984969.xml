  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Constipation is a frequent, chronic gastroenterological problem that has many varied symptoms
      and thus has several clinical definitions. According to the Rome III criteria for chronic
      constipation, almost 16% of all adults are affected by chronic constipation worldwide, and it
      is more prevalent and symptomatic in women and elderly people. Slow transit constipation
      (STC) is the major category and is characterized by a decreased rate of colonic transit.

      Recently, many researchers have focused on the relationship between intestinal microbiota and
      constipation and have demonstrated that intestinal microbiota contribute to the
      pathophysiology of functional gastrointestinal disorders.

      Thus, there is a need for an improved understanding of gut microbiota composition in
      constipation patients and for the potential role played by the gut microbiota in the etiology
      of STC.To achieve this goal the investigators characterized and compared the intestinal
      microbiota among carefully selected patients with constipation that were clinically
      categorized based on Rome III criteria, and healthy controls using high throughput
      pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and a conservative approach to detect quantitative
      changes in the relative abundances of taxa.
