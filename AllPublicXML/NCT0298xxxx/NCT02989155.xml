  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the need for a blood transfusion during surgery and
      to evaluate the levels of certain proteins in the blood when given tranexamic acid.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A review of the medical record between January 01 2013 to July 1st 2015 will be used to
      determine if the hypothesis that patients receiving tranexamic acid will have a lower need
      for blood transfusion and there are changes in the levels of the proteins essential for
      healthy oxygen transport throughout the body is correct. Tranexamic acid is a medication
      which may help wounds to stop bleeding more quickly. Participants are not expected to receive
      any direct benefits from participating in this study. Only a small risk of private patient
      medical information being exposed is anticipated. The results of this study will help
      surgeons and the medical community to better understand the uses of this type of drug and its
      possible role in benefiting hip replacement patients during and following surgery.

        Four surgeons providing total hip replacement services within the date range for data
        collection have formally agreed to include their patients in the study population,
        therefore identification of patients will occur through screening the surgery log of each
        surgeon performing these surgeries within the defined date range.
