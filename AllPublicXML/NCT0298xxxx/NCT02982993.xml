  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study provides Hepatitis C virus screening to the members of the World Trade Center
      Health Program followed at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai born during 1945-1965,
      and linkage to care for those found infected. The study will also determine if exposure to
      human remains, blood and/or bodily fluids during the World Trade Center Health Program
      activities are associated with Hepatitis C virus infection. These findings would be relevant
      to the larger United States population, especially to persons born during 1945-1965 who are
      at high risk of Hepatitis C virus infection.

      The purpose of the project is to determine if the World Trade Center Health Program cohort is
      at an increased risk of Hepatitis C virus infection, determine if human exposure to human
      remains, blood and/or body fluids during the World Trade Center recovery activities is
      associated with increased risk of Hepatitis C virus infection, and to determine if referral
      to a co-located site for Hepatitis C virus care is associated with improved linkage to
      Hepatitis C virus care in the members of the World Trade Center Health Program born during
      1945 through 1965.

        The World Trade Center Health Program is a longitudinal cohort of World Trade Center rescue
        and recovery workers who participated in the World Trade Center Screening, Monitoring, and
        Treatment Program at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, New York.
        Eligible World Trade Center responders were those who had worked or volunteered in lower
        Manhattan, or the Staten island landfill or barge-loading piers for 4 hours or more from
        September 11, 2001, to September 14, 2001; 24 hours or more during September, 2001; 80
        hours or more from September, 2001, to December, 2001. Persons enrolled in the World Trade
        Center Health Program and were born from 1945-1965 are eligible.
