  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a 52-weeks, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double- placebo, parallel
      controlled phase VI trial being carried out in 20 centers around China. The study population
      includes amnestic mild cognitive impairment patients (planned a total of 360) aged 55-85 in
      both gender. Participants will be randomly allocated to Qinggongshoutao bolus (7g per time,2
      times per day) and placebo identified to Ginkgo biloba (Ginaton), Ginkgo biloba (Ginaton)
      (80mg per time, 2 times per day) and placebo identified to Qinggongshoutao bolus, or placebo
      identified to Qinggongshoutao bolus and placebo identified to Ginkgo biloba (Ginaton) for a
      52-weeks double-blind treatment period. The primary outcome measure is change from baseline
      in the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale- Cognition Subscale (ADAS-cog) and rate of
      conversion to dementia. The secondary outcomes are changes from baseline in the Mini-Mental
      State Examination(MMSE), Delayed Story Recall(DSR), Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative
      Study/Activities of Daily Living scale adapted for MCI patients (ADCS/MCI/ADL24). Safety is
      being assessed by observing side effects and adverse reaction during the entire treatment
      period. Statistical analysis will be conducted according to per-protocol population and
      intend-to-treat population and the safety will be analyzed in safety set.
