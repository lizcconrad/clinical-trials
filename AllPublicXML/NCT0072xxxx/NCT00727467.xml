  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of an IACD i.e. Apple iPod-shuffle, on
      freezing and gait speed in people with a diagnosis of PD through the implementation of a
      randomised controlled trial. A secondary aim of the study is to evaluate the impact of such a
      device on the quality of life of people with stroke through the administration of a
      self-report questionnaire. The IACD will be pre-loaded with an individualised auditory cueing
      frequency (metronome sound) matched to the walking speed of the individual with PD.

    <textblock>
      The investigators calculated and pre-loaded 100 baseline frequencies (less 10%) in the sound
      of a metronome beat in an MP3 format (30 - 130 BPM) [38] onto a DVD-Rom. A user manual was
      created with a set of instructions that gives each physiotherapist a step-by-step guide on
      how to calculate the correct beat for their participants and how to successfully upload this
      beat onto the iPod. In addition physiotherapists in participating centres attended a training
      session on how to complete the tasks. A pack including the DVD-Rom, user manual, information
      leaflet and consent was sent to participating centres. Recruitment is due to commence in
      September 2008.

    <description>On Days 1-8 of the trial, participants in Group A will be given the iPod with some music on the device to allow all participants to become familiar with the device i.e. turning device on and off, increasing and decreasing the volume. They will be instructed to use the device only when sitting at home, and that the device should not be turned on when walking or performing any mobility related or daily tasks.
On Days 8-15, participants in Group A will be allocated to the 'intervention' phase. Each participant will be given an iPod containing an auditory cue in the form of a continuous metronome beat, individualised to the patient's walking frequency (less 10%).Participants will be instructed to listen to the cueing when they are performing any mobility related tasks. On Days 15-23, participants in Group A will be allocated to the 'control' phase. During this time period, participants will be provided with the iPod shuffle containing no music or metronome beat.</description>
