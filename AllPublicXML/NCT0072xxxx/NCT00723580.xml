      The study examines and illustrates the utility of utilizing actigraphic measurements to
      assess treatment response.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Actigraphic measurements will be recorded every 30 seconds and will be recorded for an 11 day
      baseline period, followed by a 10 day period of the initial pharmacological interventions.
      The non-invasive nature of watch-like actigraphy devices is particularly attractive for use
      in pediatric populations. Meaningful treatment response measurements are obtained when
      actigraphic data is combined with psychometric and observational repeated measurements.
      Subsequent to the initial data collection the parent consented and the child assented to
      extend the study and continue measurements.

      The case study included baseline and repeated psychological, observational and actigraphic
      measurements that were initiated prior to treatment with risperidone and repeated throughout
      the treatment process with the final data collected in July 2010.

      The Personality Inventory for Children (PIC) is an objective multidimensional measurement of
      affect, behavior, ability and family function. The PIC was administered prior to treatment
      with risperidone and repeated after 22 months of treatment. The PIC serves as both an
      actuarial pre-treatment diagnostic tool as well as a post-treatment repeated measurement
      indicating treatment associated change.

      A primary observer (mother) was trained to report symptom percentages present since previous
      observations utilizing the operationally defined and observer defined items of the systematic
      observation scale throughout the treatment process.

      Actigraphic measurements provide a basis by which to measure sleep and sleep onset latency as
      well as periods of mobility and immobility. When programmed to record activity every thirty
      seconds, thousands of measurements are quickly captured.

      Actigraphic measurements were made utilizing a watch-like actigraphic device with an 11 day
      baseline actigraphic measurement period and continued measurements that included the
      initiation of a Once-Daily, Bedtime (q.h.s.) pharmacological intervention for 6 days,
      followed by a planned adjustment to Twice a Day (b.i.d.) dosing that was measured for an
      additional 4 days. Repeated actigraphic studies were subsequently conducted after 22 months
      of risperidone treatment and were collected along with the repeated observational and
      psychometric data.

      This case study explores activity and sleep characteristics related to behavioral
      characteristics and treatment response and the utility of single subject repeated
      actigraphic, psychometric and observational measurements and monitoring of treatment
      response.

    <description>The Systematic Observation Scale utilizes single-subject repeated measurements. Symptoms and issues of interest are defined and a variety of frequency and sampling methods can be applied. The Systematic Observation Scale was designed so Primary Observers (parents, guardians, self observers or others) can make pre-treatment and subsequent observations to track, document and evaluate symptom variation over the course of an illness. The measurement utilized is the percentage of time the symptom is observed by the primary observer since the previous observation.</description>

    <description>Actigraphic measurements were obtained by attaching an actigraphic watch device to the child's non-dominant wrist. The measurements will include three separate three week periods beginning with a baseline period and the period in which the child's pharmacological treatment was initiated. Two additional three week actigraphic measurement periods will occur at 22 months post-baseline period and at 23 months post-baseline period. The resulting five treatment conditions were: 1. Baseline no medication 2. Risperidone .25 mg at bedtime (q.h.s.) x 7 days 3. Risperidone .25 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) 4. Risperidone .25 mg three times a day (t.i.d.) and 5. Risperidone .5 mg three times a day (t.i.d.). Sleep and activity will be evaluated by treatment conditions.</description>

        <title>Actigraphic Measurement of Treatment Conditions</title>
        <description>The child’s impulsivity and inability to sleep represented a significant symptom and risk factor. Impulsivity and sleep will be actigraphically assessed by treatment conditions.</description>
        <time_frame>May 12- July 14, 2010</time_frame>
        <population>Single subject repeated Actigraphic(at thirty second intervals), observational (every two months) and psychometric (baseline and at 23 months) measurements of a child anticipating pharmacological treatment. Actigraphic measurements (three 21 day periods) over five treatment conditions that included a non-medication baseline and spanned 23 months.</population>

            <title>Actigraphic (Activity Count) Measurement of Sleep and Activity</title>
            <description>Actigraphic measurements obtained by attaching an actigraphic watch device to the child's non-dominant wrist obtain measurements that occur every thirty seconds for a duration of approximately 21 days. These measurements reflect treatment condition sleep characteristics where sleep is indicated by activity counts below 40. Three 21 day actigraphic measurement periods occurred with the initial measurement occurring through baseline period and the period in which the child's pharmacological treatment was initiated. The second and third, 21 day periods of Actigraphic measurement occurred at 22 and 23 months from baseline. Five treatment conditions during the measurement periods including 1. baseline no medication 2. risperidone .25 mg at bedtime for 7 days (q.h.s.) 3. risperidone twice daily (b.i.d.) 4. risperidone .25 mg three times a day (t.i.d.) and 5. risperidone .50 mg three times a day (t.i.d.)</description>

        <title>Systematic Observation Scale Item: Percentage of Impulsivity Observed</title>
        <description>The Systematic Observation Scale utilizes single-subject repeated measurements. Symptoms and issues of interest are defined and a variety of frequency and sampling methods can be applied. The Systematic Observation Scale was designed so Primary Observers (parents, guardians, self observers or others) can make pre-treatment and subsequent observations to track, document and evaluate symptom variation over the course of an illness. The measurement utilized is the percentage of time the symptom is observed by the primary observer since the previous observation.</description>

        <title>The Personality Inventory for Children: Adjustment Scale</title>
        <description>This scale measures general personality adjustment reflecting a dimension associated with highly adaptive to maladaptive adjustment. The Personality Inventory for Children (PIC) is an age and gender referenced objective multidimensional measurement of affect, behavior, ability and family function. The PIC was administered prior to treatment with risperidone and repeated after 22 months of treatment. The PIC serves as both an actuarial pre-treatment diagnostic tool as well as a post-treatment repeated measurement indicating treatment and developmentally associated change.</description>
