  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Electroencephalography (EEG)-neurofeedback has been shown to offer therapeutic benefits to
      patients with ADHD in several mostly uncontrolled studies with relatively small sample sizes.
      It is unknown how EEG-neurofeedback affects brain functioning and exerts therapeutic effects
      in ADHD. This study is designed to examine the efficacy and safety of EEG-neurofeedback in a
      scientific rigorously way and to study the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of
      EEG-neurofeedback.

      Objectives:

        1. To investigate the efficacy of EEG-neurofeedback in reducing behavioral symptoms of
           ADHD.

        2. To investigate whether EEG-neurofeedback is able to improve neurocognitive functioning.

        3. To investigate whether EEG-neurofeedback is able to improve neural functioning.

      Study design:

      Double-blind randomized placebo-controlled treatment study.Study population: 120 subjects
      with ADHD (age 8-15, IQ of 80 or more). Intervention: 60 subjects with ADHD receive 30
      sessions EEG-neurofeedback, and 60 subjects with ADHD receive placebo EEG-neurofeedback.

      Main study parameter: ADHD-DSM-IV rating scale, rated by the investigator.

      Hypothesis:

      The hypothesis is EEG-Neurofeedback can reduce symptoms of ADHD.

    <description>The placebo EEG-neurofeedback group will get an identical procedure as the real EEG-Neurofeedback, but with feedback on a EEG signal simulation. The placebo group will not be rewarded on their real-time EEG but on a random, simulated EEG; known to be effective for this purpose (Utrecht University, study in progress).
In the protocol selection the electrode position and rewarding versus inhibition of the treatment frequency band or bands will be individually created. The first 30 seconds of the treatment will start on a predetermined fixed threshold value for all treatment subjects.</description>

    <description>The EEG-neurofeedback group will receive feedback on their real-time EEG-signal (brain activity). The treatment group will be rewarded, by brightening (i.e. not being blackened of) the feedback screen. Rewards will be given to the subjects when their digitally filtered frequency EEG activity meets the criteria in the 'percentage time over threshold' parameter. The 'percentage time over threshold' parameter will be auto-adjusted on the digitally filtered real-time EEG every 30 seconds, and the percentage parameter will be kept as a constant over all participants during the entire study (i.e. not adjusted during treatment based on individual capabilities).</description>
