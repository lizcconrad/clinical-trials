  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      IPI-493 is a potent inhibitor of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) and is orally bioavailable via
      a novel formulation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hsp90 controls the proper folding, function, and stability of various &quot;client&quot; proteins
      within cells. Many of the clients of Hsp90 (such as Akt, Bcr-Abl, EGFR, Flt-3, c-Kit and
      PDGFR α) are oncoproteins or important cell-signaling proteins, and therefore are critical
      for tumor cell growth and survival. Inhibition of Hsp90 results in degradation of these
      proteins, which abrogates growth and survival signaling and leads to tumor cell death.

          5. Not Pregnant by blood or urine test, and be willing to use adequate methods of birth
             control

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Treatment with the following therapies within the specified time period:

               -  Any chemotherapy (other than nitrosoureas or mitomycin C), radiation therapy
                  (other than whole brain irradiation [WBI]), surgery, hormonal therapy, or
                  investigational therapy within 4 weeks of the start of IPI 493 administration

               -  Any tyrosine kinase inhibitor (e.g., erlotinib, imatinib) within 2 weeks

               -  Whole brain irradiation therapy within 3 months

               -  Stereotactic cranial radiosurgery (SRS) within 4 weeks

               -  Nitrosoureas or mitomycin C within 6 weeks

               -  Any known Hsp90 inhibitor

          2. Toxicities from prior therapies must have resolved to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline

          3. Concurrent administration of the medications or foods , which are known to inhibit or
             induce CYP3A activity to a clinically relevant degree, is not allowed.

          4. Concurrent treatment with any agent known to prolong the QTc interval

          5. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positivity.

          6. Inadequate hematologic function defined by absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt; 1,500
             cells/mm3, a platelet count &lt; 100,000/mm3, and a hemoglobin &lt; 9.0 g/dL

          7. Inadequate hepatic function

          8. Inadequate renal function

          9. Sinus bradycardia

         10. Baseline QTcF &gt; 450 msec in males; QTcF &gt; 470 msec in females.

         11. Presence of left bundle branch block (LBBB), right bundle branch block (RBBB) if
             accompanied by left anterior hemiblock, bifascicular block or 3rd degree heart block.
             This does not include patients with a history of these events with adequate control by
             pacemaker.

         12. Patients who have received &gt; 450 mg/m2 of any anthracycline during prior chemotherapy
             must have a baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &gt; 40%.

         13. Active keratitis or keratoconjunctivitis.

         16. Patients with a history of stroke, unstable angina, myocardial infarction, or
             ventricular arrhythmia requiring medication or mechanical control within the last 6
             months.

         17. Significant co-morbid condition or disease which in the judgment of the Investigator
             would place the patient at undue risk or interfere with the study. Examples include,
             but are not limited to cirrhotic liver disease, sepsis, and other conditions.

         18. Women who are pregnant or lactating.

             vein thrombosis) requiring anticoagulation and meet any of the following criteria are
             excluded:
