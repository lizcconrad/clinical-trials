      RATIONALE: Sorafenib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Estrogen can cause the growth
      of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using fulvestrant may fight breast cancer by blocking
      the use of estrogen by the tumor cells. Giving sorafenib together with fulvestrant may kill
      more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving sorafenib together with fulvestrant
      works in treating patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer that did not
      respond to aromatase inhibitor therapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To investigate the clinical activity of sorafenib tosylate and fulvestrant, as
           determined by a 4-month progression-free survival rate, in patients with hormone
           receptor-positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer that progressed after
           prior treatment with an aromatase inhibitor.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the objective response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To determine the median time to progression in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To determine the progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To establish the safety and tolerability profile of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily on days 1-28. Patients also
      receive fulvestrant intramuscularly on days 1 and 15 of course 1 and on day 1 of all
      subsequent courses. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 28-56 days.

    <description>Progression-free survival rate is defined as the proportion of subjects who are progression free (CR, PR and SD) at 4 months after initiating treatment with sorafenib plus fulvestrant. Complete Response (CR):Disappearance of all target (both measurable and evaluable)lesions. Partial Response (PR):At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of both measurable and evaluable target lesions. Stable Disease (SD):Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease(PD).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Progression-free Survival at 4 Months</title>
        <description>Progression-free survival rate is defined as the proportion of subjects who are progression free (CR, PR and SD) at 4 months after initiating treatment with sorafenib plus fulvestrant. Complete Response (CR):Disappearance of all target (both measurable and evaluable)lesions. Partial Response (PR):At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of both measurable and evaluable target lesions. Stable Disease (SD):Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease(PD).</description>

Sorafenib: 800 mg/day administered as 400 mg bid (twice daily) each morning and evening approximately 12 hours apart. Treatment will begin on Day 1 of the study and continue daily until tumor progression or until an unacceptable toxicity occurs which would require delay, modification or discontinuation of study therapy.</description>
