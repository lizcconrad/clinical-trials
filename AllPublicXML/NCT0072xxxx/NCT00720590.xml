  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV protease inhibitors (PIs) are a class of antiretroviral drugs used to inhibit viral
      replication. They do so by interfering with a key step in the replication process. Some HIV
      PIs have been associated with an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular side effects.
      Further study is needed, however, to assess the full extent of effect of newer HIV PIs,
      including atazanavir and lopinavir/ritonavir, on cardiovascular disease risk. This study will
      compare the effects of atazanavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and placebo on certain cardiovascular
      disease risk factors in healthy people without HIV.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Antiretroviral therapy for HIV, particularly with the use of PIs, is associated with an
      increased risk of heart attack. Specific cardiovascular side effects seen with the use of
      some PIs include insulin resistance, abnormal blood lipid levels, and endothelial dysfunction
      (abnormalities in the cells that line the inner surface of blood vessels). Past studies have
      shown that treatment with indinavir, an older PI, results in significant endothelial
      dysfunction, which may be the main cause for the increase in cardiovascular risk. Indinavir
      is now seldom used in clinical practice, and the newer PIs atazanavir and combination
      lopinavir/ritonavir now account for nearly 70% of total PI use in the United States. It is
      not known what effect these new PIs have on endothelial dysfunction. This study will compare
      the effects of atazanavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and placebo on certain cardiovascular disease
      risk factors, including abnormal glucose metabolism and endothelial dysfunction, in healthy
      people without HIV.

      Participation in this study will last 4 weeks. All participants will undergo initial
      assessments that will include various vascular and metabolic evaluations. Body weight,
      height, basal heart rate, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure will also be measured.
      Participants will then be assigned randomly to receive 4 weeks of treatment with 400 mg of
      atazanavir per day plus placebo, 400 mg/100 mg of lopinavir/ritonavir twice per day plus
      placebo, or placebos for both drugs per day. Upon completing the 4 weeks of treatment,
      participants will repeat the initial assessments.
