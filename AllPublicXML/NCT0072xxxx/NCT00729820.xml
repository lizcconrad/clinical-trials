  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, a lot of evidence for a relation between measures of cognitive performance and
      personality characteristics has been collected. The use of computer based latency measures is
      often used to study mental processes in cognitive, as well as, in personality research On the
      basis of these relationships we can ask a question that relates to the practical usefulness
      (validity) of processing speed, accuracy of performance and personality measures in
      predicting impulsive behavior.
