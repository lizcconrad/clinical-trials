    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to calibrate the STISIM driving simulator under influence of three
      different dosages of ethanol (0.05%, 0.08% and 0.11% BAC). The levels of performance
      decrement for the three blood alcohol concentrations will serve as a standard for comparing
      the effects that will be observed with psychoactive drugs in future trials. This will make
      the results of these future studies more easily to interpret and will provide health care
      providers and policy makers who read our scientific work with an easy-to-understand and
      clinically relevant comparison.
