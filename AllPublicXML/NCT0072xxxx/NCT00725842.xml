    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the relapse rate in the French patient population
      with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) previously treated with PegInterferon Alfa-2b (Peg-IFN
      alfa-2b) plus Ribavirin according to standard clinical practice. Treatment was to be
      completed prior to the enrollment in the current study. The study will also aim to identify
      factors that are predictive of relapse. Relapse rate is defined as the percentage of patients
      with negative viral load at end of treatment who again have positive viral load at 6 months
      after the end of treatment.

      Non-probability sampling: The study population consists of adult patients over the age of 18
      affected by CHC who were previously treated for the first time with Peg-IFN alfa-2b plus
      ribavirin and achieved end-of-treatment response. Five hundred ninety patients must be
      recruited in order to evaluate the objectives of the study. The patients must meet all
      inclusion criteria and not meet any of the exclusion criteria in order to be included in the
      study.

    <description>Negative HCV-RNA at Week 4 of treatment with Peg-IFN alfa-2b + ribavirin was considered RVR; negative HCV-RNA at Week 12 of treatment with Peg-IFN alfa-2b + ribavirin was considered EVR; negative HCV-RNA between Week 12 and the end of treatment with Peg-IFN alfa-2b + ribavirin was considered a slow response. For participants who achieved RVR, EVR, or slow response, the relapse rate at 24 Weeks post EOT was to be determined on this observational study; relapse was defined as positive HCV-RNA.</description>

          <description>Negative HCV-RNA at Week 4 of treatment with Peg-IFN alfa-2b + ribavirin was considered RVR; negative HCV-RNA at Week 12 of treatment with Peg-IFN alfa-2b + ribavirin was considered EVR; negative HCV-RNA between Week 12 and the end of treatment with Peg-IFN alfa-2b + ribavirin was considered a slow response. For participants who achieved RVR, EVR, or slow response, the relapse rate at 24 Weeks post EOT was to be determined on this observational study; relapse was defined as positive HCV-RNA.</description>
