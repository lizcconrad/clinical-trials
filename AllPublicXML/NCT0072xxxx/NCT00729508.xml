  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cat allergy is an increasingly prevalent condition, affecting 10-15% of patients with
      allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and/or asthma. Cat-PAD is a novel, synthetic, allergen-derived
      peptide desensitising vaccine, currently being developed for the treatment of cat allergy.
      This study will investigate the efficacy of 4 treatment regimens of Cat-PAD in cat allergic
      subjects following challenge to cat allergen in an environmental exposure chamber (EEC).

    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study
      of 4 treatment regimens in up to 120 cat allergic subjects. A total of 24 subjects will be
      randomised into each treatment group. Each subject will undergo screening up to 4 weeks
      before treatment. Baseline challenge will consist of exposure to cat allergen for 3 hours in
      an EEC on 4 visits on successive days a week before the first administration of Cat-PAD or
      placebo. Treatment will be administered as intradermal injections into the flexor surface of
      alternate forearms. There are 5 treatment regimens involving administration of Cat-PAD or
      placebo. Post-treatment challenge (PTC) will consist of exposure to cat allergen for 3 hours
      in an EEC on 4 visits on successive days 18 weeks after the first administration of study
      medication.

          -  Subjects who cannot tolerate baseline challenge in the EEC.

          -  Allergen immunotherapy during the last 12 months or any history of Cat Dander
             immunotherapy.

             acute or chronic symptomatic coronary heart disease or severe hypertension).

          -  Subjects being treated with beta-blockers.

          -  History of immunopathological diseases.

          -  Positive test for Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C or HIV at screening.
