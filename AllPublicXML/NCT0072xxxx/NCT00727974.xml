      The purpose of this study is to determine if there are genetic variations that can explain a
      genetic basis for cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS), various phenotypes of CVS (e.g. menstrual,
      Sato, calendar-tied) and migraine headaches (e.g. with aura, without aura, hemiplegic
      migraine). This information will allow physicians to improve care for patients who have been
      diagnosed with this disease and to provide their parents with more complete information
      regarding the cause of this disease. This research is being done because many unanswered
      questions remain regarding children with CVS.

    <description>Diagnostic Criteria for CVS:
3 or more different episodes of vomiting, normal health between episodes, no abnormal test results to account for vomiting [such as endoscopic biopsies (looking at a body part with a lighted tube), hydronephrosis (water block kidney drainage), cholelithiasis (gallstones), pancreatitis (swelling of the pancreas), and hypoglycemia (too little sugar in the blood)];</description>

    <description>Diagnostic Criteria for Migraine:
5 or more different headaches, complete return to health in between headaches, headaches last 2-48 hours and get in the way everyday activity, headache affects one side of head, with pounding moderate-to-severe pain, one of the following: nausea, vomiting, photophobia (fear of light), phonophobia (fear of sound).</description>

        Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) may be the most severe recurrent vomiting disorder in
        humans. CVS is characterized by a sudden onset of rapid-fire vomiting, usually beginning in
        the early morning hours or upon wakening. It has a peak vomiting intensity of every 5-10
        minutes (6-12 emeses) and episodes last between 2 hours and 10 days. These episodes of
        acute vomiting occur on average once every 2 to 4 weeks. The child returns to completely
        normal health between vomiting episodes. Children are diagnosed based on their specific
        vomiting pattern and a lack of positive findings on laboratory testing.
