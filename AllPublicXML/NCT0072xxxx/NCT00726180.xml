  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The majority pf breast cancers present as ER-positive, many of which are able to be targeted
      with multiple hormonal therapies. Altering ER-negative tumors to increase ER expression has
      the potential to benefit patients by making hormonal therapies a therapeutic option and
      possibly improving their overall prognosis.

    <description>About 1 week (4 - 7 days) before scheduled breast surgery, consisting of lumpectomy or mastectomy, subjects will receive a dose of trastuzumab (Herceptin®). Trastuzumab will be given through an IV or port for approximately 90 minutes. During this time, subjects will be closely monitored by a chemotherapy nurse to make sure that subjects do not have a reaction to the medication. It is possible that the infusion of the medication will need to be slowed down, in which case, the time for the infusion will be longer than 90 minutes. The one dose of the trastuzumab drug will be provided by the study (not billed to insurance), but the charges to administer the drug will be billed to subjects or subjects health insurance.</description>

          -  Participants must have had either a core biopsy or incisional biopsy of their breast
             cancer, but not yet had definitive breast surgery, including lumpectomy or mastectomy.

          -  Participants may not have had a BRCA mutation found on genetic testing.

          -  Participants should have not yet received treatment for their breast cancer,
             including:

               -  chemotherapy,

               -  hormonal therapy,
