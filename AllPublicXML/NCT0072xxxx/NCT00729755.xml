  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given 1) the established safety with short-term or long-term supplementation of Cr, 2) its
      potential usefulness in improving brain energy metabolism, 3) the reported abnormality in
      brain energy metabolism in MDD subjects, and 4) plausible association between depression and
      inflammatory mediators, we hypothesize that oral Cr augmentation will help reduce symptoms in
      MDD patients as well as normalize a deficit in brain energy metabolism and that improvement
      of MDD and brain energy metabolism will be correlated with inflammatory mediators changes.

      In this study, we plan to conduct an randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      augmentation study with creatine in addition to escitalopram. We will assess the efficacy and
      safety of the Cr augmentation and evaluate changes relevant to brain energy metabolism and
      inflammatory mediators.
