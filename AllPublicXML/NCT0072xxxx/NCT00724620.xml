  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of peginterferon alfa-2b plus
      weight-based ribavirin as initial treatment in chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1
      patients. All patients will receive peginterferon alfa-2b plus oral ribavirin for 12 weeks.
      At the end of this period, quantitative PCR will be used to determine the Early Viral
      Response (EVR) at this point of treatment. Total treatment duration will be 48 weeks for
      Early Responders, 72 weeks for Slow Responders, and 12 weeks for Nonresponders.
