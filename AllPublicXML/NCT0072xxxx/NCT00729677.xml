      RATIONALE: Learning how often patients experience nausea and vomiting after receiving
      anti-vomiting medicine and chemotherapy for colorectal cancer may help doctors plan better
      treatment and improve patients' quality of life.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying delayed nausea and vomiting in patients with
      colorectal cancer receiving standard anti-vomiting medicine during the first course of
      chemotherapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To assess the prevalence of delayed nausea and vomiting in patients with colorectal
           cancer receiving standard anti-emetic medications during the first course of an
           oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy regimen (mFOLFOX6 or FOLFOX7).

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo collection of demographic, diagnostic, and treatment data at baseline.
      Patients complete the Functional Living Index-Emesis (FLIE) questionnaire at baseline prior
      to first chemotherapy infusion and at 5-7 days. Patients also fill out daily patient diaries
      about symptoms of nausea and vomiting, and use of medications to prevent these symptoms over
      days 1-5.
