      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of the Cormet Hip
      Resurfacing implant system in the post-approval environment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study tracks the performance of the Cormet Hip Resurfacing system in the post-approval
      environment to see if there are significant changes in device performance from the pre-market
      IDE setting as compared to the post-approval setting. Specifically this study will compare
      the proportion of subjects achieving a Month 24 composite clinical success (CCS) criterion
      and 24 month cumulative revision rate among the newly enrolled post-approval study subjects
      to the IDE subjects' performance on CCS as reported in the Pre-Market Application (PMA).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female patient who meets eligibility criteria consistent with product labeling

          -  skeletally mature

          -  mentally capable of completing follow-up forms

          -  Will be available for follow-up out to 2 years and annually thereafter until the last
             patient reaches the two-year evaluation

          -  Has been deemed a candidate for hip replacement by diagnosis of the investigator

          -  consented to participate in the clinical study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient with active or suspected infection in or around the hip joint;

          -  Patient with bone stock inadequate to support the device

          -  Patient with severe osteopenia

          -  Patient with a family history of severe osteoporosis or severe osteopenia;

          -  Patient with osteonecrosis or avascular necrosis (AVN) with &gt;50% involvement of the
             femoral head (regardless of FICAT Grade)

          -  Patient with multiple cysts of the femoral head (&gt;1cm)

          -  In cases of questionable bone stock, a DEXA scan may be necessary to assess inadequate
             bone stock.

          -  Patient with any vascular insufficiency, muscular atrophy, or neuromuscular disease
             severe enough to compromise implant stability or postoperative recovery;

          -  Female of child-bearing age due to unknown effects on the fetus of metal ion release.

          -  Patient with known moderate or severe renal insufficiency;

          -  Patient who is immunosuppressed with diseases such as AIDS or person receiving high
             doses of corticosteroids;
