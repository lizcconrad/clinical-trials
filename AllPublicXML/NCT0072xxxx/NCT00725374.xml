      The primary purpose of this study is to compare changes in the expression of the
      proliferation marker Ki-67 in malignant breast tissue after treatment with tibolone or
      placebo in postmenopausal women who need to undergo surgery for primary breast cancer

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary objective of this trial was to compare changes in the expression of the proliferation marker Ki-67 in malignant breast tissue after treatment with tibolone or placebo.</measure>
    <time_frame>The primary outcome measure, the proliferation marker Ki-67, was measured at screening (from the screening biopsy) and about 14 days later (from the surgically removed breast tumour tissue)</time_frame>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Apoptosis index; estrogen/progesterone/androgen receptors &amp; isoforms; bcl-2, bax; pS2; SOX4; Apolipoprotein D; Angiogenesis parameters; estrogen levels, tibolone and tibolone metabolites.</measure>
    <time_frame>Outcome parameters were measured during the trial as samples were received and at the end of the clinical phase.</time_frame>
