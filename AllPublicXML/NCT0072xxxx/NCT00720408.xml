          -  Patient must receive first dose of XL or Prograf (or IV tacrolimus for subjects unable
             to tolerate oral study drug) within 48 hours of transplantation

          -  Female patients of child bearing potential must have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy test within 7 days prior to transplant

          -  Patient has received an ABO incompatible donor liver

          -  Patient has a current malignancy or a history of malignancy (within the past 5 years),

          -  Patient has an uncontrolled concomitant infection, a systemic infection requiring
             treatment (except viral hepatitis), or any other unstable medical condition that could
             interfere with the study objectives

          -  Patient has severe diarrhea, vomiting, active peptic ulcer or gastrointestinal
             disorder that may affect the absorption of tacrolimus

          -  Patient is currently taking or has been taking an investigational drug in the 30 days
             prior to transplant

          -  Patient has a known hypersensitivity to tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil or
