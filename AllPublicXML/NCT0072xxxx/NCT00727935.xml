    <textblock>
      Lateral episiotomy is a current care practiced with childbirth room. One of the problems
      encountered with this surgical act is the residual pain on perineal scar level. Maximal
      during the first 24 hours, this pain can persist several days or several weeks hampering to
      variable degrees a normal recovery of autonomy and comfort of life. Some studies have shown
      the interest of ropivacaine, local anaesthetic with a long action's duration for proctologic
      surgeries and for the cure of inguinal hernia. A recent study shown the ropivacaine perineal
      infiltration used prior perineorrhaphy allows an absence of post-partum pain for 24 to 27% of
      cases and a first analgesics request delayed to ten hours.

      Methodology: 165 parturients having an epidural analgesia and an episiotomy were enrolled.
      The perineal infiltration was randomized according to 3 equal groups (placebo, ropivacaine
      0,75%, lidocaine 1%) and realised prior perineorrhaphy. then The parturient were followed
      during the 24 first hours. This study was designed as double blind and the study conduct was
      standardized in order to get only variable such as the episiotomy infiltration.
