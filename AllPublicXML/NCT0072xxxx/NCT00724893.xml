  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment compliance is a key success factor in obtaining the full benefit of Pegetron
      (peginterferon alfa-2b [PegIFN-2b] plus ribavirin combination) therapy for patients.
      Treatment-naïve patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) in Canada to whom Pegetron Redipen
      was prescribed will receive Pegetron Redipen therapy in accordance with approved labeling.
      The study will assess the effect of the newly approved Pegetron Redipen on treatment
      compliance and its effect on sustained virologic response rates. Sustained virologic response
      is defined as negative hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV-RNA) six months
      post-treatment.

    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>RVR was defined as undetectable HCV-RNA after 4 weeks of treatment (window of 2 to 6 weeks). Participants with no viral response information were considered viral response &quot;no&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Compliance for Participants Achieving SVR Based on Medication Adherence Questionnaire (MAQ) (Stage 2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 72 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Compliance was defined as participants taking ≥80% versus &lt;80% of their doses; compliance ≥80% was derived from participants who answered &quot;always&quot; or &quot;most of the time&quot; to Questions 4 (How often do you stick to your medication schedule for your Ribavirin?) and 5 (How often do you stick to your medication schedule for your Redipen [peginterferon] injections?) of the 6-question compliance questionnaire. Percentages are based on the total number of participants within each compliance category. SVR was defined as HCV-RNA negative at 24 weeks after EOT. Participants with no viral response information were considered viral response &quot;no&quot;.</description>

Participants with no viral response information were considered viral response “no”. For this analysis participants were grouped by their HCV genotype (Types 1-6); a genotype is a classification based on the differences in the genetic material within the hepatitis virus. Knowing the HCV genotype helps with deciding what type and what duration of treatment will be needed because each genotype demonstrates a different response to treatment in infected individuals.</description>

        <description>SVR was defined as HCV-RNA negative at ≥22 weeks after EOT. Participants with no viral response information were considered viral response “no”. Liver fibrosis stage was measured with the METAVIR scoring system (F0=no fibrosis or liver damage, F1 = beginning of liver damage with some slight scarring, F2 = moderate liver damage, scarring advancing in liver and surrounding blood vessels, F3 =significant liver damage, the liver becomes fibrotic [scarred] and connects with other scarred areas, and F4 = severe damage [cirrhosis] and liver no longer functions properly). For this analysis participants were grouped by their HCV genotype (Types 1-6); a genotype is a classification based on the differences in the genetic material within the hepatitis virus. Knowing the HCV genotype helps with deciding what type and what duration of treatment will be needed because each genotype demonstrates a different response to treatment in infected individuals.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Achieving SVR by Chronic HCV Genotype + Viral Load (Stage 1)</title>
        <description>SVR was defined as HCV-RNA negative at ≥22 weeks after EOT. Participants with no viral response information were considered viral response “no”. Viral load categories were defined as High (≥100,000 Iu/mL) or Low (&lt;100,000 Iu/mL). For this analysis participants were grouped by their HCV genotype (Types 1-6); a genotype is a classification based on the differences in the genetic material within the hepatitis virus. Knowing the HCV genotype helps with deciding what type and what duration of treatment will be needed because each genotype demonstrates a different response to treatment in infected individuals.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With EOT Response by Chronic HCV Genotype (Stage 1)</title>
        <description>EOT response was defined as HCV-RNA negative after 24 weeks of treatment in participants with HCV-RNA Genotype 2 or 3, and after 48 weeks of treatment in participants with Genotype 1, 4, 5, or 6. If there was no EOT information or if it was marked as “not done” then EOT was set to “no”. For this analysis participants were grouped by their HCV genotype (Types 1-6); a genotype is a classification based on the differences in the genetic material within the hepatitis virus. Knowing the HCV genotype helps with deciding what type and what duration of treatment will be needed because each genotype demonstrates a different response to treatment in infected individuals.</description>

SVR was defined as HCV-RNA negative at 24 weeks after EOT. Participants with no viral response information were considered viral response “no”.</description>

        <description>RVR was defined as undetectable HCV-RNA after four weeks of treatment. SVR was defined as HCV-RNA negative at 24 weeks after EOT. Participants with no viral response information were considered viral response “no”. Liver fibrosis stage was measured with the METAVIR scoring system (F0=no fibrosis or liver damage, F1 = beginning of liver damage with some slight scarring, F2 = moderate liver damage, scarring advancing in liver and surrounding blood vessels, F3 =significant liver damage, the liver becomes fibrotic [scarred] and connects with other scarred areas , and F4 = severe damage [cirrhosis] and liver no longer functions properly).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Achieving EVR by Chronic HCV Genotype 1 Subtype (Stage 2)</title>
        <description>EVR was defined as either HCV-RNA undetectable with a ≥2 log reduction in HCV-RNA from baseline or HCV-RNA undetectable after 12 weeks of treatment.SVR was defined as HCV-RNA negative at 24 weeks after EOT. Participants with no viral response information were considered viral response “no”. For this analysis participants were grouped by their HCV genotype subcategory (1a or 1b); subcategories are the result of a change in the genetic material in the viruses within the genotype.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Compliance for Participants Achieving SVR Based on Medication Adherence Questionnaire (MAQ) (Stage 2)</title>
        <description>Compliance was defined as participants taking ≥80% versus &lt;80% of their doses; compliance ≥80% was derived from participants who answered “always” or “most of the time” to Questions 4 (How often do you stick to your medication schedule for your Ribavirin?) and 5 (How often do you stick to your medication schedule for your Redipen [peginterferon] injections?) of the 6-question compliance questionnaire. Percentages are based on the total number of participants within each compliance category. SVR was defined as HCV-RNA negative at 24 weeks after EOT. Participants with no viral response information were considered viral response “no”.</description>
