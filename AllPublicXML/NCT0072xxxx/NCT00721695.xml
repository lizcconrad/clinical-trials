      This is an exploratory study to determine the safety and clinical benefit of OMS302 Injection
      in subjects undergoing Cataract Extraction with Lens Replacement (CELR) using a coaxial
      phacoemulsification process.

    <textblock>
      OMS302 Injection is a mydriatic/anti-inflammatory combination investigational drug product
      being developed as an irrigation solution during intracameral lens replacement surgical
      procedures of the eye. OMS302 irrigation solution may induce and maintain an adequately
      dilated pupil and reduce postoperative symptoms of discomfort such as eye pain and
      irritation. The use of OMS302 irrigation solution may eliminate the need for pre-operative
      dilation of the eye and could reduce the postoperative use of an anti-inflammatory and pain
      medications following surgery.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is 50 years of age or older.

          -  Subject is to undergo unilateral primary CELR for an age-related cataract under
             topical anesthesia and using a clear cornea incision.

          -  Subject's history and physical examination are within normal limits or the examination
             is clinically non-significant for purposes of the study as determined by the
             Investigator, and subject is in good general health.

          -  Subject has best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/400 or better in the non-study
             eye.

          -  Subject has intraocular pressure (IOP) between 5 mmHg and 22 mmHg, inclusive, in the
             study eye.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is allergic to any of the individual ingredients in OMS302

          -  Subject who is taking medications with the same activities as that of the active
             ingredients in OMS302 for defined time intervals prior to and after surgery.

          -  Subject with pseudo-capsular exfoliation, or evidence of prior iritis or of ocular
             trauma with iris damage, or who has used pilocarpine within six months of screening.

          -  Subject that has uncontrolled chronic ocular disease.

          -  Subject that has active corneal pathology or scarring noted in either eye (except

          -  Subject that has narrow-angle glaucoma, unstable glaucoma, or glaucoma being treated
             with prostaglandins or prostaglandin analogues.

          -  Subject taking, or has taken within the past year, an alpha adrenergic antagonist.

          -  Subject that has participated in or is currently participating in any investigational
             drug or device trial within the previous 30 days prior to the day of surgery.

          -  Subject that has had intraocular conventional surgery within the past three months or
             intraocular laser surgery within one month of the planned surgery in the study eye.

          -  Subject that requires the use of other topical medications during the trial except
             prophylactic antibiotics, topical lid care or glaucoma medications or tear replacement
