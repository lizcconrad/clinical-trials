      BACKGROUND: Pre-eclampsia complicates about 2% of pregnancies. It accounts for at least 50
      000 maternal deaths per year worldwide and is the second most common cause of maternal death
      in the developing world. Also, Pre-eclampsia is the commonest cause of iatrogenic
      prematurity, It frequently coexists with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and placental
      abruption, other important causes of adverse prenatal outcome.

      There have been many studies investigating whether the disease can be prevented. In order to
      achieve this, one needs to be able to identify firstly those women that are at highest risk
      of the disease.

      Early studies showed that impedance to flow in the uterine arteries decreases with gestation
      in normal pregnancies, while in pregnancies with established pre-eclampsia or IUGR the
      impedance is increased.

      These observations led to a number of screening studies in the second trimester, which
      assessed if it is possible to predict those pregnancies destined to have complications of
      impaired placentation. These studies showed that women with increased impedance to uterine
      artery blood flow have an increased risk of developing pre-eclampsia, and detection can be
      further increased by using angiogenic factors (That are involved in the pathogenesis of Pre-
      eclampsia and could be useful for early prediction of the disease: VEGF, PIGF, PP13, sFLT1)
      in combination with uterine arteries Doppler study in the second trimester.

      METHODS: In this study we would like to add uterine arteries Doppler to the early routine
      detailed ultrasound examination (14-16 weeks), in 3000 women in Jerusalem. in addition we
      would like to check angiogenic factors from the serum blood taken for the routine triple test
      in these women (16-18 weeks).pregnancy outcome would be collected after labour from the
      medical centers participating in this research.
