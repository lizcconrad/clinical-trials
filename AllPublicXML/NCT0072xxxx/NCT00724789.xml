    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to collect data on the incidence of congenital
      malformations in infants of women with an ongoing pregnancy after controlled ovarian
      stimulation with recombinant follicle stimulating hormone /ganirelix followed by in vitro
      fertilization (IVF) or intra cytoplasmatic sperm injection (ICSI), and to compare this
      incidence with that of a group of women who used a long protocol with a gonadotropin
      releasing hormone agonist as historical controls.
