      This protocol describes a prospective, randomized, open-label, multicenter study to evaluate
      the safety and efficacy of switching from fixed dose abacavir (ABC)/lamivudine (3TC) to fixed
      dose emtricitabine (FTC)/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) in virologically suppressed,
      human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infected subjects maintained on a
      ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (PI/r)-containing antiretroviral (ARV) regimen. Duration
      of treatment is 48 weeks.

      This protocol describes a prospective, randomized, open-label, multicenter study to evaluate
      the safety and efficacy of switching from fixed dose ABC/3TC to fixed dose FTC/TDF in
      virologically suppressed, HIV-1 infected subjects maintained on a PI/r-containing ARV
      regimen.

      Subjects were stratified based on the PI/r (ie, lopinavir/ritonavir [LPV/r] versus other
      boosted PIs) in their regimen, and the presence versus absence of comorbidities at screening
      (diabetes mellitus or cardiovascular disease such as hypertension, coronary artery disease,
      hyperlipidemia, history of myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, valvular heart disease,
      congenital heart disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, or arrhythmias). Subjects were
      randomized 1:1 to switch to FTC/TDF+PI/r or to continue on their existing regimen.

      Subjects received study treatment for 48 weeks.

    <description>The percentage of participants with HIV-1 RNA &lt; 200 copies/mL based on TLOVR algorithm at Week 48 was summarized. Participants were considered nonresponders in the TLOVR analysis if they experienced virologic rebound prior to or at Week 48, discontinued study before Week 48, or added a new antiretroviral (ARV) agent prior to completion of the study. Virologic rebound was defined as 2 consecutive HIV-1 RNA values &gt;= 200 copies/mL or the last HIV-1 RNA value &gt;= 200 copies/mL followed by discontinuation from the study.</description>

    <description>The percentage of participants with PVR for HIV-1 RNA cutoff at 200 copies/mL at Week 48 was summarized.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants were enrolled at a total of 76 study sites; 70 in the US, 3 in Canada, and 3 in Puerto Rico.

      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 393 subjects were screened for entry into this study, and 312 subjects were randomized (156 to each treatment group). One participant randomized to the TVD+PI/r group was never treated.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With HIV-1 Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) &lt; 200 Copies/mL Through Week 48 Based on Time to Loss of Virologic Response (TLOVR) Algorithm</title>
        <description>The percentage of participants with HIV-1 RNA &lt; 200 copies/mL based on TLOVR algorithm at Week 48 was summarized. Participants were considered nonresponders in the TLOVR analysis if they experienced virologic rebound prior to or at Week 48, discontinued study before Week 48, or added a new antiretroviral (ARV) agent prior to completion of the study. Virologic rebound was defined as 2 consecutive HIV-1 RNA values &gt;= 200 copies/mL or the last HIV-1 RNA value &gt;= 200 copies/mL followed by discontinuation from the study.</description>

With 170 subjects in each group, the lower limit of observed one-sided 97.5% confidence interval was expected to be greater than −0.120 with 80% power when the proportion of responders in both treatment groups is 0.820 (82%) at Week 48.
312 subjects were enrolled, representing 8% less than planned (n = 340). As a result, power to claim non-inferiority decreased to 78%.</non_inferiority_desc>
