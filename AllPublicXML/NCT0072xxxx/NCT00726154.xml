      The objective of this pilot study is to test the feasibility of a larger planned trial. The
      objective of this larger trial will be to determine the extent to which aspects of circadian
      rhythmicity, including, sleep/wake rhythms, daily social routines (i.e., social rhythms),
      circadian type (morningness/eveningness), endogenous circadian rhythms and polymorphisms
      associated with altered circadian function in specific genes (namely, CLOCK, Period 2 and
      Period 3) moderate treatment response in bipolar disorder.

      This study is a small scale pilot study which will be used to support a larger trial. The
      major aims of the larger study are to determine the extent to which aspects of circadian
      rhythmicity, including, sleep/wake rhythms, daily social routines (i.e., social rhythms),
      circadian type (morningness/eveningness), endogenous circadian rhythms and polymorphisms
      associated with altered circadian function in specific genes (namely, CLOCK, Period 2 and
      Period 3) moderate treatment response in bipolar disorder.

      The overarching aim of the study is to clarify the nature of rhythm abnormalities in bipolar
      disorder and, especially, their relation to clinical state. We propose to do this in the
      context of a randomized intervention protocol in which half of the subjects will receive a
      treatment aimed at rhythm regularization. We expect to study individuals with a range of
      circadian and sleep-wake abnormalities, social rhythm disturbances, and circadian type and to
      examine the extent to which these parameters predict subjects' clinical outcomes. Since one
      half of the subjects will receive IPSRT as part of their treatment regimen (with increasing
      regularity of social routines as a goal of treatment), we will be able to examine the extent
      to which changes in social rhythm regularity and sleep quality are associated with clinical
      and functional improvement and whether these outcomes are mediated by changes in endogenous
      circadian rhythms.

    <description>Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy (IPSRT) focuses specifically on rhythmicity. IPSRT is based on the social zeitgeber hypothesis (Ehlers et al., 1988; 1993) and the conviction that regularity of social routines and stability of interpersonal relationships have a protective effect in recurrent mood disorders. In IPSRT, resolution of depressive symptoms is theorized to come about through the exploration of the links among mood symptoms, stability of social rhythms and quality of social relationships and social role performance, and the identification and management of potential precipitants of rhythm disruption.</description>

    <description>The collaborative care (CC) condition is a less intensive psychosocial intervention that was employed as the control condition in the STEP-BD study of psychosocial treatment (see Miklowitz et al., 2007). Participants assigned to this condition will receive a psychoeducational videotape and a workbook including information about: 1) the diagnosis, management, and treatment of bipolar illness; 2) the importance of medication adherence; 3) schedule management including daily mood charting; 4) typical biases in thinking relevant to mood states; 5) improving relationships through communication skills; and 6) developing a treatment contract geared toward preventing episodes.</description>
