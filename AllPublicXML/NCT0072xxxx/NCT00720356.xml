      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different
      ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and
      help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the
      growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Erlotinib may stop the growth of
      tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving bevacizumab
      together with erlotinib may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving bevacizumab together with erlotinib
      works after radiation therapy and temozolomide in treating patients with newly diagnosed
      glioblastoma multiforme or gliosarcoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the overall survival of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma
           multiforme (GBM) with unmethylated MGMT promoter treated with bevacizumab and erlotinib
           hydrochloride after radiotherapy and temozolomide.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the 12- and 24-month progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with newly
           diagnosed GBM with unmethylated MGMT promoter treated with this regimen.

        -  To assess radiographic response rates.

        -  To perform correlative tissue assays.

        -  To collect safety data on the combination of bevacizumab and erlotinib hydrochloride in
           patients with newly diagnosed GBM with unmethylated MGMT promoter treated with
           bevacizumab and erlotinib hydrochloride after radiotherapy and temozolomide.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo radiotherapy (either intensity-modulated radiation therapy or 3-D conformal
      radiotherapy) once daily 5 days a week and receive oral temozolomide concurrently with
      radiotherapy once daily for 6 weeks (as planned). Patients whose tumor has a methylated MGMT
      promoter are removed from study.

      Approximately 4 weeks after completion of radiotherapy and temozolomide, patients receive
      bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15 and oral erlotinib hydrochloride once
      daily on days 1-28. Treatment with bevacizumab and erlotinib hydrochloride repeats every 4
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at approximately 30 days and then
      every 3 months thereafter.
