  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if breast imaging with ultrasound can be improved
      by using 1) a ultrasound attachment with two transducers and 2) a contrast agent. These
      changes might allow smaller blood vessels to be seen than under the way breast ultrasound is
      usually performed.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if performing ultrasound with an attachment made up
      of two transducers (rather than just a single transducer) will provide more information about
      the blood vessels in the breast than the current attachment.

      The study will also examine the question of whether use of an ultrasound contrast agent will
      the scanner to see smaller blood vessels than are detected without the agent.

    <description>An ultrasound contrast agent, Definity, will be administered started through the IV line already in use. The imaging will be performed to map vascular flow.
The breast will be scanned by a double ultrasound transducer system in a holder over the area of the breast to be biopsied. The machine will be set with different settings and the scan repeated, possibly multiple times.</description>
