      RATIONALE: A donor peripheral stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells.
      When the healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may help the
      patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.
      Once the donated stem cells begin working, the patient's immune system may see the remaining
      cancer cells as not belonging in the patient's body and destroy them. Giving an infusion of
      donor T cells may helps stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem
      cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of donor T cells in
      treating patients with high-risk hematologic cancer who are undergoing donor peripheral blood
      stem cell transplant.

      Note: Only Phase I portion of study was performed. Due to slow accrual, study was closed
      before Phase II portion of study.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CD4+/CD25+ cells that can be safely
           administered to patients undergoing HLA-identical sibling donor Peripheral Blood
           Progenitor Cell (PBPC) transplantation.

        -  To determine whether CD4+ and CD25+ cells can be safely administered to patients with
           high-risk hematologic malignancies undergoing HLA-identical sibling donor PBPC
           transplantation.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the incidence of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD),
           chronic GVHD, relapse, and survival after administration of CD4+ and CD25+ regulatory T
           cells in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of CD4+ and CD25+ donor regulatory T cells followed
      by a phase II study. All patients receive myeloablative preparative therapy and GVHD
      prophylaxis as per University of Minnesota protocol UMN-MT2001-02 or UMN-MT2001-10.

        -  First allogeneic peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) infusion: Patients receive
           unmobilized, culture-expanded, CD4- and CD25-positive donor regulatory T cells IV over
           15-60 minutes at the assigned dose on day -2.

        -  Second allogeneic PBPC infusion: Patients undergo matched-sibling donor PBPC
           transplantation IV on day 0.

      Patients undergo blood sample collection prior to commencement of preparative therapy and
      then at day 100, 6 months, and 1 year after PBPC transplantation. Samples are analyzed for
      immune reconstitution by immunophenotyping and functional analyses.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed for up to 1 year.
