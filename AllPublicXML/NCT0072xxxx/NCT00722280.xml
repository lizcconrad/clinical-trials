      Overall Goal

      To establish hand transplantation as a safe and effective reconstructive strategy for the
      treatment of upper extremity amputations.

      Specific Aim

      To reduce the risk of rejection and enable allograft survival while minimizing the
      requirement for long term high dose immunosuppression.

      For this purpose, we propose to utilize the &quot;Pittsburgh Protocol&quot;, which is an
      immunomodulatory strategy that has been implemented in solid organ transplants at UPMC. Early
      results in living related liver and kidney patients have confirmed that this protocol
      provides the means to allow graft survival with minimization of maintenance immunosuppression
      and even allows weaning of some patients from long-term immunosuppression.We hypothesize that
      a similar protocol can enable graft survival in highly immunogenic composite tissue
      allografts like hand transplants while reducing the number,dosing and/or frequency of
      immunosuppressive drugs associated with serious adverse effects.

      Suitable candidates will be identified via patient information brochures and via
      advertisements directed at upper limb amputees. For this purpose, a web-page will be
      constructed for free access by interested individuals. This website will be accessible
      through standard search engines. Interested potential subjects will be instructed to contact
      the investigator for an appointment. At the time of appointment, candidates will be first
      requested to complete a screening consent form (SCF) before undergoing further
      evaluation/medical screening procedures. The SCF includes a written consent to obtain PHI of
      the candidate. When the candidate visits UPMC he will undergo a consultation with the PI who
      will perform a thorough clinical assessment and explain in detail the treatment options,
      risks and benefits of the procedure. Candidates will be requested to complete a screening
      consent at this stage. Appropriate subjects will then undergo further medical screening
      procedures that include a number of examinations and investigations to determine their
      candidacy for hand transplantation. Prospective recipients who are selected based on results
      of screening procedures will be invited to review and sign the full informed consent form
      prior to being wait-listed for the procedure.

      The screening tests include:

      History and physical exam, including height and weight Urine pregnancy test for all female
      subjects of childbearing potential Complete blood count, differential, reticulocyte count,
      platelet count ABO type Liver function tests including SGPT or SGOT, serum bilirubin (total
      and direct), total protein, albumin, alkaline phosphatase and GGT, PT, PTT with INR Serum
      electrolytes and renal function panel to include the following: sodium, potassium, chloride,
      carbon dioxide, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, glucose, creatinine and BUN Urinalysis and
      creatinine clearance test to determine GFR Infectious disease studies: HIV antigen, HTLV I-II
      antibody, antibodies to HIV 1 and 2, hepatitis C virus, syphilis, hepatitis B core antibody,
      and hepatitis B surface antigen titers are required Infectious disease titers: CMV, EBV, HSV,
      toxoplasmosis and VZV (IgG and IgM when indicated) Pulmonary function tests, including DLCO2
      Chest X-ray EKG and MUGA scan or echocardiogram for determination of cardiac ejection
      fraction Sinus X-ray (if clinically indicated) CT scans (CT Angiography)/MRI studies
      (Functional MRI, Skeletal MRIs of hand/hips) as indicated by medical history and physical
      examination Ophthalmologic examination Dental consult Psychiatric evaluation

    <description>This program is the primary site for a novel immune modulation protocol for hand and/or forearm transplantation using donor bone marrow stem cells. This protocol, otherwise called the &quot;Pittsburgh Protocol&quot; has been published and implemented in 8 hand/forearm transplantations. The Pittsburgh hand transplant program is the only center that has experience with the &quot;Pittsburgh Protocol&quot; to reduce the number and dosing of immunosuppressive drugs used to prevent rejection of hand/forearm transplants.</description>

        Donor Selection Criteria

        Brain dead donors who have met the criteria for Determination of Death will be selected by
        the hand transplant team in conjunction with the CORE (Center for Organ Recovery and
        Education), the organ procurement agency (OPO) for Pittsburgh and covers Pennsylvania, New
        York and West Virginia. The mandatory requirements are family consent for limb donation,
        stable donor (does not require excessive vasopressors to maintain blood pressure), age
        between 18 to 55 years, limb matched for size with recipient, same blood type as recipient,
        negative cross-match, and importantly accurately matched for gender, skin tone and race
        (may be relative requirement depending on recipient consent).

        Recipient Selection Criteria

        Recipients will be selected from a population of subjects with upper limb loss. Recipients
        may be male or female and of any race, color or ethnicity.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age (&gt;18 years &lt;60 years): Recipients &lt;18 years of age are excluded due to limitations
             of giving full informed consent and the potentially increased risk of
             lymphoproliferative disorder in a younger population. Once hand transplantation and in
             particular the strategy for minimizing immunosuppression has proven to be efficacious
             and safe, the restrictions with regard to recipient age may be relaxed.

          2. No serious co-existing medical (coronary artery disease, diabetes) or psycho-social
             problems (including alcoholism, drug abuse).

          3. Must be negative for malignancy (for 10 years) or HIV (at transplant).

          4. Negative crossmatch with donor.

          5. Negative pregnancy test in female recipient of child bearing potential and consent to
             use reliable contraception for at least one year following transplantation.

          6. Consent to cell collection, storage, and bone marrow infusion as part of the treatment
             regime.

          7. Amputation may be recent (acute injury) or remote (patient may have undergone
             rehabilitation with prostheses).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Conditions that may impact the immunomodulatory protocol: These include diseases like
             HIV or malignancy that could expose the recipient to an unacceptable risk under
             immunosuppressive treatment. Sensitized recipients with high level of preformed
             antibodies are also at risk.

          2. Conditions that may impact the success of the surgical procedure or increase the risk
             of postoperative complications: These include inherited coagulopathies like
             Hemophilia, Von-Willebrand's disease, Protein C and S deficiency, Thrombocythemias,
             Thallassemias, Sickle Cell disease etc. Mixed connective tissue diseases and collagen
             diseases can result in poor wound healing after surgery,

          3. Conditions that may impact functional outcomes: Lipopolysaccharidoses and amyloidosis
             are few of the conditions that may impact nerve regeneration and impair outcomes.
             Also, rare disorders of bone healing like osteopetrosis may also be causes for
             exclusion.
