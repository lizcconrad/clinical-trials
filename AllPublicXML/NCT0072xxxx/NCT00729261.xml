    <textblock>
      Identifying the optimal time of extubation in a brain injured population should improve
      patient outcome. Brain injured patients usually remain intubated due to concerns of airway
      maintenance. Current practice argues that unconscious patients need to remain intubated to
      protect their airways. More recent data however suggests that delaying extubation in this
      population increases pneumonias and worsens patient outcomes.

      We designed a safety and feasibility study of randomizing brain injured patients into early
      or delayed extubation. The purpose was to gain insight into patient safety concerns and to
      obtain estimates of sample size needed for a larger study.

          2. Adequate gas exchange.

          3. Adequate ventilation.

          4. Respiratory rate to tidal volume ratio &lt;105.

          5. Core body temperature &lt; 38 degrees celsius.

          6. Hemoglobin &gt; 8 grams per deciliter.

          7. No sedative medications for 2 hours.

        Neurological requirements included:

          1. GCS â‰¤ 8.

          2. Intracranial pressure (ICP) &lt; 15 cm of water and a cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) &gt;
             60 mm Hg for patients with intracranial pressure monitors.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Age &lt; 18 years.

          2. Lack of informed consent by the patients' surrogate.

          3. Dependence on mechanical ventilation for at least two weeks prior to enrollment.

             or vasospasm).

          8. Patients intubated for airway preservation due to airway edema (cervical neck injuries
             or surgery) as opposed to airway protection.
