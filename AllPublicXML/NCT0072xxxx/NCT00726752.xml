    <description>CR was defined as the disappearance of all target and nontarget lesions and no appearance of new lesions. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters (SLD) of the targeted lesions. CR and PR had to be documented on 2 occasions separated by at least 4 weeks. SD was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify as PD being demonstrated during the first 8 weeks. PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the SLD of target lesions compared to the smallest SLD since the study treatment started.</description>

PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters (SLD) of the targeted lesions. CR and PR had to be documented on 2 occasions separated by at least 4 weeks. SD was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify as PD being demonstrated during the first 8 weeks.
