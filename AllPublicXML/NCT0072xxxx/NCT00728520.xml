  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The drug that will be used in this study is called Azacitidine. Azacitidine belongs to a
      group of drugs which may restore normal control in cancer cells by affecting the genes and
      proteins in the body. Azacitidine is approved by the FDA for the treatment of Myelodysplastic
      Syndrome (MDS), a pre-leukemic bone marrow disease. The purpose of this study is to find out
      what effect the drug Azacitidine has on Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) in elderly patients.

      Prior to starting treatment individuals being considered for this study will be evaluated to
      determine if they are eligible to participate in the study. There are certain prestudy test
      that are required: physical exam, blood tests, ECG, chest x-ray, bone marrow aspirate and
      biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of AML.

      Treatment regimen consists of Azacitidine IV/SQ on days 1-5 every 28 days. If the Azacitidine
      is given IV it will be given over 15-40 minutes. The treatment will be given for a minimum of
      4 treatment cycles. Blood samples will be taken every week to monitor for side effects of the
      Azacitidine. A bone marrow aspirate will be done every 3-4 months to determine the response
      to the study drug or until the disease progresses. There is also a quality of life
      questionnaire that will be completed at the beginning of the study and every 4 weeks while on
      the study.
