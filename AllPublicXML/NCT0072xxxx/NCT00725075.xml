  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether MK-8435 (Org 25935) is more effective than
      placebo in improving negative symptoms in participants with schizophrenia who are
      concurrently treated with a stable dose of a second generation antipsychotic.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary features of schizophrenia are characterized by positive (irrational thoughts
      and/or behavior) and negative symptoms. Negative symptoms are the gross absence of normal
      behavior and emotions, and usually include a general lack of engagement, social withdrawal,
      and loss of goal-directed behavior.

      Negative symptoms may strongly affect daytime activities and quality of life. The effects of
      currently available antipsychotics on negative symptoms are not satisfactory and leave much
      room for improvement. MK-8435 (Org 25935) is an investigational drug that may help to correct
      the above characteristics of schizophrenia by facilitating the messenger function of an amino
      acid in the brain, called glutamate. Preliminary data suggest that lowered glutamate levels
      in schizophrenia are associated with a failure to activate relevant areas in the forebrain
      and with prominent negative symptoms.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Modified Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS 1-22 Composite Score) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>SANS was a 25-item clinician-rated instrument for assessing the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. SANS 1-22 Composite Score consisted of the SANS 25 scale minus the last 3 questions (attention items). The remaining non-attention items (affective flattening, alogia, avolition-apathy, and anhedonia-asociality) comprised the SANS 1-22 Composite Score. For each item, symptom severity was rated on a 6-point scale, from 0=absent to 5=severe. The SANS 1-22 Composite Score had a total scoring range of 0 to 110. Higher scores indicated more impairment. The SANS 1-22 Composite Score was reported using data from the adjusted site rater. A negative change from baseline indicated an improvement in symptoms.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Modified Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS 1-22 Composite Score) at Week 12</title>
        <description>SANS was a 25-item clinician-rated instrument for assessing the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. SANS 1-22 Composite Score consisted of the SANS 25 scale minus the last 3 questions (attention items). The remaining non-attention items (affective flattening, alogia, avolition-apathy, and anhedonia-asociality) comprised the SANS 1-22 Composite Score. For each item, symptom severity was rated on a 6-point scale, from 0=absent to 5=severe. The SANS 1-22 Composite Score had a total scoring range of 0 to 110. Higher scores indicated more impairment. The SANS 1-22 Composite Score was reported using data from the adjusted site rater. A negative change from baseline indicated an improvement in symptoms.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS) at Week 12</title>
        <description>CDSS was a 9-item clinician-rated instrument used to evaluate depression in participants who have schizophrenia. For each item, symptom severity was rated on a 4-point scale, from 0=absent to 3=severe, with a total scoring range of 0 to 27. Higher scores indicated more impairment. A negative change from baseline indicated an improvement in symptoms.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Perception of Emotions Score at Week 12</title>
        <description>Perception of emotion was measured by computer using the CNS-Vital Signs Neurocognitive Test Battery. The participant identified different emotional states (happy, sad, angry, and calm [neutral]) presented in pictures of faces by choosing the appropriate word for the emotion. The raw score was the sum of correct responses minus errors. The standard scores were normalized from raw scores and presented an age-matched score relative to a normative comparison database. Higher scores were better.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Speed of Complex Information Processing Score at Week 12</title>
        <description>Speed of complex information processing was measured by computer using the CNS-Vital Signs Neurocognitive Test Battery-Symbol-digit Coding Test. The participant linked numbers to digits. The test consisted of serial presentations of screens, each containing a bank of 8 symbols above and 8 empty boxes below. The participant typed the number that corresponded to the symbol highlighted. The raw score was the processing time in milliseconds. The standard scores were normalized from raw scores and presented an age-matched score relative to a normative comparison database. Higher scores were better.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Composite Memory Score at Week 12</title>
          <description>Composite memory was a composite of verbal memory and visual memory and was measured by computer using the CNS-Vital Signs Neurocognitive Test Battery. The raw score was the sum of correct responses. The standard scores were normalized from raw scores and presented an age-matched score relative to a normative comparison database. Higher scores were better.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Extrapyramidal Symptoms Rating Scale Score at Week 12</title>
        <description>The abbreviated Extrapyramidal Symptoms Rating Scale (ESRS-A) was a sum of the severity rating of a 24-item instrument assessing four types of movement disorders: parkinsonism, dystonia, dyskinesia, and akathisia. Each item was rated on a 7-point scale, from 0=absent to 6=severe. Higher scores indicated more impairment. A negative change from baseline indicated an improvement.</description>
