        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject, representative willing to sign informed consent.

          2. Ability and willingness of the subject to follow postoperative care instructions until
             healing is complete

          3. Subject age must be between 8-16 inclusive.

          4. Subjects with a minimal canal diameter of 9mm or greater

        And any of the following fracture types

          1. Non-comminuted and comminuted mid-shaft fractures

          2. Distal third fractures 4 cm above the distal physis

          3. Fractures that are open or closed

          4. Subtrochanteric fractures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. A subject has a bone or soft tissue infection.

          2. Subject has a systemic infection.

          3. Subject has a distal (supracondylar) fracture.

          4. Subject with pathological bone (osteogenesis imperfecta and other conditions resulting
             in abnormal bone quality).

          5. Subjects with mental or neurological condition who are unwilling or incapable of
             following postoperative care instructions.

          6. Subject with conditions including blood supply limitation, and insufficient quantity
             or quality of bone.

          7. Foreign body sensitivity, where material sensitivity is suspected, testing is to be
             completed prior to implantation of device if at all practical or the subject should be
             excluded.
