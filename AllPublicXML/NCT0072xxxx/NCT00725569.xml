  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The planned study will be conducted in a prospective, randomized, double blind placebo
      controlled manner. Two &quot;anti-traumatic&quot; Homeopathic remedies (Arnica montana and
      Staphysagria) will be used. The selection of these remedies was based on a previous trial
      that showed a statistical difference in Hemoglobin levels favoring pregnant women treated
      with these drugs following delivery.

      The proposed study will focus on the post-operative recovery of women undergoing Cesarean
      section. According to Homeopathic principles, these two remedies are believed to improve the
      &quot;vital force&quot;, and will therefore improve convalescence following surgery in the study group.
      The study will include 90 women between the ages of 18 and 50 years who are scheduled for
      elective Cesarean Section. Exclusion criteria are: obesity (above 100kg), malignancy,
      psychiatric illness, diabetes and multipara pregnancies. Participants will be inducted
      following a detailed explanation by an MD and signing of an informed consent form, and then
      subdivided randomly into three groups numbering 30 in each: Two groups will be treated with
      homeopathic drugs of varied doses, and the third will get a placebo remedy which is
      indistinguishable from the other drugs. Outcome measures will include: 1. Blood loss - as
      estimated by a reduction in serum Hemoglobin levels. 2. Pain -to be evaluated by a numerical
      rating score (NRS) 3. Analgesic use 4. Length of post-operative stay and complications. 5.
      Quality of life outcomes - to be assessed using the MOS SF-36 questionnaire at one and four
      weeks following surgery. Although not expected, adverse events will be monitored.

      If, as we anticipate, the homeopathic treatment proves to be both safe and effective in
      shortening the duration of post-operative healing, this will have significant implications,
      with respect to both healthcare costs and patient suffering. It will also open the door for
      further research in the field of trauma medicine, as well as other stress-related illness.
