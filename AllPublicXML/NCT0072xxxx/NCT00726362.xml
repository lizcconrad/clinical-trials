      The primary objective is to survey the efficacy of various commercially available statins (a
      class of lipid-lowering agents, for example, rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, simvastatin,
      lovastatin, pravastatin and fluvastatin) under local clinical practice in treating patients
      with hyperlipidemia. Surveillance data (Lipid Profile) will be collected during course of
      usual clinical practice or captured upon its availability.
