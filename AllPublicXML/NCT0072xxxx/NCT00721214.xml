  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility and efficacy of using the
      demethylating agent 5-Azacytidine prior to allogeneic stem cell transplantation in patients
      with high risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study drug, 5-azacytidine, is given daily intravenously for 7 days. After every 2 cycles
      study participants will have a bone marrow test to evaluate the effect of the 5-azacytidine
      on the Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS). Participants continue to get cycles of 5-Azacytidine
      until 2 bone marrow tests show the MDS has stopped responding to the treatment. At that time
      they will undergo a transplant if a donor is available.
