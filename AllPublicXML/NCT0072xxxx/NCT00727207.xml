      RATIONALE: Everolimus may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well everolimus works in treating older patients
      with mantle cell lymphoma who received previous first-line or second-line chemotherapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the progression-free survival of older patients with mantle cell lymphoma
           receiving everolimus and who were previously treated with first- or second-line
           chemotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity and feasibility of treatment with this drug.

        -  Determine the efficacy of this drug in these patients.

        -  Compare the duration of remission after first- vs second-line chemotherapy.

        -  Determine the rate of objective remission.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral everolimus once daily in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for 3 years.
