    <textblock>
      This is an observational, multicenter, nationwide study where information will be collected
      on the follow-up of participants with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) who have a viral
      response at the end of treatment with pegylated interferon alfa-2b (PEG IFN alfa-2b) plus
      ribavirin (RBV) administered according to the directions on the products' labeling. No
      administration of treatment is planned as a result of study enrollment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV)[any genotype] who received pegylated
             interferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin as first treatment for hepatitis C.

          -  Negative HCV RNA at the end of treatment (24 or 48 weeks according to the product
             labeling as appropriate), measured by the assay used at each institution. Only
             institutions using an assay with a limit of detection of 50 IU/mL or less will be
             eligible.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women of childbearing potential (i.e., premenopausal women and women who are less than
             6 months postmenopausal) who will not use an appropriate contraceptive method during
             the course of the clinical study. Appropriate contraceptives include double barrier
             methods (eg, diaphragm or condom plus spermicide), intrauterine device, oral,
             injectable or subcutaneous hormonal contraceptive, or surgically sterilized partner.

          -  Completed treatment with pegylated interferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin more than 4 weeks
             before study entry.

          -  Positive HCV RNA at the end of treatment (24 or 48 weeks according to the product
             labeling as appropriate).

          -  Participants treated for a period shorter than the enrollment period.

          -  Co-infection with Human Immumodeficiency Virus (HIV).

          -  Co-infected with Hepatitis B Virus (HBV).
