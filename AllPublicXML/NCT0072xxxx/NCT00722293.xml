  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, four-arm, Phase I, dose escalation study to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability and to determine the optimal tolerated regimen (OTR) of pazopanib in combination
      with epirubicin or doxorubicin in patients with advanced solid tumors. Patients will be
      enrolled in cohorts of 3 to receive escalating doses of pazopanib and epirubicin or
      doxorubicin. Dose escalation schemas for each study arm are described in the protocol. For
      each arm, the OTR will be defined as the highest dose combination of the agents where no more
      than one out of six patients experiences a dose-limiting toxicity. Twelve additional patients
      in each arm will be studied with the OTR to evaluate toxicity and pharmacokinetics. This will
      allow an assessment of potential drug-drug interactions. Antitumor activity will be assessed
      using RECIST criteria.
