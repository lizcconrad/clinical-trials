      The purpose of this study is to find out if certain types of Magnetic Resonance (MR) scanning
      will help to better detect markers in the brain that are related to the neuropsychiatric
      symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). A small percentage of patients who have this
      type of lupus experience symptoms that may result from a blood clot or change in blood vessel
      structure in the brain. These neuropsychiatric symptoms can include an inability to think
      clearly, a change in level of awake and/or awareness, and in the worst cases, seizure and
      stroke. Another goal of the study is to find out if individuals with fibromyalgia (FM), or
      chronic pain, have symptom-related markers in any of these scans as well. Better and earlier
      detection of markers that are related to acute neuropsychiatric lupus (NPSLE) and FM will be
      helpful to all who are affected by these diseases.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Meet the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for SLE with neuropsychiatric
             symptoms.

          -  Be 18 years of age or older.

          -  Have recent onset of neurological symptoms that have been active within the last 14
             days. The criteria for NPSLE study patients will be a clinically significant
             neurologic examination which, in the opinion of the treating physician, may be due to
             SLE and requires MRI evaluation. Patients will be classified according to the
             nomenclature recommended by the ACR on Neuropsychiatric Manifestations in SLE, and
             further classified as &quot;focal,&quot; &quot;nonfocal,&quot; or &quot;seizure&quot; [68].

          -  Be willing and able to complete all study procedures and sign the informed consent
             form.

          -  Report no neurological symptoms at the time of enrollment.

          -  The patients meeting the baseline criteria will be sequentially enrolled from the
             Lupus Cohort. Recruitment will be adjusted to include equal numbers of APA positive
             and APA negative patients.

          -  Meet the established ACR criteria for FM [69].

          -  Be willing and able to complete all study procedures associated with baseline
             scanning.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Those SLE patients with acute onset of neurological symptoms with duration longer than
             14 days.

          -  Individuals who are pregnant.

          -  Individuals who are left-handed.

          -  Individuals who meet 1990 ACR criteria for FM

          -  Have acute onset of neurological symptoms related to SLE.

          -  Individuals who are pregnant.

          -  Individuals who are left-handed.

          -  Individuals who meet ACR criteria for FM.

          -  Co-morbid medical illnesses capable of causing a worsening of physical functional
             status independent of the diagnosis (e.g., morbid obesity), autoimmune diseases other
             than SLE cardiopulmonary disorders (e.g., angina, congestive heart failure,
             COPD(chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), chronic asthma), uncontrolled endocrine
             or allergic disorders (e.g., thyroid dysfunction, Type I diabetes), and malignancy
             within 2 years, excluding successfully treated squamous or basal skin carcinoma.

          -  Any present psychiatric disorder involving a history of psychosis (e.g.,
             schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, schizophreniform disorder, delusional
             disorder, etc.), current suicide risk or attempt within 2 years of the study, or
             substance abuse within 2 years.

          -  Individuals with mood disorders will not be excluded.
