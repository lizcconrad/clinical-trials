  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study to compare PK of a new 100mg capsule with four 25mg capsules. This is required because
      we plan to have only single capsules administered in the later phase clinical trials but we
      have not had a 100mg strength before. As this is a new previously untested strength we need
      to ensure that the PK is similar to that achieved using 4 x 25mg. The study will also assess
      the effect of high fat food on the PK of the 100mg capsule. The study is planned to consist
      of a single part , with three dosing periods, periods 1-3 consisting of 16 subjects. There
      will be a week wash out between each dose. In the three dosing periods subjects will either
      received 4x25 mg GSK598809 capsule in a fasted state, 100mg capsule in a fasted state or
      100mg GSK598809 capsule in a fed state. Subjects will return to the centre for follow-up 7-14
      days after the final dose. It is expected that the total duration of the study should be
      approximately eight weeks.
