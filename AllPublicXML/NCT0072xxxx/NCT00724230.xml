    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PegIntron plus Rebetol
      combination therapy administered to patients with chronic hepatitis C. The study will exclude
      (1) subjects with HCV genotype 1 and high viral load, and (2) interferon-naïve subjects with
      low viral load. It is being conducted as a post-approval commitment, in accordance with the
      Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare's guideline on Good Post-marketing Study Practice.

      Post-marketing surveys are not considered applicable clinical trials and thus the results of
      this survey will not be posted at its conclusion. The results will be submitted to public
      health officials as required by applicable national and international laws.
