    <description>Device: Duolith SD1 (Storz Medical AG) - Focused Extracorporeal shock wave therapy.
The total energy flux density was increased continuously from 0.01 to 0.25 mJ/mm 2 within 500 introductory impulses. Thereafter, 2000 treatment impulses with 0.25 mJ/mm 2 (four impulses per second) were administered per session,and the interventionwas repeated up to a total of three sessions in weekly intervals.</description>

    <description>Sham Duolith SD1 (Storz Medical AG). The placebo group received identical sham intervention with an air- filled standoff that prevented the transmission of shock waves. The placebo handpiece was identical in design, shape, and weight to ensure that there was no way for the participants to identify the placebo handpiece.</description>
