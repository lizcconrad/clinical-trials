  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To find out if Cranial Electrotherapy Stimulation is a useful treatment for people who have
      been burned and have Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. CES may be helpful in giving relief to
      some or all of those symptoms.

      The purpose of this research study is to systematically determine if CES therapy is effective
      in managing post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the burn patient. Cranial Electrotherapy
      Stimulation (CES) is the delivery of low-level electrical stimulation across the head,
      delivered with ear lobe electrode clips or self-adhesive electrode pads. CES in the current
      form has been used for the past 30 years to successfully treat anxiety, depression, insomnia
      and pain in a variety of patient populations. This FDA approved medical device is
      non-invasive and has no reported significant side effects. It will be used on patients
      undergoing outpatient rehabilitation in our burn center.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Post-Traumatic Stress Questionnaire-Military (PCL-M) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects were asked to complete questionnaire three times during the course of study. Questions addressed symptoms associated with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder(PTSD). Scores can range from 17 to 85. A score &gt;31 was used to identify symptomatic subjects and was therefore required at baseline for study enrollment.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 Weeks, 8 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This 20-item questionnaire measures depressive symptoms. Scores can range from 0-60, with scores greater than 16 indicating need for further evaluation due to possible Major Depression.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Brief Profile of Mood States (BPOMS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>BPOMS is a tool used to qualitatively measure anxiety. Subjects were asked to evaluate 30 feelings that they may have had over the past week. Stress-associated feelings are scored on a 5-point Likert scale from 0 (not at all)to 4 (extremely). Six of the feelings listed on the questionnaire are not associated with anxiety and therefore are not scored. Total scores range from 0-96, with higher scores indicating greater tension and anxiety.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Visual Analogue Scale of Pain (VAS-P) Before and After Cranial Electrotherapy Stimulation (CES).</measure>
    <time_frame>Blinded Period, Unblinded Period</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects were asked to evaluate their pain intensity before and after each daily CES or sham treatment. Responses were scored on a scale ranging from 0 (indicating no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Visual Analogue Scale of Anxiety (VAS-A) Before and After Cranial Electrotherapy Stimulation (CES).</measure>
    <time_frame>Blinded Period, Unblinded Period</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects were asked to evaluate their anxiety level before and after each daily CES treatment. Responses were scored on a scale ranging from 0 (indicating no anxiety) to 10 (worst possible).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean General Sleep Disturbance Scale (GSDS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The GSDS is a questionnaire used to qualitatively evaluate sleep. This 21-question tool evaluates each aspect of sleep and restfulness on a 0-7 score, indicating the number of days per week that each problem may be present. Total scores range from 0-147, with higher scores indicating more profound disturbances in sleep.</description>

        <description>BPOMS is a tool used to qualitatively measure anxiety. Subjects were asked to evaluate 30 feelings that they may have had over the past week. Stress-associated feelings are scored on a 5-point Likert scale from 0 (not at all)to 4 (extremely). Six of the feelings listed on the questionnaire are not associated with anxiety and therefore are not scored. Total scores range from 0-96, with higher scores indicating greater tension and anxiety.</description>

      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>This study had a high study turn-over rate, which led to small data group analysis. All subjects enrolled were active military service men. This made civilian and female comparison impossible. The PI also changed during study course.</limitations_and_caveats>
