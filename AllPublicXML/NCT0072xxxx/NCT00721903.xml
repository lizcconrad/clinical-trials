      The purpose of this study is to determine how well changes can be determined in malignant
      masses from ultrasound scans.

      To evaluate the proportions of correct diagnosis of response to breast Cancer therapies for
      localized breast cancer by ultrasound. To develop a model based on patient characteristics,
      physical exam, and radiologic studies which will predict the possibility that a patient has
      had a complete pathological response to chemotherapy neoadjuvant therapy.
