    <textblock>
      Adverse Drug Related Events (ADREs) are a leading cause of Emergency Department (ED) visits
      in Canada. However emergency physicians recognize only half of all ADREs in patients
      presenting to the ED, missing opportunities to intervene. The objective of this study is to
      develop a screening strategy that identifies patients with ADREs. Our hypothesis is that the
      development of a user-friendly, reliable screening strategy for ADREs in patients presenting
      to the ED is feasible. We believe that this will lead to improved patient care.

      Background Between 9250 and 23,750 Canadians die each year because of preventable adverse
      events related to medical care. ADREs account for 50% of all preventable adverse events and
      cause up to 12% of ED visits. Unfortunately, emergency physicians recognize only half of all
      ADREs, missing crucial opportunities to intervene.

      Objective The objective of this study is to derive a clinical decision rule that accurately
      stratifies patients presenting to the ED into risk categories for drug-related morbidity.
      This instrument will allow early identification of clinically significant ADREs allowing
      rational referral for medication optimization, treatment of ADREs and prevention of future
      events.

      Hypothesis The development of a rapid, user-friendly reliable clinical decision rule for
      ADREs in patients presenting to the ED is feasible.

      Methodology This prospective observational study will evaluate predictor variables (from the
      history, physical examination and laboratory tests) for ADREs in a representative sample of
      ED patients using standardized assessments by emergency nurses and physicians. Inter-rater
      agreement of predictor variables will be measured, and clinical pharmacists, blinded to the
      nursing and physician assessments, will use a standardized, validated algorithm to identify
      ADREs. Recursive partitioning and/or logistic regression analysis will be used to determine
      the optimal combination of predictor variables to detect the presence of an ADRE. We will
      report diagnostic test characteristics of the derived clinical decision rule. Validation of
      the clinical decision rule is planned in a future study.
