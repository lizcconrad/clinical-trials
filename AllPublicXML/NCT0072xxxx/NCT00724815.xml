    <textblock>
      This study was a randomized, parallel group, double-blind, placebo controlled design to
      compare the efficacy and tolerability of NP101 to a placebo iontophoretic transdermal patch.
      The primary objective of this study was to assess the proportion of subjects who were
      headache pain free at two hours after patch activation.

      Key secondary objectives included:

        1. The proportion of subjects who were nausea free at two hours after patch activation.

        2. The proportion of subjects who were photophobia free at two hours after patch
           activation.

        3. The proportion of subjects who were phonophobia free at two hours after patch
           activation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects stayed in the study until they had treated one migraine headache with a study patch
      or two months after randomization, whichever occurred first. During a migraine headache,
      subjects rated their baseline headache pain severity in a Migraine Study Diary using a
      4-point scale (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe) and applied the study patch only
      if their score was 2 or 3 (i.e., qualifying migraine headache). In addition to headache pain
      severity, subjects also recorded the presence or absence of aura, nausea, phonophobia, and
      photophobia, as well as the location of their headache (unilateral or bilateral) and whether
      their headache increased with movement.
