      The purpose of this study is to find out if taking a birth control pill, YAZ, is safe and
      effective for treating hidradenitis suppurativa. Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic
      (long lasting) skin disorder that mostly affects the armpits and groin area. It appears as
      blackheads and one or more red, tender bumps that may enlarge, break open, and drain pus.
      Scarring may result after several attacks of the disease.

      The exact cause of HS isn't known. However, it is believed that the plugging of hair
      follicles and bacterial infection that occur in acne also occur in HS. Many of the
      medications used for treating acne are also used for HS. However, none of the medications are
      consistently effective.

      YAZ is a combination birth control pill. Nearly all birth control pills are made up of a
      combination of estrogen and progestin hormones. YAZ contains ethinyl estradiol (an estrogen)
      and drospirenone (a progestin). People who develop acne have sebaceous glands that are
      over-stimulated by male sex hormones (androgens). Sebaceous glands secrete an oily substance
      into a hair follicle to lubricate hair or skin. The progestin in YAZ actually blocks the male
      sex hormones (androgens) that cause acne. Hormones seem to play a role in HS as the condition
      occurs after puberty. It affects more women than men and HS often gets worse around the time
      a women has her menstrual period.

      YAZ has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat moderate acne
      in women who desire an oral contraceptive for birth control.

      This study uses a placebo. A placebo looks like the study drug but contains no active drug.
      We use placebos in research studies to learn if the effects seen in research subjects are
      truly from the study drug or from other reasons.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hidradenitis suppurativa is a chronic suppurative and scarring disease primarily affecting
      the axillae and inguinal and perineal areas. The apocrine glands are the primary targets. It
      is characterized by firm, tender red nodules that soon become fluctuant and painful. Rupture
      of the lesion, suppuration, formation of sinus tracts and scarring may occur.

      The exact etiology of HS remains obscure. Proposed etiologic factors include follicular
      occlusion and bacterial infection, genetics, host defense defects, hormones, cigarette
      smoking, and irritants. Hormones seem to play a role, as the condition occurs after puberty,
      affects more women than men, and often flares in the perimenstrual period.

      Treating hidradenitis remains a challenge. Although many patients benefit from long-term
      treatment with systemic antibiotics (eg, tetracycline, minocycline, clindamycin, erythromycin
      in combination with metronidazole), no published evidence suggests that the long-term use of
      antibiotics alters the natural course of HS. Oral isotretinoin has been used, but is
      effective only in some cases. Some patients have had a beneficial response to biological
      agents, especially anti-TNF alpha biologicals such as infliximab. Oral contraceptives
      containing norgestrel or cyproterone acetate, alone or in combination with supplemental
      cyproterone acetate, spironolactone or dexamethasone (to block adrenal androgen production),
      have been shown to reduce the frequency and severity of attacks in women.

      YAZ is an oral contraceptive that is FDA approved for acne vulgaris. Unlike other progestins,
      drospirenone has unique antimineralocorticoid (mild diuretic effect) and antiandrogenic
      properties. The antiandrogenic property of drospirenone means that it blocks the male sex
      hormones that can cause acne. It is hoped that that YAZ will offer patients with hidradenitis
      suppurativa a safe and effective therapeutic option.

      Subjects will be assigned to a treatment group upon randomization. Bayer HealthCare
      Pharmaceuticals personnel, investigators, subjects and study nurse/coordinators will be
      blinded to the study product treatment assignment. The study duration will be 24 weeks with
      visits at screening, baseline (week 0), week 6, week 12, week 18, and week 24. Lesion counts
      (total, inflammatory, non-inflammatory) and an ISGA, and photography will be performed on
      every visit. A physical examination will be done at baseline and Week 24. Safety will be
      assessed from reported adverse events (AEs).

    <measure>Mean Improvement in the Sartorius Severity Score at Month 6.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Sartorius Severity score reflects changes in hidradenitis suppurative symptoms, namely the number of lesions (abscesses, nodules, and fistulas) and the longest distance between lesions. A total score is derived based on assessments at up to 8 distinct anatomical regions and ranges from 5 to indefinite. Smaller numbers are better scores and indicate less lesion involvement, thus decreases (negative changes) from baseline indicate improvement in severity of disease.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in VAS Pain Scale at Month 6.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months from Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>For this pain assessment, the participant indicated the level of average pain experienced over the past 24 hours on a horizontal line, 10 cm in length. A score of 0 indicated &quot;no pain&quot; and a score of 10 indicated &quot;worst pain&quot;. The value indicates the change from the baseline participant assessment on the 0 to 10 scale. A negative value indicates a reduction in pain intensity.</description>

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Score is a participant-reported outcome consisting of a set of 10 questions regarding the degree to which the participant's skin has affected certain behaviors and quality of life over the last week. Responses to each are: very much, a lot, a little, or not at all. The DLQI score ranges from 0 (best) to 30 (worst).</description>

        <title>Mean Improvement in the Sartorius Severity Score at Month 6.</title>
        <description>The Sartorius Severity score reflects changes in hidradenitis suppurative symptoms, namely the number of lesions (abscesses, nodules, and fistulas) and the longest distance between lesions. A total score is derived based on assessments at up to 8 distinct anatomical regions and ranges from 5 to indefinite. Smaller numbers are better scores and indicate less lesion involvement, thus decreases (negative changes) from baseline indicate improvement in severity of disease.</description>

        <description>For this pain assessment, the participant indicated the level of average pain experienced over the past 24 hours on a horizontal line, 10 cm in length. A score of 0 indicated &quot;no pain&quot; and a score of 10 indicated &quot;worst pain&quot;. The value indicates the change from the baseline participant assessment on the 0 to 10 scale. A negative value indicates a reduction in pain intensity.</description>
