  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Changes in major angiogenic proteins have been seen following initiation of tamoxifen and
      aromatase inhibitor therapy in women with breast cancer. One source of these proteins is the
      circulating platelet pool. The investigators hypothesize that in addition to their
      anti-platelet properties, agents such as aspirin can be used as targeted anti-angiogenesis
      therapy. The investigators will determine the influence of aspirin on the release of
      angiogenic proteins from platelets in 35 patients with breast cancer.
