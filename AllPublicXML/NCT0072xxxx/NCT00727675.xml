    <textblock>
      This study involves the development of an integrated psychotherapy that addresses both
      chronic pain and opioid dependence(POD).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To conduct a pre-pilot study with 20 POD patients to a) evaluate the acceptability and
      potential efficacy of specific sessions (i.e., reduced illicit opioid use as assessed by
      urine toxicology and self-report findings, and decreased pain as evidenced by attenuated pain
      intensity and pain interference on self-report measures from baseline throughout treatment)
      for inclusion in integrated Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for POD and the sequence of
      sessions, b) assess patients' satisfaction with integrated CBT as evidenced by qualitative
      feedback from individual exit interviews, and c) develop and modify initial therapist
      training and process rating measures. Products will include a) a manual for integrated CBT
      for POD to be used in opioid treatment programs and primary care settings with POD patients,
      b) therapist training materials, and c) process rating instruments.
