      The purpose of this randomized clinical trial is to test a 12-month multi-component health
      promotion intervention with home-based family caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's Disease
      and other related dementias. Specific aims are to: 1) Test the primary hypothesis: The
      Enhancing Physical Activity treatment intervention will be more effective in increasing
      caregiver lifestyle physical activity than the Standard Care Intervention; 2) Test secondary
      hypotheses: The Enhancing Physical Activity treatment intervention will be more effective
      than the Standard Care Intervention in improving the following caregiver secondary outcomes:
      mental health, physical health and physical function; and 3) Evaluate the process of
      implementing a lifestyle physical activity intervention with family caregivers. The Standard
      Care Intervention focuses on well-established care-related education and support needs. The
      Enhancing Physical Activity treatment intervention focuses on two areas: increasing lifestyle
      physical activity and addressing well-established care-related concerns that are likely to
      interfere with increasing physical activity. A total of 190 middle-age to older
      community-based primary caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's disease or other related
      dementias who report some to moderate strain with caregiving activities will be randomly
      assigned to either the Enhancing Physical Activity or Standard Care Intervention. Data will
      be collected at baseline, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 18 months and include self-report and direct
      observational methods. Data will be analyzed by using repeated measures models using the
      generalized estimating equation approach. Family caregivers are a stressed population who
      experience changes in their mental and physical health. However, effect sizes have been
      minimal for interventions designed to only affect caregiver mental health. No study known to
      us, has tested the added value of physical activity adoption in conjunction with more
      traditional caregiver support and skill building. Study findings will enable us to evaluate
      the behavioral , physical, and health-related quality of life effects achieved by the
      combined intervention; and will add knowledge about the most effective ways of intervening
      with family caregivers and other chronically stressed middle-age and older adult populations.
