  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether individualized wound prevention
      instructions will lengthen the ulcer-free period in veterans with recently healed venous
      ulcers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Venous ulcer disease is the most common form of lower extremity ulcer, and treatment requires
      months to years of costly intervention. Preventing venous ulcers from recurring is ideal,
      however, healing time is variable, possibly due to inadequate patient/clinician communication
      and surveillance. An aftercare summary is a detailed set of self-care instructions designed
      to help patients understand and influence preventative factors under their control. They have
      successfully been used in patients with cardiac disease and are currently being tested to
      help prevent diabetic foot ulcers. We propose the use of an aftercare summary to help prevent
      ulcer recurrence in veterans with recently healed venous ulcers.

    Study delayed for over a year by research shutdown at Seattle VA and other issues. Study
