    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the relative difference in Pharmacokinetics (PK)
      between extensive metabolizers (EMs) and poor metabolizers (PMs) is the same with
      desvenlafaxine SR and venlafaxine ER when a single dose is administered.

    <description>Cmax is a measure of drug metabolism and presented as least squares geometric mean with 90% Confidence Interval.

          -  History of being a nonsmoker for at least 1 year.

          -  Subjects have to be either extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers with a normal complement of 1
             or 2 fully active enzyme gene alleles or poor CYP2D6 metabolizers (lack of active
             enzyme gene alleles) via genetic testing of a blood sample.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence or history of any significant cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, respiratory,
             gastrointestinal, endocrine, immunologic, dermatologic, hematologic, neurologic, or
             psychiatric disease or any severe conditions of the ears, eyes or throat (such as
             glaucoma or increased intraocular pressure).

          -  Known or suspected alcohol abuse or consumption of more than 2 standard units per day
             (a standard unit equals 12 ounces of beer, 1½ ounces of 80-proof alcohol, or 6 ounces
             of wine) within the past 6 months.

          -  Known or suspected current abuse of prohibited drugs or other substances. Use of any
             hormonal therapy within 30 days before study day -1 until the end of the partial
