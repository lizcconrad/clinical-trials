    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the gene expression patterns from colorectal mucosal
      cells collected through the use of a standard anoscope and cytology brush. Patients will
      include those scheduled for routine colonoscopy procedures and those with confirmed
      colorectal cancer.
