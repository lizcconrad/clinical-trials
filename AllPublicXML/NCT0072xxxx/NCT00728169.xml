      The purpose of this study is to identify community resources and challenges in improving the
      health of community members with asthma.

      The primary goal of this project is to use Community-Based Participatory Research methodology
      to develop interventions aimed at improving asthma management in high-risk African American
      asthmatics. This &quot;ground-up&quot; longterm approach has never been tested before in asthmatics.
      The primary goal of this study will be accomplished with four specific aims:

      Aim 1. Conduct focus groups to identify barriers to asthma management in the target
      population.

      Aim 2. Use a community advisory board (CAB) consisting of participants selected from the
      various focus groups to gather information about solutions for the above barriers.

      Aim 3. Use the information from the CAB to develop an intervention to improve asthma self
      management behaviors in the target population.

      Aim 4. Refine the developed intervention based on feedback from focus groups conducted in Aim
      1.

      Volunteer will be asked to respond to several questions that address their perceptions about
      asthma. Volunteers will also be asked to discuss their beliefs about asthma. Everyone in the
      group will be given an opportunity to answer questions. Volunteers can decide that they no
      longer want to participate in the group discussion at any time.

      The discussion will last from 1.5 - 2 hours. The focus group discussion will have a maximum
      of 10 people.

      We will be audio and video taping the discussion so that we do not miss any information that
      volunteers share with us. The audio and video tapes will not be shared with anyone outside
      our staff.

      Volunteer participation in this study is voluntary and there will be no negative consequences
      if volunteers decide not to participate. Volunteers are also free to withdraw from this study
      at any time. Withdrawal or refusal to participate will not affect health care services or
      other rights.
