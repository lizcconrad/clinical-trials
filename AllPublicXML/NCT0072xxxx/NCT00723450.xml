    <textblock>
      The study will be a multi-center, parallel, group, placebo control, double-blind, randomized
      controlled trial of lamictal as add-on maintenance treatment in pediatric outpatients (aged
      10 to 17 years) diagnosed with Bipolar I disorder. The study consists of 4 phases: Screen
      (approximately 2 weeks), Open label phase (up to 18 weeks), Randomized phase (up to 36 weeks)
      and Taper and follow-up phase (up to 4 weeks).

        <description>The QIDS-A17-C is a 17-item scale used to assess depression severity in adolescents according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) diagnostic criteria for a major depressive episode; it is a modified version of the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS) used for adults. Each item is scored on a 0-3 scale, yielding 9 domain scores. The range of scores is 0 (best possible outcome) to 27 (worst possible outcome). Analysis was performed using mixed model repeated measures.</description>

        <title>Change From Randomization in the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology – Self-report Adolescent Version (QIDS-A17-SR) at Each Visit in the Randomized Phase</title>
        <description>The QIDS-A17-SR is a 17-item scale used to assess depression severity in adolescents according to the DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria for a major depressive episode; it is a modified version of the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS) used for adults. Each item is scored on a 0-3 scale, yielding 9 domain scores. The range of scores is 0 (best possible outcome) to 27 (worst possible outcome). The scale is completed by the participant. Analysis was performed using mixed model repeated measures.</description>

Improvement defined as CGI-BP(I)=1 (improved) or 2 (very much improved). Missing data imputed using last-observation carried forward (LOCF).</description>
          <population>Open-Label ITT Population. Only those par. available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X). Different par. may have been analyzed at different time points, so the overall number of par. analyzed reflects everyone in the Open-Label Population.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) at Each Visit in the Open-Label Phase</title>
        <description>The YMRS consists of 11 items and is based on the participant's report of their mania symptoms. It is clinician rated. Four items (irritability, speech, thought content, and disruptive/aggressive behavior) are rated on a scale of 0 to 8, while the other seven items (elevated mood, increased motor activity-energy, sexual interest, sleep, language, appearance, and insight) are rated on a scale of 0 to 4. The range of scores for the YMRS is 0 (best possible outcome) to 60 (worst possible outcome). The YMRS was completed by the investigator or their qualified designee. Analysis was performed using mixed model repeated measures.</description>

Participants 10 -12 years of age received LTG up to a maximum dose of: 3 milligrams/kilograms (mg/kg)/day or 100 mg/day, whichever was less; or 6 mg/kg/day or 200 mg/day whichever was less; or 12 mg/kg/day or 300 mg/day whichever was less, depending on their bipolar medication group. Participants 13-17 years of age received LTG up to a maximum dose of 150 mg/day, 300 mg/day, or 400 mg/day depending on their bipolar medication group. Participants took LTG for a duration of up to 18 weeks.</description>

        <description>The CGI-P is a 10-item scale used to assess attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms in children and adolescents aged 3-17 years of age. The scale is composed of two factors: restless-impulsive behavior and emotional lability. Each item was scored on a 0-3 scale. The range of scores for the CGI-P is 0 (best possible outcome) to 30 (worst possible outcome). The CGI-P was completed by the participant’s custodial parent or legal guardian. Analysis was performed using mixed model repeated measures.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in the Conners’ Global Index – Parent Version (CGI-P) at Each Visit in the Open-Label Phase</title>
          <description>The CGI-P is a 10-item scale used to assess attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms in children and adolescents aged 3-17 years of age. The scale is composed of two factors: restless-impulsive behavior and emotional lability. Each item was scored on a 0-3 scale. The range of scores for the CGI-P is 0 (best possible outcome) to 30 (worst possible outcome). The CGI-P was completed by the participant’s custodial parent or legal guardian. Analysis was performed using mixed model repeated measures.</description>
