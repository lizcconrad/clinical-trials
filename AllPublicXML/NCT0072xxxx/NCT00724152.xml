      This study examined how useful it is to teach veterans coping skills for dealing with
      tinnitus, also called ringing in the ears. A psychological intervention, cognitive-behavioral
      therapy, was used to teach coping skills even though tinnitus is not a psychological
      disorder. Participants in Period 1 of the study were assigned to one of two groups for the
      duration of the study and were blinded to their group assignment until the end of the study.
      One group received education about tinnitus. The other group received education about
      tinnitus plus additional ways to cope with problems associated with tinnitus such as sleep
      disturbance and frustration. Participants were selected to participate if their tinnitus was
      severe and they had been exposed to loud sound. Participants attended up to six weekly group
      meetings. It was predicted that participants who were randomly assigned to the cognitive
      behavioral therapy group would report a greater reduction in tinnitus severity than education
      controls. During Period 2 of the study, a third &quot;standard care&quot; arm was added. Baseline and
      outcome data of the 4 participants who completed the study after this third arm was added to
      the study design are not reported.

      The objectives of this study were to (1) develop a novel, integrative, psychological
      intervention, specifically cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), for the treatment of tinnitus
      among veterans who have past exposure to loud noise, and (2) accrue preliminary data
      examining the efficacy of the approach relative to standard care with education (ED) control
      conditions. Tinnitus was the most common service-connected disability among veterans
      2006-2012. Interventions for tinnitus are few and no cure exists. This pilot study examined
      the feasibility and efficacy of providing individualized (CBT) for veterans with bothersome
      tinnitus. Twenty-five veterans were recruited and randomly selected to one of two conditions
      during Period One of the study; the treatment condition (CBT) or (ED) control. A CBT manual
      and an ED manual were developed for this study. Subjects were be eligible for the study if
      their tinnitus was likely caused by noise exposure, their tinnitus was chronic (&gt; 6 months),
      tinnitus was a major health concern for them, and participants were able to commit to a
      6-week course of treatment at the West Haven location of VACHS. Subjects were veterans
      blinded to the treatment group to which they are assigned if ED or CBT. The THI served as the
      primary outcome measure and the TRQ served as the secondary outcome measure pre- and
      post-treatment follow-up. Results of this pilot project were used to inform the design and
      methods of future rigorous randomized controlled clinical trials of CBT for tinnitus
      following its incorporation into the Progressive Tinnitus Management (PTM) protocol. Baseline
      and outcome data of the 4 participants who completed the study after this third arm was added
      to the study design are not reported as this third arm essentially modified the design such
      that a new study began but was not completed.

    <measure>Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI)</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-treatment (session 1) to post-treatment (session 6; approximately 6 weeks after session 1)</time_frame>
    <description>Most widely used measure of tinnitus distress available during study period. The THI was created using the Tinnitus Handicap Questionnaire and the Tinnitus Questionnaire as well as the Beck Depression Inventory and Modified Somatic Perception Questionnaire. Its construct validity was also assessed using patients' responses on symptom rating scales and auditory tests of pitch and loudness. The THI score ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 indicating the most severe tinnitus and 0 is the least severe tinnitus. The authors of the THI have designated levels of severity, with scores of 16 and below falling into the &quot;no handicap&quot; range. This measure has strong internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha = .93) and test-retest validity for the total score (r = .92). Significant improvement in tinnitus handicap can be observed with a 20-point change in total score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tinnitus Reaction Questionnaire (TRQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-treatment (session 1) to post-treatment (session 6; approximately 6 weeks later)</time_frame>
    <description>This is another commonly used measure of tinnitus distress in research. The TRQ is a global measure of tinnitus distress and was developed using correlations with clinician and self-report ratings of symptom categories. Scores on this measure range from 0 to 104 with higher scores indicating more distress. This measure has a high internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha = .96) and test-retest validity for the total score (r = .88). Scores of 17 points or higher on this measure will indicate tinnitus severity is such that the patient is significantly disturbed by tinnitus. This is based on the use of the TRQ as a pre-test measure in measuring outcome of a controlled trial of CBT for tinnitus in an elderly sample. That study sample had an average TRQ score of 16.9 prior to treatment.</description>

Cognitive behavioral therapy for tinnitus participants addressed cognitive and behavioral skills targeting the management of tinnitus and the negative impacts of tinnitus. Long-term self-efficacy and self-sufficiency were emphasized. The major components of CBT for tinnitus included identification of individual responses and beliefs about tinnitus and hearing loss, re-conceptualization of the tinnitus experience as one in which the patient has personal control, presentation of skills to modify cognitions and change behaviors, and reinforcement of skills via goals setting, homework and activities. Skills related to attention control, sleep hygiene, relaxation training are provided. Tinnitus education also included causes, treatments, current research, etc.</description>

Tinnitus education also included causes, treatments, current research, epidemiological information, basic anatomy of the ear and brain, and support resources. 2 grp randomize.</description>

        <title>Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI)</title>
        <description>Most widely used measure of tinnitus distress available during study period. The THI was created using the Tinnitus Handicap Questionnaire and the Tinnitus Questionnaire as well as the Beck Depression Inventory and Modified Somatic Perception Questionnaire. Its construct validity was also assessed using patients’ responses on symptom rating scales and auditory tests of pitch and loudness. The THI score ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 indicating the most severe tinnitus and 0 is the least severe tinnitus. The authors of the THI have designated levels of severity, with scores of 16 and below falling into the “no handicap” range. This measure has strong internal consistency reliability (Cronbach’s alpha = .93) and test-retest validity for the total score (r = .92). Significant improvement in tinnitus handicap can be observed with a 20-point change in total score.</description>

        <title>Tinnitus Reaction Questionnaire (TRQ)</title>
        <description>This is another commonly used measure of tinnitus distress in research. The TRQ is a global measure of tinnitus distress and was developed using correlations with clinician and self-report ratings of symptom categories. Scores on this measure range from 0 to 104 with higher scores indicating more distress. This measure has a high internal consistency reliability (Cronbach’s alpha = .96) and test-retest validity for the total score (r = .88). Scores of 17 points or higher on this measure will indicate tinnitus severity is such that the patient is significantly disturbed by tinnitus. This is based on the use of the TRQ as a pre-test measure in measuring outcome of a controlled trial of CBT for tinnitus in an elderly sample. That study sample had an average TRQ score of 16.9 prior to treatment.</description>

        <measure>
          <title>Tinnitus Reaction Questionnaire (TRQ)</title>
          <description>This is another commonly used measure of tinnitus distress in research. The TRQ is a global measure of tinnitus distress and was developed using correlations with clinician and self-report ratings of symptom categories. Scores on this measure range from 0 to 104 with higher scores indicating more distress. This measure has a high internal consistency reliability (Cronbach’s alpha = .96) and test-retest validity for the total score (r = .88). Scores of 17 points or higher on this measure will indicate tinnitus severity is such that the patient is significantly disturbed by tinnitus. This is based on the use of the TRQ as a pre-test measure in measuring outcome of a controlled trial of CBT for tinnitus in an elderly sample. That study sample had an average TRQ score of 16.9 prior to treatment.</description>

          <title>Arm 1/Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</title>
          <description>Participants randomly assigned to this experimental group received six weeks of tinnitus education plus cognitive behavioral therapy. Cognitive behavioral therapy for tinnitus participants addressed cognitive and behavioral skills targeting the management of tinnitus and the negative impacts of tinnitus. Long-term self-efficacy and self-sufficiency were emphasized. The major components of CBT for tinnitus included identification of individual responses and beliefs about tinnitus and hearing loss, re-conceptualization of the tinnitus experience as one in which the patient has personal control, presentation of skills to modify cognitions and change behaviors, and reinforcement of skills via goals setting, homework and activities. Skills related to attention control, sleep hygiene, relaxation training are provided. Tinnitus education also included causes, treatments, current research, epidemiological information, basic anatomy of the ear and brain, and support resources.</description>
