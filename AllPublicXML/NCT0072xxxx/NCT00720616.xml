      Study hypothesis:

      Low dose growth hormone (GH), through its generation of free 'bioavailable' insulin-like
      growth factor (IGF)-I, can improve insulin sensitivity and the metabolic profile of subjects
      with metabolic syndrome.

      Study aims:

      The purpose of this study is to determine the mechanism of how low dose GH treatment affects
      the body's sensitivity to insulin actions and whether this low GH dose can affect the body's
      handling of steroid hormone levels (cortisol clearance) and fat deposition in subjects with
      metabolic syndrome.

      Study design: Subjects that satisfy the criteria of metabolic syndrome (central obesity,
      treated or untreated high blood pressure, high cholesterol and impaired fasting glucose
      levels) will be invited to participate in this study. The subjects will be assessed at the
      initial visit to ascertain their suitability before further participation in the study. If
      eligible, an equal number of men and women will be randomized (like a flip of a coin) to
      receive either daily low dose GH or placebo injections first for 12 weeks, before exchanging
      over for another 12 weeks of treatment after a 4-week washout period. Before, during and
      after treatment, the subjects will be assessed at frequently with blood tests, scans and fat
      biopsies. During the study, the subjects will be studied 4 times at the Oregon Clinical and
      Translational Research Institute (OCTRI). At the first, second and final visit, testing will
      include scans to measure the amount of whole body fat and fat in the stomach area, muscle,
      and liver; blood tests to measure levels of cortisol, and fat tissue (taken from a biopsy)
      analysis to measure the density of insulin-like growth factor-I (a hormone stimulated by
      growth hormone in the body) in fat; whereas blood tests to examine how well insulin works in
      the body (insulin sensitivity) will be collected at all visits of the study.

      The study will be a double-blinded randomized placebo-controlled cross-over study. Thirty
      subjects will be screened for eligibility initially, and the first 12 eligible subjects will
      be enrolled. Six subjects will be randomized to receive the low GH dose (0.1 mg/day)
      treatment and 6 subjects to receive Placebo treatment for 12 weeks, exchanging their
      treatment for a further 12 weeks after a 4-week washout period. The study drugs will be
      stored at the Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU) Research Pharmacy and following
      randomization, the subjects will be taught by either the Principal Investigator or one of our
      Endocrine Nurses to self-administer the injections using Norditropin/Placebo vials and
      insulin syringes into the abdomen at 2200h. Randomization for treatment assignment will be
      performed by an investigator not directly involved in the patients' recruitment, treatment
      and follow-up care. The randomization process will be performed by computerized pre-assigned
      random codes by blocks, stratified by age and examined for possible differences in body mass
      index. During their in-patient stay at the Oregon Clinical and Translational Research
      Institute (OCTRI) at OHSU, subjects will only be allowed to eat the food provided to them by
      the OCTRI.
