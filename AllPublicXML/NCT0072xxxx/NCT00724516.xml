      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the functionality of a new breast compression paddle
      used in mammography for wire localization.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Presently, the breast compression paddles that are used in mammography for wire localization
      are made of plastic and contain a relatively small rectangular shaped opening through which
      the wire is placed in the breast. When technologists use this paddle, they must carefully
      position the breast such that the rectangular opening is above the region for wire
      localization. A novel paddle has been developed which increases the wire localization access
      area tremendously and should therefore make it easier to perform the procedure. The purpose
      of this study is to evaluate the functionality of this new compression paddle. The new
      compression paddle was developed by Biomedical Engineering students in conjunction with
      Radiologists and a Medical Physicist at the University of Michigan. It was designed and
      manufactured for a student project in the Mechanical Engineering 450/599 course at the
      University of Michigan.

    <description>Instead of using the regular wire localization mammography compression paddle, a new breast compression paddle will be used. The new breast compression paddle is similar to a tennis racquet. It consists of crossing plastic strings that are strung tightly in a frame. The needle/wire can be inserted anywhere between the strings.</description>
