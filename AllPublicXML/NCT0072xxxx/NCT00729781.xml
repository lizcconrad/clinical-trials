  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to research a polyester polyethylene terephthalate (PET) implant
      for the treatment of external nasal valve collapse (NVC). NVC is a condition which causes
      narrowness and weakness in the nostril which results in nasal obstruction. Implants will be
      placed in the affected nostril(s). The implants are intended to restore the shape and
      stabilize the nasal wall to prevent nasal valve collapse and improve the symptoms associated
      with nasal obstruction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The effects of PET implants on external NVC and cosmetic contour deformity will be evaluated
      in an open-label, prospective study. Subjects for this clinical study will be recruited and
      screened from clinic office visits and patient records at each principal investigator's site
      as well as through an investigational review board (IRB)-approved general advertisement.
      Those patients that continue to qualify after either screening process will be seen and
      evaluated by one of the clinical investigators prior to enrollment in the study. Subjects
      must meet criteria for the diagnosis of external nasal valve collapse as a stand alone
      abnormality (i.e., symptoms of obstruction cannot be caused primarily by other factors).
      Other contributing factors to the nasal obstruction must be ruled out and/or treated, without
      relief before enrollment in this study. No other surgeries or procedures will be allowed
      during the study that could influence the evaluation of implants on the treatment of nasal
      valve collapse and cosmetic contour deformity. All subjects will be required to sign an IRB
      approved informed consent prior to entry into the study.

      After meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria and completing the pre-implant evaluations,
      subjects will be scheduled for treatment with the polyethylene terephthalate implants. The
      implant procedure will be performed by facial plastic physicians. All investigative sites
      will be required to undergo training to standardize the methodology of implant technique and
      administration of evaluation techniques (questionnaires, scales, photographic assessments,
      etc.). Target sample size for the study will be 72 subjects.

      Follow up evaluations for all outcome measures will occur at 1, 6, and 12 weeks after
      implantation. Long-term follow-up for adverse events will be conducted at 11 months or later
      after implantation.

    <description>Functional improvement was defined as a subject who achieves both 1) an improvement in the physical condition of the collapsed nasal valve as evidenced by an increase of &gt;= 10% in the change in volume during inspiration as measured by Vectra 3D photography from baseline to 12 weeks post-procedure; and 2) a reduction of at least 30% in the symptoms of nasal obstruction as measured by the Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation Scale (NOSE) scale (5 questions with 0-4 scale from &quot;Not a problem&quot; to &quot;Severe problem,&quot; possible score 0-100 via raw score × 5) from baseline to 12 weeks post-procedure.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cosmetic Improvement</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks after implantation</time_frame>
    <description>An independent clinician will review Vectra 3D photographs of each subject at baseline and at 12 weeks post-procedure to assess physical appearance of the external nasal wall. The clinician will be asked to determine which photographs are pre-treatment and which are post-treatment in the correct order. The clinician will then rate the photograph chosen as post-treatment using the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS; relative scale from &quot;Worse&quot; to &quot;Very much improved&quot;). If the post-treatment photograph was not correctly identified, that procedure will receive a &quot;worse&quot; on the rating scale.</description>

            <groups_desc>This study had two independent primary endpoints (cosmetic and functional improvement). Therefore, the assumed type I error rate for each was 2.5% in order to maintain an overall 5% type I error rate. For each endpoint, the percent of subjects with improvement of the total number implanted was to be compared to a rate of 50% using a one-sided, binomial exact test. If the p-value was &lt; 0.025, the objective would have been met.</groups_desc>

        <description>An independent clinician will review Vectra 3D photographs of each subject at baseline and at 12 weeks post-procedure to assess physical appearance of the external nasal wall. The clinician will be asked to determine which photographs are pre-treatment and which are post-treatment in the correct order. The clinician will then rate the photograph chosen as post-treatment using the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS; relative scale from &quot;Worse&quot; to &quot;Very much improved&quot;). If the post-treatment photograph was not correctly identified, that procedure will receive a “worse” on the rating scale.</description>
