    <textblock>
      Presently, effectiveness of treatments for CF lung disease is judged by improvement in lung
      function (FEV1). However, in CF patients, FEV1 can range from severely decreased to normal,
      and improvements may occur slowly. Thus, clinical trials require many patients over prolonged
      periods to evaluate medications. As the pace of drug development accelerates, it is no longer
      possible to test all of the promising candidate therapies using conventional study designs. A
      sensitive technique for assessing lung inflammation has been developed which uses the
      expression of genes located in circulating blood cells. Mononuclear cells pass repeatedly
      through the blood vessels of the lung, and are exposed to many of the inflammatory products
      that are present in the airways. Over the past 4 years the investigators have identified a
      small group of candidate genes that are unregulated or downregulated in response to
      antibiotic treatment. The investigators now propose to prospectively test this method of
      quantifying lung inflammation in a large group of CF patients undergoing treatment of
      pulmonary exacerbations. Blood will be sampled before and after antibiotic treatment for a
      pulmonary exacerbation, and the relative change in gene expression will be compared to
      improvement in FEV1 and other clinical responses, to determine the utility of this method for
      use in studies. If successful, this technique could allow for a rapid and noninvasive method
      to gauge immediate effects by new treatments, and assist caregivers in determining optimal
      treatment strategies for the individual.

        CF patients followed by the Adult CF Program at National Jewish Health, who are â‰¥ 18 years
        and present with signs and symptoms of an acute pulmonary exacerbation. All subjects will
        be treated with at least two pathogen specific I.V. antibiotics for a minimum of 10 days,
        along with standard guidelines for other aspects of care for an acute pulmonary
        exacerbation. Concomitant use of inhaled antibiotics and systemic steroids will be allowed,
        and typical co-infections or co-morbidities will not result in exclusion.
