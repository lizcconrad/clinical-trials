  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose-ranging clinical study to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and tolerability
      of 3 different doses of immunoselected, culture expanded, nucleated, allogeneic MPCs in
      subjects who have cardiomyopathy of both ischemic and idiopathic etiology.

      Heart failure subjects recruited will include those who have advanced heart failure NYHA (New
      York Heart Association) class II to IV and a depressed ejection fraction (EF &lt; 40%). Baseline
      eligibility testing assessments will be completed within 28 days prior to cell delivery.
      Efficacy will be explored at 3, 6, and 12 months.

      This will be a single-blinded, dose-escalation, cohort study in 60 subjects allocated
      sequentially to 1 of 3 cohorts A, B, or C. Forty-five subjects will be randomized to receive
      transendocardial delivery of MPC treatment, and 15 subjects will be randomized to receive
      standard-of-care treatment without MPC administration. The fifteen subjects randomized to
      receive standard of care without needle injection will serve as the study's control
      population and will undergo mock mapping and verbal injection scripts.
