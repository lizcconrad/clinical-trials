      Pomegranate juice (PJ) consumption by hemodialysis patients will reduce the oxidative stress
      and the incidence of infections, cardiovascular events and mortality.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The mortality rate in patients with end stage renal failure is substantially higher than in
      the general population, and deaths are mainly attributable to cardiovascular diseases and
      infections. There is accumulating evidence that supports the role for oxidative stress in
      damaging the immune system and in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases in hemodialysis
      patients, therefore antioxidative treatment, which will reduce oxidative stress, may be
      beneficial.

      Pomegranate juice contains antioxidants such as soluble polyphenols, tannins and anthocyanins
      and was shown to have anti-inflammatory, anti- bacterial and anti-atherosclerotic properties
      in mice and humans. However,the effects of pomegranate juice on oxidative stress, infections
      and cardiovascular events in hemodialysis patients are still not documented.

      This is a randomized preventive intervention trial on hemodialysis patients from one dialysis
      centre in Israel. The patients will be enrolled and randomized to receive pomegranate juice
      or placebo. Patients will be followed for one year. The objective of this study is to
      investigate the effects of pomegranate juice (PJ) consumption by hemodialysis patients on the
      changes in oxidative stress and the incidence of infections, cardiovascular events and
      mortality.
