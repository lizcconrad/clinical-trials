  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a blood clot and is a common illness that can result in pain
      and death if not recognized and treated well. Death can occur when the venous clots break off
      and form pulmonary emboli (PE), which can block the arteries of the lungs. DVT and PE most
      often complicate the course of sick patients but may also affect healthy persons. DVT can
      also be a chronic disease. In those instances in which DVT and PE develop, in addition to the
      death risk, hospitalization is drawn out and healthcare costs are increased. Therefore, the
      purpose of this study is to see if we can use ultrasound imaging to determine the type of
      clots in patients to help better manage their care.
