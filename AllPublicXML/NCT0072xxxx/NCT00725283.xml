  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to evaluate the safety of a WT1 Antigen-Specific Cancer
      Immunotherapeutic (WT1 ASCI) as post-consolidation therapy in adult patients with
      WT1-positive Acute Myeloid Leukemia in first complete remission. It will also be analyzed to
      what extent this treatment induces an immune response, specific to the malignancy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, patients were to receive a maximum of 24 doses of WT1 ASCI according four
      cycles over a period of four years.

      This protocol summary has been updated according to the Protocol Amendment 6 (dated 10 Sept
      2014).

      There will no longer be an active follow-up of patients after discontinuation or completion
      of the treatment. The study will end 30 days after the last dose will be administered, so the
      patients will not be further exposed to unnecessary study related procedures.. In addition,
      no more biological samples will be collected for protocol research purposes. For each
      biological sample already collected in the scope of this study and not tested yet, testing
      will not be performed by default, except if a scientific rationale remains relevant. Blood
      sampling for safety monitoring as per protocol will continue.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has cytologically proven AML, as defined by the WHO classification. The
             pretreatment AML karyotype should be documented.

          -  The leukemia could be a de novo or secondary AML.

          -  The patient received induction and consolidation therapy according to the
             Institution's standard of care.

          -  The patient's blasts cells show expression of WT1 tran-script, detected by
             quantitative RT-PCR.

          -  The patient is in complete remission (i.e. CR1, CR2, …):

          -  Written informed consent has been obtained prior to the performance of any
             protocol-specific procedure.

          -  The patient is &gt;= 18 years of age at the time of signature of the informed consent
             form.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0, 1 or 2.

          -  Adequate hepatic and renal function defined as:

               -  Serum bilirubin &lt; 1.5 times the Upper Limit of Nor-mal (ULN).

               -  Serum alanine aminotransferase &lt; 2.5 times the ULN.

               -  Calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 50 mL/min.

          -  If the patient is female, she must be of non-childbearing potential, i.e. have a
             current tubal ligation, hysterectomy, ovariectomy or be post-menopausal, or if she is
             of childbearing potential, she must practice adequate con-traception for 30 days prior
             to treatment administration, have a negative pregnancy test and continue such
             pre-cautions for two months after completion of the treatment administration series.

          -  In the view of the investigator, the patient can and will comply with the requirements
             of the protocol.
