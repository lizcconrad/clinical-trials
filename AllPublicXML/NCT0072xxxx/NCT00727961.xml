    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate efficacy and tolerability, and number of positive
      response to treatment with CAELYX (50 mg/m^2), administered as monotherapy once per 4 weeks
      to patients with metastatic epithelial ovarian cancer, resistant to previous platinum
      therapy.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Complete Response</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks after chemotherapy completed</time_frame>
    <description>Complete response was defined as complete disappearance of all measurable and assessable disease with no new disease or disease-related symptoms as measured by chest x-ray, computed tomography scan, and magnetic resonance imaging.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Partial Response</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks after chemotherapy completed</time_frame>
    <description>Required 50 percent or greater decrease in sum of products of all bidimensionally measurable lesions without progression of assessable disease and no new lesions as measured by chest x-ray, computed tomography scan, and magnetic resonance imaging.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Stabilization</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks after chemotherapy completed</time_frame>
    <description>All other subjects (except complete or partial responders and those with progression [see prior definitions]) were classified as stable disease as measured by chest x-ray, computed tomography scan, and magnetic resonance imaging.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Progression</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks after chemotherapy completed</time_frame>
    <description>Progressive disease was defined as 25% or greater increase in the size of measurable lesion. The reappearance of any lesion or clear worsening of assessable disease or the appearance of any new lesion was also considered as progressive disease as measured by chest x-ray, computed tomography scan, and magnetic resonance imaging.</description>

    <description>Time to the occurence of partial effect achievement as measured by chest x-ray, computed tomography scan, and magnetic resonance imaging.
Partial response required a 50 percent or greater decrease in the sum of the products of all bidimensionally measurable lesions without progression of any assessable disease and no new lesions.</description>

    <measure>Median Time to Progression</measure>

    <description>Median time to the occurence of progression. Progression was defined as 25 percent or greater increase size of measurable lesion. Reappearance of lesion, worsening of assessable disease or appearance new lesions were considered progression as measured by chest x-ray, computed tomography scan, and magnetic resonance imaging.</description>
