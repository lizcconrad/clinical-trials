          -  Non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal
             ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous
             amenorrhea

          -  Able to swallow and retain oral medication

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A subject will not be eligible for inclusion in this study if any of the following
             criteria apply:

          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular or other heart disease, glaucoma,
             diabetes, hepatic, neurologic (e.g. including but not limited to seizures, stroke,
             cerebrovascular disease or other brain conditions), or allergic disease (except for
             untreated, asymptomatic, seasonal allergies at time of dosing).

          -  Psychiatric illness currently or within the past year, or any lifetime history of

             abuse/dependence).

          -  Subjects who, in the investigator's judgment, pose a suicidal or homicidal risk, or
             any subject with a history of suicidal or homicidal attempts or behaviour.

          -  The subject has a positive pre-study drug/alcohol screen. A minimum list of drugs that
             will be screened for include amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, opiates,
             cannabinoids and benzodiazepines.

          -  A positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody
             result within 3 months of screening (with the exception of phase I hepatic impairment
             studies, oncology studies, hepatitis, hepatic fibrosis, or HIV studies).

          -  A positive test for HIV antibody.

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as:

          -  an average weekly intake of greater than 21 units or an average daily intake of
             greater than 3 units (males), or defined as an average weekly intake of greater than
             14 units or an average daily intake of greater than 2 units (females). One unit is
             equivalent to a half-pint (220mL) of beer or 1 (25ml) measure of spirits or 1 glass

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 60 days i.e. 5 half-lives.

          -  Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first
             dosing day.

          -  Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary
             supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a
             potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first
             dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical
             Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise
             subject safety.

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period.

          -  Pregnant females as determined by positive serum or urine hCG test at screening or
             prior to dosing.

          -  Lactating females.

          -  Administration of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) within 30 days prior to Study

          -  Controlled or uncontrolled hypertension, or systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg or
             diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg at screening or prior to the first dose of study
