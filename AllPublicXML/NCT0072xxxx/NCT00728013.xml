  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In summary, the CHILLAS study will be the first multicenter study performed in a Chinese
      population using a patient-level analysis to compare the effects and safety of intensive
      statin therapy with that of moderate statin therapy. Therefore, it will determine whether
      &quot;lower is better&quot;, that is, whether LDL cholesterol lowering to a level of approximately
      100mg/dl provides a benefit inferior to that of LDL cholesterol lowering to a much lower
      level; examine the role of inflammatory markers in predicting cardiac events and response to
      statin therapy; and evaluate the effects of statin therapy on regression of coronary
      atherosclerosis using IVUS.

      The CHILLAS study is planned to evaluate whether intensive treatment with statins for 2 years
      results in a reduction of cardiovascular events in patients with ACS. A total of 1,600
      patients will be randomly assigned to receive intensive statin therapy (atorvastatin, 20 or
      40 mg/d, or equivalent dose of other statins) or moderate therapy (atorvastatin, 10 mg/d, or
      equivalent dose of other statins). Both groups receive dietary counseling. Over a 2-year
      follow-up period, the primary outcome measure is the time to occurrence of cardiac death,
      nonfatal acute myocardial infarction, revascularization with either percutaneous coronary
      intervention or coronary-artery bypass grafting, documented unstable angina or severe heart
      failure requiring emergency hospitalization, and stroke. The planned duration is between
      December 2006 and December 2009.
