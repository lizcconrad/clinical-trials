    <textblock>
      This project is designed to evaluate a statewide, hospital-based parent education program to
      prevent abusive head trauma (AHT) in Pennsylvania, and investigate the additional
      effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of &quot;booster&quot; sessions of parent education delivered to
      parents at primary care provider offices in central Pennsylvania.

      Specific Aims:

        1. Assess the effectiveness of an established statewide program of hospital-based postnatal
           parent education about violent infant shaking, provided at a single consistent point in
           time between the infant's birth and hospital discharge, in reducing the incidence of
           AHT.

        2. Identify which component(s) are the most important mediators of the intervention's
           effectiveness; determine whether the intervention effect is more directly related to
           changes in perpetrator or caregiver behavior; and determine the effectiveness of the
           intervention among various socioeconomic groups.

        3. Determine the cost effectiveness of the hospital-based program.

        4. Establish the feasibility, additional costs, and effectiveness of a combined program of
           repeated exposure delivered both post-natally in the hospital and during follow up 2-,
           4- and 6-month outpatient health maintenance visits with the pediatric care provider.

    <textblock>
      Upon the birth of the child, all parents (mothers, and whenever possible, fathers or father
      figures) will be asked to read written materials and view an 8-minute video on the dangers of
      violent infant shaking. Parents will be asked to voluntarily sign a commitment statement
      affirming their receipt and understanding of the materials; these commitment statements will
      be sent to the Principal Investigator. A random subset of parent participants will be asked
      to voluntarily answer a short questionnaire about their impressions of the materials. In
      addition, 31 counties in central Pennsylvania will be randomly divided into two groups. In 15
      counties, the hospital-based intervention will remain as described above. In the other 16
      counties, all primary care providers having offices in those counties will be asked to
      provide all parents of newborns at the 2-, 4-, and 6-month immunization visits another set of
      written materials about violent infant shaking and voluntarily sign a response form that they
      read and understood the materials. Participating parents in this group will also be asked if
      they would be willing to complete a short telephone survey when the infant is 7 months old
      (and if so, asked to provide a telephone number). The telephone survey asks questions about
      the intervention materials and parents' perception of the information, and seeks to determine
      the mediators of a program effect. An invitation letter will be sent to a control group of
      parents who do not receive the office-based intervention to ask if they would be willing to
      complete the short telephone survey when their infant is 7 months old.

    <description>All of Central PA new parents will receive the state-wide hospital-based intervention. In half of the 31 central PA counties, all primary care providers having offices in those counties provide an office-based booster intervention to new parents. The other half of central PA counties will receive the state-wide, hospital-based intervention, but not the office-based booster intervention.</description>

    <description>Upon the birth of the child in a Pennsylvania hospital, all parents (mothers, and whenever possible, fathers or father figures) will be asked to read written materials and view an 8-minute video on the dangers of violent infant shaking. Parent education materials contain four key messages: crying is a normal infant behavior, how to keep calm when an infant is crying, how to help calm a crying infant, how to select other caregivers for your infant. Parents will be asked to voluntarily sign a commitment statement affirming their receipt and understanding of the materials.</description>
