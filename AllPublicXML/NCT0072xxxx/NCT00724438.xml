  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prior studies examining the pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of the new
      etonogestrel-containing single rod implantable contraceptive device, Implanon, did not
      include women who exceeded 130% of ideal body weight. Yet, as these women comprise a
      significant portion of the U.S. population, studies of Implanon in obese women are essential.
      The proposed study represents an important first step in addressing the lack of data on
      Implanon in obese women. We aim to examine the pharmacokinetics of Implanon in obese women
      during the first 6 months of use and to provide data on the acceptability, side effect
      profile, and ease of insertion, palpation, and removal in these women. We also aim to collect
      samples for future validation studies of the use of the blood spot (finger-stick blood sample
      on filter paper) as a method of determining plasma etonogestrel.
