  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use cone-beam CT scans to more accurately position the tumor
      during radiation and to see whether this method is more effective than the standard method of
      using 2D images (portal images), which is a type of X-ray. Cone-beam CT is a type of CT
      scanner attached to the treatment accelerator that produces 3D images of the patient.

      The ability to eliminate the tumor with radiation depends in part on the accuracy of
      delivering the radiation to the lung. The position of the tumor changes because of normal
      breathing. Therefore, we want to improve the accuracy of the way the radiation is delivered
      to the tumor. With cone-beam CT scans taken before and during your treatment, we will be able
      to determine the location of the tumor with 3D images, measure how much the tumor moves as
      you breathe, and then position you so that the tumor will get the best delivery of radiation.

    <description>You will have the following CT scans along with the standard weekly portal images:Before treatment you will have a CT scan (a respiratory-correlated CT scan) at the time of the radiation planning, or simulation planning.During the first week of treatment - you will have 5 cone-beam CT scans at days 1 through 5 of your radiation treatment schedule.
During the remaining weeks of treatment - you will have a cone-beam CT scan every week. Depending on the number of treatments that your study doctor has prescribed for you, the number of weekly scans can be between 3 and 7.
For all scans, an external monitor will be used to record your breathing.
If needed, you will be repositioned by adjusting the radiation machine's treatment couch position.</description>
