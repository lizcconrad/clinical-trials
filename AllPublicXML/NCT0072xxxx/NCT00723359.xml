          -  Age ≥ 18 years

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (Zubrod) ≤ 2

          -  Normal organ and marrow function

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 3 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin
             C)prior to day 1 or those who have not recovered from AEs due to agents administered
             more than 3 weeks earlier

          -  Treatment with another investigational agent during the study or within 4 weeks before
             day 1

          -  Major surgery within 4 weeks before day 1 (this does not include placement of vascular
             access device or tumor biopsies)

          -  Antineoplastic therapy with biological agents within 2 weeks before day 1

          -  HAHAs, HACAs, or HAMAs in response to previous MAb therapy

          -  Previous participation in this study

          -  Clinically relevant active infection including active hepatitis B or C or human
             immunodeficiency virus (HBV, HCV, or HIV) or any other concurrent disease which,in the
             judgment of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for enrollment into
             this study

          -  Acute or relevant abnormalities in electrocardiogram (ECG), as judged by the
             Investigator

             day 1), unstable angina, uncontrolled congestive heart failure, uncontrolled
             hypertension, (recurrent or persistent increases in systolic blood pressure ≥ 180 mm
             Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 110 mm Hg), uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmias, grade 3

             reactions if needed)

          -  Concomitant antineoplastic therapies including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or
             biological agents during the study

          -  Any condition, including laboratory abnormalities, that in the opinion of the
             Investigator places the subject at unacceptable risk if he or she are included in the
             study

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding

          -  Unwillingness to use an effective contraceptive method during the study and at least 3
