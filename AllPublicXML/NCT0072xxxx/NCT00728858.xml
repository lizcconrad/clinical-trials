  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nifedipine and barnidipine act as calcium channel blockers, and are widely prescribed for
      pressure control of prehypertension and stage 1 hypertension.

      CYP3A4 is responsible for the metabolism of nifedipine and nifedipine, while the contribution
      of CYP3A5 remains ambiguous. This study is aimed to analyze the association between
      antihypertensive effects of nifedipine as well as barnidipine and single nucleotide
      polymorphisms of CYP3A4, CYP3A5 and calcium channels.

      For each drug, 20 patients will be enrolled. Patients' blood pressure and heart rates will be
      measured at first visit, followed by visits at week4 , week 8 and week 12. Blood samples will
      be drawn at week 4 and week 12 for following analyses of drug plasma concentrations. SNPs in
      CYP3A4, CYP3A5 and calcium channel v 1.2 will be genotyped using SNPstream.

      The differences in the decrease of blood pressures and the durg plasma concentrations between
      genotypes will be analyzed.
