    <textblock>
      The primary aims of this study are to identify and characterize the immediate consequences of
      patients who fail fluconazole treatment during the treatment of severe infection, and to
      determine if fluconazole failures are more frequently associated with fluconazole-resistant
      or fluconazole-susceptible strains of C. albicans.

      The primary aims of this study are to identify and characterize the immediate consequences of
      patients who fail fluconazole treatment during the treatment of severe infection, and to
      determine if fluconazole failures are more frequently associated with fluconazole-resistant
      or fluconazole-susceptible strains of C. albicans (i.e. does in vitro resistance matter?).
      Perhaps the breakpoints are not correct and need to be changed, as has recently happened with
      vancomycin.

      A third objective is to calculate fluconazole PK/PD parameters such as AUIC, and compare the
      calculated AUIC values of patients who fail with fluconazole-susceptible vs
      fluconazole-resistant isolates. Specifically for fluconazole, the question here is whether
      dose matters, and can aggressive dosing offset higher MICs. Thus in all cases, we will also
      determine the AUIC of fluconazole in order to fully characterize the impact of dose chosen on
      the outcomes of treated patients who fail to respond to fluconazole. The clinical,
      microbiological, and pharmacoeconomic outcomes of patients who fail fluconazole therapy and
      are subsequently hospitalized with severe infections caused by C. albicans will be documented
      and described.

        This is a multi-center study of adult and pediatric patients hospitalized with severe
        infection caused by C. albicans. An announcement of this case series collection study will
        be sent to our ongoing list of primary care practitioners, hospitalists, specialists in
        infectious diseases, pulmonologists, clinical pharmacists, and other investigators
        throughout the USA.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Medical history, clinical signs and symptoms, and radiological findings consistent
             with severe C. albicans infection. For example, the criteria for pneumonia are as
             follows:

               1. A core body temperature &gt;38C [100.4F] or &lt;36.1 C [97oF] or leukocytosis (blood
                  leukocyte count &gt;10,000 cells/mm3) or bandemia (&gt;10% bands).

               2. Chest radiographic examination that shows a new or progressive infiltrate,
                  consolidation, cavitation, or pleural effusion.

               3. Rales, dullness to percussion, or decreased breath sounds on physical examination
                  of the chest, new onset of purulent sputum, or change in character of sputum.

          2. A positive culture must demonstrate the presence of C. albicans, isolated from a
             properly obtained respiratory or blood sample, collected within 72 hours of admission
             to a hospital. All patients with respiratory cultures must produce sputum with Gram
             stain analysis indicating the relative absence of contaminating oropharyngeal squamous
             cells and the presence of a significant number of WBCs and morphologically distinct
             bacteria. Fluconazole sensitivity testing results must be available for the initial C.
             albicans isolate.

          3. Must have received, and failed to respond to, at least 4 days of treatment with
             fluconazole.

        4. Admitted to a hospital or ICU for treatment of a severe infection.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant or lactating women

          2. Cystic fibrosis

          3. Life expectancy &lt;3 months from underlying disease

          4. Underlying lung carcinoma
