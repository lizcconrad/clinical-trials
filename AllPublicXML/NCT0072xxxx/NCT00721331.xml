    <textblock>
      This will be a phase I, single center, randomized, vehicle-controlled, blinded study
      comparing two dosage strengths of CRx-197 cream, nortriptyline, an active comparator (0.1%
      mometasone) and placebo (the active ingredient free vehicle cream of CRx-197)in healthy
      volunteers.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject must voluntarily sign and date the written Informed Consent prior to any study
             specific procedures

          -  Subject must be 18 to 60 years of age

          -  Subject must have healthy skin on which reddening can be easily recognized in the area
             where they will place the test fields

          -  Subject must be free from a condition/disease that the investigator feels interferes
             with the interpretation of the study results.

          -  Females of childbearing potential should either be surgically sterile (hysterectomy or
             tubal ligation), or should use a highly effective medically accepted contraceptive
             regimen. A highly effective method of birth control is defined as those which result
             in a lower failure rate (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and
             correctly such as implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some
             intrauterine devices (IUDs), sexual abstinence or vasectomised partner.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Suntan, hyper- or hypo-pigmentation, or tattoos in the area where they will place the
             test fields

          -  Dark skinned persons whose skin color prevents ready assessment of skin reactions

          -  Cardiac disease, including recent myocardial infarction, any degree of heart block or
             other cardiac arrhythmias and valvular heart disease

          -  Mania

          -  Narrow angle glaucoma

          -  Hyperthyroidism by medical history, TSH less than LLN, or subject receiving any
             thyroid medication

          -  Severe liver disease - ALT laboratory value that exceeds 1.5x ULN

          -  Inflammatory dermatoses (e.g., atopic dermatoses/eczema, psoriasis)

          -  Any skin condition involving the test fields including but not limited to bacterial,
             viral, or fungal skin infections, acne, rosacea

          -  Active varicella, tuberculosis, syphilis or post-vaccine reactions

          -  Autoimmune disease (e.g., lupus erythematosis)

          -  Known allergic reactions or hypersensitivity to any of the components of the study
             treatments

          -  Allergy to adhesives on the patches used for occlusion in the study

          -  UV therapy or significant UV exposure in the four weeks before treatment application

          -  History of malignancy (except for treated or excised basal cell carcinoma)

             application that may influence the outcome of the study

          -  Positive for HIV antibody

          -  Systemic treatments in the four weeks prior to treatment application that may interact
             with any of the study drugs, such as: Glucocorticoids, MAO inhibitors,
             anti-depressants, anti-seizure medications, anti-psychotics and anti-histamines

          -  Subjects who require medications that inhibit the CYP450 2D6 pathway such
             as:Quinidine, Cimetidine, Type 1 anti-arrhythmic, Phenothiazines, Selective serotonin
             reuptake inhibitors, Reserpine, other anticholinergic drugs, and sympathomimetic drugs

          -  Treatment with any investigational agent within one month before treatment application
             for this trial

          -  Female subject who is pregnant , lactating, or with a positive pregnancy test

          -  Unwilling or unable to comply with the requirements of this protocol, including the
