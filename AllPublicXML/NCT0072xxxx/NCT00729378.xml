  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Jump-In study will prospectively assess the effects of impact exercise on skeletal
      development in young girls, including bone mass, bone mineral density, and bone geometry. We
      hypothesize that girls who regularly participate in impact loading exercise will accrue
      greater skeletal mass, increase bone density and undergo structural adaptations that in
      combination will improve bone strength compared to girls who do not participate in impact
      exercise.

    <textblock>
      Jump-In is a school-based, block-randomized, trial of the effects of impact-loading exercise
      on skeletal development in prepubescent and early pubescent girls. Fourth (n=~200) and sixth
      (n=~200) grade girls in 14 Tucson (Arizona) schools with no contraindication to physical
      exercise will be enrolled. Girls in intervention schools will participate in impact
      activities 3 times per week at school, progressively increasing the number (up to 40) of
      jumps and their height (from 6 inches to 18 inches per repetition) over the initial 2 months.
      Thereafter, new activities will be introduced approximately every 2-3 months to maintain
      interest and motivation, and continually stress the skeleton in novel ways, over 2 years of
      intervention. Physical and behavioral assessments will be done in both intervention and
      control groups at baseline, end of the initial school year, and yearly thereafter for 5
      years. Assessments include height and weight, selected skeletal lengths, fat, lean soft
      tissue, bone mineral content and areal density from dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA),
      and bone geometry (e.g., cortical thickness, periosteal circumference and cortical and
      trabecular density) and muscle area from peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT).
      Also, maturation will be assessed via the Tanner Stage (self-assessment against standardized
      drawings of stages of physical development), diet from the Harvard Youth Food Frequency
      Questionnaire, and physical activity using pedometers and standardized questionnaires. We
      hypothesize that girls in intervention schools will demonstrate enhanced skeletal
      development, including greater mineral mass and density, and enhanced bone geometry, leading
      to greater bone strength compared to girls in control schools. We further hypothesize that
      younger (Tanner Stage 1) girls will experience greater adaptations than older girls (Tanner 2
      and 3), and that positive adaptations will be maintained throughout the 3-year follow-up
      period.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Recruitment was performed for three years (2007-2009) in a total of 16 elementary and middle schools (9 intervention and 7 control) in two Tucson, Arizona area school districts. Recruitment consisted of attending back to school days and holding recruitment assemblies before or after school.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Intervention and control schools designated prior to recruiting. Schools were selected based on size, demographics, and student flow from elementary to middle school to prevent contamination. 739 participants completed informed consent process (agreed to participate); only 509 scheduled measurement appointments and completed study measurements.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Exercise Intervention</title>
          <description>Subjects in the exercise intervention arm performed activities designed to provide skeletal loading: impact activities, 3 times per week, increasing the number of jumps (up to 40) and increasing height (from 6 inches to 24 inches per repetition) over the initial 8-weeks (2 months). New activities were introduced approximately every 2-3 months in order to continually stress the skeleton over 2 years.
Physical activity performed by these subjects (in addition to intervention activities) was objectively assessed by pedometer (7-day wear period) and further assessed by a validated past year physical activity questionnaire PYPAQ).</description>

New activities were introduced approximately every 2-3 months in order to continually stress the skeleton over 2 years.
Physical activity performed by these subjects (in addition to intervention activities) was objectively assessed by pedometer (7-day wear period) and further assessed by a validated past year physical activity questionnaire PYPAQ).</description>

        <title>Baseline Bone Strength Index at the Femur 4% Site</title>
        <description>Baseline (initial) measurement of bone strength index (BSI) at the femur 4% site. Bone Strength Index (BSI) is a measurement of the resistance to compression forces at the epiphyses of long bones. Measurement made by pQCT at a distance of 4% of total tibia length from the distal growth plate. Measurement units: mm^4.</description>

New activities were introduced approximately every 2-3 months in order to continually stress the skeleton over 2 years.
Physical activity performed by these subjects (in addition to intervention activities) was objectively assessed by pedometer (7-day wear period) and further assessed by a validated past year physical activity questionnaire PYPAQ).</description>

        <title>Baseline Stress-Strain Index at the Femur 20% Site</title>
        <description>Baseline (initial) measurement of stress-strain index at the femur 20% site. Stress-strain index (also called strength-strain index and stress-strength index in the literature) is a measure of the resistance to torsional and bending forces at diaphyseal sites of long bones. Measurement made by pQCT at a distance of 20% of total femur length from the distal growth plate. Measurement units: mm^3.</description>

        <description>Baseline to 12-month change in strength-strain index at the tibia 50% site. Stress-strain index (also called strength-strain index and stress-strength index in the literature) is a measure of the resistance to torsional and bending forces at diaphyseal sites of long bones. Measurement made by pQCT at a distance of 50% of total tibia length from the distal growth plate. Measurement units: mm^3.</description>

        <title>24-month Change in Stress-Strain Index at the Tibia 50% Site</title>
        <description>Baseline to 24-month change in strength-strain index at the tibia 50% site. Stress-strain index (also called strength-strain index and stress-strength index in the literature) is a measure of the resistance to torsional and bending forces at diaphyseal sites of long bones. Measurement made by pQCT at a distance of 50% of total tibia length from the distal growth plate. Measurement units: mm^3.</description>

            <title>Exercise Intervention</title>
            <description>Participants randomized to the exercise intervention group performed activities designed to provide skeletal loading: impact activities 3 times per week, increasing the number of jumps (up to 40) and increasing height (from 6 inches to 24 inches per repetition) over the initial 8-weeks (2 months). New activities were introduced approximately every 2-3 months in order to continually stress the skeleton over 2 years.
Physical activity performed by these subjects (in addition to intervention activities) was objectively assessed by pedometer (7-day wear period) and further assessed by a validated past year physical activity questionnaire PYPAQ).</description>

        <description>Baseline to 24-month change in strength-strain index at the tibia 66% site. Stress-strain index (also called strength-strain index and stress-strength index in the literature) is a measure of the resistance to torsional and bending forces at diaphyseal sites of long bones. Measurement made by pQCT at a distance of 66% of total tibia length from the distal growth plate. Measurement units: mm^3.</description>
