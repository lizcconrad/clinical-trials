  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite rising smoker rates, particularly in girls and young women, only few studies have
      focused on smoking cessation in young smokers. Gynaecologist practices may be an ideal
      setting to proactively intervene with young female smokers. Elevated health risks of smoking
      while using hormonal contraceptives could be a successful approach to gain young women's
      attention on smoking cessation. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of
      a smoking cessation intervention for girls and young women visiting gynaecologist practices
      and using hormonal contraceptives.

      In the randomized controlled trial, female smokers aged 14-25 will be recruited in practices
      of gynaecologists. Intervention within the practice consists of a 30 minutes counseling
      session based on Motivational Interviewing, a standardised physician letter focusing on the
      elevated health risks of smoking while using hormonal contraceptives and a stage-matched
      self-help manual. After four weeks, an expert system feedback letter will be sent. In the
      intervention group, no smoking intervention will be given. Follow-up assessments will be
      conducted after 12 months, including saliva cotinine measures.
