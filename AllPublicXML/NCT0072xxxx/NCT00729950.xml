  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label, multicenter, pharmacokinetic study of MDX-010 in up to 90
      evaluable subjects with surgically unresectable malignant melanoma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Group A: Six to 12 subjects will be treated with transfectoma-derived MDX-010 at 2.8 or 5
      mg/kg/dose, or with hybridoma-derived MDX-010 at 3 mg/kg/dose administered on Days 1, 57, and
      85. The 2.8, 3, and 5 mg/kg dosage cohorts may be initiated concurrently. Additionally, 6
      subjects per cohort will receive single doses of transfectoma-derived MDX-010 at 7.5, 10, 15,
      and 20 mg/kg.

      Dose escalation from the 5 mg/kg cohort to the 7.5 mg/kg cohort will depend on the safety
      profile following a single dose of 5 mg/kg. Once all subjects are enrolled in the 5 mg/kg
      cohort and 4 weeks have elapsed since the sixth subject in the cohort has received the first
      infusion, dose escalation to the 7.5 mg/kg cohort may occur if ≤1 DLT has occurred in the 5
      mg/kg cohort. Dose escalation to the 10 mg/kg cohort may occur 4 weeks after the sixth
      subject in the 7.5 mg/kg/dose cohort has received the first infusion (with ≤1 DLT). Dose
      escalation to the 15 and 20 mg/kg cohorts may occur 4 weeks after the sixth subject in the
      previous cohort has received the first infusion (with ≤1 DLT). Up to six additional subjects
      may be enrolled in the MTD dose cohort or in the 20 mg/kg dose cohort if MTD is not attained.

      Group B: If single-dose administration of MDX-010 at 10 mg/kg is well tolerated (≤1 DLT in
      the cohort in Group A), then an additional 12 to 20 subjects will be enrolled and treated
      with MDX-010 at 10 mg/kg/dose administered on Days 1, 22, 43, and 64.

      Subjects who respond to therapy will be followed until disease progression or a maximum of
      approximately 1 year. Subjects with a response of SD ≥ 3 months, PR, or CR to their initial
      treatment cycle who subsequently relapse may be eligible for retreatment with the same
      regimen or an alternate regimen considered to be more effective at the time of retreatment.

    <description>Subjects will be treated with transfectoma-derived MDX-010 at 2.8 or 5 mg/kg/dose, or with hybridoma-derived MDX-010 at 3 mg/kg/dose administered on Days 1, 57, and 85.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject must have read, understood, and provided written informed consent and
             authorization in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
             Act (HIPAA) afer the nature of the study has been fully explained.

          -  Subject must be at least 18 years of age with a histologic diagnosis of unresectable
             Stage III or IV malignant melanoma (may include mucosal melanoma). Subjects with
             either stable or progressive malignancy will be permitted in the study. Classification
             of stable or progressive disease, to be recorded for all subjects, will be defined by
             the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), as detailed in Appendix 3
             and determined since last melanoma treatment. Subjects must have at least 1 site of
             measurable disease.

          -  At least 4 weeks since treatment (surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, or immuno-
             therapy) for melanoma and recovered from any serious toxicity experienced during
             treatment.

          -  Life expectancy of at least 18 weeks.

                  total bilirubin less than 3.0 mg/dL)

               -  HIV negative

               -  HBsAg negative

               -  anti-HCV nonreactive. If reactive, subject must have a negative HCV RNA
                  qualitative PCR.

               -  Unless definitely attributable to disease.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any prior malignancy except for the following: adequately treated basal or squamous
             cell skin cancer, superficial bladder cancer, carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or any

          -  Pregnant or nursing: it is not known what effect MDX-010 could have on the developing
             immune system of the fetus or infant, therefore, exposure in utero or via breast milk
             will not be allowed.

          -  Any underlying medical condition which, in the opinion of the principal investigator,

             adverse events.

          -  Any concurrent medical condition requiring the use of systemic or topical
             corticosteroids or the use of immunosuppressive agents (e.g. cyclosporine and its
             analog, or chemotherapy agents). All corticosteroid use must have been discontinued at
             least 4 weeks prior to trial entry.

          -  Prior treatment with MDX-010 or any other anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody.

          -  Evidence or history of significant cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic, renal, psychiatric or
             gastrointestinal disease that would make the administration of MDX-010 unsafe.

             completed at least 4 weeks before Screening).
