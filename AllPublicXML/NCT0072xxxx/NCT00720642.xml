    <description>This is the population of patients in whom surgical intervention could possibly be avoided. These patients will be those in whom all imaging evidence (mammographic or sonographic) was removed during the Intact BLES procedure, and in whom a definitive diagnosis of ADH could be made using the pathology assessment criteria outlined in the protocol.</description>

    <description>Patients with a pathology diagnosis of ADH in whom all imaging evidence (mammographic or sonographic) of the target lesion was NOT removed OR in whom a definitive diagnosis of ADH COULD NOT be made by implementing the pathology criteria for evaluation outlined in the protocol AND patients with a diagnosis of DCIS will undergo open surgical excision and will be analyzed separately from the PSAP group.</description>
