  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial will compare the effectiveness of an Iyengar Yoga
      intervention to a Wellness Seminar health education lecture series, for improvements in
      energy, mood and biological functioning in breast cancer survivors with persistent,
      post-treatment fatigue. It is anticipated that the Iyengar Yoga intervention will be feasible
      and acceptable to breast cancer survivors with minimal side effects and that the Yoga
      intervention will be effective in improving fatigue and physical performance.

    <textblock>
      Fatigue is the most common and distressing side effect of cancer treatment and persists
      beyond successful treatment completion in approximately 30% of breast cancer survivors,
      causing serious disruption in quality of life. Behavioral interventions incorporating
      physical activity or relaxation/stress management have demonstrated beneficial effects on
      cancer-related fatigue, although research in cancer survivors is limited. Mind-body
      interventions such as yoga are extremely popular among cancer patients and offer a promising
      alternative to traditional treatments. Research is needed to establish the feasibility and
      efficacy of these interventions in cancer populations, particularly those who are
      experiencing problems with fatigue.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosed with early, resectable breast cancer (Stage I or II)

          -  Completed treatment with surgery, radiation, and/or chemotherapy between 6 months and
             5 years previously

          -  No other cancer in last 5 years, including breast cancer recurrence

          -  Postmenopausal women

          -  Age 40 - 65

          -  Reporting persistent cancer-related fatigue

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence that fatigue is directly related to a medical or psychiatric disorder (e.g.,
             untreated hypothyroidism, diabetes, anemia (defined as hematocrit &lt; 24), chronic
             fatigue syndrome, current major depression, insomnia, sleep apnea, restless leg
             syndrome)

          -  Evidence that fatigue is related to other non-cancer related factors (e.g., shift
             work, recent change in activity or schedule)

          -  Physical problems or conditions that could make yoga unsafe (e.g., serious neck
             injuries, unstable joints; also severe cachexia, dizziness, bone pain, severe nausea,
             etc)

          -  Regular use of medications and/or behavioral therapies that would confound evaluation
             of IY, including regular participation in yoga classes

          -  Presence of medical conditions that involve the immune system and would confound
             immune evaluation (e.g., autoimmune disorder, inflammatory disease)

          -  Use of medications that might confound immune evaluation (e.g., regular use of
             corticosteroids, narcotics, opiates)

          -  Unable to commit to intervention schedule

          -  Body mass index greater than 30 kg/m2

          -  Regular tobacco (defined as daily or near daily) or alcohol use (defined as &gt; 2
             drinks/day)
