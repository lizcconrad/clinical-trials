      This retrospective study evaluates the effectiveness and safety of ezetimibe plus statin or
      ezetimibe plus fenofibrate in dyslipidemic patients that were treated with these dual
      inhibition lipid lowering regimens as part of their normal standard of care. This study
      assesses the percentage of patients who achieve LDL-C target goals and also evaluates the
      patient compliance to treatment.
