  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well umbilical cord blood transplant from a donor works
      in treating patients with hematological cancer. Giving chemotherapy and total-body
      irradiation (TBI) before a donor umbilical cord blood transplant helps stop the growth of
      cancer and abnormal cells and helps stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the
      donor's stem cells. When the healthy stem cells from an unrelated donor, that do not exactly
      match the patient's blood, are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone
      marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes the
      transplanted cells from a donor can make an immune response against the body's normal cells
      (called graft-versus-host disease). Giving cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil before and
      after transplant may stop this from happening.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate probability of one year survival.

      II. Demonstrate equivalent or improved engraftment rates with a non-anti-thymocyte globulin
      (ATG) based conditioning regimen. Patients will be considered graft failure/rejections
      provided they meet any of the criteria listed below:

        -  Absence of 3 consecutive days with neutrophils &gt;= 500/ul combined with host cluster of
           differentiation (CD)3 peripheral blood chimerism &gt;= 50% at day 42

        -  Absence of 3 consecutive days with neutrophils &gt;= 500/ul under any circumstances at day
           55

           5% donor CD3)

        -  Primary autologous count recovery with &lt; 5% donor CD3 peripheral blood chimerism at
           count recovery and without relapse

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Six month non-relapse mortality.

      II. Overall incidence of graft failure/rejection. Patients will be considered graft
      failure/rejections provided they meet any of the criteria listed below:

        -  Absence of 3 consecutive days with neutrophils &gt;= 500/ul combined with host CD3
           peripheral blood chimerism &gt;= 50% at day 42

        -  Absence of 3 consecutive days with neutrophils &gt;= 500/ul under any circumstances at day
           55

           count recovery and without relapse

      III. Kinetics of chimeric reconstitution.

      IV. Incidence of neutrophil engraftment by day 42.

      V. Incidence of platelet engraftment by six months.

      VI. Incidence of grade II-IV and III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) at day 100.

      VII. Incidence of one year chronic GvHD.

      VIII. Incidence of clinically significant infections at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years.

      IX. Probability of one and two year survival.

      X. Incidence of one and two year relapse or disease progression.

      XI. Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC) patients: Kinetics of immune
      reconstitution, with both functional and quantitative assays.

      XII. FHCRC patients: Examination of possible immunologic factors leading to emergence of a
      dominant unit.

      OUTLINE:

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) over 1 hour
      on days -6 to -2 and cyclophosphamide IV over 1-2 hours on day -6. Patients undergo a lower
      dose of total-body irradiation (TBI) on day -1.

      UMBILICAL CORD BLOOD TRANSPLANT: Patients undergo donor umbilical cord blood infusion on day
      0.

      IMMUNOSUPRESSIVE THERAPIES: Patients receive cyclosporine IV over 1 hour every 8-12 hours on
      days -3 to +180 and mycophenolate mofetil IV or orally (PO) every 8 hours on days 0 to +96.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 2 years.

             based on patient specific factors, as long as the following minimum criteria are met:

               -  HLA matching

                    -  Minimum requirement: The CB graft(s) must be matched at a minimum at 4/6
                       HLA-A, B, DRB1 loci with the recipient. Therefore 0-2 mismatches at the A or
                       B or DRB1 loci based on intermediate resolution A, B antigen and DRB1 allele
                       typing for determination of HLA-match is allowed

                    -  HLA-matching determined by high-resolution typing is allowed per
                       institutional guidelines as long as the minimum criteria are met

               -  Selection of two CB units is mandatory when a single cord blood unit does not
                  meet the following criteria:

                    -  Match grade 6/6; TNC Dose &gt;= 2.5 x 10^7/kg

                    -  Match grade 5/6 or 4/6; TNC dose &gt;= 4.0 (+/- 0.5) x 10^7/kg

               -  If two CB units are used, the total cell dose of the combined units must be at
                  least 3.0 x 10^7 TNC per kilogram recipient weight based on pre-cryopreservation
                  numbers, with each CB unit containing a MINIMUM of 1.5 x 10^7 TNC/kg

               -  The minimum recommended CD34/kg cell dose should be 2 x 10^5 CD34/kg, total dose
                  from a single or combined double

               -  The unmanipulated CB unit(s) will be Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed
                  or will be obtained under a separate investigational new drug (IND), such as the
                  National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) Protocol 10-CBA conducted under BB IND-7555
                  or another IND sponsored by (1) a participating institution or (2) an
                  investigator at FHCRC or one of the participating institutions

               -  FHCRC only: Up to 5% of cord blood product, when ready for infusion, may be
                  withheld for research purposes as long as thresholds for infused TNC dose are
                  met; threshold for double unit transplantation is &gt;= 3.0 x 10^7/kg; these
                  products will be used to conduct studies involving the immunobiology of double
                  cord transplantation and kinetics of engraftment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with an available 5-6/6 HLA-A, B, DRB1 matched sibling donor

          -  Pregnancy or breastfeeding

          -  Evidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or known HIV positive
             serology

          -  Uncontrolled viral or bacterial infection at the time of study enrollment

          -  Active or recent (prior 6 month) invasive fungal infection without infectious disease
             (ID) consult and approval

          -  Active central nervous system malignancy

          -  Patients who have received &gt;= 2 cycles of multiagent chemotherapy within the 3 months
             previous to UCBT; patients who have had previous autologous transplant within 12
             months of UCBT are excluded regardless of history of recent treatment

          -  DONOR: Any cord blood units with &lt; 1.5 x 10^7 total nucleated cells per kilogram
             recipient weight

          -  DONOR: Any cord blood units without the full maternal testing and negative results for
             hepatitis A, B, C, HIV, and human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV-1) viruses; any
             additional available virology results on the unit itself will be reviewed but are not
             mandated, complete or always available; cord blood units are presumed to be
             cytomegalovirus (CMV) negative regardless of serologic testing due to passive
             transmission of maternal CMV antibodies
