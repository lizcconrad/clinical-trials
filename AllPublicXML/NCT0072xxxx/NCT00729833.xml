  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is being conducted to determine the maximum tolerated dose, overall safety and
      tolerability profile, and pharmacokinetic profile of CP-751,871 and sunitinib when given in
      combination with advanced solid tumors.

    <textblock>
      The study was closed to enrollment on 14 Jan 2011 and terminated secondary to excessive
      screen failure rate and for business reasons associated with Pfizer's business decision to
      stop development of the figitumumab compound. Safety concerns did not contribute to the
      decision to terminate this clinical trial.

    <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Treatment-emergent AEs are events occurred between first dose of study drug and up to 28 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. If the same participant in a given treatment had more than one occurrence in the same preferred term event category, only the worst CTCAE grade was reported. Severity grades were 0 (no change from normal or reference range), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), 3 (severe), 4 (life-threatening or disabling), and 5 (death).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 15 of every 2 cycles until disease progression up to follow-up (approximately 28 days following the last dose of study drug)</time_frame>
    <description>Objective response (OR) was based on assessment of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) according to RECIST. CR was the complete disappearance of all target and non-target disease, no new lesions, or the normalization of markers (if markers were being followed). PR was greater than or equal to 30% decrease under baseline of the sum of longest diameters of all target measurable lesions, no unequivocal progression of non-target disease, no new lesions, or no reappearance of lesions after a CR. Confirmed responses are those that persist on repeat imaging study ≥4 weeks after initial documentation of response.</description>

        <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Treatment-emergent AEs are events occurred between first dose of study drug and up to 28 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. If the same participant in a given treatment had more than one occurrence in the same preferred term event category, only the worst CTCAE grade was reported.
