  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is nonrecognition by the medical team of pain in maltreated
      children. These children would have a particular painful behaviour, &quot;quiet&quot;. The management
      of their pain would be then unsuited, which could explain their complex relation with the
      pain in the adulthood. A pilot study realized in the CHU of Nantes on 11 files of maltreated
      children showed that they had very low scores of evaluation of the pain, in spite of severe
      traumatisms. There is, at the moment, no data in the literature on the acute pain of the
      maltreated children.
