      This study will determine the best location to biopsy the gastrointestinal (GI) tract for
      early and accurate diagnosis of GI graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD). (A biopsy is the
      surgical removal of a small piece of tissue for examination under the microscope.) GVHD is a
      life-threatening complication of stem cell transplantation in which the donor s immune cells
      destroy the patient s healthy tissues. It most commonly affects the skin, liver and GI tract.
      This study will establish where to best biopsy tissue from the GI tract and study the tissue
      to try to explore how GI GVD occurs and how it may be possible to better diagnose and treat
      it.

      Patients 18 years of age and older who have undergone or are who will undergo stem cell
      transplantation and who are at high risk for developing GI GVHD may be eligible for this
      study. Participants may enter the study before the transplant procedure or later if they
      develop GVHD symptoms.

      Participants undergo the following tests and procedures:

      I. Before starting conditioning chemotherapy or radiation therapy for the transplantation

        -  Medical history and physical examination

        -  Sigmoidoscopy (endoscopy of the lower part of the large intestine) and biopsies

        -  Blood draw

        -  Stool sample collection

      II. Two to 3 weeks after conditioning regimen

        -  Sigmoidoscopy with biopsies

        -  Blood draw

        -  Stool sample collection

      III. 30, 45, 60 and 90 days after transplantation

      -Blood draw

      IV. After completing the tests in part II and at the appearance of GI symptoms suspected to
      be due to GVHD

        -  Updated medical history and physical examination

        -  Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (endoscopy of the esophagus, stomach and upper small
           intestine)

        -  Colonoscopy (endoscopy of the entire part of the large intestine) with biopsies

        -  Blood draw

        -  Stool collection

      V. Two weeks after starting therapy in patients diagnosed with GVHD

        -  Sigmoidoscopy with biopsies

        -  Blood draw

        -  Stool sample collection

        -  PET/CT scan in selected patients (nuclear medicine and x-ray imaging of the GI tract

    <textblock>
      Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) affects up to 70% of patients who undergo stem cell
      transplantation. GVHD is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and commonly
      affects the skin, liver, and gastrointestinal (GI) system. Gastrointestinal (GI)
      manifestations of GVHD include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. In
      patients with GI GVHD, the extent of gut involvement and its relationship to underlying
      symptoms is unclear. Furthermore, diagnosis requires histologic evaluation that entails
      cumbersome invasive endoscopic procedures for tissue procurement. Histologic findings that
      support this diagnosis are nonspecific and have poor sensitivity and specificity. Treatment
      of GI GVHD is also nonspecific, and has many systemic side effects that account for a large
      portion of associated morbidity and mortality.

      Such uncertainties regarding the diagnosis and treatment of GI GVHD stem from a lack of
      understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease. Cytokines produced by T lymphocytes,
      mononuclear phagocytes, and natural killer cells have been shown to play an integral role in
      the regulation of tissue damage. Human studies performed to date have examined peripheral
      blood cytokines, but results have been conflicting and with little clinical correlation.
      Current analysis of gut tissue has been limited mostly to animal subjects with little
      correlation to humans.

      The primary objective of this study is to identify areas of the GI tract to be biopsied that
      would achieve the highest yield for the diagnosis of GI GVHD. This will be accomplished by
      performing esophagogastroduodenoscopy, colonoscopy, and ileoscopy in all post transplant
      patients with GI symptoms, suspected to be due to GVHD. Endoscopic biopsies will be evaluated
      by a single designated GI pathologist to make the diagnosis of GVHD. A novel application of a
      quantitative histological apoptotic assay will be evaluated in a blinded fashion for its
      diagnostic utility. A GVHD diagnostic yield rate for each area of the GI tract will be the
      primary outcome measure.

      Other biopsies obtained at baseline, following the conditioning regimen as well as before and
      after therapy for GI GVHD will be used to achieve the secondary objective of understanding
      the immune response underlying GI GVHD. A comprehensive evaluation of the inflammatory milieu
      of gut tissues will be achieved using immunohistochemistry and flow cytometric
      immunophenotyping of mucosal mononuclear cells and microarray, qRT-PCR and ELISA of mucosal
      cytokines. Other secondary objectives include the evaluation of serum proteomic pattern
      analysis, serum citrulline, fecal calprotectin and 18F-FDG PET/CT for the noninvasive
      diagnosis of GI GVHD.

      Better understanding of the pathophysiology of GI GVHD will allow us to develop more focused
      and effective diagnostic and therapeutic options that are less invasive and have fewer
      systemic side effects leading to reduced morbidity and mortality.
