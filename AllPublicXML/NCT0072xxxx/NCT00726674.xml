      Treatment of diabetes mellitus type II with basal insulin, for patients treated in Clalit
      outpatient clinics that are not adequately controlled with current treatment.
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with diabetes treated in outpatient clinics will be recruited by their primary care
      physician. Recruitment period will be 3 months per center and each patient will be followed
      for 7 months Diabetes specialists will be responsible for 50-65 primary care physicians. The
      specialists will advise and direct the primary care physician through the whole study period.

      The study protocol includes patients treated with different types of non short- acting
      insulin. Insulin Lantus (including dose) will be started by the primary physician, if needed
      after consulting the Diabetes Specialist. The treatment should follow the study protocol.

      Patients will have 3 pre-scheduled visits in their clinic: 1. At the beginning of study. 2.
      After 3 months. 3. At study end (after 6 month). An additional telephone contact will take
      place 1 month after last visit. to evaluate adherence to therapy Data collecting: Data
      including HbA1c, FPG,current diabetic treatment, dose of insulin Lantus, and relevant
      additional diseases\complaints will be collected at each visit. Additional information as
      demographic data, medical history will be collected at beginning of study.

      Safety: Hypoglycaemic episodes will be recorded
