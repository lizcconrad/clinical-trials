    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare progression-free survival (PFS), based upon
      investigator assessment using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.0
      (RECIST 1.0) and clinical findings, in participants with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer
      who receive combination therapy with vintafolide and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin
      (PLD/Doxil®/Caelyx®) with that in subjects with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer who receive
      PLD alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of
      vintafolide and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD; available in the United States as
      Doxil® and outside the United States as Caelyx®) compared to PLD alone.

      Vintafolide is a drug that is specifically designed to enter cancer cells via the folate
      vitamin receptor (FR). Experimental evidence shows that this target receptor is expressed on
      virtually all ovarian cancers. Early clinical evidence in a small number of Phase I subjects
      and in a subset of subjects in an on-going single-arm Phase II study suggests that
      vintafolide may have antitumor effect in women with advanced ovarian cancer and that it is
      generally well-tolerated. This evidence suggests that vintafolide may be useful as
      chemotherapy against advanced ovarian cancer.

      Patients at centers with EC20 imaging capability will also undergo imaging with the folate
      receptor (FR-)targeting investigational diagnostic agent EC20 during the screening period to
      assess uptake of this agent into tumors. This non-invasive procedure will provide additional
      information on the utility of EC20 imaging to identify subjects with the FR molecular
      &quot;target&quot; before treatment with vintafolide therapy.

          -  Subjects must have received prior platinum-based chemotherapy but must not have
             received more than 2 prior systemic cytotoxic regimens. Subjects are allowed to
             receive, but are not required to receive, one additional non-cytotoxic regimen for the
             management of recurrent or persistent disease. Non-cytotoxic (biologic or cytostatic)

          -  Subjects must have recovered (to baseline/stabilization) from prior cytotoxic
             therapy-associated acute toxicities. Subjects who have recovered from non-cytotoxic
             therapy-associated toxicity or who have &quot;controlled&quot; non-cytotoxic therapy toxicity
             (e.g., vascular endothelial growth factor-related hypertension) can be entered into
             the trial after a drug wash-out period of 4 half lives

          -  Subjects must have adequate organ function including:

               1. Bone Marrow Reserve: Absolute neutrophil count(ANC)≥ 1.5x10^9/L prior to
                  treatment. Subjects on maintenance doses of granulocyte colony stimulating factor
                  (G-CSF) are eligible. Platelets ≥ 100x10^9/L and hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL.

               2. Hepatic: Total bilirubin level &lt; 1.5 x ULN and alanine aminotransferase (ALT),
                  aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma glutamyl transferase(GGT), and alkaline
                  phosphatase levels &lt; 2.5 x ULN.

               3. Renal: Serum creatinine level ≤ 1.5 x ULN or creatinine clearance ≥ 50
                  mL/min/1.73m^2 for subjects with serum creatinine levels above 1.5 x ULN.

               4. Cardiac: Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) equal to or greater than

        the institutional lower limit of normal. LVEF must be elevated within 90 days prior to
        Cycle 1 Day 1

          -  Subjects of childbearing potential must:

               1. Have a negative serum pregnancy test prior to initiation of the therapeutic
                  regimen

               2. Practice an effective method of birth control (e.g., oral, transdermal or
                  injectable contraceptives, intrauterine device, double-barrier contraception,
                  such as diaphragm and spermicidal jelly) for the duration of their participation
                  in the trial through 3 months following the last dose of study drug.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The presence of any of the following will exclude the subject from the study:

          -  Diagnosis of tumor of low-malignant potential

          -  Prior exposure to PLD or anthracycline therapy

          -  Prior exposure to FR-targeted therapy (EC145, EC0225, farletuzumab, etc)

          -  Prior therapy with mouse antibodies

          -  Prior therapy with vinorelbine (Navelbine®) or vinca-containing compounds

          -  Prior abdominal or pelvic radiation therapy, radiation therapy to &gt; 10% of the bone
             marrow, or prior radiation therapy within the past 3 years to the breast/sternum,
             dermal lesions, head or neck

          -  Recent (i.e., ≤ 6 weeks) history of abdominal surgery or peritonitis

          -  Serious comorbidities (as determined by the investigator) such as, but not limited to,
             active congestive heart failure or recent myocardial infarction. Subjects who require
             antifolate therapy for the management of comorbid conditions (e.g., rheumatoid
             arthritis) will be excluded from the trial.

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Concurrent malignancy or history of other cancer (except noninvasive skin cancer)
             within the last 5 years

          -  Symptomatic central nervous system metastasis

          -  Other concurrent chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, or any ancillary therapy
             that is considered to be investigational (i.e., used for non-approved indications(s)
             and in the context of a research investigation). Use of low dose corticosteroid
             therapy (for nausea prophylaxis, etc) is acceptable; however, concomitant tamoxifen
             therapy is not. Supportive care measures are allowed.
