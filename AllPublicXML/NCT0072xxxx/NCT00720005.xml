      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the visual outcomes and patient satisfaction after
      bilateral implantation of the aspheric ReSTOR multifocal intraocular lens (IOL) and compare
      it to a historical control group of patients implanted bilaterally with the spherical ReSTOR
      multifocal

             eye surgeries.

          -  Willing and able to comply with scheduled visits and other study procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Preoperative ocular pathology potentially affecting visual acuity.

          -  Keratometric astigmatism exceeding 1.50 diopters.

          -  Planned postoperative refraction for mono-vision.

          -  Contact lens use during the active treatment portion of the trial.

          -  Any concurrent infectious/non infectious conjunctivitis, keratitis or uveitis.

          -  Pregnant or nursing mothers and females of childbearing potential not practicing a
             reliable and medically acceptable method of birth control.

          -  Any clinically significant, serious or severe medical or psychiatric condition that
             may increase the risk associated with study participation or study device implantation
             or may interfere with the interpretation of study results.

          -  Participation in (or current participation) any investigational drug or device trial
             within the previous 30 days prior to the start date of this trial.

          -  Intraocular conventional surgery within the past three months or intraocular laser
             surgery within one month in the operated eye.

          -  Other ocular surgery at the time of the cataract extraction.
