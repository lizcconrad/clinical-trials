  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will gather information on the safety and efficacy of patients with rheumatoid
      arthritis (RA) who are starting treatment with infliximab for the first time. Patients will
      be treated in the usual manner according to local guidelines and normal clinical practice.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Local patients, diagnosed with RA at the National Institute of Rheumatic Diseases, Piestany,
      Slovakia, can participate, if their physicians have decided to treat the patient with
      infliximab. Registration for the trial will be done on a voluntary basis.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 14, and Week 54</time_frame>
    <description>The DAS 28 is an assessment of disease activity based on swollen joint count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and general health. Participants can be scored on a range of 0 to 10, with lower scores indicating less disease activity.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Fulfilling Criteria for a Therapeutic Response According to the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Response Criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 14 and Week 54</time_frame>
    <description>Response to treatment was assessed by EULAR response criteria. According to these criteria, participants were characterized as good, moderate, or non-responders based on both DAS level attained and change in DAS. Good response was defined as &gt;1.2 improvement in DAS from Baseline and DAS attained during follow-up of ≤2.4. Non-responders were participants with improvement of ≤0.6 or participants with improvement of &gt;0.6 but ≤1.2 and DAS attained during follow-up of &gt;3.7. Remaining participants were classified as moderate. Scores of good and moderate were considered to have therapeutic response.</description>
