             having a staining intensity of at least 2+ and a staining uniformity of heterogeneous
             (25 - 75% of tumor cells stain positively for αv integrin) or homogeneous staining
             (&gt;75% of tumor cells are positive for αv integrin) of tumor cells when evaluated by
             immunohistochemistry .

             dependency

          -  Coagulation [prothrombin time (PT) or international normalized ratio (INR) and
             activated partial prothrombin time (aPTT)] ≤ 1.25 x upper limit of normal (ULN)

          -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 2.5 x ULN if no
             liver metastasis; ≤ 5 x ULN if liver metastasis

          -  Total Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN

          -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN

          -  Female patients must be postmenopausal (at least 12 months since last menses),
             surgically sterile, abstinent, or, if sexually active, be practicing an effective
             method of birth control (e.g., prescription oral contraceptives, contraceptive
             injections, intrauterine device, double-barrier method, contraceptive patch, male
             partner sterilization) before study entry, for the duration of study participation,
             and for three months after the last infusion of study agent and must have a negative
             urine or serum pregnancy test within 1 week before beginning treatment on this study
             and at all specified timepoints throughout the study. Men must be sterilized or agree
             to use a double-barrier method of birth control and must agree to not donate sperm

             dementia) or any uncontrolled medical condition (eg, uncontrolled diabetes), including
             the presence of laboratory abnormalities, that would place the patient at unacceptable
             risk by participating in the study or would confound the ability to interpret data
             from the study

          -  Uncontrolled infection, clinically important active infection within 4 weeks before
             the first dose of study agent, or currently receiving treatment for an infection

             radiotherapy, chemotherapy, investigative therapy, or high-dose steroids; however,

             been stable for ≥ 14 days are permitted for patients with prostate cancer
