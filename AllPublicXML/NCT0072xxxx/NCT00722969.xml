    <textblock>
      Patients with advanced or metastatic (stage IIIB-IV) non small cell lung cancer who have not
      received prior chemotherapy will be treated with erlotinib 150 mg once a day and sorafenib
      400 mg twice a day. The objectives of the study are to assess the efficacy and safety of this
      combination treatment. Additional exploratory study objectives are correlation of biomarkers
      and imaging modalities potentially predictive for response and (progression free) survival.

          6. Subjects with at least one uni-dimensional(for RECIST) measurable lesion. Lesions must
             be measured by CT-scan.

          7. Adequate bone marrow, liver and renal function as assessed by the following laboratory
             requirements to be conducted within 7 days prior to screening:

         13. Alkaline phosphatase &lt; 4 x ULN

         14. PT-INR/PTT &lt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal [Patients who are being therapeutically
             anticoagulated with low molecular weight heparin will be allowed to participate
             provided that no prior evidence of underlying abnormality in these parameters exists.]

             [G-CSF and other hematopoietic growth factors may be used in the management of acute
             toxicity such as febrile neutropenia when clinically indicated or at the discretion of
             the investigator, however they may not be substituted for a required dose reduction.]
             [Patients taking chronic erythropoietin are permitted provided no dose adjustment is
