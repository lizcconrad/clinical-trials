    <textblock>
      The Real World Examination of Fibromyalgia: Longitudinal Evaluation of Costs and Treatments
      (REFLECTIONS) Study is a 12-month, prospective observational study that will be utilized in
      approximately 58 care settings in the United States (US) and Puerto Rico. It is designed to
      examine treatment patterns and health outcomes of adult participants diagnosed by their
      physician with fibromyalgia (FM) and who are starting any &quot;new pharmacologic agent&quot; for FM.

      The primary benefit of this study is enhanced understanding of the disease state of FM and
      the role that pharmacologic treatment plays, which may help to optimize management of FM.
      This study will address current gaps in a rapidly growing body of literature on FM.

    <time_frame>Baseline through 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Significant variables included in the final model were age over 65, physician gender and specialty, use of opioids (excluding tramadol), use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and number of medications.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Odds Ratios From Stepwise Logistic Regression Model of Longitudinal Adherence to Duloxetine Treatment for Fibromyalgia (FM) Over 12 Months: Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) Score, Pregabalin Use, and Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID) Use</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Significant variables included in the final model were pregabalin use, NSAID use, and GAD-7 (7-item, self-reported measurement of GAD severity [not at all severe, severe for several days, severe for more than half the days, severe nearly every day]; Total score=sum of all 7 items; ranges from 0 to 21; Higher score=greater level of anxiety). Odds ratios were based on medication possession ratio (MPR) â‰¥0.8 for pregabalin and NSAID use among duloxetine initiators at Baseline; MPR=total supply days/total number of days in 12-month study period.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Reasons for Discontinuing Medications for Fibromyalgia (FM) During the Study</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were allowed to select multiple reasons for discontinuing treatment. During the 12-month period post-baseline, a participant could possibly discontinue more than 1 medication, or discontinue the same medication more than once. A reason for discontinuation was given each time a participant stopped taking a medication.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Brief Pain Inventory-Interference (BPI-I) Average Subscale Score at 12 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Average BPI-I measures self-reported degree of pain interference on function. Interference scores range from 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes) for each question assessing interference of pain within past 24 hours for general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, and enjoyment of life. Average interference = average of non-missing scores of individual interference items.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Brief Pain Inventory-Severity (BPI-S) Average Subscale Score at 12 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>BPI-S measures self-reported severity of pain. Severity scores range from 0 (no pain) to 10 (severe pain) for each question assessing worst pain, least pain, and average pain in past 24 hours, and current pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) Total Score at 12 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>FIQ measures self-reported fibromyalgia (FM) status, progress, and outcomes over past week. FIQ comprises 20 items: Items 1-11 measure physical functioning (each rated on 4-point Likert-type scale); Items 12 + 13 measure number (no.) of days participant felt well and no. of days participant felt unable to work due to FM symptoms. Items 14-20 are numerical, 11-point Likert-type scales (marked in 10-millimeter [mm] increments) rating work difficulty, pain intensity, fatigue, morning tiredness, stiffness, anxiety, and depression. Total scores range from 0-80; Higher score=greater negative impact.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Sheehan Disability Score (SDS) Total Score at 12 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SDS is completed by the participant and assesses the effect of the participant's symptoms on work/social/family life. Total scores range from 0 to 30; Higher score=greater disruption in the participant's work/social/family life.</description>

          <description>FIQ measures self-reported fibromyalgia (FM) status, progress, and outcomes over past week. FIQ has 20 items: Items 1-11 measure physical functioning (each rated on 4-point Likert-type scale); Items 12 + 13 measure number (no.) of days participant felt well and no. of days participant felt unable to work due to FM symptoms. Items 14-20 are numerical, 11-point Likert-type scales (marked in 10-millimeter [mm] increments) rating work difficulty, pain intensity, fatigue, morning tiredness, stiffness, anxiety, and depression. Total scores range from 0 to 80; Higher score=greater negative impact.</description>

Items 14-20 are numerical, 11-point Likert-type scales (marked in 10-millimeter [mm] increments) rating work difficulty, pain intensity, fatigue, morning tiredness, stiffness, anxiety, and depression.
