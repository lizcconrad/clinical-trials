    <textblock>
      This will be a single centre study conducted at the 3rd hospital affiliated to Peking
      University. Approximately 24 healthy Chinese volunteers, male and female, will be recruited
      to obtain at least 20 evaluable volunteers. The primary objective of this study is to
      characterize the pharmacokinetics of AZD6140 and its active metabolite AR-C124910XX after
      single and multiple (twice daily) doses of AZD6140 90 mg and 180 mg in healthy Chinese
      volunteers. The secondary objective of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability
      of single and multiple (twice daily) 90 mg and 180 mg doses of AZD6140 by physical
      examination, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and collection of adverse events in
      healthy Chinese volunteers.
