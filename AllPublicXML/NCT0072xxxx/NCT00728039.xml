      1. Characterize the quality of life of young children with CVS (i.e., psychological,
           social, physical, school functioning) and the impact of the child's illness on the
           parent's and family's quality of life (i.e., emotional, social, cognitive functioning,
           communication, worry, daily activities and family relationships).

        2. Assess symptoms of depression, anxiety, ADHD and behavioral problems in what our
           preliminary data suggests is a psychiatrically vulnerable population.

        3. Evaluate the associations between quality of life and psychiatric symptoms and the
           frequency and intensity of CVS attacks.

        4. Use the data generated from this study to develop a psychosocial intervention targeted
           at young children with CVS and their families who evidence risk for functional
           disability, with the aim of intervening as early as possible to limit the psychological
           and social morbidity experienced by children with CVS and their and families.
