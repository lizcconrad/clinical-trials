On Day 1 prior to their first dose of iloprost with PD-15 (Baseline), patients were asked to compare their PAH status to that during Screening (if the Screening and Baseline visits were conducted on the same day, then patients were asked to compare their PAH status to that in the past 2 weeks).

        <description>Disease severity was assessed by NYHA classification of PAH criteria: Class I: no limitation of physical activity (PA). Ordinary PA: no undue dyspnea/fatigue, chest pain, near syncope. Class II: slight limitation of PA. Comfortable at rest. Ordinary PA: undue dyspnea/fatigue, chest pain, near syncope. Class III: marked limitation of PA. Comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary PA: undue dyspnea/fatigue, chest pain, near syncope. Class IV: inability to carry out PA without symptoms. Right heart failure. Dyspnea/fatigue may even have been present at rest. Discomfort increased by any PA.</description>

        <description>The Patient Global Self Assessment is a 7-point scale that was presented to patients prior to conducting visit-specific study procedures. Patients were asked to compare their current PAH status to their status in the past by selecting one of the following options: markedly better; moderately better; mildly better; no change; mildly worse; moderately worse; or markedly worse.
On Day 1 prior to their first dose of iloprost with PD-15 (Baseline), patients were asked to compare their PAH status to that during Screening (if the Screening and Baseline visits were conducted on the same day, then patients were asked to compare their PAH status to that in the past 2 weeks). On Day 28 and at the end of study (EOS) visit, patients were asked to compare their PAH status to that of the previous visit.</description>

          <description>The Patient Global Self Assessment is a 7-point scale that was presented to patients prior to conducting visit-specific study procedures. Patients were asked to compare their current PAH status to their status in the past by selecting one of the following options: markedly better; moderately better; mildly better; no change; mildly worse; moderately worse; or markedly worse.
On Day 1 prior to their first dose of iloprost with PD-15 (Baseline), patients were asked to compare their PAH status to that during Screening (if the Screening and Baseline visits were conducted on the same day, then patients were asked to compare their PAH status to that in the past 2 weeks). On Day 28 and at the end of study (EOS) visit, patients were asked to compare their PAH status to that of the previous visit.</description>
          <population>Modified intent-to-treat (MITT) population - includes all enrolled patients without major protocol violations, who received at least one dose of iloprost with PD-15, and had one or more post-baseline evaluations for pharmacodynamic endpoints.</population>

        <description>The Patient Global Self Assessment is a 7-point scale that was presented to patients prior to conducting visit-specific study procedures. Patients were asked to compare their current PAH status to their status in the past by selecting one of the following options: markedly better; moderately better; mildly better; no change; mildly worse; moderately worse; or markedly worse.
On Day 1 prior to their first dose of iloprost with PD-15 (Baseline), patients were asked to compare their PAH status to that during Screening (if the Screening and Baseline visits were conducted on the same day, then patients were asked to compare their PAH status to that in the past 2 weeks). On Day 28 and at the EOS visit, patients were asked to compare their PAH status to that of the previous visit.</description>
