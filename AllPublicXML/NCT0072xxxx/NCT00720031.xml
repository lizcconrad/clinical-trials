    <textblock>
      Most of HLA-A2 melanomas express Melan-A/MART-1 antigen and are recognized by tumor reactive
      Melan-A specific T lymphocytes. By using blood samples from HLA-A2 melanoma patients (stage
      III and IV), our goal is to produce a tumor reactive Melan-A specific T cell clones and to
      conduct a phase I-II clinical trial, based on the infusion of several millions to several
      billions of these lymphocytes to the patient, in order to induce passive immunity against
      this antigen. Production of the clones will be performed in the Unit for Cellular and Gene
      Therapy from Nantes University Hospital. Therapeutic response, safety treatment but also
      localization and survival of infused T cell clones will be assessed. This approach is
      expected to precise the ability of the clones to migrate within the tumor and to transfer
      specific immunity.

    <description>By using patients' blood, several million to several billion of Melan-A/MART1 tumor reactive T cell clone(s) will be produced in vitro, then infused to the patient, 3 to 6 months after collecting blood sample. During this production period of the T cell clone, the patient will be treated with deticene at the dose of 250mg/m2/j by IV for 4 days each month.
After each T cell clone infusion (J1), the patient will receive IFN-α at the dose of 9 M/U 3 times a week for 4 weeks and Interleukin-2 at the dose of 9 M/U from Day 1 to day 5 and from Day 8 to Day 12.</description>
