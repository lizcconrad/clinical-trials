  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of varying doses of artesunate on
      treatment outcome and whether higher doses of artesunate can overcome the problem of
      compromised artemisinin sensitivity in the region.

      To determine the safety and tolerability of this previously untested experimental high dose
      (6 mg/Kg/D X 7 day, total 42 mg/Kg) artesunate monotherapy regimen.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 150 volunteers with acute uncomplicated falciparum malaria will be randomly
      assigned one of 3 arms to be treated with artesunate monotherapy for 7 days at a ratio of
      2:1:2.

      Arm 2 serves as a control and will serve as a bridge to the ARC 1 study performed in
      2006/2007. Patients in Arm 1 will receive a relatively low &quot;standard&quot; dose, and patients in
      Arm 2 will receive the intermediate dose of 4 mg/kg that was used in the ARC1 study. Patients
      in Arm 3 will receive an experimental &quot;high-dose&quot; regimen. Currently available safety data
      extends to subjects who have received the 28 mg/Kg total dose over 7 days and to another
      study administering 8 mg/Kg/day for 3 days (total dose 24 mg/Kg). Subjects randomized into
      this study's 'high-dose' Arm 3 will, therefore, receive a total dose that is higher than has
      been previously studied in humans.

      The study design will be based on the WHO recommendations for the 'Assessment and Monitoring
      of Antimalarial Drug Efficacy for the Treatment of Uncomplicated Falciparum Malaria' (WHO,
      2003).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Acute symptomatic falciparum malaria infection as determined by malaria smear with a
             parasite density of 1000 to 200,000 asexual parasites/Micro-liter as determined on the
             thick/thin screening smear with fever (defined as ≥ 37.5ºC), or reported history of
             fever within the last 48 hours.

          2. Age: 18-65 years old

          3. All females between the age of 18 and 50 are required to have a negative human
             chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) pregnancy test (urine). All females of childbearing
             potential (not surgically sterile, or less than two years menopausal) are required to
             use an acceptable method of contraception, such as implant, injectable, or oral
             contraceptive(s), if possible with additional barrier contraception, intrauterine
             device, sexual abstinence, or vasectomized partner, throughout the study.

          4. Written informed consent obtained

          5. Willing to stay under close medical supervision for the study duration of 42 days

          2. Mixed malaria infection on admission by malaria smear

          3. A previous history of intolerance or hypersensitivity to the study drug artesunate or

             other clinically significant illness, which in the opinion of the investigator would
