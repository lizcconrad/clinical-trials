  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ustekinumab (CNTO 1275)
      compared with placebo in participants with moderate to severe plaque type psoriasis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter (involving more than 1 study center), randomized (study medication
      assigned by chance), double-blind (neither the invesitigator nor the participant knows the
      identity of the study medication), placebo- controlled (1 of the study medications is
      inactive), parallel-group comparative study (different groups of participants will receive
      different treatments at the same time). The total duration of the study will be 78 weeks
      which will be comprised of: a screening period (6 weeks); an efficacy assessment period (64
      weeks [with a total of 7 treatments at Weeks 0, 4, 12, 16, 28, 40, and 52]) and a follow-up
      assessment period (8 weeks). The efficacy assessment period will further include: a
      placebo-controlled treatment period (Weeks 0-12) and an active drug treatment period (Weeks
      12-64). During the placebo-controlled treatment period, participants will receive ustekinumab
      (45 mg or 90 mg) subcutaneously (SC-into the muscles) or placebo SC. During the active drug
      treatment period, participants will continue treatment with 45 mg or 90 mg SC as assigned
      during the placebo-controlled treatment period; however, participants in the placebo group
      will be divided into 2 groups and will receive ustekinumab 45 mg (Placebo A) or 90 mg
      (Placebo B) SC. Efficacy will be evaluated primarily by analysis of psoriasis area and
      severity index (PASI) score. Participant safety will also be monitored.

    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants with &gt;=75% improvement in PASI score at Week 12 from Baseline was reported. PASI is a widely used tool for the measurement of severity of psoriasis. The combination of redness, scaling, and thickness, as well as overall body involvement determine the PASI score. The scale ranges from 0 (best) to 72 (worst). Baseline visit refers to Week 0.</description>

    <description>The DLQI is a self-administered 10-item questionnaire that is used to assess 6 different aspects of quality of life: symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work or school performance, personal relationships, and treatment. Scores range from 0 (no impairment in quality of life) to 30 (most impairment in quality of life).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) at Week 12, 28, 40, 52 and 64</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12, 28, 40, 52 and 64</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 is a validated instrument measuring health-related quality of life across multiple disease states. It has 36 questions with 8 subscale scores and 2 summary scores: (1) physical component summary (PCS)=physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, and general health; (2) mental component summary (MCS)=vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. There is no total overall score; scoring is done for both sub scores and summary scores. For sub scores and summary scores: 0=worst score and 100=best score.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 12, 28, 40, 52 and 64</time_frame>
    <description>The PDI questionnaire consists of 15 questions relating to the impact of psoriasis in terms of daily activities, work or school, personal relationships, leisure, and treatment. Each question is scored on a scale of 0 (no impact) to 3 (greatest impact). The PDI is calculated by summing the scores of the questions resulting in a maximum score of 45 (greatest impact) and a minimum score of 0 (no impact).</description>

    <time_frame>Week 12, 28, 40,52 and 64</time_frame>
    <description>The NAPSI score is used to evaluate the severity of nail bed psoriasis and nail matrix psoriasis. The nail is divided with into quadrants and given a score for nail bed psoriasis (0-4) and nail matrix psoriasis (0-4) depending on the presence of any of the features of nail psoriasis in that quadrant. Each nail is evaluated, and the sum of all the nails is the total NAPSI score. The sum of the scores from all nails ranges from 0 (no psoriasis) to 80 (psoriasis present in all 4 quadrants of all 10 nails).</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Cleared (0), Cleared or Minimal (0 or 1) and Mild (Less Than or Equal to 2) Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants with PGA score of cleared (0), cleared or minimal (0 or 1) and mild (less than or equal to 2) was reported. The PGA score is a numeric scale which is completed by the physician and is designed to evaluate the physician's overall assessment of the participant's psoriasis. Overall lesions will be graded for induration (I), erythema (E), and scaling (S) as: 0=cleared, 1=minimal, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=marked, and 5=severe. The sum of the 3 scores (I + E + S) will be divided by 3 to obtain a final PGA score ranging from 0 [best] to 5 [worst].</description>

        <description>The SF-36 is a validated instrument measuring health-related quality of life across multiple disease states. It has 36 questions with 8 subscale scores and 2 summary scores: (1) physical component summary (PCS)=physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, and general health; (2) mental component summary (MCS)=vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. There is no total overall score; scoring is done for both sub scores and summary scores. For sub scores and summary scores: 0=worst score and 100=best score.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) at Week 12, 28, 40, 52 and 64</title>
          <description>The SF-36 is a validated instrument measuring health-related quality of life across multiple disease states. It has 36 questions with 8 subscale scores and 2 summary scores: (1) physical component summary (PCS)=physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, and general health; (2) mental component summary (MCS)=vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. There is no total overall score; scoring is done for both sub scores and summary scores. For sub scores and summary scores: 0=worst score and 100=best score.</description>
          <population>The full analysis set (FAS) population included all the randomly assigned participants with efficacy data who fulfilled the eligibility criteria and received study medication. Here, 'N' signifies the participants evaluated for this measure and 'n' signifies the participants evaluated for this measure at a particular time point.</population>

        <description>The NAPSI score is used to evaluate the severity of nail bed psoriasis and nail matrix psoriasis. The nail is divided with into quadrants and given a score for nail bed psoriasis (0-4) and nail matrix psoriasis (0-4) depending on the presence of any of the features of nail psoriasis in that quadrant. Each nail is evaluated, and the sum of all the nails is the total NAPSI score. The sum of the scores from all nails ranges from 0 (no psoriasis) to 80 (psoriasis present in all 4 quadrants of all 10 nails).</description>
