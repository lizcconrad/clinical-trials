  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, observational, hypothesis-generating study exploring
      mobility, Quality of Life and other physical performance measures among older, long-term stay
      Nursing Home residents with CKD, with versus without anemia. Enrolled patients will
      participate in the study up to a total of 26 weeks and be assessed at Weeks 1, 2, 14 and
      26/End of Study. Based upon Week 1 hemoglobin and serum creatinine lab results, participants
      will be categorized into 1 of 4 groups.

    <measure>Total Distance Walked or Wheeled in a Maximum of 10 Minutes at Each Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 2, 14 and 26</time_frame>
    <description>The distance a participant walked, with or without an assistive device and stand-by assistance of 1 person, or propelled him/herself in a wheelchair with or without the use of his/her feet, over level ground, during a period of up to 10 minutes including up to two 30-second rest periods (at weeks 2, 14 and 26).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Anemia</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Anemia is defined using World Health Organization (WHO) criteria as Hemogloblin &lt;12 g/dL in women, &lt; 13 g/dL in men.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Anemia Related Conditions at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The percentages of anemic subjects with iron deficiency, vitamin B12 deficiency, gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, chronic inflammation, and folate deficiency. Anemia of iron deficiency is defined as reduced serum iron, reduced transferrin saturation, ferritin less than 12 ng/mL plus increased Total Iron Binding Capacity (TIBC), per normal laboratory range. Anemia of chronic inflammation defined as reduced serum iron and transferrin saturation, increased or normal ferritin, and reduced or normal TIBC. GI bleed is based on the result of the stool guaiac sample(s) collected: A participant is considered to have GI bleed if one guaiac sample is positive, and not to have GI bleed only if all of his/her three stool guaiac samples were negative.
Vitamin B12 and folate deficiency based on standard laboratory ranges.</description>

    <measure>Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) for Participants With CKD</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 1, 14 and 26</time_frame>
    <description>Estimated GFR measures how much blood the kidneys are filtering, and was calculated using 2 methods: 1. Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study (MDRD) formula: estimated GFR = 186 x [Serum creatinine]^-1.154 x [Age]^-0.203 x [0.742 if patient is female] x [1.210 if patient is black]. 2. Cockcroft-Gault formula: GFR = (140-age) * (Weight in kg) * (0.85 if female) / (72 * Serum Creatinine).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical Performance: Speed Walked or Wheeled in a Maximum of 10 Minutes at Each Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 2, 14 and 26</time_frame>
    <description>Physical performance was measured for all patients with CKD (defined as estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) &lt;60 mL/min/1.73m^2). The average speed a participant walked, with or without an assistive device, and stand-by assistance of one person or propelled themselves in their wheelchair with or without the use of their feet, over level ground, up to 10 minutes with up to two 30 second rest periods.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical Performance: Duration Walked or Wheeled at Each Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 2, 14, 26</time_frame>
    <description>The duration a participant was able to walk or propel themselves in a wheelchair during 10 minutes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical Performance: Time to Rise From Sitting to Standing</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 2, 14, 26</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were asked to stand from a seated position so that knees approximated full extension. Timing began from the point that the participant initiated the standing behavior to the point he/she was on his/her feet with knees at approximately full extension.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical Performance: Grip Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 2, 14, 26</time_frame>
    <description>Grip strength was measured using an adjustable, hand-held, hydraulic grip strength dynamometer. While seated, participants were asked to grip the 2 bars of the dynamometer in their hand and slowly squeeze as hard as they can; then relax. The highest of three measurements was recorded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical Performance: Lower Extremity Strength, Left Leg.</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 2, 14, 26</time_frame>
    <description>Lower extremity strength test measures the maximum amount of weight a participant can lift one time throughout his/her range of motion. While supine, and using adjustable cuff weights, participants were asked to bend at their hip and knee and draw their heel along the bed towards their buttocks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical Performance: Lower Extremity Strength, Right Leg</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 2, 14, 26</time_frame>
    <description>Lower extremity strength test measures the maximum amount of weight a participant can lift one time throughout his/her range of motion. While supine, and using adjustable cuff weights, participants were asked to bend at their hip and knee and draw their heel along the bed towards their buttocks.</description>

        <description>The percentages of anemic subjects with iron deficiency, vitamin B12 deficiency, gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, chronic inflammation, and folate deficiency. Anemia of iron deficiency is defined as reduced serum iron, reduced transferrin saturation, ferritin less than 12 ng/mL plus increased Total Iron Binding Capacity (TIBC), per normal laboratory range. Anemia of chronic inflammation defined as reduced serum iron and transferrin saturation, increased or normal ferritin, and reduced or normal TIBC. GI bleed is based on the result of the stool guaiac sample(s) collected: A participant is considered to have GI bleed if one guaiac sample is positive, and not to have GI bleed only if all of his/her three stool guaiac samples were negative.

        <title>Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) for Participants With CKD</title>
        <description>Estimated GFR measures how much blood the kidneys are filtering, and was calculated using 2 methods: 1. Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study (MDRD) formula: estimated GFR = 186 x [Serum creatinine]^-1.154 x [Age]^-0.203 x [0.742 if patient is female] x [1.210 if patient is black]. 2. Cockcroft-Gault formula: GFR = (140-age) * (Weight in kg) * (0.85 if female) / (72 * Serum Creatinine).</description>

        <description>Grip strength was measured using an adjustable, hand-held, hydraulic grip strength dynamometer. While seated, participants were asked to grip the 2 bars of the dynamometer in their hand and slowly squeeze as hard as they can; then relax. The highest of three measurements was recorded.</description>

      <restrictive_agreement>The Clinical Trial Agreement generally does not restrict an investigatorâ€™s discussion of trial results after completion. The Agreement permits Amgen a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 45 days and possible extension). Amgen may remove confidential information, but authors have final control and approval of publication content. For multi-center studies, the investigator agrees not to publish any results before the first multi-center publication.</restrictive_agreement>
