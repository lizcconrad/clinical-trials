  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fractalkine (FKN) is a chemoattractant and adhesion molecule for leukocytes. Angiogenic
      effect of FKN also has been reported. We investigate FKN-mediated angiogenesis in ocular
      angiogenic disorders.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fractalkine (FKN), the sole member of the CX3C chemokine family, is named for its fractal
      geometry. The CX3C motif, with three amino acids between the two terminal cysteines, makes
      fractalkine distinct from other chemokines.The structure of fractalkine, a membrane-bound
      glycoprotein with the chemokines domain atop an extended mucin-like stalk, also is
      unique.Membrane-bound FKN can be markedly induced on primary endothelial cells by
      inflammatory cytokines; this form promotes the robust adhesion of monocytes and T
      lymphocytes. Soluble FKN can be released by proteolysis at an efficient chemotactic activity
      level for monocytes and T cells. Thus, FKN is a versatile molecule regulating both cell-cell
      interactions in its membrane-bound form and directed-cell migration in its soluble form. The
      receptor of FKN, CXC3R1, is a G protein-couple protein, which expresses T lymphocytes,
      monocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, microglia, and neurons.Sulfation of tyrosine enhances
      the function of CX3CR1 in cell capture and firm adhesion. Fractalkine is expressed
      constitutively in the kidney, heart, lung, and brain. Fractalkine has demonstrated an
      important role in CNS inflammation, cardiac allograft rejection, arteriogenesis, renal
      disease, psoriasis, and during pregnancy. Silverman et al demonstrated the presence of FKN in
      normal cultured microvascular endothelial and stromal cells of iris and retina in vitro. Upon
      inflammatory cytokine stimulation, EC also express FKN and its receptors with FKN secretion
      in an autocrine manner. In addition to EC chemotaxis and tube formation, FKN is an angiogenic
      mediator in rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, we hypothesize that FKN not only participates in
      ocular inflammatory reactions, but also plays an important role in ocular angiogenesis.
