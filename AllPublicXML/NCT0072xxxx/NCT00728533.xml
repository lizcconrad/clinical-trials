  <brief_title>Open-Label, Randomised Parallel-Group Study</brief_title>
  <official_title>The Rationale of the Study is to Demonstrate That Degarelix Given at Three-month Dosing Intervals Will Produce and Maintain Androgen Deprivation in Prostate Cancer Patients Through Immediate and Prolonged Testosterone Suppression, and to Provide Confirmatory Evidence of the Safety of Degarelix.</official_title>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients, aged 18 years or older, with a histologically proven prostate cancer of all
             stages in whom endocrine treatment is indicated.

          -  Screening testosterone level above the lower limit of normal range, globally defined
             as &gt; 2.2 ng/mL.

          -  Screening PSA level of =2 ng/mL. ECOG score of =2.

          -  Life expectancy of at least one year.

        CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION:

        Primary endpoint:

          -  Probability of testosterone at castrate level (=0.5 ng/mL) from Day 28 through Day
             364.

        Secondary endpoints:

          -  Probability of testosterone at castrate level (=0.5 ng/mL) from Day 56 through Day
             364.

          -  Serum levels of testosterone, LH, FSH, and PSA over time.

          -  Time to PSA failure - defined as two consecutive increases of 50%, and at least 5
             ng/mL, compared to nadir.

          -  Plasma levels of degarelix over time.

          -  Frequency and severity of adverse events.

          -  Clinically significant changes in laboratory safety parameters.

          -  Clinically significant changes in physical examinations, ECGs, vital signs, and body
             weight.
