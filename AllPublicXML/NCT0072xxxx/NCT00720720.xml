                  (external carotid excluded) according to criteria from NASCET

               -  without constituted or transitory recent cerebral vascular accident. The
                  discovery of an ischaemic after-effect on a systematic scanner is not a criterion

          -  Subject with normal body weight or in over weight (Body Mass Index ranged between 19
             and 30 kg/m2, [limits included])

             (according to AFSSAPS' recommendations)

          -  Subject with social insurance or equivalent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject who, according to AFSSAPS' recommendations, should received a
             hypocholesterolemic therapy before the end of the study.

          -  Subject with a history of diabetes

          -  Subject with cardiac disease such as unstable angina, myocardial infarction, coronary
             angioplasty, coronary artery bypass graft surgery, or moderate or severe congestive
             heart failure within the last 6 months.

          -  Subject taking any drugs known to affect the evaluation of studied parameters

          -  Subject with severe or acute disease that could affect the results of the study or
             subject safety

          -  Subject with regular consumption of phytosterol enriched foods products during the
             study.

          -  Subject with any other medical condition or laboratory abnormality prior to
             recruitment that in the opinion of the principal investigator could affect subject
             safety or render unlikely trial to be conducted to the end.

          -  For women: pregnancy or breast feeding or subject likely to be pregnant during the
             study.

          -  For women: subject likely to modify their hormonal therapy during the study

          -  Subject in exclusion period after its participation in an other clinical trial
