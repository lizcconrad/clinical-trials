    <textblock>
      The TODAY study group has prepared a protocol with the primary objective of collecting blood
      and phenotypic information to be used to explore relationships between candidate genes and
      type 2 diabetes (T2D), as well as obesity, insulin resistance, and cardiovascular
      complications of insulin resistance. Participation in the genetics study includes a blood
      draw for analysis of diabetes type and DNA extraction, as well as collection of basic family
      and medical history. Appropriate informed consent and assent are obtained from all
      participants to extract DNA and send blood, genetic material, and medical history to the
      Central Repository of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
      (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The data are kept indefinitely by the
      Central Repository. The NIDDK will issue requests for proposals (RFP) throughout the
      scientific community for research that may help in the development of new diagnostic tests,
      new treatments, and new ways to prevent diabetes and other related comorbidities.

        Recruitment is conducted within a 'catchment' area that includes (a) the patient pools of
        the 15 TODAY clinical centers and (b) collaborating clinics and physicians who either refer
        subjects to a TODAY site or obtain IRB approval to conduct the protocol at their own
        locale.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diabetes by ADA criteria (laboratory determinations of fasting glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL,
             random glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL, or two-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) glucose ≥
             200 mg/dL) documented and confirmed in medical record or a laboratory determination of
             HbA1c ≥ 7%. For asymptomatic patients diagnosed with diabetes with a normal fasting
             glucose but an elevated two-hour glucose during an OGTT, the HbA1c must be ≥ 6%.

          -  BMI ≥ 85th percentile documented at time of diagnosis or at screening.

          -  Age &lt; 18 at time of diagnosis.

          -  Signed informed consent and assent forms as appropriate.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Genetic syndrome or disorder known to affect glucose tolerance other than diabetes.

          -  Patient on medication known to affect glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity or
             secretion within 60 days of the time of diagnosis. If diagnosis is confirmed after the
             patient has been off the medication for 60 days, the patient may be included.
             Exclusionary medications include but are not limited to

               1. inhaled steroids at dose above 1000 mcg daily fluticasone equivalent,

               2. oral glucocorticoids,

               3. antirejection or chemotherapy agents (e.g., tacrolimus, L-asparaginase),

               4. atypical antipsychotics.
