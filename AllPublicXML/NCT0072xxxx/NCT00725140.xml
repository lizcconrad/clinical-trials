      This is a observational, open, prospective, single arm cohort study within authorized SPC

      Primary Objective:

      To describe the effectiveness of Almotriptan in treating acute migraine attacks when pain is
      mild and in the first hour of pain in everyday primary care clinical practice.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. Influence of an educational intervention on the early intake of the treatment

        2. Influence of medication history or concomitant medication on treatment results

        3. Influence of migraine triggers on treatment results

        4. Influence of stress on treatment results

        5. Tolerability profile validation

        6. Patients' satisfaction

        7. Reasons for delaying migraine treatment intake

          2. Patients with a history of migraine headaches progressing from mild to at least
             moderate pain intensity if untreated on a scale of no pain (0), mild (1), moderate
             (2), or severe (3) within the past year.

          3. Migraine headache frequency of 2 to 6 per month for the past 3 months.

          4. Male or female aged 18 to 65 years.

          5. Able to differentiate a migraine headache from an interval (e.g., tension-type)
             headache.

        8.Female patients of childbearing potential must not suspect to be pregnant and have an
