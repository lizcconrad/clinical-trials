    <textblock>
      The use of sugar and starch-like foods for energy (carbohydrate metabolism) changes when
      people sleep. However, it is still not known if differences in the amount of nighttime sleep
      have an effect on the carbohydrate metabolism of people who have a relative with type 2
      diabetes (parent, sibling, or grandparent). This study is being done to test the hypothesis
      that individual differences in habitual sleep duration may be related to differences in the
      carbohydrate metabolism of people who have a history of type 2 diabetes in their family.

      On two consecutive inpatient days, the participants in this study will undergo two different
      tests. The first test will determine how much insulin can their body produce in response to
      an intravenous glucose infusion over a period of several hours. The second test will
      determine how effective is the action of the sugar-processing hormone, insulin, in their body
      when it is infused intravenously together with glucose over a period of several hours.
