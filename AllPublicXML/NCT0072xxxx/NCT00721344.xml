  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      48 healthy adult male &amp; female subjects will be enrolled in this study to determine the
      effect of Technosphere® Inhalation Powder (FDKP) on the QT interval of the EKG. Eligible
      subjects will be randomized into a dosing regimen after admission.

      This is a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, cross-over, placebo- and active-controlled
      cardiac safety study in 48 healthy subjects (both male and female subjects) designed to
      assess the effect of FDKP on cardiac repolarization, if any, following introduction of
      Technosphere® Inhalation Powder via inhalation. Each trial subject will be administered 20 mg
      of FDKP, 40 mg of FDKP, 400 mg oral dose of moxifloxacin (active), and placebo in a crossover
      design during an 11 day in-patient stay.
