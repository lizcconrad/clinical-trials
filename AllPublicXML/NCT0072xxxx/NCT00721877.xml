  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Resveratrol may prevent cancer in healthy people. Studying samples of blood and urine in the
      laboratory from participants who are taking resveratrol may help doctors learn more about how
      this drug is used by the body. This phase I trial is studying the side effects of resveratrol
      and to see how it works in healthy adult participants.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effect of resveratrol on human cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme activity in
      healthy adult participants.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the modulation effect on phase II detoxification enzymes. II. To evaluate
      safety in participants treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive oral resveratrol once daily for 4 weeks.

      Patients complete a daily diary documenting adverse events and an intake calendar for
      recording the daily intake of any non-routine medications.

      Participants undergo blood sample collection periodically. Lymphocytes are isolated and
      analyzed for baseline GST activity and level. Serum is analyzed to determine bilirubin levels
      to be used as surrogate UGT 1A1 activity. Analyses of CYP probe drugs will be performed using
      high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assays. A sensitive ELISA assay will be used
      for quantitative analyses. Urine samples are collected periodically and drug and metabolite
      levels will be analyzed.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed for 2 weeks.

    <description>Will be assessed by a comparison of CYP enzyme activities from baseline to end of resveratrol intervention. CYP1A2, 2D6, 2C9, and 3A4 activity will be assessed by plasma paraxanthine/caffeine ratio, urinary dextromethorphan/dextrophan ratio, urinary losartan/losartan metabolite ratio, and area under the plasma buspirone concentration-time curve, respectively. The primary analysis will consist of paired t-tests of differences in log values from baseline to end of intervention (equivalent to log of the ratio).</description>

    <measure>Changes in Phase II enzyme activity</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to end of resveratrol intervention</time_frame>
    <description>GST activity and GST-pi level in blood lymphocytes and serum bilirubin levels will be used to assess Phase II enzyme activity. Paired t-tests of differences in values from baseline to end of intervention will be used, with a 2-sided significance level of 0.0167 for the three tests.</description>
