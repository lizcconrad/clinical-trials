  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a post-marketing surveillance of patients with chronic hepatitis C treated with
      PegIntron and Rebetol combination therapy in clinical practice in Japan. The objective of the
      study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination therapy. The study will also
      compare the safety profile of the combination therapy among elderly patients and younger
      patients.

      Post-marketing surveys are not considered applicable clinical trials and thus the results of
      this survey will not be posted at its conclusion. The results will be submitted to public
      health officials as required by applicable national and international laws.
