    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of multiple,
      once-daily, intravenous doses of trans sodium crocetinate (TSC). The effectiveness of TSC in
      alleviating the symptoms of intermittent claudication (IC) will also be assessed.

    <textblock>
      Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) is a manifestation of systemic atherosclerosis, and patients
      with PAD commonly manifest symptoms of intermittent claudication (IC) such as cramping,
      aching, or fatigue in the calf muscles provoked by activity. In PAD, arterial occlusions lead
      to decreased leg blood flow during exercise or walking and the pain associated with this
      ischemia is IC. The diffusion of oxygen from blood to muscle could be a component of the
      overall decreased delivery or deficit of oxygen (hypoxia) to skeletal muscle resulting in
      symptoms in PAD patients. The overall goal of the development of TSC as a treatment for PAD
      is to allow for enhanced diffusion of oxygen through the plasma to alleviate the symptoms
      caused by the hypoxia in the tissues.

      This double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial will randomize up to 48 patients at up
      to 8 clinical research sites in the US. In addition to safety and pharmacokinetic assessments
      conducted during the trial, the primary endpoint of the study will be demonstrated from
      standardized, graded exercise treadmill tests conducted throughout the study. The clearly
      measurable parameters will be peak walking time (PWT) and claudication onset time (COT)
      comparing baseline and after TSC or placebo and are well-established endpoints accepted by
      the medical community and regulatory authorities for IC clinical trials.
