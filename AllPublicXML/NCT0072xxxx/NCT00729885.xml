  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) is one of the most common causes of vertigo and
      the most common vestibular disorder of the inner ear. BPPV is the result of small
      free-floating particles (canaliths) in the posterior semicircular canals where they aggravate
      the sensory apparatus and induce sudden and severe attacks of vertigo when the head is turned
      into certain positions.

      The treatment of BPPV was revolutionized by the introduction of the Epley maneuver, a
      sequence of head movements that use gravity to reposition the canaliths within the inner ear.
      The Epley maneuver provides prompt relief from vertigo in approximately 80% of patients.

      The innovation, the Vertigone goggle, provides both physician and patient with visual
      feedback to guide them through an accurate Epley maneuver. This changes the current treatment
      paradigm for BPPV, greatly increasing the availability of the maneuver to non-specialist
      physicians, nurse practitioners, physician's assistants and physical therapists. The device
      is designed so that the patient with recurrent vertigo can use the goggle to treat BPPV at
      home. The goggle is currently a pre-market prototype.

      The hypothesis for the study is that accuracy in the performance of the Epley maneuver
      correlates with improved clinical resolution of vertigo in BPPV patients. If the hypothesis
      is true, then there is a clear case for the utility of the visual feedback provided by the
      VertiGONE goggle in performing the maneuver.

    <description>The classic Epley maneuver involves 3 head positions: 1) the patient supine, the neck is extended 20°and the head turned 45° towards the affected ear, 2) the patient rotates his head 90° to the contralateral side, with the final head position 45° from vertical, 3) the patient turns his head 135° towards the floor on the contralateral side. For the classic Epley maneuver, the goggle coach ball markings will be set for correct positioning.</description>
