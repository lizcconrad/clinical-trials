    <textblock>
      This pilot study is intended to demonstrate that we can actually deliver the Diabetes
      Prevention Program intervention well and to show that it is likely effective. We will use
      results from this pilot study to support our application to The National Institute of Health.
      NIH is asking for health care centers to show ways to provide this treatment at a reasonable
      cost. We propose to demonstrate successful and sustainable use DPP's lifestyle intervention
      in a primary care health care setting (University of Rochester Primary Care).
