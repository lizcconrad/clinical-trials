      This is a multi-national, multi-site, observational study to determine which of two
      strategies, when used by referring physicians is superior in the diagnosis of axial
      spondyloarthritis (AS) by rheumatologists.

      Subjects will be selected using a non-probability sampling method. For each center of
      excellence, the local network of referring physicians will be assigned, according to a random
      code in a 1:1 ratio, to use one of the two referral strategies for eligible patients.

        Each of several participating national centers of excellence will establish a network with
        local primary care physicians or their equivalent who will work with the center of
        excellence and will provide referrals of suitable patients.
