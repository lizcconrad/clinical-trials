      This is a phase 1b study of Indibulin in combination with Capecitabine in advanced solid
      tumors.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the trial is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and
      optimal dosing schedule of indibulin in combination with capecitabine in subjects diagnosed
      as having advanced solid tumors.

      Secondary objectives include the determination of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), safety and
      tolerability, and preliminary activity of this combination. In addition, biological activity
      of indibulin in combination with capecitabine will be evaluated.

      Single arm, open label, Phase Ib, dose-escalation study of indibulin in combination with
      capecitabine in subjects with advanced histologically confirmed, solid tumors for which no
      standard therapy exists and for whom treatment with capecitabine is considered medically
      acceptable.

      3 subjects will be treated at each dose level. When DLT occurs in 2 or more of 6 or fewer
      subjects, MAD has been reached and the dose will be reduced to the previous dosing level,
      which will be considered the MTD.

             prothrombin time) &lt;1.1× institutional ULN

          8. Adequate bone marrow, liver and renal function as assessed by the following laboratory
             requirements to be conducted &lt;2 weeks prior to Study Day 1:

               -  Creatinine ≤1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) OR a calculated creatinine
                  clearance ≥1.50 cc/min (See Appendix 6 for calculation method)
