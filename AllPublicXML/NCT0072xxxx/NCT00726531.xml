  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the project is to evaluate the delivery, impact and cost effectiveness of a
      community based exercise programme (FaME); compared to a home based exercise programme (OEP)
      supported by similarly aged mentors; compared with usual care for primary care patients.

      Primary Objective:

        1. To determine the effect on continuation of exercise of two evidence based exercise
           programmes designed for older people, compared with usual care i.e. with no special
           interventions to promote physical activity.

           Secondary Objective:

        2. To determine the health benefits of the programmes to patients starting at various
           levels of physical activity, particularly the effects on physical and psychological
           status, health status and quality adjusted life years (QALYs).

        3. To estimate the costs of the exercise interventions and to assess the cost-effectiveness
           of community group exercise, and home-supported exercise compared with usual care.

        4. To determine the acceptability of the programmes, adherence rates, enabling factors and
           barriers to future implementation.

        5. To determine participants' perceptions of the value of exercise, and the predictors of
           continued exercise.

      A cluster controlled trial using minimisation for allocation at the level of general practice
      in two centres (London and Nottingham/Derby), to compare a community-centre based group
      exercise programme - FaME [delivered by specifically trained postural stability instructors
      (PSIs) and supplemented by home exercise and prescriptive recommendations for walking], with
      a home based exercise programme and walking plan - OEP [supported by specifically trained and
      similarly aged mentors], with two years follow-up to determine the impact, acceptability and
      adherence to the programme, and longer term continuation of exercise. Control subjects will
      continue to receive usual care in primary care. A cost-effectiveness analysis will be
      conducted within the study.

             are not already receiving any long term physiotherapy and who do not fulfill the
             exclusion criteria.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             GP does not consent to them taking part in exercise)

          -  Resting BP &gt; 180/100 mmHg, tachycardia &gt; 100bpm, uncontrolled hypertension

          -  Significant drop in BP during exercise

          -  Psychiatric conditions or physical abilities which would prevent participation in an
             exercise class (for example psychotic illness, acute systemic illness (e.g.
             pneumonia), uncontrolled visual or vestibular disturbances which the GP considers
             would exclude patients from undertaking the exercise programme, poorly controlled
             angina, acute rheumatoid arthritis, unstable or acute heart failure, or conditions
             requiring a specialist exercise programme e.g. uncontrolled epilepsy significant
             neurological disease or impairment, unable to maintain seated upright position or
             unable to move about independently indoors)

          -  Not living independently (e.g. residential care)

          -  Significant cognitive impairment (unable to follow simple instructions)
