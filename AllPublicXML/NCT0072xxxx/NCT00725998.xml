      Introduction: In Cochlear Implant (CI) users, the recording of the electrically evoked
      compound action potential (ECAP) of the auditory nerve represents an option to assess changes
      in auditory nerve responses and the interaction between the electrode and the neural tissue
      over time.

      Aim: To study ECAP in children during the first year of CI use.

      Material and methods: The ECAP characteristics have been analyzed in 13 children implanted
      younger than three years old. SERIES STUDY.

    <description>The ECAP characteristics have been analyzed in 13 children implanted younger than three years old.
Series Study Results:
During the first year of CI use there was a significant statistical growth for the amplitude of N1 peak, in basal electrodes, between the second and third returns. There were not any significant differences obtained for N1 peak, latency, slope, neither for p-NRT nor recovery time, among the returns.</description>
