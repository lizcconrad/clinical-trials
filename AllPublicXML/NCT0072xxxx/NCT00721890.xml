  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Green tea is extracted from steam treated leaves, allowing the preservation of catechins, the
      active elements of the infusion. Catechins are recognized for their anti-cancer activity.
      Catechins act on the capacity of cancer to disseminate to other organs because of their
      anti-protease action. Proteases are proteins capable of digesting the cancer environment and
      facilitating the progression of cancer cells to blood vessels which will bring them to
      distant organs. We know that ovarian cancer responds well to the initial treatment of
      chemotherapy but tends to recur rapidly. We intend to provide green tea with higher
      concentrations of catechins to women with complete remission of their ovarian cancer in an
      attempt to delay cancer relapse. We also intend to identify, with molecular technologies, the
      proteases involved in ovarian cancer recurrence and response to catechins. Our objective is
      to test the hypothesis that green tea intake may delay ovarian cancer recurrence and to
      develop tools to predict which women will best benefit of the addition of green tea to their
      initial treatment.
