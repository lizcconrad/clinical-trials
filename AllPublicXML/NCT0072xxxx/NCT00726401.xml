      You are being asked to take part in a research study of COLD-fX, a product designed to boost
      the immune system. COLD-fX is an extract from the roots of North American ginseng and it may
      offer some benefit to people with seasonal allergies.

      The purpose of the present study is to find out how effective and safe COLD-fX is in
      improving quality of life and reducing symptoms of seasonal allergies such as hay fever.
      COLD-fX is not yet approved for treatment of seasonal allergies. We are seeking to enroll 200
      participants in the Capital Health region.
