  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder requiring lifestyle modification and
      medicines, adherence to which has to be practised on a daily basis.

      Motivation of patients to adhere to treatment is difficult in clinical practice. It is well
      documented that majority of patients do not reach the glycaemic targets even in the centres
      of excellence. Regular short service messages (SMS) through cell phones could have a positive
      effect on behaviour and adherence to life style changes and compliance to drugs. It may be
      practical and feasible to use information technology as an effective and simple tool for
      motivating patients to adhere to the prescribed treatment regimen.

      In diabetic patients, frequent reminders regarding the need for adherence to LSM and drugs by
      the medical professionals will improve the compliance.

      In diabetic patients, frequent reminders by the medical professionals on the need for
      adherence to Life Style Modification (LSM) and drugs will improve the compliance. SMS may be
      an effective and cheap tool of communication. Improved compliance is likely to result in
      better glycaemic control.

      Out of total number of 200, consecutive randomization of 100 patients each to SMS or usual
      care arms will be done. Patients in the SMS group will get SMS once in 3 days as a reminder.
      Patients will be reviewed at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months from the date of randomization

      Fasting and 2hr postprandial glucose and HbA1c will be tested during each visit.

      At baseline and at the end of the study, lipids, and renal function test will also be done. A
      validated questionnaire will be used to assess physical activity, diet habits, adherence to
      drug prescriptions and frequency of monitoring of blood glucose. . Body weight, blood
      pressure, biochemical variables, scores for diet and physical activity and compliance to
      drugs, will be compared using students 't' test or chi-square test as relevant.
