  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a 7.5% Icodextrin
      peritoneal dialysis solution for once-daily long dwell exchange in patients undergoing
      Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD) in Chinese uremic patients.Patients were
      divided into Dianeal group or Extraneal group for long dwell time. Net ultrafiltration, small
      solute clearance and relationship between different transport group were used to evaluate
      efficacy of Icodextrin. Physical examination, vital signs and laboratory tests were used to
      evaluate safety of Icodextrin.

      A prospective, multicenter, randomized, double blind, parallel controlled study has been
      conducted for 5 weeks in 201 CAPD patients. These patients were randomized from 7 centers
      with 98 allocated to the Icodextrin group and 103 to the Dextrose group. Before study,
      conventional glucose-based solution was the only dialysate which can available in China.
      Extraneal® is one of peritoneal dialysate produced by Baxter which contains 7.5% Icodextrin.
      Patients involved the study were allocated to Dianeal group and Extraneal group in randomize.
      In Dianeal group, prescription was unchanged, while in Extraneal group, Extraneal dialysate
      was used instead of 2.5% Dianeal. Assessments at baseline, week 2, and week 4 included drain
      volume and levels of glucose, creatinine, and urea in the dialysate drained from the long
      dwell; physical examination; vital signs; drained body weight; laboratory analyses. Daily net
      peritoneal ultrafiltration, daily peritoneal creatine clearance and daily peritoneal urea
      nitrogen clearance were recorded prior to and 2 week, 4 week after commencing Extraneal.
