    <textblock>
      This is a study of 2 dose levels (0.16 or 0.64 mg/kg) of IMO-2055 administered by weekly
      subcutaneous (SC) injections in two patient populations, treatment naïve or previously
      treated patients. Each dose group (treatment naive or previously treated) will be randomized
      to receive one of the 2 doses being studied.
