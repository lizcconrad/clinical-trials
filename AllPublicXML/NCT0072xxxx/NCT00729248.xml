  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a laboratory investigation comparing the regulatory effects of different
      immunosuppressive therapies in an in vitro human MLR assay of selecting specific
      immunosuppressive therapy to promote a regulatory profile and determining possibly newer
      accepted dosing and drug concentrations for agents most associated with this regulatory
      profile.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Life-long immunosuppressive (IS) therapy is typically required in the great majority of organ
      transplants. Immunobiologically correct IS dosing, tapering to low levels and/or monotherapy
      could lower the incidence of complications related to IS and improve long term graft and
      patient survival. The current standard of IS care for liver transplant recipients are the
      calcineurin-inhibitors (CNIs) tacrolimus (TAC) and cyclosporine (CSA), although alternative
      IS drugs such as mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and sirolimus (SRL) are available for use in
      select patients. This is also true for kidney, pancreas and heart transplant recipients, with
      TAC being favored in each case. The ideal IS agent is one that can be given at low levels
      such that both rejection and long term toxicity are minimized. Directly related to IS
      minimization might be the development of a regulatory, &quot;tolerance profile&quot;, as assessed by ex
      vivo immunophenotyping and functional assays that might test these specific IS agents singly,
      in combination or even in sequence.

      Human Tregs and DCregs can be more predominantly generated in the presence of one of three IS
      agents with different modes of action, i.e., TAC, MMF or SRL, and in different conditions of
      antigen presentation and alloimmune incompatibility.

      This is a bench protocol studying the effects of TAC, MMF and SRL on pre operative living
      renal recipient donor pair.
