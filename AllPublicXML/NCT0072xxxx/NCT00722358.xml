        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Chronically infected with HCV genotype 1

          -  Treatment naive

          -  HCV RNA viral load of ≥10*5 IU/mL

          -  BMI 18 to 35kg/m²

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP)

          -  Any significant acute or chronic medical illness which is not stable or is not
             controlled with medication and not consistent with HCV infection

          -  HCV infected subjects who are treatment non-responder (defined as subject who received
             at least 12 weeks of SOC and continue to have a detectable HCV RNA level or subjects
             who did not attain a 2-log decline in HCV RNA levels at 12 weeks and stopped treatment

          -  HCV infected subjects who are treatment intolerant (defined as subject who are unable
             to receive at least 12 weeks of SOC due to toxicities associated with interferon
             and/or ribavirin

          -  HIV and/or HBV positive
