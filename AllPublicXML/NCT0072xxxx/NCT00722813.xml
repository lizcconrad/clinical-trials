  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study to determine patient preferences between two different diagnostic
      tests; a CT angiogram (CTA) and a catheter angiogram, both of which are used at the
      University to screen for and detect heart disease.

    <textblock>
      This is a single site study that will retrospectively and prospectively identify and enroll
      100 subjects, both male and female, 18 years of age and older who undergo both coronary
      angiography and coronary artery computed tomography (CT), using the electronic radiology and
      cardiology databases. The purpose is to conduct a survey to assess their preference for
      either test to diagnose coronary artery disease. Subjects should be within six months of
      having the tests to avoid memory and recall problems.
