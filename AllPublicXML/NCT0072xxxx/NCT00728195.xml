  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 3 fixed doses of
      JNJ-37822681 compared with placebo (an inactive substance that is compared with a drug to
      test if the drug has a real effect in a clinical trial) after 6 weeks treatment and
      olanzapine after 12 weeks treatment in participants with schizophrenia (psychiatric disorder
      with symptoms of emotional instability, detachment from reality, often with delusions and
      hallucinations, and withdrawal into the self).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical
      research study), double-blind (neither the participant nor the physician know the study
      medication drug name), randomized (study drug assigned by chance), placebo- and
      active-controlled, parallel-group (a clinical trial comparing the response in two or more
      groups of participants receiving different treatments), dose-response study in participants
      with schizophrenia. The total study duration will not exceed 16 weeks for each participant
      and will include following visits: screening, baseline, Week 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11
      and 13 (end of treatment or early withdrawal), and a post-study safety visit (1 week after
      final dose of study drug). All participants will be hospitalized during the first 2 weeks of
      treatment for detailed follow-up of safety and disease status. Following a screening period,
      participants will be randomly assigned to one of 5 treatment groups to receive oral doses of
      JNJ-37822681 (10, 20 or 30 milligram [mg] twice a day) for 12 weeks, olanzapine 15 mg daily
      for 12 weeks, or placebo for 6 weeks followed by olanzapine 15 mg daily for the remaining 6
      weeks. Olanzapine will be initiated at 10 mg daily for 1 week and then increased to 15 mg
      daily for the remainder of the treatment period. Efficacy will primarily be evaluated by
      Positive And Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Participants' safety will also be monitored at
      each visit.

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS is a 30-item scale to assess the neuropsychiatric symptoms of schizophrenia. The PANSS provides a total score and scores for 3 subscales, the positive subscale (7 items), the negative subscale (7 items), and the general psychopathology subscale (16 items), each item scored on a scale of 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme). The total score ranges from 30 to 210 and higher score indicates greater severity.</description>

    <description>The SWN is a participant self rated scale to evaluate the participant's feelings during the past 7 days on a form with 20 statements, subsequently divided into 5 subscales: mental-functioning, self-control, emotional regulation, physical functioning and social integration. Each item is scored between 1 (not at all) and 6 (very much). Total score ranges from 20-120 with higher scores indicating higher subjective well-being.</description>

    <description>The NOSIE comprises 30 items which form 6 scales: social competence, social interest, personal neatness, irritability, manifest psychosis and retardation and is completed by a suitably trained and experienced member of the nursing staff. Each item is scored from 0 (never) to 4 (always). It was assessed only at 2 weeks when the participants were hospitalized. Total score ranges from 0 to 120, with lower score indicating better results.</description>
