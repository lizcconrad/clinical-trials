  <official_title>A Single Site, Three Arm, Open Label Comparative Preference Study to Evaluate the Preference of Consumers and Health Care Professionals for the Use of Shapes by PolyMem Wound Dressings and Shapes by PolyMem Silver Wound Dressings, Each Compared to Antibiotic Ointment Covered With a Band-aid Type Dressing (Current Standard of Practice) and to Each Other in the Post-biopsy Management of Shave Biopsies. Each Participant Serves as Own Control. A Blinded Third Party Physician Will Evaluate and Compare the Wounds Based on Photos Taken at the Various Follow-up Points..</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Shave biopsies are often uncomfortable during the healing process. This is a preliminary
      study to determine if patients and clinicians prefer using PolyMem formulating dressings on
      shave biopsy sites compared to the current standard of practice, which is antibiotic ointment
      covered with a band-aid type dressing.

      Only individuals who require 2 shave biopsies on the same treatment day will be entered in
      the study. Each participant serves as their own control.
