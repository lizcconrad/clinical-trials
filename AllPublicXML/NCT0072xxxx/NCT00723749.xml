    <textblock>
      The aim of this post marketing surveillance study is to investigate the retention rate after
      12 months of drug dependence treatment with SUBOXONE® (buprenorphine plus naloxone) of opioid
      dependent patients under real life conditions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nonprobability sampling was done by invitation to volunteer with the intention to document 4
      to 5 patients per physician where a substitution therapy with Suboxone is planned and
      indicated.

Take Home prescription is defined as a prescription of up to 7 daily dosages SUBOXONE® from the treating physician which allows the patients to receive the prescribed amount of daily dosages SUBOXONE® from a pharmacy to take home and dispense the medication on his own on a daily basis.
A patient can receive only one take home prescription for up to 7 days at the time.</description>
