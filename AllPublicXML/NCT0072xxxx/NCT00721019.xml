  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of sugar and starch-like foods for energy (carbohydrate metabolism) changes when
      people sleep. However, it is still not known if differences in the amount of nighttime sleep
      have an effect on the carbohydrate metabolism of people who have a relative with type 2
      diabetes (parent, sibling, or grandparent). This study is being done to test the hypothesis
      that the carbohydrate metabolism of people who have a history of type 2 diabetes in their
      family will be different after they have slept short hours for 10 days in comparison to when
      they have slept longer hours for 10 days.

      Study participants will complete two 10-day inpatient stays in the sleep laboratory of the
      University of Chicago Clinical Resource Center scheduled at least 4 weeks apart. Bedtime
      duration will be set at 5 hours per night during one of these stays and 8.5 hours per night
      during the other. No daytime naps will be allowed. Study participants will be served regular
      daily meals including breakfast, lunch, dinner, and a bedtime snack. On weekdays all
      participants will engage in simulated &quot;office work&quot; while in the sleep laboratory. During the
      rest of the time participants will maintain their usual indoor and outdoor activities as much
      as possible within the limits of the University of Chicago campus. During the last two days
      of each inpatient stay in the laboratory, participants will undergo two different tests. The
      first test will determine how much insulin does their body produce in response to an
      intravenous glucose infusion lasting several hours. The second test will determine how
      effective is the action of the sugar-processing hormone, insulin, in their body when it is
      infused intravenously together with glucose over a period of several hours.
