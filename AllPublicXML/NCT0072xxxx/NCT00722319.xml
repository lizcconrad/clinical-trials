  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients on warfarin treatment pose particular problems when undergoing percutaneous coronary
      intervention with stent implantation (PCI-S), because of the poor definition of the optimal
      antithrombotic strategies to be adopted both peri-procedurally and during the 4 (or more)
      weeks after PCI-S, when dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel is
      recommended. In the absence of solid evidence-based data, no definite recommendations for the
      management of this patient subset are currently given in the guidelines on percutaneous
      coronary intervention issued by the most prominent Cardiology Associations. Indeed, a high
      variability has been reported in the current antithrombotic strategies, which may consist in
      either the temporary substitution of warfarin by dual antiplatelet treatment or the
      combination of warfarin and aspirin or clopidogrel or both. Peri-procedural bridging therapy
      with either intravenous unfractionated or subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin is also
      variably carried out. Purpose of this registry is to determine in patients on warfarin
      treatment undergoing PCI-S: 1) the contemporary peri-procedural and medium-term
      antithrombotic management; and 2) the relative safety and efficacy of the various
      antithrombotic regimens.
