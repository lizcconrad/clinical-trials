  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to determine whether written educational materials
      plus brief education by telephone will help patients better understand and participate in the
      decision on how many embryos to transfer to the uterus during treatment of infertility with
      in vitro fertilization (IVF). The main study hypothesis is that women and men who receive the
      study's educational intervention will experience favorable changes in knowledge and beliefs
      about benefits, susceptibility and severity of multiple gestation that impact decisions about
      the number of embryos to transfer. Secondary objectives are to understand patient beliefs,
      knowledge and information preferences regarding other possible risks of IVF, to compare
      perception of IVF-related risks to familiar risks that are included in routine preconception
      health promotion, and during IVF, and to prepare couples to manage IVF-related obstetrical
      risks when they make the transition to prenatal care after becoming pregnant.

      Medical Treatment Coverage: None, this study does not provide any monetary contribution to
      medical treatment

      The long-term objective of this research is to improve patient understanding of the known and
      strongly suspected risks from treating infertility with assisted reproductive technologies
      such as in vitro fertilization (IVF). During IVF, when more embryos are transferred to the
      uterus, the risk of pregnancy with multiple fetuses increases. In addition, single infants
      conceived with IVF are at greater risk for low birth weight. This study will promote
      behaviors that may reduce these risks. One in 3 women who completes a pregnancy conceived
      with assisted reproductive technologies such as IVF delivers multiples, and these treatments
      produce over 12,000 multiple birth deliveries annually in the United States. This study will
      lead to a better understanding of the most effective ways to counsel IVF patients about the
      embryo transfer decision. This study will also help define how to prepare IVF patients to
      work most effectively with their prenatal care team to manage IVF-related obstetrical risks.
