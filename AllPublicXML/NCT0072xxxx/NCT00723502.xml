    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the H. pylori eradication rates with
      Finafloxacin in combination with Amoxicillin or Esomeprazole.

      The secondary objective is to evaluate and compare the safety and tolerability of multiple
      oral doses of Finafloxacin plus Amoxicillin versus Finafloxacin plus Esomeprazole.
