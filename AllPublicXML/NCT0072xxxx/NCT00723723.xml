    <textblock>
      This observational study is being conducted in patients receiving statin treatment as
      secondary prevention of coronary heart disease under the current standard of care in
      compliance with European guidelines. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the percentage
      of these patients that reach target LDL levels. Additionally this study will measure the
      patient's compliance to treatment as assessed by counting the returned tablets. Both
      assessments will be made at visits conducted 6-8 weeks after the first visit and 28-32 weeks
      after the first visit.
