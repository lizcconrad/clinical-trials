  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BioCart™II is a novel scaffold seeded with autologous chondrocytes to be used to repair
      cartilage lesions of the knee. This study is designed to compare the efficacy and safety of
      BioCart™II treatment compared to microfracture which is the classical method of treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Full thickness cartilage lesions are typically incapable of self repair, are a source of pain
      and morbidity and lead to early onset osteoarthritis. A classical method of treatment has
      been microfracture where holes are drilled in the subchondral bone to allow influx of bone
      marrow cells which fill and repair the lesion. The resulting repair has been reported to be
      mixed fibrocartilage which is recognized to be less efficient and durable than hyaline
      cartilage, the physiological material making up the joint. In autologous chondrocyte
      implantation, a sample of cartilage is removed from a non-weight bearing region of the joint
      and the cells are grown and expanded in culture and then returned to the knee to repair the
      damaged cartilage. For implantation with BioCart™II, the chondrocytes are grown in the
      presence of proprietary growth factors which maintain the chondrocytes in optimal condition
      for subsequent repair. For implantation, the cells are seeded on a completely human three
      dimensional spongelike scaffold which holds the cells in the correct topology to allow for a
      rapid repair of the damaged joint with true physiological cartilage. BioCart™II is user
      friendly for the surgeon and patient alike giving it an advantage over other methods for
      autologous chondrocyte implantation that are in clinical use.

    <description>A cartilage biopsy will be harvested from patients during arthroscopy and used for chondrocyte isolation, culture and future implantation. Subjects will also have about 80 ml venous blood drawn for autologous cell culture medium. Two-four weeks following biopsy harvest, BioCart™II will be implanted into the cartilage defect after careful debridement via miniarthrotomy.</description>

    <intervention_name>Microfracture</intervention_name>
    <description>MF procedure will be carried out according to accepted practice. After careful debridement multiple perforations, or microfractures, are made in the subchondral bone using an awl. The released bone marrow forms a clot at the lesion site which is an enriched environment for new tissue formation. With the subject's consent a cartilage biopsy will be taken (at least 150 mg) and about 80 ml venous blood withdrawn. This will be used for chondrocyte culture and cryopreservation in case a later BioCart™II implantation is required after failure of the microfracture procedure.</description>
