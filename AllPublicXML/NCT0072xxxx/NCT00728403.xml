      The study is a 2 phase double blind randomized placebo control trial. The objective is to
      asses the metabolic and therapeutic effects of American Ginseng (Panax quinquefolius L.)
      extract and Korean Red Ginseng (steamed Panax C.A. Meyer) extract in the management of type 2
      diabetes in a 12 week period. One Hundred and twenty subjects with type 2 diabetes
      (hyperglycemia key inclusion criteria: HbAlc≥6.5% - ≤ 8.1% ) will participate in the study
      (36 men and 36 post-menopausal women).
