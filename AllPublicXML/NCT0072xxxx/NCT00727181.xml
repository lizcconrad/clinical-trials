  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is designed to confirm the clinical safety and effectiveness of the Trifecta valve
      by establishing associated adverse event rates, clinical status as indicated by New York
      Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification, hemodynamic performance, and hematology
      analysis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The clinical investigation is a multi-center, multi-country, prospective, non-randomized,
      observational study without concurrent or matched controls, designed to evaluate the safety
      and effectiveness of the Trifecta valve. A maximum of 120 subjects requiring aortic valve
      replacement will be implanted at a maximum of 6 investigational sites in Europe. The sample
      size is based on late patient-years of follow-up with a minimum of 400 late patient-years
      experience required.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient requires aortic valve replacement. (Note: patients undergoing concomitant
             procedures, e.g. coronary artery bypass grafting, or valve repair, are eligible for
             this study).

          2. Patient is legal age in host country.

          3. Patient (or legal guardian) has given written informed consent for participation prior
             to surgery.

          4. Patient is willing to undergo all study procedures and adhere to data collection and
             follow-up requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient is pregnant or nursing (women of child bearing potential must have a
             documented negative pregnancy test within one week prior to surgery).

          2. Patient already has a prosthetic valve(s) at a site other than the aortic valve.

          3. Patient requires concomitant replacement of the tricuspid, pulmonary, or mitral valve.

          4. Patient has an inability or is unwilling to return for the required follow-up visits.

          5. Patient has active endocarditis (patients with previous endocarditis must have two
             documented negative blood culture results prior to enrollment).

          6. Patient has had an acute preoperative neurological event defined as patient has not
             returned to baseline or has not stabilized 30 days prior to the planned valve
             implantation surgery.

          7. Patient is undergoing renal dialysis.

          8. Patient has a documented history of substance abuse within one year of enrollment or
             is currently a prison inmate.

          9. Patient is currently participating in the study of an investigational drug or device,
             or the patient was previously participating in an investigational drug study and has
             not completed a 30-day wash out period.

         10. Patient had the Trifecta valve implanted as part of this study, but then had the
             device explanted.

         11. Preoperative evaluation indicates other significant cardiovascular abnormalities such
             as aortic dissection or ventricular aneurysm.

         12. Patient has a life expectancy less than two years.
