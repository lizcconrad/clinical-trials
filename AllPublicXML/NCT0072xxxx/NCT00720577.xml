      Part A. The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of 6 weeks of treatment with,
      simvastatin, losartan or pioglitazone compared to placebo on the RNA expression profile of
      lower extremity peripheral arterial atherosclerotic plaque. Part B. The effect of
      simvastatin, losartan or pioglitazone compared to placebo on protein and lipid biomarkers in
      lower extremity peripheral arterial atherosclerotic plaque.

      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 6 week study. The study
      consists of 3 separate sub-studies in which patients undergoing bilateral lower extremity
      peripheral artery atherectomy will receive one of three FDA approved drugs known to have
      beneficial effect on the risk of cardiovascular disease. Patients will be selected for the
      particular sub-study based on a series of entry criteria and then randomized to the
      particular agent or placebo for 6-weeks.
