      The purpose of this study is to verify the accuracy and applicability of predictors of fluid
      administration efficacy in hypotensive critically ill patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe hypotension is a common life-threatening conditions in critically ill patients.
      Discriminating between the need for volume expansion or inotropic/vasoactive support is a
      main clinical goal. Pulse pressure variation are an accurate index of fluid responsiveness,
      but it needs controlled mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of at least 8 ml/kg and
      absence of arrhythmias. This could limit its clinical applicability. Moreover pulse pressure
      variation accurately predicted cardiac output increment. However the cardiac output increase
      is not a clinically relevant target in absence of low cardiac output.

      The objectives of the present protocol are: 1) to calculate the accuracy of cardiovascular
      and renal variables to predict either arterial pressure increase or clinically relevant
      improvement after fluid administration and 2) to verify how often dynamic indices could be
      applied in clinical practice.

      Arterial pressure increase is defined by mean arterial pressure above 65 mmHg or an increment
      greater than 20 % respect to basal value. Clinically relevant improvement is defined by
      restoring adequate values of arterial pressure or cardiac index or diuresis or central venous
      saturation if they are inadequate before fluid administration. These adequate values are 65
      mmHg for mean arterial pressure, 2.5 l.min-1.m-2 for cardiac index, 0.5 ml.kg-1.h-1 for the
      diuresis, 70 % for central venous saturation.
