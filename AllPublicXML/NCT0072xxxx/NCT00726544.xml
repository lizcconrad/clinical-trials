  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this ascending-dose research study is to determine whether the administration
      of ARC1779 Injection improves subject's health profile by protecting the brain, heart, and
      kidney from damage due to formation of small blood clots in blood vessels. It will also
      determine the safety of ARC1779 Injection, how ARC1779 Injection enters and leaves the blood
      and tissue over time, and its effect on laboratory tests related to blood clotting, heart and
      brain function, and other body systems.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female;

          -  ≥18 to ≤75 years of age;

          -  Diagnosis of TMA based on presence of:

          -  Thrombocytopenia, defined as a platelet count &lt;100 x 109 per liter;

          -  Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, defined by negative findings on direct antiglobulin
             test, and evidence of accelerated red blood cell (RBC) production and destruction);
             AND

          -  Absence of a clinically apparent alternative explanation for thrombocytopenia and
             anemia, e.g., disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), eclampsia, HELLP syndrome,
             Evans syndrome;

          -  Females: non-pregnant and commit to use of effective, redundant methods of
             contraception (i.e., for both self and male partner) throughout the study and for at
             least 30 days after discontinuation of study drug treatment;

          -  Males: commit to use of a medically acceptable contraceptive (abstinence or use of a
             condom with spermicide) throughout the study and for at least 30 days after
             discontinuation of study drug treatment;

          -  Not received an unlicensed investigational agent (drug, device, or blood-derived
             product) within 30 days prior to randomization, and may not receive such an
             investigational agent in the 30 days post-randomization (note: investigational use for
             treatment of TMA of a licensed immunomodulator, e.g., rituximab, is permitted at any
             time relative to randomization);

          -  Capable of understanding and complying with the protocol, and he/she (or a legal
             representative) must have signed the informed consent document prior to performance of
             any study-related procedures.

        Patients who have again become acutely ill following recent treatment and achievement of a
        brief remission of acute TMA may be enrolled in the study if ALL of the following
        conditions are met:

          -  Disease activity in the patient in unabated (e.g. persistent thrombocytopenia and
             microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with ongoing neurological symptoms and/or troponin
             elevation);

          -  The last plasma exchange of the patient's preceding course of treatment occurred at
             least 7 days prior;

          -  The patient did not undergo splenectomy during the preceding course of treatment;

          -  The new course of plasma exchange has not been ongoing for more than 3 days.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Females: pregnant or &lt;24 hours post-partum, or breastfeeding;

          -  History of bleeding diathesis or evidence of active abnormal bleeding within the
             previous 30 days;

          -  Disseminated malignancy or other co-morbid illness limiting life expectancy to ≤3
             months independent of the TMA disorder.

          -  Diagnosis other than TMA which can account for the findings of thrombocytopenia and
             hemolytic anemia (e.g., DIC, HELLP syndrome, Evans syndrome);

          -  Diagnosis of DIC verified by laboratory values for D-dimer, fibrinogen, prothrombin
             time (PT), and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT).

        Patients who have again become acutely ill following recent treatment and achievement of a
        brief remission of acute TMA may not be enrolled in the study if ANY of the following
        conditions are met:

          -  The last plasma exchange of the patient's preceding course of treatment occurred less
             than 7 days prior;

          -  The patient underwent splenectomy during the preceding course of treatment;

          -  The new course of plasma exchange has been ongoing for more than 3 days.
