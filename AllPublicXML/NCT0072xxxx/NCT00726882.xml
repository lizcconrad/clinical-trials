  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this follow-up study is to evaluate the frequency and persistence of specific
      viral mutations in response to treatment with ABT-333 (dasabuvir).

      This Phase 2, multicenter study was conducted in HCV-infected participants who received
      ABT-333 at any dose level or matching placebo in a prior clinical study involving ABT−333.
      Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected participants who received ABT-333 at any dose level or
      matching placebo in Study M10-351 Substudy 2 (NCT00696904; ABT-333 dosing duration was 2
      days) and Study M10-380 (NCT00851890; ABT-333 dosing duration was 28 days) were eligible.

      After receiving at least 1 dose of ABT-333 or placebo, subjects were assessed for
      participation in this rollover study and asked to review the informed consent. The day of
      study completion or early discontinuation from the prior ABT-333 clinical study served as the
      baseline assessment. If it was found that a participant received placebo during the previous
      ABT-333 clinical study, the sites were instructed to discontinue the participant from this
      study.

      This study included approximately monthly blood sample collection procedures for 48 weeks,
      and no treatment was provided during this time.

    <time_frame>Baseline (day of study completion or early discontinuation from the prior ABT-333 clinical study), 48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants in studies M10-351 (NCT00851890) and M10-380 (NCT00696904) were analyzed for persistence of resistance-associated variants by comparing post-treatment clonal sequence data with baseline and on-treatment sequence data from M10-351 and M10-380 studies to assess amino acid changes. Phenotypic resistance to ABT-333 was assessed by calculating the fold change in half maximal effective concentration (EC50) of post-treatment samples compared with the EC50 value for the corresponding baseline sample as determined for M10-351 and M10-380 studies. The number of participants with variants at resistance-associated amino acid positions and phenotypic resistance at post-treatment time points are presented. Variants are included if the absolute percent of total clones encoding the variant was at least 10% greater than at baseline in a post-treatment sample.</description>

    <description>Only serious adverse events that the investigator considered causally related to study procedures (i.e., venipuncture) were to be collected in this study. A serious adverse event was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject that the investigator believed to be causally related to a study procedure and met at least 1 of the following criteria: death, life-threatening, hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, congenital anomaly, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, important medical event requiring medical or surgical intervention to prevent serious outcome, elective or spontaneous abortion.</description>

        <description>Only serious adverse events that the investigator considered causally related to study procedures (i.e., venipuncture) were to be collected in this study. A serious adverse event was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject that the investigator believed to be causally related to a study procedure and met at least 1 of the following criteria: death, life-threatening, hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, congenital anomaly, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, important medical event requiring medical or surgical intervention to prevent serious outcome, elective or spontaneous abortion.</description>
