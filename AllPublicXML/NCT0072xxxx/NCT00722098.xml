  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the combination of chemotherapy
      (Cyclophosphamide) and CD34-DC vaccines results in the improved rate of clinical responses
      for stage IV melanoma patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vaccination of patients with metastatic melanoma using ex vivo generated dendritic cells
      (DCs) loaded with tumor-associated antigen(s) have been shown to induce tumor-specific
      immunity against melanoma antigens measured by in vitro assays and, in some cases, tumor
      regression. At the present time, the numbers of recorded patients with metastatic melanoma
      who have been treated with DC vaccinations are too small to predict with certainty the future
      of overall therapeutic value of DC vaccinations in the management of patients with metastatic
      melanoma. The purpose of this study is to gather data on feasibility and efficacy of novel
      combination therapy of CPA and a DC vaccine outlined in this protocol to treat metastatic
      melanoma.

    <description>Patients will receive a fixed dose of about ≥15x106 viable dendritic cells per injection. Patients will receive a total of 8 doses of the vaccination with each individual dose being administered at weeks: 0, 2, 4, 6, 10, 14, 18 and 22. Responses will be evaluated and patients with SD, PR or CR may receive 4 more vaccine at 36, 48, 72 and 96 weeks, if there is vaccine available. The vaccine will be injected subcutaneously, in 3 separate injection sites (3.3.ml per site) in the upper and lower extremities.
Patients will receive either CPA 300mg/m2 for injections administered intravenously over a 2-hour infusion in the outpatient clinic 24 hours prior to DC vaccinations # 1, 3, 5, 6 and 7.</description>

         10. Written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who have received &gt; 8 cycles of cytotoxic chemotherapy or metastatic melanoma

          2. Patients who have received any chemotherapy &lt; 4 weeks before the beginning of the

             the viral infection and this additional parameter will interfere with the evaluation
             of DC induced immune responses in melanoma patients. Furthermore, the safety of
             collecting DCs, loading them with antigen and re-infusing these cells to HIV+ patients
             has not yet been determined.)

          9. Pregnancy (Pregnancy is associated with considerable immunosuppression 70 and this
             additional parameter will interfere with the evaluation of DC induced immune responses
             in melanoma patients. In addition, the safety and tolerability of cell body-loaded DC
             given subcutaneously is entirely unknown.)
