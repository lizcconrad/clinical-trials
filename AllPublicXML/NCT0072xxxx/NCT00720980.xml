  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Granuloma annulare is a benign, usually self-limiting, cutaneous dermatosis, which typically
      presents as asymptomatic, flesh-colored or red papules, frequently arranged in an annular
      pattern on the distal extremities. Although localized granuloma annulare is most commonly
      observed, a generalized or disseminated form can occur. The etiology of granuloma annulare is
      unknown, however, multiple inciting factors have been proposed. The purpose of the
      investigators is to review the outcomes of treatment of granuloma annulare (GA) resistant to
      standard regimens that resolved after a 3-months treatment course of monthly rifampin,
      ofloxacin, and minocycline (ROM) therapy, successfully used to treat paucibacillary leprosy,
      a disease with clinical and histopathologic similarity to GA.

      We will document the regimen treatment each patient has had and then review the following
      from the patient's chart to target our specific aims as outlined above.

        1. What previous treatment options have been or/are currently being used?

        2. How long did the patient take the treatment for?

        3. Was the patient able to discontinue or become less dependent on prior treatment?

        4. Was the disease process slowed by the treatment?;

        5. Were there any side effects that the patient experienced with treatment?

        The investigators reported 6 cases of resistant GA that resolved after a 3-month treatment
        course of monthly rifampin, ofloxacin, and minocycline (ROM) therapy. ROM therapy has been
        successfully used to treat patients with paucibacillary leprosy, which has morphologic and
        histologic similarities to GA.
