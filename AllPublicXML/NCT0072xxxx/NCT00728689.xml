  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetic parameters and safety of a
      single dose of ST-246 400mg Form I versus ST-246 400mg Form V capsules in fed normal healthy
      volunteers.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a Phase I, double-blind, cross-over, single-dose study of the orally administered
      anti-orthopoxvirus compound, ST-246, to 12 healthy, fed volunteers between the ages of 18 and
      50 years. Subjects were randomized such that 6 subjects received either ST-246 Form I
      (monohydrate) followed 10 days later after a wash-out period by Form V (hemihydrate), and 6
      subjects received ST-246 Form V followed by Form I, as for the previous group.

      Both forms of ST-246 were similar in the way they were manufactured. The only difference
      between Form I and Form V may be related to how it dissolves, and this may affect the way
      that it is absorbed in the human body. Information about any side-effects that may occur will
      also be collected in this study.
