  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and treatment effect of 50 mg odanacatib (MK-0822) with
      Vitamin D versus placebo with Vitamin D in postmenopausal women with low bone density. The
      primary efficacy hypothesis is that odanacatib will increase aBMD at the lumbar spine
      compared to placebo at 12 months.

    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline to Month 12 in Lumbar Spine Areal Bone Mineral Density (aBMD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>aBMD (g/cm^2) was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at the lumbar spine and mean BMD measurements from at least 3 evaluable lumbar spine vertebrae (L1-L4) were used. If a vertebra was fractured at baseline or became fractured during the study, its BMD measurement was excluded from the analysis and the lumbar spine BMD was recalculated based on the three remaining vertebrae. aBMD data was centrally evaluated and all areal BMD measurements included a longitudinal BMD correction factor as determined by the quality control center. aBMD at the lumbar spine was assessed at the Screening visit (Baseline), Month 6, Month 12, and Month 24 for the repeated measures longitudinal Analysis of Covariates (ANCOVA) model, with percent change from baseline at Months 12 and 24 pre-specified to be reported as primary and secondary outcome measures, respectively.</description>

    <description>An AE was defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the SPONSOR's products, whether or not considered related to the use of the product. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition which is temporally associated with the use of the SPONSOR's product was also an AE. The percentage of participants that experienced at least one AE was reported for each treatment arm.</description>

          <title>Percent Change From Baseline to Month 24 in Lumbar Spine aBMD</title>
          <description>aBMD (g/cm^2) was measured by DXA at the lumbar spine and mean BMD measurements from at least 3 evaluable vertebrae from L1 through L4 were used. If a vertebra was fractured at baseline or became fractured during the study, its BMD measurement was excluded from the analysis and the lumbar spine BMD was recalculated based on the three remaining vertebrae. aBMD data was centrally evaluated and all areal BMD measurements included a longitudinal BMD correction factor as determined by the quality control center. aBMD at the lumbar spine was assessed at the Screening visit (Baseline), Month 6, Month 12, and Month 24 for the repeated measures longitudinal ANCOVA model, with percent change from baseline at Months 12 and 24 pre-specified to be reported as primary and secondary outcome measures, respectively.</description>

          <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Hip Trochanter aBMD</title>
          <description>aBMD (g/cm^2) data was measured by DXA at the hip trochanter. All measurements utilized the same hip and at least 2 vertebrae for all time points. The left hip only was scanned. If the left hip was unevaluable, then the right hip was scanned. Once the appropriate leg was identified for scanning, it was used for all subsequent measurements. aBMD data was centrally evaluated and all areal BMD measurements included a longitudinal BMD correction factor as determined by the quality control center. aBMD at the hip trochanter was assessed at the Screening visit (Baseline), Month 6, Month 12, and Month 24 for the repeated measures longitudinal ANCOVA model, with percent change from baseline at Months 12 and 24 pre-specified to be reported as secondary outcome measures.</description>
