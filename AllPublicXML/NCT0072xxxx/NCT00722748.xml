      This proposal puts forward a research plan to initiate a genetic databank, henceforth
      referred to as The Genebank at Scripps Clinic Registry. This database will usher in genomic
      research at Scripps as we strive to stay at the forefront of cardiovascular research in the
      new century. Human subject donation allows for the creation of the proposed genebank.

    <textblock>
      The completion of the human genome project within the final months of the previous
      millennium, is a landmark of scientific accomplishment. This achievement heralds the
      importance human and molecular genetics will play in the coming century in medicine. In
      short, one expects that dissecting the phenotypic aspects of disease to a culprit
      mutation/variation of a gene or collection of genes, will modify and or augment our present
      diagnostic ability leading on to new therapeutic interventions that are targeted based on
      these discoveries.

      The broad application of human genetics will progress from the study of rare mendelian traits
      with complete penetrance compiled over the last 3-4 decades to a large number of &quot;common&quot;
      diseases that have multi-gene etiology with variable penetrance such as non-insulin dependent
      diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Cardiology will probably stay at a forefront of this
      transformation, as cardiovascular diseases (CVD) remain the major source of morbidity and
      mortality in developing countries, and is fast reaching the same status in the underdeveloped
      countries. Furthermore, the track record of rapid adaptation of new technology and research
      in the field of cardiology, would give further impetus to this transition. In the midst of
      these dynamic currents, this proposal puts forward a research plan to initiate a genetic
      databank, henceforth referred to as The Genebank at Scripps Clinic Registry. This database
      will usher in genomic research at Scripps as we strive to stay at the forefront of
      cardiovascular research in the new century.

      The objective of this study is, to obtain blood samples in order to define genes for various
      cardiovascular conditions. The blood samples will go through DNA analysis and noted for 1
      million SNP's per individual.

      Cardiac Catheterization Patients

      Blood will be collected from the patients that will undergo heart catheterization for
      establishing a gene bank registry. Informed consent will take place prior to cardiac
      catheterization. 38 cc of blood collected will be processed to create a repository of DNA,
      RNA, and lymphoblastoid cell-line immortalization on selected patient populations, plasma and
      serum. The DNA will be amplified in certain patient populations to preserve the quantity.

        Subjects will be recruited from Scripps Health general diagnostic population, cardiology
        population, and outside referrals. Upon meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria, each
        eligible patient will be given a consent form and the study will be discussed with them in
        a face-to-face discussion with the principal investigator, one of the co-investigators or
        one of the research coordinators. The patient (or legal representative) must sign the
        informed consent form prior to any study related procedures being performed.
