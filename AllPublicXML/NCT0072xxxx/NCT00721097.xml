  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease, affecting up to 10 % of the general population in
      developed countries. Corticosteroids are necessary to control symptoms, but induce adverse
      events sometimes intolerable. In severe asthma, which represent 5 to 10% of global asthma,
      corticosteroids frequently fail to prevent severe exacerbations, leading to emergency care,
      hospitalization and sometimes death. The aim of this study is to identify predictive factors
      specific for exacerbation outcome which will lead to a minor increase in treatment in order
      to prevent exacerbations, while minimizing drug adverse effects.
