      The study is a randomized controlled trial of a 5-session positive affect skills intervention
      compared to an attention-matched control condition. Participants will be 200 men and women
      who have tested positive for HIV within the past 12 weeks. Both intervention and control
      sessions will be approximately one hour long and will be administered one-on-one by trained
      facilitators. Both groups will have daily home practice over the 5 weeks of the intervention.
      At the end of the assessment period, participants in the control condition will have the
      opportunity to attend a Â½ day group session that provides a condensed version of the positive
      affect skills taught in the intervention condition. Participants will complete assessments at
      four points and CD4 and viral load assays will be run at 3 time points.
