  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An important challenge for the field of injury prevention and control is the translation of
      research findings into effective community-based prevention programs and practices. The
      National Center for Injury Prevention and Control believes that dissemination research can
      overcome this challenge by providing insight into the structures and methods needed to
      translate injury control research into everyday practice. The proposed dissemination research
      study will rigorously assess whether the use of a &quot;facilitative system&quot; can successfully
      bridge the gap between injury prevention and control research and the implementation of
      evidence-driven, community-based programs, policies, and practices. The facilitative system
      links communities with academic partners to provide communities with the skills and resources
      needed to help facilitate the community health improvement process. The system identifies
      what assets are available within communities, as well as the skills and resources needed to
      work through the community health improvement process. The facilitative system will then
      provide technical assistance, best practices guides, and direct consultation in carrying out
      all phases of the community health improvement process. This information is designed to
      increase community capacity in community assessment, coalition development, accessing and
      interpreting local injury prevention data, searching and selecting evidence-based research,
      and program planning and evaluation. The study will use a randomized community trial design
      to evaluate fall injury occurrence and process measures of program implementation in three
      groups of communities:

        -  a control group receiving no special resources or guidance related to fall injury
           prevention or the community health improvement process;

        -  a &quot;Standard Program&quot; group receiving modest funding to implement an &quot;evidence-based&quot;
           fall prevention program in their local community;

        -  a &quot;Facilitative System&quot; group receiving facilitative system support in addition to the
           resources provided the Standard Program group.

      We hypothesize that the Facilitative System program will be more effective at:

        -  reducing fall-related injuries in the elderly;

        -  building community coalitions that are goal-oriented and sustainable;

        -  implementing community-based, evidence-driven fall prevention programs that are both
           tailored to the community needs and yet faithful to empirically-tested fall prevention
           research studies

    <description>Rates of fall injury diagnoses per 100 person-years (P-Y) were computed for the communities in each of the study groups for a 2 year baseline period, 2007-2008, and for a 2 year follow-up period corresponding to years 2010-2011. Change in fall injury rates and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) are reported. A mixed-effects Poisson regression model was used to test the presence of an interaction effect on the fall rate between study group and time period (baseline or follow-up). The test is intended to detect a differential time effect by study group. This model, with main effects for study group and time period and an interaction term, will be referred to as the primary model. Model coefficients and incidence rate ratios (IRR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) are reported.</description>

facilitative system: The facilitative system links communities with academic partners to provide communities with the skills and resources needed to help facilitate the community health improvement process. The system identifies what assets are available within communities, as well as the skills and resources needed to work through the community health improvement process. The facilitative system will then provide technical assistance, best practices guides, and direct consultation in carrying out all phases of the community health improvement process. This information is designed to increase community capacity in community assessment, coalition development, accessing and interpreting local injury prevention data, searching and selecting evidence-based research, and program planning and evaluation.</description>

          <title>Emergency Department and In-patient Hospitalization for Fall Injury</title>
          <description>Rates of fall injury diagnoses per 100 person-years (P-Y) were computed for the communities in each of the study groups for a 2 year baseline period, 2007-2008, and for a 2 year follow-up period corresponding to years 2010-2011. Change in fall injury rates and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) are reported. A mixed-effects Poisson regression model was used to test the presence of an interaction effect on the fall rate between study group and time period (baseline or follow-up). The test is intended to detect a differential time effect by study group. This model, with main effects for study group and time period and an interaction term, will be referred to as the primary model. Model coefficients and incidence rate ratios (IRR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) are reported.</description>
