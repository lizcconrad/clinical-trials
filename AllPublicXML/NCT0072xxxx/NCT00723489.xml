  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the Atopic Dermatitis and Vaccinia Immunization Network (ADVN) is to
      reduce the risk of the fatal reaction, eczema vaccinatum (EV), to the smallpox vaccination in
      those with atopic dermatitis (AD). Since vaccination with live vaccinia virus (VV) in
      individuals with AD increases the risk of EV, a yellow fever vaccine was chosen. The purpose
      of this study is to determine the immune response to a yellow fever vaccine in adults with
      AD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AD is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder characterized by recurrent viral skin infections.
      The purpose of this study is to understand the immune response to a yellow fever vaccine in
      adults with AD. This study will provide substantial information about normal and defective
      cutaneous immunity in participants with AD in response to a live virus vaccine, which is
      critical for understanding the EV reaction.

      An individual's participation in the study will last up to 13 weeks. Participants will be
      randomized into one of two arms. The first experimental arm will consist of 20 adults with AD
      and 20 healthy adults. They will receive one dose of YFV-17D by subcutaneous administration
      in the right deltoid and receive one dose of YFV-17D placebo by transcutaneous administration
      in the left deltoid. The second arm will consist of 20 adults with AD and 20 healthy adults.
      They will receive one dose of YFV-17D placebo by subcutaneous administration in the right
      deltoid and receive one dose of YFV-17D vaccine transcutaneously in the left deltoid.

      This study will consist of 6 follow-up visits over a 35 day period after study entry.

    <description>Log10 Neutralization Index (LNI) is the Log10 difference in virus titer (measurement of amount of virus) between pre-vaccination and post-vaccination. An LNI greater than or equal to 0.7 suggests that a person has active immunity against Yellow Fever virus.</description>

    <time_frame>30 days after Yellow Fever (YF) immunization (Acceptable Blood Draw Range: Day 28 - Day 35 after YF immunization)</time_frame>
    <description>Neutralization titer (NT50) is the dilution of serum (antibody) that results in a 50% reduction in the amount of virus. A higher NT50 number reflects the presence of more protective antibody levels against the Yellow Fever virus. Some studies have used an NT50 titer of 1:10 or 1:20 as the minimum level to suggest that a person has active immunity against the Yellow Fever virus.</description>

          <description>Log10 Neutralization Index (LNI) is the Log10 difference in virus titer (measurement of amount of virus) between pre-vaccination and post-vaccination. An LNI greater than or equal to 0.7 suggests that a person has active immunity against Yellow Fever virus.</description>

        <description>Neutralization titer (NT50) is the dilution of serum (antibody) that results in a 50% reduction in the amount of virus. A higher NT50 number reflects the presence of more protective antibody levels against the Yellow Fever virus. Some studies have used an NT50 titer of 1:10 or 1:20 as the minimum level to suggest that a person has active immunity against the Yellow Fever virus.</description>
