      Objectives:

      To describe the safety and efficacy of intravitreal flucinolone acetonide implants in the
      management of patients having refractory ocular Behcet's disease

      Hypothesis:

      A descriptive observational study

      Study design:

      A 1-year, multi-center (including four Korean medical centers) observational study

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A multi-center, prospective single arm study to assess the efficacy and safety of retisert
      (intravitreal flucinolone acetonide 0.59 mg) in patients with refractory ocular Behcet's
      disease. This study will be conducted at 4 sites, located in Korea. The number of subject is
      expected approximately 15 patients. The medical records for the patients meeting following
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be collected until 1 year after implantation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males and non-pregnant females at least 18 years of age having complete or incomplete
             type of Behcet's disease according to the revised diagnostic criteria proposed by the
             Behcet's Disease Research Committee of Japan in 2003; typical ocular lesion and at
             least, one of the main symptoms or two of the additional symptoms.

          -  One or both eyes having a history of recurrent or chronic ocular Behcet's disease
             affecting the eye more than 1 year duration requiring either systemic corticosteroid
             or other equivalent systemic therapy for at least three months prior to enrollment; OR
             at least 2 sub-Tenon's injections of corticosteroid for the management of uveitis
             during the six months prior to enrollment; OR at least 2 separate recurrences within
             the six months prior to enrollment requiring either systemic corticosteroid therapy or
             sub-Tenon's injection of corticosteroids

          -  At the time of enrollment the implanted eye must have: ≤ 10 anterior chamber cells/HPF
             and a vitreous haze ≤ grade 2

          -  Visual acuity of at least 1.4 logMAR units (Snellen 20/500).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Allergy to FA or any component of the delivery system

          -  History of only posterior segment uveitis not accompanied by vitritis or macular edema
