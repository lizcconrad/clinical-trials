  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if ramucirumab given as monotherapy is effective in
      the treatment of Persistent or Recurrent Epithelial Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Primary
      Peritoneal Carcinoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current chemotherapies used to treat ovarian cancer participants include doxorubicin,
      topotecan, and paclitaxel, to mention a few. Doxorubicin was studied in ovarian cancer
      participants that were refractory to paclitaxel and platinum-based chemotherapy agents.
      Inhibition of angiogenesis is considered a promising approach to the treatment of cancer.
      Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an important regulator of angiogenesis and is
      likely an important therapeutic target in persistent or recurrent epithelial ovarian,
      fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma. VEGF is overexpressed in ovarian tissue and
      may be the most important single tumor angiogenic factor. Phase 1 studies currently nearing
      completion with ramucirumab have demonstrated safety and tolerability at clinically relevant
      doses, with preliminary evidence of clinical efficacy in ovarian cancer participants.
      Therefore, ImClone Systems plans to conduct a Phase 2 trial to assess the safety and efficacy
      of ramucirumab in participants with platinum-refractory persistent or recurrent epithelial
      ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Progression-Free Survival at 6 Months (PFS-6)</measure>
    <time_frame>First Dose to 6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Data presented are the percentage of participants without progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause at 6 month after first dose. PD was determined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria version 1.0. PD is ≥20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions and/or unequivocal progression of non-target lesion and/or new lesion.</description>

    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR): Percentage of Participants With Complete Response (CR) and Partial Response (PR)</measure>
    <time_frame>First dose to date of objective progressive disease /death or new anti-cancer therapy up to 34.6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Objective response is confirmed complete response (CR) + partial response (PR), as classified by the investigators according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria version 1.0. CR is disappearance of all target and non-target lesions; PR is ≥30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions without new lesion and progression of non-target lesion. ORR is calculated as a total number of participants with CR or PR from the start of study treatment until disease progression/recurrence or the start of new therapeutic anticancer treatment, whichever occurred first, divided by the total number of participants treated, then multiplied by 100.</description>

    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>First dose to measured progressive disease or death due to any cause up to 34.6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as the time from date of first dose to the first observation of progression of disease (PD) or death due to any cause. PD was determined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria version 1.0. PD is ≥20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions and/or unequivocal progression of non-target lesion and/or new lesion. For participants who had no PD or death or had started new therapeutic anticancer treatment, PFS was censored at their last radiographic tumor assessment.</description>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>First dose to death due to any cause up to 43.9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival is defined as the time from first dose to the date of death due to any cause. For participants who were alive or were lost to follow-up, overall survival was censored on the last date the participant was known to be alive.</description>

             (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)], as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria
             in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Tumors within a previously irradiated field will be
             designated as &quot;nontarget&quot; lesions unless progression is documented or a biopsy is
             obtained to confirm persistence at least 90 days following completion of radiation
             therapy

          3. The participant has recovered to Grade ≤ 1 by the National Cancer Institute Common
             Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 3.0 (NCI-CTCAE v3.0) from the effects
             of recent surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or other targeted
             therapies for ovarian cancer, with the exception of alopecia or peripheral neuropathy
             (which must have resolved to Grade ≤ 2). Any other prior therapy directed at the
             malignant tumor must be discontinued at least three weeks prior to the first dose of
             study medication, or hormonal therapy discontinued at least one week prior to the

             study medication

          4. The participant has received prior radiotherapy to any portion of the abdominal cavity
             or pelvis other than for the treatment of ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary

        <title>Objective Response Rate (ORR): Percentage of Participants With Complete Response (CR) and Partial Response (PR)</title>
        <description>Objective response is confirmed complete response (CR) + partial response (PR), as classified by the investigators according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria version 1.0. CR is disappearance of all target and non-target lesions; PR is ≥30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions without new lesion and progression of non-target lesion. ORR is calculated as a total number of participants with CR or PR from the start of study treatment until disease progression/recurrence or the start of new therapeutic anticancer treatment, whichever occurred first, divided by the total number of participants treated, then multiplied by 100.</description>
