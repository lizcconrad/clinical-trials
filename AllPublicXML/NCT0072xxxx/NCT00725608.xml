    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the acceptability and safety of switching to
      Suboxone® (buprenorphine plus naloxone) and the effect of the switch on medication
      dispensing. Subjects, for whom a therapy with Suboxone® is indicated and planned prior to
      study enrollment and who are willing to participate, will initiate therapy on Day 1 of the
      study. The dosage will be adjusted between Day 2 to 7 depending on patient's needs and
      determined by the treating physicians in accordance with the SmPC of Suboxone®. Data will be
      collected at baseline, day 1 til 7, the end of weeks 2 and 4 and monthly up to the end of
      Month 12.
