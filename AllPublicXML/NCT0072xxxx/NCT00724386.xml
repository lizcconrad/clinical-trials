    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine the feasibility based on toxicity and response rate of
      giving paclitaxel weekly with concomitant every-other week radiotherapy to limit skin
      toxicity. This study will also seek to determine the maximally tolerated dose of Navelbine
      added to this combination when followed by Filgrastim and the dose-limiting toxicities of
      this regimen.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the male or female breast
             (male or female) with gross, uncontrolled, unresectable breast and/or chest wall
             disease including:

               1. patients with locally advanced unresectable stage IIIa or IIIb;

               2. patients with locally recurrent (including locoregional lymph nodes) disease for
                  which curative surgery is not thought possible

               3. patients with metastatic disease AND uncontrolled locoregional disease are
                  eligible.

          -  Prior chemotherapy allowed, except for nitrosoureas and mitomycin chemotherapy or high
             dose chemotherapy with marrow or stem cell rescue.

          -  Prior palliative radiation to sites of metastases allowed (i.e. bone, brain, lung)

          -  4 weeks since any prior treatments (excluding hormonal therapy). Concurrent hormonal
             therapy is not allowed.

          -  Aged 18 years or older

          -  CALGB performance status of 0 - 2

          -  Life expectance of at least 12 weeks

          -  Initial Laboratory Data:

               -  ANC Count &gt; 1500/mm3

               -  Platelet Count &gt; 100,000/mm3

               -  Creatine ≤ 2.0 mg/dl

               -  Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dl

               -  ALT (SGPT) ≤ 3 times the upper limit of normal

          -  Signed informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior breast or chest wall radiation is not allowed unless the proposed site radiation
             port does not overlap with prior ports

          -  Subjects must not be pregnant (females able to have children must have negative
             pregnancy test and agree to use adequate contraception)

          -  Patients with a documented hypersensitivity to E.coli derived proteins are excluded.

          -  No other serious medical condition such as uncontrolled infection that in the opinion
             of the investigators places patient at undue risk for study treatment
