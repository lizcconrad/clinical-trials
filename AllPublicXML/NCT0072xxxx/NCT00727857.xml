    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of pioglitazone, twice daily (BID),
      combined with metformin versus pioglitazone taken alone and metformin taken alone in treating
      Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.

    <textblock>
      Pioglitazone hydrochloride (ACTOS®) is a member of a class of oral antidiabetic agents known
      as thiazolidinediones, which act by reducing insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is a key
      feature of dysmetabolic syndrome and has been suggested to be the common pathophysiologic
      basis of both atherosclerosis and type 2 diabetes. Pioglitazone binds to peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptors, an effect that is associated with altered transcription of
      genes capable of influencing carbohydrate and lipid metabolism.

      Metformin hydrochloride is an oral antihyperglycemic drug not chemically or pharmacologically
      related to thiazolidinediones. Metformin is a biguanide, which has been shown to be effective
      in improving glycemic control in diabetic patients. Metformin inhibits hepatic glucose
      production, most likely through an inhibition of gluconeogenesis, and its use is associated
      with an improvement in tissue sensitivity to insulin. In accordance with published algorithms
      for the use of combination therapy for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, physicians have
      traditionally combined metformin with other antidiabetic agents.

      This study will determine the effect of a fixed-dose combination of metformin with
      pioglitazone, compared to metformin monotherapy and pioglitazone monotherapy.

      Study participation is anticipated to be approximately 6.5 months.
