      The aim of this study is to compare the clinical outcomes of root coverage procedures, using
      coronally advanced flap in combination with acellular dermal matrix with or without enamel
      matrix derivatives .

    <textblock>
      coverage of gingival recession defects has been considered as a matter of interest for dental
      practitioners.subjects with a paired gingival recession defect will be selected from the
      patients who sought dental treatment at our department.Random allocation of the treatment
      sites to test (CAF+ EMD+ADM) and control (CAF + ADM) groups will be performed by a person who
      is external to the study and using a computerized selection of random numbers for allocation
      of the study groups.The parameters of the study are as following items: probing depth( PD),
      clinical attachment level (CAL), width of keratinized tissue (WKT), recession depth from
      cemento- enamel junction (RD), recession width (RW), distance between mucogingival junction
      and the stent (MGJ), Plaque (PI) and gingival (GI) indices and root coverage percentage (RC)
      and the patients will be followed up for 6 months.
