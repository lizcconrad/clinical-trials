  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the first year of treatment after a FE of SCZ, 75% to 90% of patients achieve remission
      from psychotic symptoms. However, approximately 40% of FE patients are non-adherent to
      medication regimes and more than 60% have intermittent periods of gaps of non-adherence.
      Relapse rates are high with 82% of patients relapsing at least once within 5 years.
      Unfortunately even amongst those who do achieve full remission from psychotic symptoms,
      functional recovery remains a major challenge for patients. All the evidence suggests that
      individuals with SCZ do best with a combination of pharmacology and psychosocial
      intervention. Cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) is gaining recognition as an effective
      treatment in SCZ and is in fact the only psychosocial treatment in SCZ with proven durability
      at short term follow-up. Although it is currently being used, the investigators need to learn
      more about the impact of CBT on FE SCZ especially as experts are advocating for CBT to be a
      critical component of FE clinical services.

      The primary problem to be addressed is the incomplete functional recovery following a FE of
      SCZ and whether CBT is an effective treatment to aid this recovery. If CBT were to positively
      impact recovery in the FE we then need to address (i) which mechanisms are responsible for
      this improvement, and (ii) whether this treatment is effective for all FE patients.
