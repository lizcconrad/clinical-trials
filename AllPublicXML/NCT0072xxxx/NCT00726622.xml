      This study is being done to compare two types of surgery currently used for rectal cancer.
      The two types of surgery are laparoscopic-assisted rectal resection and open laparotomy
      rectal resection. Although laparoscopic-assisted rectal resection is being used for rectal
      cancer in some medical centers, the effectiveness of this type of surgery compared to open
      surgery is unknown. The study will compare the safety and effectiveness of the surgeries,
      recovery from surgery in the hospital, overall recovery from surgery and cancer outcome.

      This is a multicenter study. Patients eligible for this trial will have completed 5FU based
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy/radiation therapy per the institution's standard of care or IRB
      approved clinical trial. Patients may be registered/randomized anytime after completion of
      neoadjuvant therapy, but surgery must occur within 4-12 weeks (28-84 days) after completion
      of neoadjuvant therapy. Patients are stratified according to the site of the primary tumor
      (high, middle or low rectum), registering surgeon, and planned operative procedure (low
      anterior resection or abdominal perineal resection). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms. Please see the arms section for more details. The primary and secondary
      objectives are listed below.

      Primary Objective:

      To test the hypothesis that laparoscopic-assisted resection for rectal cancer is not inferior
      to open rectal resection, based on a composite primary endpoint of oncologic factors which
      are indicative of a safe and feasible operation.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To assess patient-related benefit of laparoscopic-assisted resection for rectal cancer
           vs.

           open rectal resection (blood loss, length of stay, pain medicine utilization)

        2. To assess disease free survival and local pelvic recurrence at two years.

        3. To assess quality of life, sexual function, bowel and stoma function at scheduled time
           points throughout the trial.

      Patients will be evaluated after surgery to determine the need for subsequent care based on
      the final pathology. Patients should not start treatment on any other investigative trial
      involving intervention or invasive diagnostic procedures ≤ 30 days following surgery to
      enable a complete evaluation of post-operative adverse events and complications occurring
      within 30 days of surgery. Patients are followed periodically for up to 5 years post surgery.

    <measure>Comparing Laparoscopic-assisted Resection to Open Rectal Resection for Rectal Cancer as Measured by the Percentage of Patients With Successful Resection Based on Pathological Evaluation.</measure>
    <time_frame>At time of Surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint will be a composite endpoint of oncologic factors which are indicative of an adequate surgical resection based on pathologic evaluation.
Primary endpoint parameters:
Circumferential margin &gt; 1 mm
Negative distal margin
Completeness of total mesorectal excision (TME) A complete TME is a rectal resection specimen that has an intact mesorectum and covering peritoneal envelope all the way to the level of rectal transection with no coning in of the mesorectum above the point of transection. The surface of the peritoneal covering should be smooth and shiny with no defects exposing the underlying fat.
All three criteria must be met for a resection to be deemed adequate. Laparoscopic-assisted resection will be compared to Open rectal resection to determine if it is non-inferior.</description>

    <measure>Completeness of Total Mesorectal Excision (Complete or Nearly Complete)</measure>
    <time_frame>At time of surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Complete total mesorectal excision was defined as a rectal resection specimen having smooth surface of mesorectal fascia with all fat contained in the enveloping fascia to a level 5 cm below the tumor for tumor-specific total mesorectal excision for upper rectal cancer, or the entire mesorectal envelope present for low rectal cancer. Nearly complete was defined as a rectal resection specimen having the mesorectal envelope intact except for defects no more than 5 mm deep, with no loss of mesorectal fat.
The percentage of patients with complete or nearly complete mesorectal excision was calculated along with the binomial 95% CI.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients undergo open laparotomy and rectal resection. The standard form of surgery is open laparotomy rectal resection. During open laparotomy, the surgeon makes a large incision or cut in the abdomen, and goes in through that cut to remove the tumor and lymph nodes from the rectum.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Arm 2: Laparoscopic-assisted rectal resection</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients undergo laparoscopic-assisted rectal resection. Laparoscopic-assisted rectal resection is performed using small instruments on long handles introduced into the abdomen through small ports called trocars in 3 - 6 positions on the abdomen through incisions measuring 5 -10 mm, under the guidance of a video camera. The abdominal wall is held up with carbon dioxide under pressure. The piece of bowel or intestine is removed through another incision (about 8 centimeters), and the ends of the intestine are reconnected to provide normal bowel function.</description>

Laparoscopic-assisted rectal resection is performed using small instruments on long handles introduced into the abdomen through small ports called trocars in 3 - 6 positions on the abdomen through incisions measuring 5 -10 mm, under the guidance of a video camera. The abdominal wall is held up with carbon dioxide under pressure. The piece of bowel or intestine is removed through another incision (about 8 centimeters), and the ends of the intestine are reconnected to provide normal bowel function.</description>

        <title>Comparing Laparoscopic-assisted Resection to Open Rectal Resection for Rectal Cancer as Measured by the Percentage of Patients With Successful Resection Based on Pathological Evaluation.</title>
        <description>The primary endpoint will be a composite endpoint of oncologic factors which are indicative of an adequate surgical resection based on pathologic evaluation.
Primary endpoint parameters:
Circumferential margin &gt; 1 mm
Negative distal margin
Completeness of total mesorectal excision (TME) A complete TME is a rectal resection specimen that has an intact mesorectum and covering peritoneal envelope all the way to the level of rectal transection with no coning in of the mesorectum above the point of transection. The surface of the peritoneal covering should be smooth and shiny with no defects exposing the underlying fat.
All three criteria must be met for a resection to be deemed adequate. Laparoscopic-assisted resection will be compared to Open rectal resection to determine if it is non-inferior.</description>

Nearly complete was defined as a rectal resection specimen having the mesorectal envelope intact except for defects no more than 5 mm deep, with no loss of mesorectal fat.
The percentage of patients with complete or nearly complete mesorectal excision was calculated along with the binomial 95% CI.</description>

During open laparotomy, the surgeon makes a large incision or cut in the abdomen, and goes in through that cut to remove the tumor and lymph nodes from the rectum.</description>

            <title>Arm 2: Laparoscopic-assisted Rectal Resection</title>
            <description>Patients undergo laparoscopic-assisted rectal resection. Laparoscopic-assisted rectal resection is performed using small instruments on long handles introduced into the abdomen through small ports called trocars in 3 - 6 positions on the abdomen through incisions measuring 5 -10 mm, under the guidance of a video camera. The abdominal wall is held up with carbon dioxide under pressure. The piece of bowel or intestine is removed through another incision (about 8 centimeters), and the ends of the intestine are reconnected to provide normal bowel function.</description>

          <title>Completeness of Total Mesorectal Excision (Complete or Nearly Complete)</title>
          <description>Complete total mesorectal excision was defined as a rectal resection specimen having smooth surface of mesorectal fascia with all fat contained in the enveloping fascia to a level 5 cm below the tumor for tumor-specific total mesorectal excision for upper rectal cancer, or the entire mesorectal envelope present for low rectal cancer. Nearly complete was defined as a rectal resection specimen having the mesorectal envelope intact except for defects no more than 5 mm deep, with no loss of mesorectal fat.
The percentage of patients with complete or nearly complete mesorectal excision was calculated along with the binomial 95% CI.</description>
