  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the optimal outpatient treatment strategy of
      uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) in areas of the United States where the
      prevalence of Community-Acquired Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus (S.) aureus (CA-MRSA)
      is high. Infection with the S. aureus bacteria that is resistant to antibiotics is a cause of
      SSTIs. Three oral antibiotics will be tested for off patent treatment. Patients will receive
      Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), placebo (substance containing no medication),
      clindamycin, or cephalexin or some combination of these. The study population will include
      2,235 volunteers, children 13 years of age and over and adults presenting to 5 large urban
      Emergency Departments. Therapy for acute uncomplicated SSTIs, including abscess, infected
      wound, and cellulitis will start on the day of enrollment. Participants may be involved in
      study related procedures for about 9 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) has recently emerged
      as a cause of skin and soft-tissue infection (SSTI). In the current era of increasing CA-MRSA
      infections, the outpatient management of SSTIs has not been well studied. This will be a
      clinical trial to evaluate oral off-patent antibiotics for outpatient treatment of patients
      with any of the 3 main types of acute uncomplicated SSTI, i.e., abscesses, infected wounds,
      and cellulitis. Upon enrollment, subjects will be stratified by type of infection, and then
      randomized to various treatments. Subjects with an acute uncomplicated cutaneous abscess
      receiving incision and drainage (I&amp;D) will be treated with Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole
      (TMP/SMX) or placebo to determine whether the addition of an antibiotic with activity against
      CA-MRSA is more clinically efficacious than I&amp;D alone. Subjects with an acute wound infection
      will be treated with TMP/SMX or clindamycin to determine if clindamycin, an antibiotic with
      activity against CA-MRSA, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), and
      streptococci is more clinically efficacious than TMP/SMX, an antibiotic with activity against
      CA-MRSA and MSSA. Subjects with acute cellulitis will be treated with cephalexin/TMP/SMX or
      cephalexin/placebo to determine if cephalexin/TMP/SMX is more clinically efficacious than
      cephalexin alone. The primary objectives for each type of SSTI studied are to compare the
      cure rates in the per protocol (PP) population. Secondary objectives provide additional means
      of assessment for the clinical efficacy of the employed interventions and resolution of the
      infection and include describing microbiological cure, change in the dimension of erythema,
      composite cure, surgical procedures, invasive and recurrent infections, infections in
      household contacts, and time to normal activity and until analgesics are no longer used at
      various times in the PP/ modified intent-to-treat (mITT) populations. This is a multi-center,
      randomized, double-blind clinical trial in which subjects will be stratified by the type of
      infection and then randomized to various 7-day oral antibiotic treatments, including
      placebo-controlled and comparative designs. The study population will include children 13
      years of age and over and adults, who weigh greater than or equal to 40 kg presenting to 5
      large urban emergency departments. Therapy will start on the day of enrollment. Subjects will
      be evaluated upon enrollment, at 2-3 days after enrollment (OTV), at 1-3 days after the
      end-of-therapy (EOT), at 7-14 days after the end-of-therapy (TOC), and at 6-8 weeks after the
      end-of-therapy (EFV).

    <description>Clinical cure at TOC was defined as no failure on any previous visit up through the TOC, absence of fever, and resolution or minimal presence of all the following signs and symptoms from baseline based on clinician assessment of erythema, swelling, and tenderness. A participant would have been a clinical failure at the On Therapy (OTV) visit with presence of fever attributable to the infection being studied, increase in erythema by 25% or more, or worsening of both swelling and tenderness based on clinical assessment. A participant would have been a clinical failure at the End of Therapy (EOT) visit with presence of fever attributable to the infection being studied, increase or no improvement in erythema, or no improvement in either swelling or tenderness based on clinical assessment.</description>

                  cavity on soft tissue ultrasound evaluation that, when opened reveals purulent
                  material, receiving incision and drainage (I&amp;D) (considered standard care for
                  abscess) and having a minimum diameter (along any axis) of at least 2 cm
                  (measured from the borders of induration, if a fluctuant lesion, or borders of
                  the abscess cavity on ultrasound, if not fluctuant).

                  Note: Although I&amp;D of an abscess is considered standard care (i.e., patients will
                  receive I&amp;D whether or not they are enrolled in the study), the procedure may be
                  performed after enrollment into the study so that prior measurements of the area
                  of erythema and swelling/induration can be obtained unless it is an occult
                  abscess in which the I&amp;D will be performed prior to enrollment to verify
                  infection type and ensure correct classification of the subject.

               2. Infected Wound - a wound (defined as any apparent break in the skin) with any
                  apparent drainage limited in depth to only involving skin and subcutaneous
                  tissue, including sutured cutaneous wounds not involving intra-abdominal
                  surgeries contaminated with bacterial or bowel contents (e.g., colon surgery and
                  empyema drainage), and

               3. Cellulitis - an area of erythema without the presence of a wound with drainage or
                  abscess; Cellulitis associated with an abscess will be categorized as an abscess.
                  Cellulitis associated with an infected wound will be classified as an infected
                  wound. Patients with cellulitis and an abscess less than 2 cm will be excluded.
                  Infected wound associated with an abscess that may require I&amp;D, will be
                  classified as an infected wound.

          -  Are to receive outpatient treatment at enrollment/baseline;

          -  Express willingness and ability to be contacted and return for re-evaluation according
             to the study protocol;

             guardian and assent);

          -  Negative pregnancy test for subjects who are women of childbearing potential.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Severe allergy or reaction to study drug or drugs similar to the study drug relevant

             clindamycin, or sulfonamides, or any other drug containing sulfur such as thiazides,
             furosemide, and oral sulfonylureas);

          -  Concomitant treatment (i.e., while on study drug therapy) with coumadin, phenytoin, or
             methotrexate, or suspected G-6-PD or folic acid deficiency;

             (non study drug) antibiotics for at least 72 hours and failed.

          -  Expected concurrent treatment with a topical antibiotic or another systemic antibiotic
             up to Test-of-Cure Visit (TOC) (note: if patient was using a topical antibiotic

        <description>Clinical cure at TOC was defined as no failure on any previous visit up through the TOC, absence of fever, and resolution or minimal presence of all the following signs and symptoms from baseline based on clinician assessment of erythema, swelling, and tenderness. A participant would have been a clinical failure at the On Therapy (OTV) visit with presence of fever attributable to the infection being studied, increase in erythema by 25% or more, or worsening of both swelling and tenderness based on clinical assessment. A participant would have been a clinical failure at the End of Therapy (EOT) visit with presence of fever attributable to the infection being studied, increase or no improvement in erythema, or no improvement in either swelling or tenderness based on clinical assessment.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Reduction in Erythema Dimensions by 5% Intervals at the On-therapy Visit in the Intent to Treat Population</title>
        <description>The area of erythema was measured in square centimeters at baseline and at the on-therapy visit. For each subject, the change in area was calculated as the area at on-therapy subtracted from the area at baseline. The change in area was then divided by the original area to determine the proportional change. Participants were then categorized by reductions in 5% intervals, with participants whose erythema did not change or increased categorized as no reduction.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Reduction in Erythema Dimensions by 5% Intervals at the End-of-therapy Visit in the Per Protocol Population</title>
        <description>The area of erythema was measured in square centimeters at baseline and at the end-of-therapy visit. For each subject, the change in area was calculated as the area at end-of-therapy subtracted from the area at baseline. The change in area was then divided by the original area to determine the proportional change. Participants were then categorized by reductions in 5% intervals, with participants whose erythema did not change or increased categorized as no reduction.</description>

All participants who met enrollment criteria, had none of the exclusion criteria, completed at least 75% of the first 5 days of antimicrobial therapy, and had physical follow-up at the Test of Cure (TOC) visit were included in the per protocol population.</population>

        <title>Number of Participants With Reduction in Erythema Dimensions by 5% Intervals at the End-of-therapy Visit in the Intent to Treat Population</title>
        <description>The area of erythema was measured in square centimeters at baseline and at the end-of-therapy visit. For each subject, the change in area was calculated as the area at end-of-therapy subtracted from the area at baseline. The change in area was then divided by the original area to determine the proportional change. Participants were then categorized by reductions in 5% intervals, with participants whose erythema did not change or increased categorized as no reduction.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Reduction in Erythema Dimensions by 5% Intervals at the TOC Visit in the Per Protocol Population</title>
        <description>The area of erythema was measured in square centimeters at baseline and at the TOC visit. For each subject, the change in area was calculated as the area at TOC subtracted from the area at baseline. The change in area was then divided by the original area to determine the proportional change. Participants were then categorized by reductions in 5% intervals, with participants whose erythema did not change or increased categorized as no reduction.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Reduction in Erythema Dimensions by 5% Intervals at the TOC Visit in the Intent to Treat Population</title>
        <description>The area of erythema was measured in square centimeters at baseline and at the TOC visit. For each subject, the change in area was calculated as the area at TOC subtracted from the area at baseline. The change in area was then divided by the original area to determine the proportional change. Participants were then categorized by reductions in 5% intervals, with participants whose erythema did not change or increased categorized as no reduction.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With Reduction in Erythema Dimensions by 5% Intervals at the TOC Visit in the Intent to Treat Population</title>
          <description>The area of erythema was measured in square centimeters at baseline and at the TOC visit. For each subject, the change in area was calculated as the area at TOC subtracted from the area at baseline. The change in area was then divided by the original area to determine the proportional change. Participants were then categorized by reductions in 5% intervals, with participants whose erythema did not change or increased categorized as no reduction.</description>

All AEs were assessed for association with the study product by a clinician and were considered associated with study product if the event was temporally related to the administration of the study product and no other etiology more likely explains the event. Associated adverse events are summarized by MedDRA System Organ Class.</description>
          <population>All subjects who took at least one dose of study medication were included in the intent to treat population.</population>

        <description>As a quality of life measure, participants maintained a memory aid from Day 1 to Day 14 to track measures such as use of other, non-study medications such as analgesics. Each participant is summarized by the last day of reported analgesic usage, from the start of treatment with study intervention. The maximum number of days assessed, 14, was assigned to participants who were still taking analgesic medications by the end of the assessment period.</description>
