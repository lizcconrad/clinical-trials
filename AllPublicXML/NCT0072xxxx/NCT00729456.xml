      This study was an attempt to confirm the results of an earlier experiment in which the
      benefit of an education programme was assessed in a group of people with diabetes complicated
      by ulceration of the foot. Foot ulcers are the source of considerable suffering and cost and
      carry a high risk of amputation: they are difficult to heal and approximately 40% recur in
      the first 12 months. The earlier experiment (published by Malone and colleagues in 1989)
      indicated that a single hour-long education session appeared to lead to a three-fold
      reduction in the numbers of ulcers which recurred after successful treatment. It was not
      possible to confirm these findings in the present study in which patients from three
      specialist clinics in Nottingham and Derby, UK, were allocated either to receive a
      one-to-one, individually targeted, education programme in the own home (and reinforced after
      one month by a telephone call), or to receive usual care. The group who received the
      education reported better recommended foot care behaviour (intended to minimise the risk of
      injury) at 12 months but despite this, there was no difference between the two groups in the
      percentage who suffered either a new ulcer (41% education versus 41% usual care) or
      amputation (10% and 11%, respectively). While the benefit of education is undeniable in
      general, it was not possible to show that this particular teaching session had an impact on
      the occurrence of new disease in this group of patients.

      This was a randomised controlled trial of the effect over 12 months of a one-to-one
      educational package designed to improve foot care behaviour in a group of patients at the
      highest risk of new foot disease: those with a recently healed ulcer. The primary outcome was
      the incidence of new ulceration at 12 months. Secondary outcomes included self-reported
      footcare behaviour, new ulceration at 6 months, amputation (major or minor) at 12 and 6
      months, and measures of well-being (SF36; Diabetic Foot Ulcer Scale, DFS short-form). The
      educational intervention was based on the content of the International Consensus on the
      Diabetic Foot, 2003, was modified following discussion with a focus group of former ulcer
      sufferers, and included graphic images of different forms of foot disease. Although
      structured, the information was targeted in discussion to the individual's circumstances, and
      was delivered one-to-one in the patient's own home by a single health care professional. It
      was reinforced after one month by a semi-structured phone conversation with the same
      educator. Outcomes were determined by postal questionnaire, backed up with reminders and
      phone calls when necessary, as well questionnaires sent to GP staff and by searching hospital
      records. Foot care behaviour was assessed at 12 months using a newly devised and validated
      measure of footcare function (NAFF) which was also delivered by post. All outcomes were
      assessed by researchers blind to allocation group. Mean age was 64.9 (SD 10.9) years, and
      there were no differences between groups at baseline in terms of demographics, diabetes type
      and complications. The incidence (%) of new ulcers at 6 and 12 months was 26 (30%) and 36
      (41%) in the intervention group and 18 (21%) and 35 (41%) in the controls, RR 0.997 (CI
      0.776-1.280). There were no differences in any of the other outcome measures although the
      intervention group reported a higher score in recommended foot care behaviour when compared
      with controls (42.0 versus 38.7, p=0.03).
