      Hypothesis: Treatment with metformin in overweight non-diabetic individuals with coronary
      heart disease and on standard cardiovascular risk reducing agents including statins will have
      a beneficial impact on carotid artery atherosclerosis compared to placebo.

      Rationale: Once subjects have a heart attack, they remain at much higher than average risk of
      another heart attack and stroke, despite the best current therapies to lower their
      cholesterol and blood pressure and thin their blood. Many subjects with heart disease also
      have problems metabolising (i.e. processing) sugar even if they do not have diabetes. There
      is some evidence that metformin, a drug which improves sugar metabolism, decreases the risk
      of future heart attacks in diabetic patients. However, whether metformin further reduces the
      risk of heart disease beyond established treatments in people without diabetes is unknown.

      Method: The investigators will test the ability metformin, a drug with proven safety, to slow
      the progression of furring up (known as atherosclerosis) of blood vessels in non-diabetic
      subjects with heart disease. This will be achieved by treating 2 groups of subjects with
      metformin and placebo pills respectively. To measure atherosclerosis, the investigators will
      carry out ultrasound scans of the big blood vessels in the neck at the start of the study,
      after 1 year and after 1.5 years of therapy.The investigators will then be able to assess
      whether metformin has had a beneficial impact.
