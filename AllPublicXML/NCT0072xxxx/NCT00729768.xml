  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II/III, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, multicenter trial to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of efalizumab compared with cyclosporine (CsA), when both
      are given in combination with Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) and corticosteroids after induction
      therapy with basiliximab, as an immunosuppressant regimen in de novo renal transplantation. A
      total of 200 subjects undergoing either living or cadaveric renal transplantation will be
      randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either efalizumab + MMF + corticosteroids or CsA + MMF +
      corticosteroids.
