    <description>The primary objective is to assess the effects of ACR16 on voluntary motor function in HD patients, as defined as the sum score of items 4-10 and 13-15 of the UHDRS motor assessment (a modified motor score in MS) at 26 weeks of treatment.</description>

    <time_frame>At 4, 8, 12 and 26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The effects of ACR16 on CGI, cognitive function, behaviour and symptoms of depression and anxiety. CGI has two components—the CGI-Severity, which rates illness severity, and the CGI-Improvement, which rates change from the initiation (baseline) of treatment.</description>
