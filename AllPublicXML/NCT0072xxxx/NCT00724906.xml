  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be two separate but identical studies: ALSE-A-02a, ALSE-A02b. Each study is
      designed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and safety of a single dose of 123I-ALTROPANE®
      in subjects with upper extremity tremor for less than three years. Currently, no
      radiopharmaceutical diagnostic imaging agent has been approved by the FDA in the U.S. for use
      in diagnosing Parkinson disease and related Parkinsonian syndromes. The diagnosis of
      Parkinsonian syndromes in the U.S. is based on clinical criteria only. The goal is to
      demonstrate that 123I-ALTROPANE® paired with SPECT imaging permits a more accurate early
      diagnosis of Parkinson disease than a clinical diagnosis by a general neurologist.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each study is a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized, open-label, out patient clinical
      trial which will include up to 240 subjects per study. Subjects will be male and female, age
      40-80 years, with approximately 20 sites per study.

      Subjects will participate in 5 study visits over the course of the study period. The
      screening visit will include an assessment of eligibility. The second visit will be the
      collection of the community neurologist's diagnostic assessment. The third visit, during
      which all subjects receive a single intravenous (IV) injection of 123I-ALTROPANE® and single
      photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging, will include appropriate safety
      assessments before and after dosing. The fourth visit, to occur 24 to 72 hours after SPECT
      imaging, will include follow up safety assessments as well as the first Movement Disorder
      Specialist's (MDS) evaluation. The fifth visit, to occur 6 months (±7 days) after SPECT
      imaging, will include follow-up safety assessments as well as the MDS reevaluation and truth
      standard diagnosis. The subject's participation in the study will be up to 7 months.
