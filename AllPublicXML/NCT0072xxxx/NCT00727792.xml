      The purpose of the study is to improve chest MRI exams, eventually resulting in improvements
      in patient care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will recruit patients to participate in the assessment of new MRI technologies designed to
      improve chest MRI exams that will result in improvements in patient care.

      Several different MRI technologies will be evaluated. Specific evaluation of distinct
      technologies (eg. new head coil design, and new imaging sequence for the spine) may be
      evaluated simultaneously, or over non-overlapping periods in time.

    <description>Assessment of the new technologies will be quantified by a variety of performance and image quality/content measures. The appropriate set of measures will be selected based on specific features offered by each assessed technology, but will be drawn from the following quantities:
Scan speed: Scan speed is time required to set-up and run the new technique relative to the standard method.
Signal to noise: SNR (signal to noise ratio)is the ratio of average image intensity in target tissue relative to standard deviation of background areas (outside of body). This is a fundamental parameter used to quantify relative performance of new imaging sequences/hardware/software.
Contrast to noise: CNR (contrast to noise)is the difference in average image intensity between two target tissues relative to noise. This is a key descriptor to quantity lesion/tissue conspicuity, thus is used to characterize relative performance of new imaging sequence/hardware/software.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  If you are a male or a non-pregnant female patient, age 18 years or older, of any
             ethnic background presenting to MRI for a clinically-ordered chest MRI exam, you are
             eligible to participate in this study.

          -  If you are a female of child bearing potential you will be questioned for the
             possibility of pregnancy. Pregnancy screening, if necessary, is performed routinely by
             ordering physicians prior to MRI scanning to confirm the patient is not pregnant.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have electrically, magnetically or mechanically activated implants such
             as heart pacemaker, magnetic surgical clips, prostheses or implanted neurological
             stimulator.

          -  Pregnant patients or patients who are nursing

          -  Patients who are claustrophobic.
