  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic somatoform pain is common in psychiatric patients. Chronic somatoform pain causes
      significant distress and disrupts social functioning. Moreover, chronic somatoform pain often
      does not sufficiently respond to medication.

      Chronic somatoform pain is associated with medial pain system. The medial pain system is
      comprised of structures engaged in affect and motivation, such as medial thalamus and limbic
      structures. The medial pain system gets inhibitory control from motor cortex. Functional
      neuroimaging studies indicate that chronic somatoform pain is associated with hypoactivity of
      motor cortex, defective inhibitory process, and hyperactivity of medial pain system.

      Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is a safe and non-invasive tool to
      modulate neurophysiologic activity of the focal brain. Therefore, pain relief by rTMS can be
      obtained from motor cortex stimulation, restoration of defective inhibitory process, and
      deactivation of medial pain system. Studies have shown that motor cortex stimulation using
      rTMS can relieve pain in patients with neuropathic pain. However, to our knowledge, there is
      no rTMS study on chronic somatoform pain in psychiatric patients. The purpose of this study
      is to evaluate the effect of motor cortex rTMS on chronic somatoform pain.

    <description>Patients receive high frequency rTMS applied to the motor cortex (M1 area). The treatment protocol consists of 10 sessions of rTMS. At each session, patients receive 30 stimulation trains (10 Hz, 4 sec, 100% motor threshold) with 26 sec inter-train interval, resulting in a total of 1200 pulses per session.</description>
