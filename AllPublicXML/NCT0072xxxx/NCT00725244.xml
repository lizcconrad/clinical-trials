    <textblock>
      Aim:

      To compare the efficacy, safety and number of sessions of bipolar eletrocoagulation (BEC) and
      argon plasma coagulation (APC) in the management of the bleeding telangiectasias from chronic
      radiation coloproctopathy (CRCP).

      Methods:

      Thirty patients with active bleeding from telangiectasias were enrolled in two groups (15 BEC
      and 15 APC) and classified according of Saunders score. BEC settings were 50 W and APC
      settings were 40 W and 1.0 l/min. Colonoscopy was the first exam to rule out synchronous
      lesions and follow-up was performed with sigmoidoscopies. Clinical cure was defined as
      cessation of bleeding and endoscopic cure was determined by absence of telangiectasias.
      Failure was defined whenever more than 7 sessions or other therapy was necessary.

      Thirty patients with active and chronic hematochezia from radiation telangiectasias were
      randomized in two groups :

        -  fifteen patients in group 1- bipolar eletrocoagulation (BE) and

        -  fifteen in group 2 - argon plasma coagulation(APC). For inclusion in the study, all
           patients were required to have active (at least one episode last week) and chronic
           (persist or appear 6 months after the conclusion of radiotherapy) rectal bleeding.
           Between May 2005 and April 2008, patients were treated and followed at the Endoscopy
           Unit in the São Paulo Hospital (UNIFESP).

    <description>Bipolar Eletrocoagulation was performed with a high-frequency electrosurgical generator (ERBE® ICC 200 Eletromedizin, Tubingen, Germany), using Gold probe (Wilson- Cook®) with 7 Fr diameter and 300 cm length. The power setting was 50 W. Coagulation of each telangiectasia was achieved with the probes by applying light pressure directly on the telangiectasia.</description>

    <description>Argon Plasma Coagulation was delivered using a &quot;spray-painting&quot; technique, with short applications at 40 W power with a gas flow of 1.0l per minute. APC equipment was an argon delivery unit (ERBE® ICC 300) coupled a high frequency surgery unit (ERBE® ICC 200). Only the end-firing probe with 2.3 mm and 220 cm length was used. The probe was purged with argon, tested and passed though the endoscope until it extends approximately 1 cm from the tip. The probe was hold just above the mucosal surface and the contact was avoided. During the procedure periodic suction was made to prevent over-distention with gas and consequently patient discomfort.</description>
