  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to provide a direct comparison of the efficacy, safety and
      tolerability for pazopanib and sunitinib (SUTENT)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of pazopanib compared to sunitinib in
      subjects with advanced RCC who have received no prior systemic therapy for advanced or
      metastatic RCC. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 800mg pazopanib
      to be administered once daily orally continuous dosing or 50mg sunitinib to be administered
      in 6-week cycles: 50mg orally daily for 4 weeks followed by 2 weeks off treatment. Subjects
      are permitted to receive supportive care throughout the study including transfusion of blood
      and blood products, treatment with antibiotics, anti-emetics, anti-diarrheal agents,
      analgesics, erythropoietin, or bisphosphonates, when appropriate. The study treatment will
      continue until subjects experience disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdraw
      consent, or death.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Supplementary Quality of Life Questions (SQLQ) Limitations Due to Mouth and Throat Soreness Score at Day 28 of Cycles 1-4 (Average of Weeks 4, 10, 16, and 22, Respectively)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Weeks 4, 10, 16, and 22</time_frame>
    <description>The SQLQ consists of 5 items assessing the worst mouth/throat, hand, and foot soreness, and limitations due to mouth/throat and foot soreness. Participants (par.) assessed the limitations caused by their mouth/throat soreness by answering the question of &quot;In the past 4 weeks, how much did your worst mouth/throat soreness limit you in the following activities: swallowing/eating/drinking/talking/sleeping&quot; by using the following 4-point scale: 0, not limited; 1, limited a little; 2, limited a lot; 3, unable to do. The overall limitation score (15=best; 0=worst), based on the individual scores for the 5 activities, is derived as follows: the actual scores were rescored by subtracting the actual score from &quot;3&quot; for each of the 5 categories. A high score indicates less limitation. Change from Baseline was calculated as the assessment week value minus the Baseline value. A negative mean change from Baseline represents a worsening of condition.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Per protocol amendment, the number of participants (par.) was increased to ~1100 (including all par. enrolled in Studies VEG108844 and VEG113078 [NCT01147822; a substudy in Asian par.]). This summary is a pooled analysis of both studies. 1110 par. were analyzed; 927 from VEG108844 (reflected in the protocol enrollment field), 183 from VEG113078.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants were stratified based on Karnofsky Performance Scale scores (70 or 80; 90 or 100), Baseline levels of lactate dehydrogenase (&gt;1.5 versus &lt;=1.5 times the upper limit of normal [ULN]), and previous nephrectomy (yes versus no) and were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either pazopanib or sunitinib.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>PFS is defined as the interval between the date of randomization and the earliest date of progressive disease (PD), as defined by the Independent Review Committee (IRC), or death due to any cause. The IRC defined PD per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), Version 1. Per RECIST, PD is defined as a &gt;=20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of &gt;=1 new lesion. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for PFS estimates.</description>

        <description>The FACIT-F scale measures the severity and impact of fatigue on functioning and health related quality of life (HRQoL) experienced in the past seven days. The level of fatigue is measured by 13 questions assessed on a four-point scale (0=not at all fatigued; 1=a little bit fatigued; 2=somewhat fatigued; 3=quite a bit fatigued; 4=very much fatigued; possible total score of 0 to 52). A negative change from Baseline represents a worsening condition. Change from Baseline was calculated as the assessment week value minus the Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the FACT-Kidney Symptom Index-19 (FKSI-19) Scale Disease-related Symptoms-physical (DRS-P) Domain Score at Day 28 of Cycles 1-4 (Average of Weeks 4, 10, 16, and 22, Respectively)</title>
        <description>The FKSI-19 is a disease-specific instrument that measures disease and treatment-related symptoms specifically in renal cancer patients in 4 domains. The DRS-P domain assesses symptoms experienced in the past 7 days. Participants are asked to respond to 12 questions (&quot;I have a lack of energy,&quot; &quot;I feel pain,&quot; for example) by using a 5-point scale (0=not at all, 1=a little bit, 2=somewhat, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much; possible total domain score of 0 to 48). Higher scores represent better health. A negative change from Baseline represents a worsening of condition.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in the FACT-Kidney Symptom Index-19 (FKSI-19) Scale Functional Well Being (FWB) Domain Score at Day 28 of Cycles 1-4 (Average of Weeks 4, 10, 16, and 22, Respectively)</title>
          <description>The FKSI-19 is a disease-specific instrument that measures disease and treatment-related symptoms specifically in renal cancer patients in 4 domains. The FWB domain assesses well being in the past 7 days. Participants are asked to respond to 3 questions (&quot;I am able to work,&quot; &quot;I am able to enjoy life,&quot; and &quot;I am content with the quality of my life now&quot;) by using a 5-point scale (0=not at all, 1=a little bit, 2=somewhat, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much; possible total domain score of 0 to 12). Higher scores represent better health. A negative change from Baseline represents a worsening of condition.</description>
          <population>ITT Population. Some participants were missing scores at Baseline and were excluded from the analysis. Participants missing scores at other early time points were excluded from the analysis at those time points. Change from Baseline was calculated as the assessment week value minus the Baseline value.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Supplementary Quality of Life Questions (SQLQ) Limitations Due to Mouth and Throat Soreness Score at Day 28 of Cycles 1-4 (Average of Weeks 4, 10, 16, and 22, Respectively)</title>
        <description>The SQLQ consists of 5 items assessing the worst mouth/throat, hand, and foot soreness, and limitations due to mouth/throat and foot soreness. Participants (par.) assessed the limitations caused by their mouth/throat soreness by answering the question of &quot;In the past 4 weeks, how much did your worst mouth/throat soreness limit you in the following activities: swallowing/eating/drinking/talking/sleeping&quot; by using the following 4-point scale: 0, not limited; 1, limited a little; 2, limited a lot; 3, unable to do. The overall limitation score (15=best; 0=worst), based on the individual scores for the 5 activities, is derived as follows: the actual scores were rescored by subtracting the actual score from &quot;3&quot; for each of the 5 categories. A high score indicates less limitation. Change from Baseline was calculated as the assessment week value minus the Baseline value. A negative mean change from Baseline represents a worsening of condition.</description>

        <description>The CTSQ assesses 3 domains related to the participant’s satisfaction with cancer therapy: Expectations of Therapy (ET), Feelings about Side Effects (FSE), and Satisfaction with Therapy (SWT). Participants shared their thoughts on their cancer therapy (9 questions), their satisfaction with their most recently administered cancer therapy (6 questions), and if they would take the same cancer therapy if given the choice to do so again. All questions were assessed on a 5-point scale; 1, never; 5, always. Scores were averaged and transformed to a 0-100 scale; higher scores represent better health.</description>

        <title>Medical Resource Utilization (MRU): Assessed as the Mean Number of Non-study Medical Visits, Telephone Consultations, Hospital Days, and Emergency Room (ER) Visits Per 30 Days Through Week 24</title>
        <description>Non-study medical visits were defined as the sum of primary care physician visits, nurse practitioner/physician’s assistant/nurse visits, and medical or surgical specialist visits. Days hospitalized were defined as the sum of days in the general ward and days in intensive care. The number of telephone consultations and ER visits was assessed via individual questions on the electronic Case Report Form. The endpoint was totaled through Week 24, divided by the number of days on treatment for each participant, then multiplied by 30 days to get the number of visits per 30 days.</description>
