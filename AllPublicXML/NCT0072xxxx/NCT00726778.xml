      The main objective of this study is to investigate the effect of genetic and environmental
      parameters on racial/ethnic differences in aspects of insulin secretion and action. The
      genetic component will be modeled by estimating the degree of European genetic admixture
      (ADM) obtained from approximately 50 ancestry informative markers (AIMs). The environmental
      components will be modeled by measuring energy intake (food intake), energy expenditure
      (physical activity) and socioeconomic status.

      Three 5-ml blood samples will be obtained from each subject and sent to the Laboratory Core
      of the General Clinical Research Center to establish EBV lymphoblastoid cell lines and for
      DNA extraction. EBV lines will be kept at UAB for future genetic analysis. Extracted DNA will
      be sent to Dr. Mark Shriver at the Pennsylvania State University for genotyping of the
      ancestry informative markers (AIMs).

        120 African Americans, 120 European Americans and 120 Hispanic Americans (60 males and 60
        females per group). To minimize the influence of puberty on SI and AIRg, recruitment will
        be limited to individuals between ages 7-12, a range that based on previous observations
        from our team, categorize children from Tanner stage 1 and 2.
