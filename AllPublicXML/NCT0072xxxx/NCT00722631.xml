  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is increasing evidence that inflammation plays a role in progression and
      destabilization of atherosclerotic plaque. FDG-PET can visualize activated metabolic activity
      of inflammatory cells. It is possible that FDG-PET can detect atherosclerotic plaque
      inflammation and that FDG-PET can monitor the effect of pioglitazone on plaque inflammation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atherosclerotic patients with impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes will undergo the
      FDG-PET/CT imaging at baseline and again following 4 months after treatment. Patients who
      meet eligibility criteria will be titrated up to a maximum of 30 mg/day pioglitazone or 4
      mg/day glimepiride. Physical examinations will be done at baseline, 4 months, and 12 months.
      During study, subjects will have body weight, and vital signs (HR, BP, etc) assessed as well
      as waist circumference. Laboratory assessments will be done at each baseline, 4 month.
