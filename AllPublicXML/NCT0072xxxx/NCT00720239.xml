    <textblock>
      The study will test a new wound healing dressing called Taliderm® on leg ulcers caused by
      chronic venous insufficiency (CVI). Some people with CVI have poor vein circulation that
      causes ulcers to develop on the lower legs. This new dressing is hoped to help the ulcers
      heal more quickly. The study hypothesis is to determine whether the TalidermR Wound Dressing,
      a poly-N-acetyl glucosamine (pGlcNAc) derived membrane material expedites wound healing in
      humans with venous stasis ulcers.

    <description>Taliderm wound healing dressing will be applied to the wound site as follows depending on assignment to group:
Control group receives no intervention. Experimental Group 1 (n = 10) will receive TalidermR only one time at the beginning of the treatment phase.
Experimental Group 2 (n = 10) will receive TalidermR to the wound every other week during the treatment phase.
Experimental Group 3 (n = 10) will receive TalidermR to the wound every three weeks during the treatment phase.</description>
