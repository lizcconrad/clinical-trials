  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to determine if there is improvement in pain and other
      patient outcomes when using a continuous wound analgesia system after total knee replacement,
      compared to usual methods of pain control. Another purpose is to determine if the system
      makes it easier for nurses to care for these patients.

    <textblock>
      Continuous local wound infusion analgesia is a relatively new way of managing post-operative
      pain, whereby a local anesthetic is continuously infused into the surgical area. Some studies
      and users have reported decreased pain, decreased opioid use, decreased post-operative nausea
      and vomiting, decreased length of stay, and improved patient and caregiver satisfaction with
      the use of continuous local wound infusion analgesia, when compared to placebo, or usual
      care, in arthroplasty and other surgical interventions.

      Hypotheses:

      Primary:

      The On-Q PainBuster (continuous wound infusion analgesia) in TKA will result in improved
      patient pain control, compared to usual care.

      Secondary:

        -  Pain scores post-operatively will be better than usual care.

        -  Fewer narcotics will be ingested post-operatively than with usual care.

        -  Post-op nausea and vomiting will be less than usual care.

        -  Length of stay will be shorter compared to usual care.

        -  Patient satisfaction will be greater than satisfaction with usual care.

        -  Post-operative infection rates will be no different between groups.

        -  Fall rates will be no different between groups.

        -  Subjects will participate in physical therapy the day of surgery.

        -  Nursing Intensity requirements will be less with the wound infusion due to fewer
           requests for pain medication.
