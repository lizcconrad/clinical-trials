  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the outcome of specific repetitive biomechanical
      perturbation training on motor patterns.

      The first hypothesis of this project is that footwear derived biomechanical challenges will
      convey active and passive matching biomechanical responses (i.e. kinetic, kinematic and
      electromyographic) trough out the musculoskeletal kinematic chain.

      The second hypothesis of the project is that repetitive exposure to in-situ (trough out the
      gait sickle) introduction to a biomechanical stimulus would generate a process of motor
      learning thus conveying plasticity of existing locomotor patterns and gait strategies.

      Design: Prospective, case control Setting: subjects will undergo a tailored training program
      utilizing a novel biomechanical system comprising four modular elements attached onto
      foot-worn platforms (APOS system, Apos - Sports and Medical Technologies Ltd. Hertzlia,
      Israel) which conveys perturbation throughout the gait sickle. Pre and post training level
      walking will be examined via: (1) a three-dimensional motion analysis system and (2) ground
      reaction force analysis using force platforms (3) Electro-Myography system. Each subject will
      be examined in 4 different settings Patients will then participate in continued biomechanical
      perturbation training for 3-6 month and will then undergo a second gait examination Ages
      Eligible for Study: 50 Years - 75 Years, Genders Eligible for Study: None Accepts patients
      suffering from medial compartment knee osteoarthritis
