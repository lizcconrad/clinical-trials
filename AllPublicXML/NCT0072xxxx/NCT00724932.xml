  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current trial was designed to demonstrate faster recovery from a neuromuscular blockade
      (NMB) induced by rocuronium after reversal at 1-2 Post Tetanic Count (PTC) by 4.0 mg.kg-1
      sugammadex compared to 50 µg.kg-1 neostigmine at reappearance of second twitch (T2) in
      participants undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy or appendectomy under propofol
      anesthesia, to compare safety and to evaluate operating room and Post Anesthetic Care Unit
      (PACU) length of stay.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In those surgical procedures where a neuromuscular block is desired for intubation and/or
      avoid unwanted muscular activity, anesthesiologists may use a more profound NMB until the end
      of surgery, e.g. in open abdominal procedures or during laparoscopic procedures in order to
      improve surgical conditions. Reversal with sugammadex at a dose of 4.0 mg.kg-1 at 1-2 PTC
      after an intubation dose of 0.6 mg.kg-1 or maintenance dosing rocuronium has been found to be
      both safe and efficacious in previous clinical trials but has never been investigated
      exclusively in participants undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy or appendectomy.

      With sugammadex profound muscle relaxation may now be provided right up to the end of the
      surgical procedure. This may lead to improved Patient Outcomes, such as improvement in the
      time from end of surgery to the discharge to the PACU. In this multi-center, randomized,
      parallel-group, active-controlled, safety-assessor blinded trial such benefits will be
      further investigated.

    <time_frame>From start of IMP administration to recovery of T4/T1 ratio to 0.9 (ranging from ~2 minutes to ~9 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>Neuromuscular functioning was monitored by applying repetitive Train-Of-Four (TOF) electrical stimulations to the ulnar nerve every 15 seconds &amp; assessing twitch response at the adductor pollicis muscle. T1 and T4 refer to the magnitudes (heights) of the first and fourth twitches, respectively, after TOF nerve stimulation. The T4/T1 Ratio (expressed as a decimal of up to 1.0) indicates the extent of recovery from neuromuscular blockade (NMB). In this study, twitch responses were recorded until the T4/T1 Ratio reached &gt;= 0.9, the minimum acceptable ratio that indicated recovery from NMB. A faster time to recovery of the T4/T1 Ratio to 0.9 indicates a faster recovery from NMB.</description>

        <title>Time From Start of Administration of Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP, Sugammadex or Neostigmine) to Recovery of the Fourth Twitch/First Twitch (T4/T1) Ratio to 0.9</title>
        <description>Neuromuscular functioning was monitored by applying repetitive Train-Of-Four (TOF) electrical stimulations to the ulnar nerve every 15 seconds &amp; assessing twitch response at the adductor pollicis muscle. T1 and T4 refer to the magnitudes (heights) of the first and fourth twitches, respectively, after TOF nerve stimulation. The T4/T1 Ratio (expressed as a decimal of up to 1.0) indicates the extent of recovery from neuromuscular blockade (NMB). In this study, twitch responses were recorded until the T4/T1 Ratio reached &gt;= 0.9, the minimum acceptable ratio that indicated recovery from NMB. A faster time to recovery of the T4/T1 Ratio to 0.9 indicates a faster recovery from NMB.</description>

          <title>Time From Actual Operating Room Discharge to PACU Discharge Ready</title>
          <description>The time of Operating Room discharge was defined as the actual time the participant was discharged from the Operating Room. The time of PACU discharge ready was defined as the time at which the participant had a Modified Aldrete Score &gt;=9. The Modified Aldrete Score was to be assessed at PACU arrival, at 5, 15, 30, 45, 60 minutes after PACU arrival and every 15 minutes thereafter (if applicable) until the participant was ready to be discharged from the PACU. The Modified Aldrete Postoperative Recovery Score (range = 0-10) is calculated based on scores of 0 to 2 each for Activity, Respiration, Circulation, Consciousness and Oxygen Saturation, with a higher score indicating increased postoperative recovery.</description>
