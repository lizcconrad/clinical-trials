  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spondylarthropathy (SpA) comprises a group of rheumatic diseases mainly affecting the spine
      and sacroiliac joints. In most of the patients disease activity alternates, and some patients
      have symptom free periods. Tumor-Necrosis-Factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) antagonists have
      significantly improved the treatment options for patients with spondyloarthritis. TNF-alpha
      antagonist therapy is costly, implies an increased risk of infections, including reactivation
      of tuberculosis, and the risk of long-term adverse events, as cancer, is fully clarified. It
      is highly relevant to explore to which extent anti-TNF-alpha therapy can be discontinued in
      SpA patients without immediate relapse of disease activity. Two studies have investigated
      discontinuation of a TNF-alpha antagonist (infliximab and etanercept) in ankylosing
      spondylitis, reporting flares in the majority of patients within the 1-year follow-up period,
      with the longest times to relapse in patients with the lowest disease activity. The effect of
      adalimumab discontinuation has never been studied, and, furthermore, the effect of
      TNF-alpha-antagonist discontinuation has never been studied in patients with early
      spondyloarthritis not fulfilling the New York criteria.
