    <textblock>
      Patients receiving a patient assistance program during therapy for Hepatitis C will be
      enrolled into this study. All patients will receive PegIntron and Rebetol (according to the
      label) and the patient assistance program, which includes (1) medications used for treatment
      (psychiatric medications); (2) other interventions (nurse support); and (3) educational
      literature. This study will be compared to similar studies from other clinics using various
      patient support programs for the purpose of designing future comparative phase IV studies.
