    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to evaluate the rates of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) eradication
      and relapse in participants treated with PegIntron and Rebetol in clinical practice in
      Greece. Participants will not be treated as part of the study. Data on participants treated
      in accordance with approved labeling will be collected retrospectively from approximately 30
      sites in Greece.

        <title>Number of Participants Who Achieved Sustained Virological Response as Assessed at 24-week Post-treatment Follow-up by Subgroups Based on HCV Genotype at Baseline</title>
        <description>SVR was assessed at the 24-week post-treatment follow-up (Visit 2) by subgroups based on HCV genotype (1, 2, 3, 4, or 2 &amp; 3) at baseline. SVR was defined as undetectable plasma HCV-RNA at 24 weeks after termination of combination treatment (24 or 48 weeks of treatment duration).</description>

        <population>Efficacy Analysis Set (N=309) included all participants enrolled into the study who attended the final study visit and had HCV RNA evaluation measurement available at the 24-week post-treatment follow-up. Of the 309 participants in this population, 286 achieved SVR and were included in this analysis. 23 participants were relapsers.</population>

          <title>Number of Participants Who Achieved Sustained Virological Response as Assessed at 24-week Post-treatment Follow-up by Subgroups Based on Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) Levels at Baseline</title>
          <description>SVR was assessed at the 24-week post-treatment follow-up (Visit 2) by subgroups based on ALT levels at baseline as assessed by investigator. Normal baseline ALT level was defined as &lt;40 IU/mL and elevated baseline ALT level was defined as &gt;= 40 IU/mL. SVR was defined as undetectable plasma HCV-RNA at 24 weeks after termination of combination treatment (24 or 48 weeks of treatment duration).</description>
          <population>Efficacy Analysis Set (N=309) included all participants enrolled into the study who attended the final study visit and had HCV RNA evaluation measurement available at the 24-week post-treatment follow-up. Of the 309 participants in this population, 286 achieved SVR and were included in this analysis. There was missing data for 6 participants.</population>
