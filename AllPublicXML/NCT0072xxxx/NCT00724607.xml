  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Active duty military personnel serving in the current and recent conflicts in Afghanistan and
      Iraq are frequently exposed to blasts and other mechanisms of traumatic brain injury
      (TBI).1,2 Although physical trauma is not unexpected during war fighting, survival after
      blast-related head injury has become a common occurrence only in recent years. As such, the
      associated cerebral damage is less well studied and understood.

      The Brain Injury Outcomes (BIO) Study is a longitudinal study with the short-term objective
      of better characterizing multi-modal outcomes in individuals who have sustained a brain
      injury using a systems medicine approach. Long-term aims include monitoring participants for
      signs of emerging symptoms or age-related vulnerabilities. Identification of abnormality
      profiles for all severity levels of brain injury (from any source) reflects a second
      long-range goal. Third, the investigators will examine and compare physiology between
      Veterans who have sustained a Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI) with and without persisting
      symptoms and various co-morbidities including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A control
      group of Veterans who have not sustained a TBI will also be recruited for comparison. Fourth,
      the investigators intend to facilitate the clinical use of advanced methodologies, such as
      brain imaging and tissue measures, with the brain injured (and other populations). Finally,
      the investigators will assess methods of analysis, combination and integration for
      multi-modal data in search of diagnostic profiles. Increased knowledge of injury patterns and
      the trajectory associated with brain injury could contribute to better methods of diagnosis,
      monitoring and, perhaps, treatment.

      This investigation has spawned several sub-studies, one of which was the Validation of Brief
      Objective Neurobehavioral Detectors (BOND) of Mild TBI, which continues. The investigators
      are collaborating with Harvard/Boston Children's Hospital in the Angiogenic Signaling
      Signatures Identified in Stress and Trauma (ASSIST) sub-study. Oak Ridge National Laboratory
      (ORNL) is integrating BIO Study multi-modal data.

    <description>In this longitudinal study with multiple measurement modalities (i.e., neuroimaging, biospecimens, cognition, etc.), the primary outcome measures are from the neuroimaging modality, specifically, the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) sequences. FA is one of the quantitative metrics yielded by the DTI sequence. FA is a ratio of the directional flows of water molecules within axonal bundles and is interpreted as a representation of the overall structural health of the bundle.</description>
