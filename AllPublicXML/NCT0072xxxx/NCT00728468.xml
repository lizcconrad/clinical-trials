  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research in test tubes suggests that may affect cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6), an important
      enzyme that is responsible for eliminating many drugs that cancer patients need to take,
      including dextromethorphan. The purpose of this study is to test the impact of PF-00299804 on
      the activity of CYP2D6, and how the human body handles dextromethorphan.

      To assess the effect of repeated dosing with 45 mg QD PF-00299804 on the pharmacokinetics of
      dextromethorphan, a CYP2D6 probe, in cancer patients with advanced malignant solid tumors.

    <measure>Best Overall Response (BOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, end of every even-numbered cycle until disease progression up to end of treatment (up to 18 months)</time_frame>
    <description>BOR: investigator assessment by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), recorded from treatment start until disease progression/recurrence. Complete Response: disappearance of all lesions. Partial Response (PR): &gt;=30% decrease in sum of longest diameters (SLDs) of target lesions (TLs) taking as reference baseline SLD. Progressive disease (PD): &gt;=20% increase in SLD of TLs taking as reference smallest SLD since treatment start, or appearance of &gt;=1 new lesion. Stable disease: neither shrinkage for PR nor increase for PD taking as reference smallest SLD since treatment start.</description>

    <description>Time in weeks from the first documentation of objective tumor response to objective tumor progression or death due to any cancer. Duration of tumor response was calculated as (the date of the first documentation of objective tumor progression or death due to cancer minus the date of the first CR or PR that was subsequently confirmed plus 1) divided by 7. DR was calculated for the subgroup of participants with a confirmed objective tumor response.</description>

TTP was calculated as (first event date minus the date of first dose of study medication plus 1) divided by 30.437. Tumor progression was determined from oncologic assessment data (where data meet the criteria for PD).</description>
