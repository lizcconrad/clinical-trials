  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Premature babies are affected by a condition known as &quot;patent ductus arteriosus&quot; in which the
      ductus arteriosus (a normal structure) fails to close after birth as it should. A very large
      ductus can put extra strain on the heart and lungs, making the baby's breathing dependent on
      a mechanical ventilator. Attending physicians can close the duct with medical\or surgical
      treatment but assessing whether this is justified can be difficult. The physician usually
      bases this decision on assessment of the baby's general condition and an ultrasound
      evaluation of the heart (called an &quot;echocardiogram&quot;) but the last is particularly dependent
      on availability of skilled operators.

      The investigators have examined whether blood levels of a hormone called B-type natriuretic
      peptide (Nt pro-BNP)in the first week of life predict the need to treat a ductus arteriosus.
      This hormone is produced by the heart if it is under strain. If the test is helpful it could
      reduce dependence of physicians on echocardiography by skilled operators.

      Babies who were recruited had blood samples collected on days 1, 2, 3 and 7 for measurement
      of Nt pro-BNP. Each baby also had an echocardiogram performed between the fifth and seventh
      day of life. Decisions about treatment of the duct were made by attending physicians
      independent of the study. Physicians, investigators and echocardiographers were blinded to
      knowledge of the Nt pro-BNP concentration. Nt pro-BNP was also measured before and after
      treatment in all babies who had a PDA treated and echocardiography performed to confirm
      closure.

      Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves were used to assess the predictive value of
      Nt pro-BNP for samples collected at each time point. The investigators also compared the Nt
      pro-BNP levels in samples collected before and after treatment to assess the usefulness of Nt
      pr-BNP as an indicator of duct closure.
