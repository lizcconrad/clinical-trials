  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, prospective observational cohort study (OCS) designed to follow
      patients with locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer in the United States. Two cohorts
      will be included:

        -  Patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-negative) disease
           receiving their first cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or targeted therapy (approximately 825
           patients)

        -  Patients with hormone receptor-positive (HR-positive) disease receiving their first
           hormonal therapy for advanced disease (approximately 425 patients)

      Patients who have received any chemotherapy for advanced disease more than 8 weeks prior to
      enrollment to this OCS will not be eligible. A total of approximately 1,250 patients will be
      enrolled. Approximately 150 study sites will be activated in order to achieve complete
      enrollment by December 2010.

    <time_frame>Approximately 4.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Progression free survival was defined as the time from enrollment to progression or death of any cause, whichever came first. The disease response status was assessed by the investigator according to the method of his or her choice. The choices included computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), bone scan, X-ray, Positron emission tomography (PET) or CT PET, physical exam, laboratory exam, and other method.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Tumor Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 4.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The tumor response was measured as complete response, partial response, stable disease, progressive disease, or clinical deterioration based on their best overall response. The tumor response was assessed by the investigator according to the method of his or her choice. The choices included computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), bone scan, X-ray, Positron emission tomography (PET) or CT PET, physical exam, laboratory exam, and other method.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Hormone Receptor-positive Participants Who Initiated Cytotoxic Chemotherapy Following Discontinuation</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 4.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were assessed quarterly for progressive events and treatment status.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Any Adverse Events, Any Serious Adverse Events, Any AEs Leading to Early Treatment Discontinuation, and Adverse Events Leading to Hospitalization or Death</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 4.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered to be related to the medicinal product. An Serious Adverse Events (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, or results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Arterial Thromboembolic Events, Venous Thromboembolic Events, Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction, and Peripheral Neuropathy</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 4.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>All AEs were graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 3 as Grade 1 (mild), Graded 2 (moderate), Grade 3 (severe), Grade 4 (very severe, life threatening, or disabling), and Grade 5 (death related to AE). Venous Thromboembolic Events (VTEs) included all Grade 4 or of more severity of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolus; Arterial Thromboembolic Events (ATEs) Included new or worsening angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, stroke, transient ischemic attack, peripheral arterial ischemia of any NCI CTCAE grade; Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction (LVSD) included congestive heart failure) of NCI CTCAE Grade 2 or of more severity; Peripheral Neuropathy (PN) included sensory and/or motor events of Grade 3 or of more severity.</description>
