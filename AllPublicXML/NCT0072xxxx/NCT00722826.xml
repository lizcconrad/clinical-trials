  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with pulmonary regurgitation after surgical correction of ToF over 13 years old will
      be recruited from the UCSF adult congenital heart disease clinic. Since there is no data in
      the literature describing the prevalence of abnormal MRI volumetric and functional parameters
      in asymptomatic patients with PR after ToF repair, a pilot study with 30 patients will be
      conducted. Increase in sample size may be necessary in the future to accurately interpret the
      data. After informed consent is obtained, clinical history and physical examination as well
      as review of old charts will be performed to characterize these patient's clinical status.
      All patients will undertake a graduated supine bicycle exercise test with MVO2 measurement to
      assess exercise capacity.

      MRI studies will be performed in a 1.5 tesla unit. SSFP cine images will be obtained in the
      short-axis plane encompassing the entire heart. Velocity-encoded cine MR images will be
      obtained perpendicular to the direction of blood flow in the main pulmonary artery.
      Volumetric and flow analysis will be performed in a separate dedicated workstation by a
      radiologist. End-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume, ejection fraction, total ejection
      fraction and pulmonary regurgitant fraction will be calculated.
