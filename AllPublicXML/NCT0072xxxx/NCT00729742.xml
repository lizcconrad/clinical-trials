    <description>Part II: All patients will receive 1 week of erlotinib 150 mg tablets per day.
Arm 1: Patients who experience a PET response will continue on erlotinib monotherapy until disease progression.
Arm 2: Patients who fail to receive a PET response will continue to take erlotinib in combination with dalotuzumab 10 mg/kg IV infusion once weekly. At the time of disease progression, patients on erlotinib monotherapy will be offered to crossover to dalotuzumab 10 mg/kg IV infusion once weekly in combination with erlotinib.</description>
