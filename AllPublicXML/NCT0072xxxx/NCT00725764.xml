  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to determine the best confirmed response rate, safety, and
      tolerability of GSK1363089 treatment in adult subjects with squamous cell carcinoma of the
      head and neck (SCCHN). GSK1363089 is a new chemical entity that inhibits multiple receptor
      tyrosine kinases (RTKs) with growth-promoting and angiogenic properties. The primary targets
      of GSK1363089 are the HGF and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) RTK families (eg,
      MET, VEGFR2/kinase insert domain receptor [KDR]). Since MET overexpression has been
      associated with poorer prognosis and MET tyrosine kinase mutations have been reported in
      SCCHN, inhibition of MET receptor and VEGFR2/KDR activation by agents such as GSK1363089 may
      be of therapeutic benefit in this patient population.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Achieving Best Overall Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Best overall response was assessed by the investigator per response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST). Per RECIST v1.0 for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR. Tumor size was recorded at Baseline, and tumor response were recorded approximately every 8 weeks. Tumor response were classified by the investigator using RECIST criteria participant's best response whether observed in the study treatment period or the treatment extension period was considered. The best overall response was the best response recorded from the start of treatment until disease progression/recurrence. Number of participants who achieved best overall response were recorded.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>ORR was defined as the proportion of participants achieving best overall response of confirmed CR or PR divided by the total number of participants who received treatment. Per RECIST v1.0 for target lesions and assessed by MRI: CR, Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response PR, &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; OR = CR + PR. Participants were evaluated for tumor response per RECIST. Percentage of participants with ORR were reported.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 20 months</time_frame>
    <description>Data for number of participants who presented one or more adverse events (serious or non serious) was reported. An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence (MO) in a participant temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product (MP), whether or not considered related to the MP and can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with its use. The SAE was any untoward MO that, at any dose, results in death, life threatening, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, results in or prolongs inpatient hospitalization, congenital abnormality or birth defect, that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this definition.</description>

Participants fasted 2 hours before to 1 hour after each dose. Each treatment cycle was 2 weeks. The 8-week study treatment period consisted of four 2-week treatment cycles. In the absence of progressive disease (PD) and unacceptable toxicity, participants may have received foretinib treatment on the same dosing schedule for up to 1 year at the discretion of the investigator, and beyond 1 year with the approval of the sponsor while participating in this study. During the treatment extension period, participants continued to receive foretinib on Days 1 through 5 followed by a 9-day observation period.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</title>
        <description>Data for number of participants who presented one or more adverse events (serious or non serious) was reported. An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence (MO) in a participant temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product (MP), whether or not considered related to the MP and can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with its use. The SAE was any untoward MO that, at any dose, results in death, life threatening, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, results in or prolongs inpatient hospitalization, congenital abnormality or birth defect, that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this definition.</description>

            <description>In each treatment period, participants received foretinib 240 mg capsules orally on Days 1-5 of every 14-day cycle. Participants fasted 2 hours before to 1 hour after each dose. Each treatment cycle was 2 weeks. The 8-week study treatment period consisted of four 2-week treatment cycles. In the absence of PD and unacceptable toxicity, participants may have received foretinib treatment on the same dosing schedule for up to 1 year at the discretion of the investigator, and beyond 1 year with the approval of the sponsor while participating in this study. During the treatment extension period, participants continued to receive foretinib on Days 1 through 5 followed by a 9-day observation period.</description>
