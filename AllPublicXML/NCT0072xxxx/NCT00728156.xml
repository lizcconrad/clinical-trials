  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with diabetes are more likely to develop furring of their coronary arteries and
      present with angina and heart attacks. Furthermore, after such an event, they have poorer
      outcomes (higher rates of death) and survivors are more likely to have recurring symptoms.
      Using a novel &quot;clotting chamber&quot; the investigators have shown that patients with diabetes are
      more likely to develop blood clots. This study will look at the role of different blood
      thinning medications in patients with diabetes. If successful, the investigators will provide
      evidence to conduct large clinical studies to look at the role of additional blood thinning
      medication in reducing heart attacks and strokes in patients with diabetes.

      The objective of this study is to compare the effect of Clopidogrel on platelet dependent
      thrombosis in patients with T2DM and CAD with placebo. The Badimon chamber, an ex vivo
      arterial injury model is used for this purpose. This model simulates the in vivo situation of
      high shear arterial wall damage and helps to quantify thrombus which is the sum endpoint of
      all haemostatic abnormalities seen in vitro.

    <description>Patients assigned to clopidogrel in addition to their standard care.(all patients will be on aspirin)We aim to study the effect of clopidogrel as dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with established coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes. Ninety patients with type 2 diabetes and stable coronary artery disease has been randomly treated with clopidogrel or placebo (45 each) for one week in addition to their standard care (including aspirin,75 mg once daily).</description>

    <description>Patients assigned to placebo in addition to their standard care.(all patients will be on aspirin).This is a single-centre randomised double-blind placebo-controlled parallel design study, comparing efficacy of clopidogrel versus placebo in patients with T2DM and coronary artery disease. Ninety patients have completed the study. All patients were on their routine medications as per standard practice. After informed consent, participants were randomised to receive either clopidogrel 75mg daily or placebo for 7 days.</description>
