    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients who completed the 10 cycles of docetaxel administrations in the preceding
        XRP6976J/2101 study and wish to continue docetaxel administrations,and who have no
        alternative therapy for hormone refractory prostate cancer according to the Investigator's
        judgment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Continuation in the study would be detrimental to the patient's well-being

          -  Development of life-threatening and/or toxic conditions not manageable by symptomatic
             care, dose reduction, or delay of dosing

          -  Obvious disease progression (rising prostate specific antigen, any increase of â‰¥ 20 %
             in the sum of the measurable lesion in comparison to the nadir value, and progression
             in non-measurable lesion)

          -  Patients treated with anti-cancer treatment other than study therapy after completion
             of 10 cycles of study treatment in the XRP6976J/2101 study
