        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must sign an informed consent consistent with ICH-GCP guidelines prior to

          2. Male or female patients 40 years of age or older.

          3. Patients must have a diagnosis of COPD defined by a post-bronchodilator FEV1 &lt; 80% of
             predicted and FEV1 &lt; 70% of FVC (to be obtained 30 minutes after administration of
             salbutamol HFA). Predicted normal values will be calculated according to ECSC
             (R94-1408).

             For Height measured in inches

             Males:

             FEV1 predicted (L) = 4.30 x (height (inches)/39.37) - 0.029 x age (yrs) - 2.49

             Females:

             FEV1 predicted (L) = 3.95 x [height (inches)/39.37] - 0.025 x age (yrs) - 2.60

             or Height measured in meters

             Males:

             FEV1 predicted (L) = 4.30 x [height (meters)] - 0.029 x age (yrs) - 2.49

             Females:

             FEV1 predicted (L) = 3.95 x [height (meters)] - 0.025 x age (yrs) - 2.60

          4. Patients must have a diagnosis of chronic bronchitis symptoms i.e., cough and sputum
             expectoration on most days for at least three months in each of two consecutive years.

          5. Patients must be a current or ex-smoker with a smoking history of sup or egal to 10
             pack years (Patients who have never smoked cigarettes must be excluded).

          6. Patients must be able to perform all specified procedures and able to maintain all
             necessary records during the study period as required in the protocol.

          7. Patients must be able to inhale medication in a competent manner from the HandiHaler®
             device for BIBW 2948 BS.

          8. Patients must be able to read and understand the questionnaires in the languages
             provided (English in the U.S., French in France and German in Germany).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with significant diseases other than COPD will be excluded. A significant
             disease is defined as a disease or condition which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, may put the patients at risk because of participation in the study or
             may influence either the results of the study or the patient's ability to participate
             in the study.Patients with clinically relevant abnormal baseline haematology, blood
             chemistry, or urinalysis if the abnormality defines a significant disease as defined
             in exclusion criteria No. 1.

          2. Patients with an acute or chronic hepatitis or alpha one antitrypsin deficiency or
             other liver disease.

             x the upper limit of the normal range will be excluded regardless of the clinical
             condition. A repeat laboratory evaluation will not be conducted in these patients.

          4. Patients with history of asthma or allergic rhinitis.

             converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers) that in the opinion
             of the investigator are causing symptoms of cough.

          9. Patients with any respiratory tract infection or COPD exacerbation in the 30 days
             prior the visit 1 or during the 1-week period prior to visit 2 (visit 2 will not be
             postponed and the patient will be discontinued from the study).

         10. Patients who have had any change in their respiratory medications within the last 6
             weeks prior the visit 1.

         11. Patients with a history of thoracotomy for other reasons should be evaluated as per
             Exclusion 1.

         12. Patients with a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease that have changed
             medication (dose intensification or a change in therapy) to treat this disease within
             the 6 weeks prior the visit 1.

         13. Patients with a history of cancer, other than treated basal cell carcinoma, within the
             last five years.
