    <textblock>
      We propose to study and compare measures of brain energy metabolism in geriatric bipolar
      individuals and healthy older adults. We would also like to investigate changes in brain
      energy metabolites and in vivo creatine kinase (CK) enzymatic activity associated with CoQ10
      administration in older bipolar individuals.

      Hypotheses

        1. At baseline, the forward rate constant (kfor) of CK enzymatic activity in the frontal
           lobe of older subjects with bipolar depression will be significantly decreased relative
           to that of age-matched healthy controls.

        2. After 8 weeks of treatment, bipolar depression subjects will demonstrate an increase in
           the kfor of CK after 8 weeks of CoQ 10 treatment.

        3. Increases in the CK forward rate constant (kfor) will correlate with improvement in
           subjects' mood state as assessed by the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale
           (MADRS).

        4. Baseline measures of executive functioning and information processing speed (measured by
           performance on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), Trails A and B and Stroop tests)
           will be impaired in subjects with geriatric bipolar depression compared with healthy
           controls. These measures will improve with successful treatment with CoQ10 and correlate
           with increases in the CK forward rate constant (kfor).

      Summary:

      A review of literature suggests a distinct pattern of bioenergetic changes, possibly related
      to mitochondrial dysfunction and abnormal CK function, in older adults and in individuals
      with bipolar disorder. As opposed to rudimentary measurements of static metabolite
      concentrations, the novel use of MT-MRS in such individuals will offer insight into the
      enzyme kinetics of CK, specifically examining the rate at which ATP is formed from PCr. From
      previous investigations it would seem that the dietary-supplement, CoQ10, is able to improve
      the efficiency of mitochondrial function in subjects with altered bioenergetics. We propose
      to measure CK activity and PCr turnover rate before and after CoQ10 treatment, with the
      overall aim of understanding metabolic relationships between brain bioenergetic alterations
      and treatment with CoQ10 in geriatric bipolar depression.

    <measure>We Measured the Change in Rate Constant of Creatine Kinase in Individuals With Bipolar Depression Treated With CoQ 10 as Compared With Age and Gender Matched Controls. These Rate Constants Were Calculated Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).</measure>
    <time_frame>8 week trial</time_frame>
    <description>The rate constant for creatine kinase is a measurement of the reaction rate ADP+PCr &lt;---&gt; ATP + Cr, which is catalyzed by the enzyme creatine kinase. The rate constant shows the direction and magnitude of the reaction at equilibrium. A higher rate constant indicates a higher rate constant of the CK enzyme, meaning, more efficient/rapid conversion of PCr to ATP through the creatine kinase enzymatic reaction in tissues with high and fluctuating energy demands such as brain and muscle tissue. As the value is a reaction rate, there are no associated units.</description>

    <measure>We Measured Response to Treatment of Depression (Using the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale)in Older Adults With Bipolar Disorder After an 8 Week Trial of CoQ10.</measure>
    <time_frame>8 week trial</time_frame>
    <description>The Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) is a 10 question questionnaire which assesses symptom severity of depression. The score is on a 0-60 scale with higher numbers indicating more severe depressive symptoms. The score is represented as a number of points.
Clinical improvement following treatment with CoQ10 supplement was only tested in the Bipolar subject cohort, not in healthy controls, therefore outcome data only apply to the bipolar group.</description>

        <title>We Measured the Change in Rate Constant of Creatine Kinase in Individuals With Bipolar Depression Treated With CoQ 10 as Compared With Age and Gender Matched Controls. These Rate Constants Were Calculated Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).</title>
        <description>The rate constant for creatine kinase is a measurement of the reaction rate ADP+PCr &lt;---&gt; ATP + Cr, which is catalyzed by the enzyme creatine kinase. The rate constant shows the direction and magnitude of the reaction at equilibrium. A higher rate constant indicates a higher rate constant of the CK enzyme, meaning, more efficient/rapid conversion of PCr to ATP through the creatine kinase enzymatic reaction in tissues with high and fluctuating energy demands such as brain and muscle tissue. As the value is a reaction rate, there are no associated units.</description>

        <title>We Measured Response to Treatment of Depression (Using the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale)in Older Adults With Bipolar Disorder After an 8 Week Trial of CoQ10.</title>
        <description>The Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) is a 10 question questionnaire which assesses symptom severity of depression. The score is on a 0-60 scale with higher numbers indicating more severe depressive symptoms. The score is represented as a number of points.
Clinical improvement following treatment with CoQ10 supplement was only tested in the Bipolar subject cohort, not in healthy controls, therefore outcome data only apply to the bipolar group.</description>
