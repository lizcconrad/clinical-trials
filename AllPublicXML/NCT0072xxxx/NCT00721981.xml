      The main purpose of this study is the identification, description, and segmentation of
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients based on their value appraisal of treatment
      outcomes and all intermediate states of health, to obtain patient preferences in direct
      correlation with clinical data from patients suffering from NSCLC (stage IIIB / IV) who are
      in transition from 1st to 2nd line treatment, and to gain utility scores by health state
      derived from patients' perceived value and taken from their perspective.
