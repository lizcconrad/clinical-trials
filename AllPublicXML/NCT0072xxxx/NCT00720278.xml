    <measure>Change From Baseline in 12-hour Reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score(rTNSS)for the Entire 14-day Study Period Compared to Placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>rTNSS consisting of runny nose, itchy nose, nasal congestion, and sneezing was assessed twice daily. Each symptom is rated on a scale from 0-3: 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, and 3=severe. (maximum 12 points per assessment.) Total possible score is 24 per day.
Least square means was controlled for study day as the within-patient effect, treatment group and site as the between-patient effects, treatment by-study day interaction, and baseline as a covariate.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Instantaneous Total Nasal Symptom Score for the Entire 14-day Study Period Compared to Placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 14 Days</time_frame>
    <description>instantaneous (subjects rate how they feel &quot;right now&quot;) total nasal symptom score consisting of runny nose, itchy nose, nasal congestion, and sneezing was assessed twice daily. Each symptom is rated on a scale from 0-3: 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, and 3=severe. Total possible score is 24 per day.
Least square means was controlled for study day as the within-patient effect, treatment group and site as the between-patient effects, treatment by-study day interaction, and basline as a covariate.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the 12-hour Reflective Secondary Symptom Complex Score for the Entire 14-day Study Period Compared to Placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Reflective secondary symptom scores (SSCS) (post-nasal drip, itchy eyes, cough and headache) were assessed twice daily. Each symptom is rated on a scale from 0-3: 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, and 3=severe. Total possible SSCS score is 24 per day.
Least square means was controlled for study day as the within-patient effect, treatment group and site as the between-patient effects, treatment by-study day interaction, and basline as a covariate.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to Day 14 in the Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) Compared to Placebo in Patients 18 Years of Age and Older</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>A 28-item RQLQ was completed on Day 1 and Day 14 or Early temination. The RQLQ consists of 7 domains rated on a 7 point scale with 0 being not troubled by the allergy symptoms, and 6 being extremely troubled/all of the time.
Domain score will be calculated from the mean score of all items in the domain. Overall score will be calculated from the mean score of all items.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female patients 12 years of age and older

          2. Provide written informed consent/pediatric assent. If the patient is a minor, a parent
             or legal guardian must give written informed consent

          3. Screening Visit: Have a 12-hour reflective TNSS of at least 8 out of a possible 12 and
             a congestion score of 2 or 3 on Day -7

          4. Randomization Visit: Have a 12-hour reflective TNSS (AM or PM) of at least 8 on 3
             separate symptom assessments (one of which was within 2 days of Day 1, and can include
             the morning of Day 1) during the Lead-in Period. In addition, an AM or PM 12-hour
             reflective nasal congestion score of 2 or 3 must have been recorded on 3 separate
             symptom assessments (one of which was within 2 days of Day 1, and can include the
             morning of Day 1)

          5. Randomization Visit: An instantaneous TNSS of ≥ 8 before beginning the onset of action
             assessment on Day 1

          6. Must have taken at least 10 doses of study medication during the lead-in period

          7. Willing and able to comply with the study requirements

          8. At least a 2-year history of SAR

          9. The presence of IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to ragweed antigen or other local fall
             allergens, confirmed by a positive response to either skin prick within the last year.
             A positive response is defined as a wheal diameter of at least 3 mm larger than the
             negative control for the skin prick test.

         10. General good health and free of any disease or concomitant treatment that could
             interfere with the interpretation of the study results as determined by the
             investigator or the sponsor's medical officer. When in doubt, the investigator should
             confer with the sponsor's medical monitor or designee to determine eligibility for the
             study.

         11. Patients receiving immunotherapy injections (antigen desensitization) must be on a
             stable maintenance regimen for at least 30 days before the first study visit
             (adjustments to regimen following a brief period of missed injections does not
             preclude participation). Patients currently receiving sublingual immunotherapy are
             excluded. A 6-month washout period is required following the last dose of sublingual
             immunotherapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. On Focused Nasal Examination, the presence of any nasal mucosal erosion, nasal
             ulceration, or nasal septal perforation at either the screening visit or randomization
             visit will disqualify the patient from the study.

          2. Other nasal disease(s) likely such as sinusitis, rhinitis medicamentosa, clinically
             significant polyposis, or nasal structural abnormalities.

          3. Nasal surgery or sinus surgery within the previous year.

          4. Chronic sinusitis - more than 3 episodes per year

          5. Planned travel outside of the study area during the study period

          6. The use of any investigational drug within 30 days prior to Day -7. No investigational
             products are permitted for use during the conduct of this study

          7. Presence of any hypersensitivity to drugs similar to azelastine and to either sorbitol
             or sucralose (Splenda® brand sweetener)

          8. Women who are pregnant or nursing

          9. Women of childbearing potential who are not abstinent or not practicing a medically
             acceptable method of contraception

         10. Respiratory Tract Infections within 14 days prior to Day -7

         11. Respiratory Tract Infections requiring oral antibiotic within 14 days of Day -7

         12. Asthma (with the exception of mild, intermittent asthma). Patients with mild,
             intermittent asthma who only require short-acting inhaled bronchodilators are eligible
             for enrollment.

         13. Significant pulmonary disease including COPD

         14. Clinically significant arrhythmia or with symptomatic cardiac conditions

         15. A known history of alcohol or drug abuse

         16. Existence of any surgical or medical condition or physical or laboratory findings,
             which in the opinion of the investigator or sponsor's medical monitor, might
             significantly alter the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of study
             drug or that might significantly affect the patient's ability to complete this trial.

         17. Clinically relevant abnormal physical findings within 1 week of randomization which,
             in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with the objectives of the study
             or that may preclude compliance with the study procedures

         18. Participation in MedPointe Protocols MP433, MP434, MP435, or MP436.

        <description>rTNSS consisting of runny nose, itchy nose, nasal congestion, and sneezing was assessed twice daily. Each symptom is rated on a scale from 0-3: 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, and 3=severe. (maximum 12 points per assessment.) Total possible score is 24 per day.
Least square means was controlled for study day as the within-patient effect, treatment group and site as the between-patient effects, treatment by-study day interaction, and baseline as a covariate.</description>

        <description>instantaneous (subjects rate how they feel &quot;right now&quot;) total nasal symptom score consisting of runny nose, itchy nose, nasal congestion, and sneezing was assessed twice daily. Each symptom is rated on a scale from 0-3: 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, and 3=severe. Total possible score is 24 per day.
Least square means was controlled for study day as the within-patient effect, treatment group and site as the between-patient effects, treatment by-study day interaction, and basline as a covariate.</description>
