    <textblock>
      Increases in carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT) are correlated with increased risk
      of stroke and myocardial infarction. The purpose of this study is to assess if pomegranate
      juice will retard the carotid (IMT) progression rate in men and women who have one or more
      existing cardiovascular risk factors (current cigarette smoking, hypertension, low
      HDL-cholesterol, and/or high LDL-cholesterol) upon entrance into the study.

      Previous studies in atherosclerotic mice have shown that pomegranate supplementation reduced
      their macrophage oxidative stress and attenuated the development of their atherosclerosis.
      Further research in hypertensive humans demonstrated that pomegranate juice had an
      angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory effect and significantly decreased systolic
      blood pressure.

      This study will use a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design with eight clinic
      visits (one screening visit [week -4 to -1], one baseline visit [week 0], and six treatment
      visits [weeks 13, 26, 38, 52, 65, and 78]).
