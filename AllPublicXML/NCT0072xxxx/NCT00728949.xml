      The purpose of this study is to determine whether IMC-A12 offers increased progression-free
      survival (PFS) associated with IMC-A12 monotherapy and IMC-A12 in combination with an
      antiestrogen therapy in patients with hormone receptor positive advanced or metastatic breast
      cancer that have experienced disease progression on antiestrogen therapy.

    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common form of malignancy affecting women worldwide, with
      approximately 178,480 new cases of invasive breast cancer and 62,030 new cases of in situ
      breast cancer expected in the United States (US) in 2007. Approximately 40,460 women are
      expected to die of breast cancer in the coming year, making the disease the second leading
      cause of cancer-related mortality among women (trailing only cancers of the lung and
      bronchus). However, thanks in part to recent advances in treatment, mortality rates
      associated with breast cancer have declined consistently since 1990.

      Surgical resection and other treatments may particularly benefit patients whose disease is
      identified prior to metastasis; the 5-year survival rate for patients diagnosed with
      locoregionally advanced disease is 83%. However, women with distant metastases at diagnosis
      have a much poorer outlook, with a 5-year survival rate of only 26% and a median survival of
      approximately 2 years. Treatment of advanced disease may include first-line chemotherapy
      utilizing an anthracycline (eg, doxorubicin or epirubicin), antibody therapy, limited
      surgery, taxanes, and other cytotoxic agents. As complete responses are rare, these
      treatments are not generally employed as curative but in an effort to prolong life and
      provide symptom palliation.

      Approximately two-thirds of all breast cancers are positive for expression of the estrogen
      receptor.For patients whose tumors are positive for this receptor or the progesterone
      receptor, the preferred first-line treatment comprises blockade of estradiol synthesis or
      hormone receptor activity using aromatase inhibitors or antiestrogen agents. Although
      endocrine therapies are useful and well-tolerated, most patients respond to this form of
      treatment for about 12-18 months before developing refractory disease. New therapies able to
      provide additional benefit to patients with hormone receptor-positive,
      antiestrogen-refractory, advanced and metastatic breast cancer are required.

          -  Tumors are positive for estrogen receptors (ER), progesterone receptors (PgR), or both
             (ie, 10% or more of infiltrating cancer cells exhibit nuclear staining for ER and/or
             PgR; positive biochemical test results are also acceptable)

          -  The patient has received prior antiestrogen therapy:

               1. With at least one antiestrogen agent (with or without ovarian suppression)
                  administered for ≥ 3 months in the adjuvant or metastatic setting; and

               2. Experienced disease progression while on or within 12 months after receiving the
                  last dose of endocrine therapy

          -  The patient is postmenopausal and/or meets at least one of the following criteria:

               1. Age ≥ 18 years with an intact uterus and amenorrhea for ≥ 12 months, with
                  estradiol and/or follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) values in the postmenopausal
                  range

               2. History of bilateral oophorectomy

               3. History of bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy

               4. History of radiation castration and amenorrheic for ≥ 3 months

          -  The patient has fasting serum glucose &lt; 120 mg/dL or below the ULN

        Exclusion Criteria:

             metastatic (or locally advanced and inoperable breast cancer) and adjuvant setting

          -  The patient has poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. Patients with a history of
             diabetes mellitus are allowed to participate, provided that their blood glucose is
             within normal range (fasting glucose at study entry &lt; 120 mg/dL or below ULN) and that
             they are on a stable dietary and/or therapeutic regimen for this condition
