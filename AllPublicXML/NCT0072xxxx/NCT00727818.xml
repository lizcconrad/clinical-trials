  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate by histology and histomorphometry, thirty human
      osseous biopsies sampled from fifteen patients (2 biopsies per patient) following 3 months of
      implantation. This study is part of a splitting-blind clinical investigation to compare the
      performance and safety of INION GTRTM Biodegradable Membrane System to resorbable bilayer
      Bio-Gide®-membrane of Geistlich biomaterials in enhancing bone regeneration after removal of
      wisdom teeth.

      The bone defect and alveolar cavity were augmented with Spongostan® dental 1x1x1cm, Johnson &amp;
      Johnson, Spreitenbach, Switzerland. The extraction sites were covered on one side with an
      INION GTRTM Biodegradable Membrane System and on the other with Geistlich resorbable bilayer
      Bio-Gide®-membrane.

      This study was conducted in adaptation to the ISO 10993 Standard : Biological Evaluation of
      Medical Devices, Part 6 (2007): Tests for Local Effects after Implantation.

      This study was conducted in accordance with the requirements of the FDA (Department of health
      and human services) Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) Regulations, 21 CFR 58 (revised as of
      April 01, 2005) and in accordance with the requirements of the OECD Good Laboratory
      Practices, reference ENV/MC/CHEM (98) 17, adapted by council on November 26th 1997.
