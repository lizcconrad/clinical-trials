  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 14-week study will observe the gene expression of certain immune cells in patients with
      rheumatoid arthritis who receive etanercept, infliximab, and adalimumab. Patients at the
      National Institute of Rheumatology and Physiotherapy, Budapest, who are already scheduled to
      receive an anti-TNF agent will be asked to participate in this study. Patients will receive
      their treatment (etanercept, infliximab, or adalimumab) as scheduled, and have blood samples
      collected during the study and analyzed by the laboratory. Patient's response to their
      treatment will also be studied based on x-rays and other examinations.

      Only patients who - regardless of this study - are scheduled and permitted to receive
      anti-TNF-alpha treatment because of their RA will be asked to participate. No patient will be
      recruited only for the sake of the study. The prescribing physicians will not be influenced
      by the study as to what form of anti-TNF-alpha therapy they should select.

        Subjects will be recruited from a single center at the National Institute of Rheumatology
        and Physiotherapy, Budapest, the largest center for biological therapy in Hungary. Subjects
        will be patients who are scheduled and permitted to receive anti-TNF-alpha treatment due to
        their rheumatoid arthritis.
