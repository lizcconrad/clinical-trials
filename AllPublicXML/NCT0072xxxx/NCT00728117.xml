  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that feeding preterm infants while they receive indomethacin or ibuprofen
      therapy for treatment of a patent ductus arteriosus will decrease the incidence of feeding
      intolerance and shorten the time period that infants need to tolerate full enteral nutrition.
      We also hypothesize that this intervention will minimize the alterations in intestinal
      permeability that occur with these drugs and will improve the infants' hemodynamic response
      to enteral nutrition

    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled multi-center clinical trial to determine whether very
      low birth weight infants should receive feedings during indomethacin or ibuprofen treatment
      of a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Many neonatologists withhold feeds from premature
      infants receiving indomethacin or ibuprofen therapy for a PDA because of concerns that these
      drugs alter intestinal blood flow and permeability. However, there are no established studies
      which show that feeding during these medical treatments leads to bowel injury. At the same
      time, studies suggest that withholding feedings from premature infants may lead to intestinal
      atrophy and injury, leading to increased difficulty with feedings when they are initiated or
      re-started. Thus, this multi-center study evaluates whether feeding infants during
      indomethacin or ibuprofen therapy improves feeding tolerance by measuring the number of
      episodes of feeding intolerance and the number of days required to attain full feedings. In
      addition, this study will employ techniques to measure gastrointestinal permeability and
      mesenteric blood flow in patients who receive and don't receive feedings for their PDA
      treatment.
