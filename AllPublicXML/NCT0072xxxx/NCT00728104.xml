      This is a study with the principle goal being to learn about the use of L-Carnitine and
      CoQ10, two vitamin supplements that are currently being used to treat Cyclic Vomiting
      Syndrome, largely initiated by parents. We want to learn how effective these supplements are
      compared to standard treatment, at what dose, and what onset of action in order to initiate
      future prospective study on these supplements.

        Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome (CVS) is a condition where children and adults have repeated
        attacks of severe vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain, headaches, and tiredness. These
        episodes can last from several hours to several days.
