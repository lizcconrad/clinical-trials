    <textblock>
      The problem of cocaine dependence remains a major medical, social, and legal concern. Several
      studies have suggested that disulfiram may be beneficial for the treatment of cocaine
      dependence. A common assumption has been that disulfiram treatment, by increasing DA
      availability, enhances the aversive aspects of stimulants. This study aims to measure plasma
      activity in those with the C/C DBH genotype, which is associated with higher DBH activity
      subsequently making the disulfiram treatment more effective, as well as determine the effects
      of treatment with disulfiram on cocaine self-administration using a human laboratory model of
      cocaine self-administration.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Meet DSM IV criteria for cocaine dependence; 2. Have a self-reported history of
             using cocaine by the smoked or IV route. Participants must report at least weekly use
             for the past month and have a cocaine-positive urine test in the week of study entry;
             3. Have vital signs after a 48 hours washout period as follows: resting pulse between
             50 and 80 bpm, blood pressures between 105-130mm Hg systolic and 45-80mm Hg diastolic;
             4. Have hematology and chemistry laboratory tests that are within normal (+/- 10%)
             limits with the following exceptions: a) liver function tests (total bilirubin, ALT,
             AST, and alkaline phosphatase) &lt; 3 x the upper limit of normal, and b) kidney function
             tests (creatinine and BUN) &lt; 2 x the upper limit of normal; 5. Have a baseline ECG
             that demonstrates normal sinus rhythm, normal conduction, and no clinically
             significant arrhythmias; and 6. Have a medical history and standard physical
             examination demonstrating no clinically significant contraindications for study
             participation, in the judgment of the admitting physician and the principal
             investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Have any history or evidence suggestive of seizures or brain injury 2. Have any
             previous medically adverse reaction to cocaine, including loss of consciousness, chest
             pain, or epileptic seizure; 3. Have neurological or psychiatric disorders, such as:

               -  psychosis, bipolar illness or major depression as assessed by MINI (or SCID if
                  necessary);

               -  organic brain disease or dementia assessed by clinical interview;

               -  history of any psychiatric disorder which would require ongoing treatment or
                  which would make study compliance difficult;

               -  history of suicide attempts within the past three months assessed by MINI and/or
                  current suicidal ideation/plan as assessed by MINI; 4. Have evidence of
                  clinically significant heart disease or hypertension, as determined by the PI; 5.
                  Have a family history in first degree relatives of early cardiovascular morbidity
                  or mortality, as determined by the PI; 6. Have evidence of untreated or unstable
                  medical illness including: neuroendocrine, autoimmune, renal, hepatic, or active
                  infectious disease; 7. Have HIV and are currently symptomatic, have a diagnosis
                  of AIDS, or are receiving antiretroviral medication; 8. Have any history of
                  asthma, chronic coughing and wheezing, or other respiratory illnesses; 9. Heavy
                  current alcohol intake that is likely to lead to withdrawal symptoms, in the
                  opinion of the PI; 10. Refuse to abstain from alcohol during the protocol and for
                  at least one week after discharge.

                  11. Have any other illness, condition, or use of medications, which in the
                  opinion of the PI and/or the admitting physician would preclude safe and/or
                  successful completion of the study.
