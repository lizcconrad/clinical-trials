  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although a large number of obese patients develop high blood pressure, the cause is unknown.
      The purpose of this study is to look at the effect of high fatty acids (a type of fat) in the
      development of high blood pressure in obese people.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies indicate that increased levels of a circulating fat (free fatty acids or FFAs)
      increases blood pressure, impairs endothelial (vascular) function, and increases inflammatory
      markers in subjects with and without diabetes. The effects of FFA on blood pressure and
      vasculature have not been fully investigated. A group of 12 obese nondiabetic, normotensive
      subjects will be admitted to the Grady Clinical Research Center (GCRC) on separate 4
      occasions. Research subjects will receive, in random order, a 8-hour intravenous (IV)
      infusion of Intralipid 20% at 40 mL/h (a fat solution), 8-hour IV infusion of normal saline
      at 40 mL/h, 8-hour IV infusion of dextrose (sugar) 10% at 40 mL/h, and a 8-hour intravenous
      (IV) infusion combination of Intralipid 20% and dextrose 10% at 40mL/h.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Systolic blood pressure is the amount of pressure the heart generates when pumping blood through the arteries to the body.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 hours, 8 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples were collected for the measurement of insulin levels at baseline, 4 hours after saline infusion, and 8 hours after saline infusion. Insulin was measured in plasma using a solid phase, two-site sequential chemiluminescent immunometric assays on the DPC Immulite analyzer. Current guidelines identify normal insulin levels as 8.8 μU/mL for men and 8.4 for women. High levels of insulin most frequently indicate insulin resistance or hypoglycemia, if paired with a low glucose level.

    <measure>C-peptides Levels for Saline Infusion</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 hours, 8 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples were collected for the measurement of C-peptide levels at baseline, 4 hours after saline infusion, and 8 hours after saline infusion. C-peptide was measured in plasma using a solid phase, two-site sequential chemiluminescent immunometric assays on the DPC Immulite analyzer. Current guidelines identify normal C-peptide levels as 0.51 to 2.72 ng/mL.
A high level of C-peptide generally indicates a high level of endogenous insulin production. This may be in response to a high blood glucose caused by glucose intake and/or insulin resistance. A high level of C-peptide is also seen with insulinomas and may be seen with low blood potassium, Cushing syndrome, and renal failure. A low level of C-peptide is associated with a low level of insulin production. This can occur when insufficient insulin is being produced by the beta cells, with diabetes for example, or when production is suppressed by treatment with exogenous insulin.</description>

        <title>Change in Systolic Blood Pressure From Baseline to 4 Hours</title>
        <description>Systolic blood pressure is the amount of pressure the heart generates when pumping blood through the arteries to the body. Current guidelines identify normal systolic blood pressure as lower than 120 mmHg. Blood pressure was measured in triplicate with a manual cuff prior to and every 4 hours during the 8 hour infusion with subjects in supine position. Change is the difference between 4 hour systolic blood pressure from baseline systolic blood pressure.</description>

Current guidelines identify normal range of FFA level as less than 0.72 mmol/L. Elevated plasma levels of FFA indicate a greater rate of insulin resistance.

        <title>Change in Triglyceride Levels From Baseline to 8 Hours</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for measurement of triglycerides at baseline and 4 hours after each infusion. Triglyceride levels were measured on CX7 Chemistry Analyzer. Current guidelines identify normal range of triglyceride level as less than 150 mg/dL. Elevated levels of triglycerides are associated with an increased risk of developing heart disease. Change is the difference between 8 hour triglyceride levels from baseline triglyceride levels.</description>

        <title>Change in Diastolic Blood Pressure From Baseline to 4 Hours</title>
        <description>Diastolic blood pressure is the amount of pressure in your arteries when your heart is at rest between beats. Current guidelines identify normal diastolic blood pressure as lower than 80 mmHg. Blood pressure was measured in triplicate with a manual cuff prior to and every 4 hours during the 8 hour infusion with subjects in supine position. Change is the difference between 4 hour diastolic blood pressure from baseline diastolic blood pressure.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected for measurement of plasma glucose levels at baseline, 4 hours after dextrose infusion, and 8 hours after dextrose infusion. Plasma glucose was measured on CX7 Chemistry Analyzer. Current guidelines identify normal fasting glucose as less than 100 mg/dL. High levels of glucose most frequently indicates diabetes.</description>

        <title>Insulin Levels for Saline Infusion</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for the measurement of insulin levels at baseline, 4 hours after saline infusion, and 8 hours after saline infusion. Insulin was measured in plasma using a solid phase, two-site sequential chemiluminescent immunometric assays on the DPC Immulite analyzer. Current guidelines identify normal insulin levels as 8.8 μU/mL for men and 8.4 for women. High levels of insulin most frequently indicate insulin resistance or hypoglycemia, if paired with a low glucose level. Low levels of insulin paired with high glucose level can indicate diabetes.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected for the measurement of insulin levels at baseline, 4 hours after intralipid/dextrose infusion, and 8 hours after intralipid/dextrose infusion. Insulin was measured in plasma using a solid phase, two-site sequential chemiluminescent immunometric assays on the DPC Immulite analyzer. Current guidelines identify normal insulin levels as 8.8 μU/mL for men and 8.4 for women. High levels of insulin most frequently indicate insulin resistance or hypoglycemia, if paired with a low glucose level. Low levels of insulin paired with high glucose level can indicate diabetes.</description>

        <title>C-peptides Levels for Saline Infusion</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for the measurement of C-peptide levels at baseline, 4 hours after saline infusion, and 8 hours after saline infusion. C-peptide was measured in plasma using a solid phase, two-site sequential chemiluminescent immunometric assays on the DPC Immulite analyzer. Current guidelines identify normal C-peptide levels as 0.51 to 2.72 ng/mL.
A high level of C-peptide generally indicates a high level of endogenous insulin production. This may be in response to a high blood glucose caused by glucose intake and/or insulin resistance. A high level of C-peptide is also seen with insulinomas and may be seen with low blood potassium, Cushing syndrome, and renal failure. A low level of C-peptide is associated with a low level of insulin production. This can occur when insufficient insulin is being produced by the beta cells, with diabetes for example, or when production is suppressed by treatment with exogenous insulin.</description>

      <pi_employee>All Principal Investigators ARE employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>

    <limitations_and_caveats>A larger sample size and inclusion of subjects from different ethnicities would be required to generalize the results of this study. Study used healthy volunteers--outcomes cannot be applied to patients with diabetes mellitus or insulin resistance</limitations_and_caveats>
