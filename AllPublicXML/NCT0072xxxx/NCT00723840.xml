      This observational study will evaluate the social cost and quality of life of participants
      who have had Crohn's Disease for at least 6 months and have active disease despite drug
      therapy. Participants are followed for a total of 18 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants for this study will be enrolled from 25 gastroenterology sites, even spread
      across Italy. Each center will enroll between 10 and 40 participants each.

    <description>Direct health care costs, non health care costs and costs for productivity loss were calculated by observation period in Crohn's Disease participants (in active phase) with a CDAI score &gt;= 150.
Direct health care costs refer to the resources used to prevent and treat a disease. Indirect costs include expenses for a participant's (or their caregiver's) transport, home assistance or home nursing assistance. Costs for productivity loss include the participant's (or their caregiver's) productivity loss or time loss.</description>

    <measure>EuroQoL (Quality of Life)-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) Scores in Participants With Crohn's Disease</measure>

    <description>EQ-5D was calculated for the pharmacoeconomics analysis to evaluate quality of life (QoL) in participants in the active phase with Crohn's Disease and had a CDAI score &gt;= 150.
EQ-5D is a participant answered questionnaire scoring 5 dimensions - mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. The EQ-5D total score ranges from 0 (worst health state) to 1 (perfect health state) and 1 reflects the best outcome.</description>

        <description>EQ-5D was calculated for the pharmacoeconomics analysis to evaluate quality of life (QoL) in participants in the active phase with Crohn's Disease and had a CDAI score &gt;= 150.
EQ-5D is a participant answered questionnaire scoring 5 dimensions - mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. The EQ-5D total score ranges from 0 (worst health state) to 1 (perfect health state) and 1 reflects the best outcome.</description>
