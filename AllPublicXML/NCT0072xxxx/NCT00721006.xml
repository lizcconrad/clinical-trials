    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to compare in patients with double-sided claudication
      if the transplant of a combination of stem cells obtained from the bone marrow of the same
      patient will contribute to the formation of new blood vessels in one of the severly diseased
      ischemic limbs(legs)versus the control limb that receives a placebo product.

      Limb Ischemia (LI) is a severe obstruction of the arteries which seriously decrease blood
      flow to the extremities (mainly feet and legs) and has progressed to the point of severe pain
      and even skin ulcers or sores.

      LI needs comprehensive treatment since the condition will not improve on its own. The overall
      goal of treatment is to reduce pain and increase blood flow to improve symptoms or save the
      leg and feet. In many cases, current options for treatment including medications, surgery or
      endovascular procedures have not been successful.

      In the last few years, investigators have explored therapies aimed to increase blood flow to
      the ischemic vessel by transplanting cells that will promote the development of new vessels
      in the diseased leg.

      The study hypothesis is based on the concept that the process of formation of new blood
      vessels is complex and requires the participation of several types of stem cells and growth
      factors. The lack of any of these components will produce vessels which are immature and
      unable to provide appropriated blood supply to the leg.

      Patients eligible to participate in the this study are those suffering from double-sided
      claudication with poor circulation or severe leg blockages, which are not candidates for
      surgical procedures.

      Once the mixture of stem cells is prepared and the patient's bone marrow is ready, cells will
      be transplanted into the calf muscle of one the the diseased legs while the other diseased
      leg will receive the placebo. Clinical study to evaluate and compare the efficacy of the stem
      cell transplant will be performed for six months post cell transplant.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males or females older than 18 years of age.

          -  Limb ischemia with ABI of &lt; 0.7 in the index lower extremity in two consecutive
             examinations done at least 1 week apart.

          -  Limb ischemia with resting ischemic pain and/or claudication at 100 meters and/or
             non-healing ulcers.

          -  Claudication

          -  Patients not considered candidates for surgical or percutaneous revascularization, due
             to poor target vessels, inability to cross total occlusions, or a morbidity which
             precludes general anesthesia.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             judgment will interfere with the patient's ability to comply with the protocol,
             compromise the patient's safety, or interfere with the interpretation of the study
             results.

          -  No evidence of acute infection

          -  WBC &gt; 15000.
