  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the bacteriological eradication rates of Finafloxacin and Ciprofloxacin in female
      patients with uUTI.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with clinical signs and symptoms of uUTI who have a high probability of the required
      number of bacteria in their urine, measured by positive test for nitrite and /or leucocyte
      esterase by means of a dipstick will be enrolled in this study. Only these patients with
      bacterial count equal or more than 10e5 cfu/mL will be included in the efficacy analysis. At
      Baseline, patients will be randomly assigned (2:1) to receive Finafloxacin 300 mg or
      Ciprofloxacin 250 mg, following a double-dummy design, ie Group 1 will receive Finafloxacin
      tablets + Ciprofloxacin placebo capsule while Group II will receive Ciprofloxacin capsule +
      Finafloxacin placebo tablets. The treatment will last in total 3 days. The microbiological
      results will be compared with the baseline microbiology. If the concentration of initial
      pathogen in the urine is equal or more than 10e3 cfu/mL in the post-therapy culture compared
      with the baseline , this will define a bacteriological eradication. Microbiological
      assessment will be performed as well. Evaluation of the bacteria reinfection or relapse will
      be performed, based on the microbiology results. The status of clinical improvement and cure
      will be considered additionally.
