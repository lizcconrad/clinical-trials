      Aim: We evaluated the process of development of autistic children, in a direct and indirect
      intervention context from mother´s response in Autism Behavior Checklist.

      Method:

      The sample were composed of 11 mothers of children diagnosed with Autism (6) and Asperger
      Syndrome (5), according to the criteria established by the DSM IVtr (APA, 2002). These
      children were randomly divided into two groups: Six were receiving both direct and indirect
      intervention (Therapy Group -TG), and five were receiving exclusively indirect intervention
      (Orientation Group - OG). We used the Autism Behavior Checklist (Krug et al., 1993), adapted
      to Portuguese on three occasions: at the beginning, six months later and 12 months later.
      This is a list of nonadaptive behaviors (57), in the areas: Sensorial, Body and Object Use,
      Language, Social and Relating.
