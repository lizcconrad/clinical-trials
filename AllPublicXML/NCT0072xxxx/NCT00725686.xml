        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is ≥ 50 years old and in general good health. Patients with medically
             controlled chronic disease such as HTN, AODM, and hyperlipidemia may be included.

          -  Patient is capable of giving consent.

          -  Patient is willing and able to comply with the visit schedule and study procedures
             including follow-up visits.

          -  Patient has documented CNV secondary to AMD with evidence of active disease
             characterized by blood vessel leakage or evidence of hemorrhage.

          -  Patient has clear ocular media and adequate pupil dilation to allow good quality
             imaging by fundus photography.

          -  Patient's intraocular pressure is ≤ 25 mmHg

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is of childbearing potential. Every female patient is considered of
             child-bearing potential unless she has had sterilization surgery or is post-menopausal
             and has not had a menstrual period for at least 12 months.

          -  Patient has CNV due to causes other than AMD, including ocular or periocular
             infections.

          -  Patient has lesions not easily imaged and quantified.

          -  Patient has underlying systemic disease such as cardiac, neurological, infectious
             disease, uncontrolled diabetes mellitis, or disease of the eye other than AMD. Patient
             may have medically controlled glaucoma.

          -  Patient is participating in any concurrent interventional study.
