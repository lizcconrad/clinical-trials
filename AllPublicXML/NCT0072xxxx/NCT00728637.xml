    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the FIT Heart Study was to test the effectiveness of a
      hospital-based standardized screening and educational intervention targeted to family members
      of patients hospitalized with CVD, to increase adherence to CVD prevention guidelines.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      FIT Heart was a randomized controlled trial that tested a novel systems approach to increase
      adherence to national prevention guidelines among family members of patients hospitalized
      with CVD. Participants were blood relatives or cohabitants of patients hospitalized with
      atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, aged 20-79 years, did not have established
      cardiovascular disease or diabetes, and spoke English or Spanish. Participants randomized to
      a special intervention group received behavioral counseling and education on diet and
      physical activity; personalized risk factor screening and immediate feedback; and
      reinforcement and follow-up throughout the year. The control group received a brief CVD
      prevention message in the form of a handout. All participants received standardized
      assessments of diet, lifestyle, and CVD risk factors at baseline and 1 year (94% follow-up).
      The main findings have been published showing the mean percent change in LDL-cholesterol
      level from baseline to 1-year improved in both groups and was not significantly different in
      the special intervention vs. control group (-1% vs. -2%; p=.64).
