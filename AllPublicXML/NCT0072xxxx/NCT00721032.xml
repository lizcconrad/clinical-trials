  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ventricular tachycardia (VT) is a morbid arrhythmia responsible for many sudden deaths and
      ICD shocks. Despite much progress in the treatment of arrhythmia, VT remains a therapeutic
      challenge. Most patients with VT have an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) for
      secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death, however, an ICD merely treats VT, it does not
      prevent VT. In patients with recurrent VT and ICD shocks, two strategies are available to
      decrease the burden of VT. The first is antiarrhythmic drugs, and the second is VT ablation.
      The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of antiarrhythmic drugs and VT ablation
      guided by MRI. VT can sometimes be suppressed with antiarrhythmic medications, however, these
      are often ineffective, and carry a high burden of side effects. Many forms of VT can be cured
      by selective destruction of critical electrical pathways with catheter ablation. A major
      limitation in the ablation of VT, however, is the time required to localize scar tissue and
      important pathways for targeting of lesions. Magnetic resonance imaging can now obtain
      reliable images of scar location within the ventricles. Recent advances in electroanatomical
      mapping systems allow operators to import pre-acquired images into the mapping system. The
      aim of this study is to examine the feasibility of importing historic MRI scar maps of the
      ventricles into the electroanatomical system and using such images to guide catheter
      ablation, as compared to antiarrhythmic drug suppression of VT. We suspect that MRI guidance
      will be especially useful in patients with &quot;unstable&quot; VT, i.e. VT that causes an abrupt drop
      in blood pressure, and thus cannot be maintained in the electrophysiology (EP) lab for
      mapping and entertainment purposes. Patients referred for VT ablation have ICDs. Through
      previously completed animal work (Circulation 2004; 110(5): 475-82) and a human trial (2006
      Sep 19;114(12):1277-84) we have demonstrated the safety of MRI in the setting of pacemakers
      and implantable defibrillators using appropriate precautions. Through careful device
      programming and using MRI sequences with limited energy exposure (specific absorption rate &lt;
      2 W/kg) we will study the pre procedural myocardial anatomy of patients enrolled into this
      study.

      The primary endpoint will be lack of VT documented by implantable defibrillator (when
      present) interrogation or Holter monitoring 6 months post ablation. The secondary endpoints
      will be comparison of inducible arrhythmia at the end of the procedure, procedure time,
      comparison of endocardial voltage mapping to scar on delayed enhancement MRI images, and
      complications in each study arm.
