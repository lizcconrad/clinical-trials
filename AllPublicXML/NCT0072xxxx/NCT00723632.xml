    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to evaluate the costs associated with peginterferon alfa-2b
      (PegIntron) plus ribavirin (Rebetol) treatment for chronic hepatitis C in the Czech Republic.
      Only costs associated with rescue medication, concomitant therapy, disease monitoring, and
      medical intervention costs recognized by the treating institution as treatment-related
      expenses will be included in the analysis. The study will also evaluate the correlation
      between hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapy-related costs with ribavirin dosing and participant
      history.

        <title>Average Cost Per Participant With SVR Stratified by Prior Treatment Status</title>
        <description>SVR is defined as undetectable HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) six months after the end of treatment. Cost per participant with SVR was calculated as a ratio of the total costs for all participants and the number of participants with SVR in the given group. All costs were adjusted for inflation to 2010 values.</description>
        <time_frame>From enrollment up to 48 weeks for participants with HCV genotype 1, and from enrollment up to 24 weeks for participants with HCV genotypes 2 and 3</time_frame>
        <population>Participants were included in the analysis if all of the following conditions were met: initial exam form was completed; at least 1 follow up visit form was completed; the end of treatment (either according to plan or early) was recorded; and SVR status was recorded six months after treatment termination.</population>
