      The study hypothesis is the difference in therapeutic effect of two varnish formulations (G1
      = NaF, 2.26%F, G2 = NaF, 2.71% F + CaF2). These products are commercially available in the
      Brazilian and international market and they are used for dental caries as white spot lesions
      control.

      The aim of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic effect of two varnish formulations (G1
      = NaF, 2.26%F, G2 = NaF, 2.71% F + CaF2) on the remineralization of white spot lesions (WSL).
      The sample was composed of 15 (7- to 12-year-old) children with 45 active WSL in anterior
      permanent teeth. The children were randomly divided in two groups providing 22 lesions for G1
      and 23 for G2. The children were submitted to weekly varnish applications 4 times. The WSL
      were evaluated twice: baseline and on week 4. Maximum lesion dimensions (mesial-distal and
      incisal-gingival) were measured in millimeters and classified in four grades of size. WSL
      were also recorded assessing lesion activity by one calibrated examiner. The Pearson
      chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were used (P &lt; 0.01). WSL reductions were observed in
      both varnish groups (Chi-square= 0.15, d.f.=1, P=0.90); and with similar magnitude (in mm):
      1.19 and 1.29 for G1 and G2, respectively. Thirty-six WLS (15 in G1 and 26 in G2) were
      classified as inactive in week 4 reaching an overall value of 80%. No difference was observed
      between G1 and G2 regarding activity scores (Fisher's exact test, p &gt; 0.01). It can be
      concluded that after 4 applications the two varnish formulations tested produced similar
      clinical effects indicating the reduction and the control of carious activity in most WSL.
