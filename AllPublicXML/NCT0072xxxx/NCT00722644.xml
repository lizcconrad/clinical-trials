  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this 5-year study is to determine whether a Cognitive Behavioral
      Stress Management (CBSM) intervention, demonstrated to be effective in reducing distress,
      enhancing coping, and maintaining health among HIV+ non-drug abusers (see Schneiderman and
      Antoni, 2000), can be effectively adapted for our target population of culturally diverse,
      HIV+, low-income &quot;Recovering Drug Abusers&quot; (RDAs). Since the late 1980s, members of our
      research team (i.e., Schneiderman, Antoni, Klimas, Fletcher) have been developing, refining
      and evaluating the effects of CBSM among HIV+ Men who have Sex with Men (MSM). In the
      early/mid 90s, we began to adapt and evaluate the effects of CBSM in other non-drug abusing
      subgroups that were emerging with increasing levels of HIV seroprevalence (e.g., pregnant
      women, African American and Hispanic men and women). After accumulating considerable support
      for the effectiveness of CBSM in these subgroups in the late 90s, our research team (i.e.,
      Malow, Schneiderman, Antoni, Klimas, Page) turned its attention to developing the CBSM for
      one of the most neglected and understudied populations affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic in
      this country: &quot;inner city&quot; minority drug abusers. With supplemental funding on two NIH grants
      to conduct formative stage1 pilot research, our project team has been able to develop and
      document the feasibility and potential promise of the CBSM approach adapted/translated for
      RDAs (CBSM-RDA). This application proposes to take the next logical step in continuing this
      work: conducting a 3, 6, 8, 10, and 12 month follow-up outcome study comparing CBSM-RDA with
      a matched attention, time and interest value Health Promotion Comparison (HPC) condition, in
      225 male and 225 female HIV+ RDAs with respect to key biopsychosocial health endpoints:
      distress (i.e., depressive symptoms, and mood state), quality of life, drug abuse relapse,
      unsafe sex, Combination Antiretroviral Therapy (CART) medication adherence and health status
      indicators (e.g., Viral Load, CD4 count, physical symptoms).
