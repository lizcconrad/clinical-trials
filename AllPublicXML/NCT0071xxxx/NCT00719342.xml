  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been shown that diffuse luminance flicker increases retinal and optic nerve head blood
      flow. This indicates that a neuro-vascular coupling between neural activity and blood flow
      exists in the retina as described previously for the brain. Although a lot of mediators such
      as NO, pO2, pCO2, H+ and K+ have been proposed, the mechanism of this coupling is still a
      matter of controversy. However, it has been shown in an animal experiment, that an increase
      in blood flow, evoked by diffuse luminance flicker stimulation is paralleled by decrease in
      pO2 in the tissue. In a recently performed study we could show that breathing of 100% O2 did
      not influence flicker induced changes in the retina and optic nerve head. However, breathing
      of 100% oxygen also leads to a pronounced vasoconstriction of the retinal vessels and in turn
      to a increased tension of the vessel wall. Recent evidence indicates that a combination of
      92% O2 and 8% CO2 can, at least partially, counteract the vasoconstrictory effect of O2 and
      increases tissue pO2. Thus, in this study the investigators set out to investigate the
      flicker light induced increase in blood flow under a mixture of O2/CO2 .
