  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Renal artery stenosis (RAS) usually refers to a disease of the large extra-renal arterial
      vessels and most frequently is caused by atherosclerotic obstructions. The prevalence of
      atherosclerotic RAS increases with age, male gender, traditional cardiovascular risk factors
      (hypertension, diabetes, smoking, hyperlipidemia) and atherosclerotic comorbidities like
      coronary artery or peripheral artery disease (PAD). A prevalence up to 40% has been reported
      in patients with PAD. Undoubtedly, atherosclerotic RAS is a progressive disease, as more than
      half of the patients exhibit an increasing degree of stenosis within five years after
      diagnosis, and one out of five patients with a critical stenosis (&gt;60%) suffers renal atrophy
      and renal failure during this period. RAS may be treated conservatively by so called best
      medical treatment, surgically, or by endovascular interventions using balloon angioplasty and
      stenting.

      The purpose of the investigators study is to determine the incidence and the predictors of
      RAS in patients with PAD, and to compare the effect of renal artery stenting versus best
      medical treatment in patients with hypertension and ostial renal artery stenosis in a
      randomized controlled trial.
