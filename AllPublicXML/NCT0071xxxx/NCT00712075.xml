  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aging and psychosis are major priority areas for VA. This project is a continuation of a
      Merit Review Program, in which we developed, manualized and conducted randomized controlled
      trials of a novel psychosocial rehabilitation intervention for older people with
      schizophrenia, called cognitive-behavioral social skills training (CBSST). We found that
      CBSST improved community functioning in these patients. CBSST, however, is an intensive
      program that would burden VA mental health clinics with demands for additional staff and
      financial resources and burdens older veterans with travel and time demands. To reduce these
      burdens and barriers to implementation of CBSST, we are developing a computer-assisted CBSST
      intervention that takes advantage of available handheld computer technology. Therapist
      contact is cut 50% and replaced by handheld computer-assisted CBSST intervention tools. The
      project will examine whether computer-assisted CBSST is as effective as the full CBSST
      program, while improving client satisfaction and reducing burden and cost.

      Aging and psychosis are major priority areas for VA. This project is a continuation of a
      Merit Review Program, in which we developed, manualized and conducted randomized controlled
      trials of a novel psychosocial rehabilitation intervention for older people with
      schizophrenia, called cognitive-behavioral social skills training (CBSST). We found that
      CBSST improved community functioning in these patients. CBSST, however, is an intensive
      program that may burden VA mental health clinics with demands for additional staff and
      financial resources and Veterans with travel and time demands. To reduce these burdens and
      barriers to implementation of CBSST, we developed a computer-assisted CBSST intervention that
      takes advantage of available handheld computer technology (personal data assistants or PDAs).
      Therapist contact is cut 50% and replaced by handheld computer-assisted CBSST intervention
      tools. The project will examine whether computer-assisted CBSST is as effective as the full
      CBSST program, while improving client satisfaction and reducing burden and cost. A
      randomized-controlled clinical trial comparing 3 treatment conditions (computer-assisted
      CBSST, CBSST, and a PDA-only control condition) will be conducted. Participants will be
      recruited, treated for 6 months and followed longitudinally for 6 months after treatment. A
      multidimensional evaluation of treatment outcome, including functioning (primary outcome),
      CBSST skills acquisition, and symptoms will be conducted at baseline, mid-treatment, end of
      treatment (6-months after baseline), and 6-month follow-up (12 months after baseline).
      Factors that might mediate improvement in CBSST will be assessed, including homework
      adherence, cognitive insight (metacognition and belief flexibility), and defeatist
      performance beliefs (e.g., &quot;Why try, I'll just fail again&quot;).

      The proposed project will also use innovative computer-assisted Ecological Momentary
      Assessment (EMAc) methods to measure outcomes. EMAc is an ambulatory data collection
      technique that permits the real time, real world monitoring of behaviors, moods, and
      cognitions. Participants are signaled by handheld computers several times throughout the day
      to respond to questionnaires, which eliminates recall and information-processing biases that
      can compromise the validity of traditional self-report and interview measures. Outcomes in
      the proposed trial will be assessed using traditional measures, as well as EMAc measures.

      Specific Aims: (1) To determine whether computer-assisted CBSST is as effective as the full
      CBSST program (in prior project) and supportive contact, despite reduced burden and cost. (2)
      To examine whether EMAc measures of functioning and psychotic symptoms are sensitive to
      change in CBSST. (3) To examine whether increased cognitive insight, reduced defeatist
      performance beliefs, and greater homework adherence mediate outcomes in CBSST.

    <time_frame>Baseline, at mid-treatment (3-mo), at end-of-treatment (6-mos), and at 6-mo follow-up (12 mos post-baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>The ILSS is a self-report measure in an interview format to assess everyday functioning in ten domains: Appearance and Clothing, Personal Hygiene, Care of Personal Possessions, Food Preparation/Storage, Health Maintenance, Money Management, Transportation, Leisure, Job Seeking, and Job Maintenance. Scale ranges from 0 to 1. Subscales are averaged to yield composite score. Higher scores represent a higher level of functioning.</description>

    <description>The Comprehensive Module Test (CMT) is an assessment of CBSST skills acquisition in three domains: Communication Skills Test, Problem Solving Test, and Thought Challenging Test. The total CMT score ranges from 0-33. Higher total scores represent higher level of CBSST skills acquisition.</description>

    <description>The PANSS is 30 item semi-structured clinical interview designed to assess positive and negative symptoms. The PANSS consists of 7 items on the positive symptom subscale, 7 items on the negative symptom subscale, and 16 items on the general psychopathology subscale. Each item in the subscale is rated from 0 (absence of symptom) to 7 (extreme symptom severity). Scores of each subscale are summed to yield a total score range of 30 (Absence of symptoms) to 210, where higher scores represent more severe symptoms.</description>

        <title>Independent Living Skills Survey (ILSS)</title>
        <description>The ILSS is a self-report measure in an interview format to assess everyday functioning in ten domains: Appearance and Clothing, Personal Hygiene, Care of Personal Possessions, Food Preparation/Storage, Health Maintenance, Money Management, Transportation, Leisure, Job Seeking, and Job Maintenance. Scale ranges from 0 to 1. Subscales are averaged to yield composite score. Higher scores represent a higher level of functioning.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, at mid-treatment (3-mo), at end-of-treatment (6-mos), and at 6-mo follow-up (12 mos post-baseline)</time_frame>
        <population>Due to incomplete ILSS data for one participant in the CBSST group, 25 of 26 participants were included in the analyses for this measure.</population>

CBSST+PDA: PDA-Assisted Cognitive Behavioral Social Skills Training (CBSST+PDA) includes weekly group therapy sessions, each 90 minutes in length, with 6-8 patients (maximum of 10) were held for 24 weeks. The intervention integrated cognitive behavioral and social skills training interventions modified for use with older patients with psychosis. Participants utilized PDAs to assist with homework completion and compliance.</description>

          <title>CBSST+PDA</title>
          <description>PDA-Assisted Cognitive-Behavioral Social Skills Training (CBSST+PDA): The CBSST rehabilitation intervention will be combined with the use of a PDA to facilitate homework completion and progress towards recovery goal attainment in consumers.
CBSST+PDA: PDA-Assisted Cognitive Behavioral Social Skills Training (CBSST+PDA) includes weekly group therapy sessions, each 90 minutes in length, with 6-8 patients (maximum of 10) were held for 24 weeks. The intervention integrated cognitive behavioral and social skills training interventions modified for use with older patients with psychosis. Participants utilized PDAs to assist with homework completion and compliance.</description>

          <title>PDA-Only</title>
          <description>PDA-only: To control of device contact, the PDA-only arm will not receive CBSST and will only carry a PDA with access to the basic features of the device.
PDA-only: To control for the effects of having a PDA, a third group was provided PDAs for the same duration as the other two groups. Participants had access to the same basic functions (calendar, contact list, etc.) as the CBSST+PDA group, but did not have any homework or weekly group meetings.</description>
