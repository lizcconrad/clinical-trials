  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study includes an interview with men who have selected &quot;watchful waiting&quot; or &quot;active
      surveillance&quot; for their localized prostate cancer, in lieu of active treatment (such as
      surgery or radiation). We hope to understand the educational and support needs of men on
      surveillance so that we can develop a new intervention that will improve quality of life for
      such men.
