  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to find out why pterygium occurs and recurs in a rural African
      population. Participants will be interviewed on personal and lifestyle information, family
      history of pterygium, environmental exposure and history of previous eye inflammation. They
      will undergo eye examination and photography. Those with pterygium will be operated on to
      remove pterygium and followed up to detect any recurrence and complications of surgery. The
      excised pterygium will be examined pathologically and genetically; participant's blood will
      also be examined genetically. Data will be analyzed for statistically significant differences
      in findings between pterygium and pterygium free participants.

      The study hypothesis is that multiple factors are responsible for the occurrence and
      recurrence of pterygium in a rural african population.
