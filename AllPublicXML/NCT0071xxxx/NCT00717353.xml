      Germline polymorphisms are inherited genetic variation present in all cells of the body. At
      molecular level, such variations may affect gene transcription, translation, mRNA stability,
      protein activity, protein expression (1-3). Mounting evidences have emerged showing that
      genetic polymorphisms in drug metabolizing genes and DNA repaired genes are major
      determinants of response to drugs and carcinogens with possible predictive or prognostic
      value for clinical outcome (4-6). However, only a small number of all polymorphisms
      discovered have functional significance and it is often difficult to predict this base on
      nucleotide sequence alone. Genome based studies have generated a wealth of data on genetic
      polymorphisms far exceeds our knowledge on the function of these variants. Hence, there is an
      urgent need to characterize the functional and expressional impact of genetic polymorphisms
      in candidate genes so that appropriate target polymorphisms most likely to affect the
      phenotype can be selected for larger scale association studies. In this study, we will adopt
      a novel 2-stage approach to identify and characterize new polymorphisms in the UGT1A6 and 2B7
      genes in our Asian population. Data from our initial genotyping work will then be used to
      optimize the study design of the stage II association study for the generation of hypothesis
      that lung cancer histology (phenotype) is associated with UGT polymorphisms (genotype). This
      study will help to advance our understanding in the functional significance and diversity of
      genetic variants that exist in our population. It may also shed light on the role of UGT in
      carcinogenesis and will provide vital ground work for future studies of risk assessment,
      treatment and may allow identification of at risk individual for chemoprevention and adjuvant
      therapy studies.

        Our laboratory has conducted a pilot study to look at UGT1A expression in both normal and
        cancer tissue using RT PCR. We have found that in UGT1A6 is the predominant UGT1A enzymes
        expressed in normal lung and the expression of UGT1A6 enzymes is down regulated in lung
        cancer (unpublished data). The distribution of UGT1A enzymes in the lung suggests that
        UGT1A6 may be important in the glucuronidation of inhaled UGT substrates including
        chemicals from tobacco smoking.
