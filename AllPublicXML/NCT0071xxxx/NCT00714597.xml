      The primary objective was to compare the efficacy of once daily [q.d] subcutaneous [s.c.]
      injections of Semuloparin sodium (AVE5026) with q.d. s.c. injections of Enoxaparin for the
      primary prevention of Venous Thromboembolic Events [VTE] in patients hospitalized for acute
      medical illness.

      The secondary objectives were to evaluate the safety of AVE5026 and to document AVE5026
      exposure in this population.

    <textblock>
      Randomization had to take place just prior to the first study drug injection.

      The total duration of observation per participant was 35-42 days from randomization broken
      down as follows:

        -  10 to 14-day double-blind treatment period;

        -  25 to 32-day follow-up period.

      Mandatory bilateral compression ultrasound [CUS] had to be performed between 10 to 15 days
      after randomization.

    <description>VTE included:
asymptomatic proximal Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) detected by the mandatory CUS and confirmed by a Compression Ultrasound Adjudication Committee (CUSAC) after central and blind review of the mandatory CUS;
symptomatic DVT and non-fatal Pulmonary Embolism (PE) reported by the investigator and confirmed by a Central Independent Adjudication Committee (CIAC) after central and blind review of diagnosis tests.
VTE-related Death included fatal PE and unexplained deaths.</description>

    <time_frame>From 1st study drug injection up to 3 days after last study drug injection</time_frame>
    <description>Bleedings were centrally and blindly reviewed by the CIAC and classified as:
&quot;major&quot; (fatal, symptomatic in a critical area/organ, causing a post-operative drop in hemoglobin ≥2 g/dL or requiring post-operative transfusion ≥2 units of blood);
&quot;clinically relevant non-major&quot; (overt bleeding requiring medical intervention and not meeting criteria for major bleeding);
&quot;Non-clinically relevant bleeding&quot;.</description>

    <time_frame>From randomization up to 15 days after randomization or the day of mandatory CUS, whichever came first</time_frame>
    <description>Initiation of curative anticoagulant or thrombolytic treatment after VTE assessment was defined from investigator's answer to the question &quot;was the subject treated for VTE?&quot; asked after the diagnostic tests for suspected VTE and after the mandatory CUS.</description>
