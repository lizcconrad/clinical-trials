      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of an anti-asthma herbal medicine
      intervention (ASHMI) in adult asthmatics

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a major public health problem worldwide, particularly in westernized societies and
      has continued to increase in prevalence over the past two decades. Inhaled corticosteroids
      have become the first-line treatment for persistent asthma even though side effects have been
      reported. New asthma medications, including leukotriene inhibitors and anti-IgE, have shown
      limited benefits. Patients have increasingly turned to complementary and alternative medicine
      (CAM) for treatment of their asthma, despite the uncertainty of its benefits due a lack of
      well-controlled scientific studies.

      We have developed a Chinese herbal formula composed of 3 herbs called ASHMI. It has been
      previously shown in murine studies that ASHMI (a formula containing Ling Zhi, Ku Shen and Gan
      Cao) has therapeutic effects on the major pathogenic mechanisms of asthma-airway
      hyperreactivity, pulmonary inflammation, and airway remodeling, as well as a down-regulating
      of TH2 response. A subsequent study in 91 asthmatic patients in Weifang, China found ASHMI to
      be a safe and effective alternative to prednisone for treating asthma and exhibited a
      beneficial effect on TH1 and TH2 balance. Additionally, a Phase I study conducted in the
      United States showed good tolerability to ASHMI. Based on these preliminary studies, we
      hypothesize that ASHMI will be a safe medication in patients with asthma.
