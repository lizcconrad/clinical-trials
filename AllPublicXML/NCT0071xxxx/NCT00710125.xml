    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 safety and dose escalation study to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      and identify the dose limiting toxicities (DLT) following IV administration of GPX-150 once
      every 3 weeks. Escalating doses starting at the dose of 14 mg/m2 and increasing to the dose
      of 265 mg/m2 will be administered IV once every 3 weeks for up to 8 cycles of treatment.
      Patients who have previously received an anthracycline are limited to 4 cycles of treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is at least 18 years of age.

          -  Patient has a histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of solid tumor.

          -  Patient has progressive disease

          -  Patient is considered to have incurable disease and is not a candidate for known
             effective systemic treatment.

          -  Patient has a performance status of at least 70% on Karnofsky scale.

          -  Patient has not received any cytotoxic chemotherapy or other investigational agents
             within 4 weeks of the first treatment in this study (6 weeks for mitomycin or
             nitrosourea). Patients should receive supportive care as indicated. Patients currently
             receiving blood transfusions or erythropoiesis-stimulating agents should continue
             receiving them as per the ASCO guidelines. Patients requiring palliative radiation
             therapy should complete their course of radiation treatment 4 weeks before the first
             study treatment.

          -  Patient may have received unlimited prior hormonal therapy, but this must have been
             completed at least 4 weeks prior to the first study treatment, and progressive disease
             documented following withdrawal of hormone therapy. Patient with hormone-refractory
             prostate cancer on long acting LHRH agents may continue on these agents.

          -  Patient may have received unlimited prior biological or immunological therapy without
             limitation, but this must have been completed at least 4 weeks prior to the first
             study treatment.

          -  Patient has fully recovered from any previous surgery (at least 4 weeks since major
             surgery) and radiation therapy (at least 4 weeks since the end of treatment).

          -  Patient has recovered from reversible toxicity of prior therapy. Permanent and stable
             side effects or changes are acceptable if ≤ to Grade 2.

          -  Patient has adequate hematological function as defined by an ANC ≥ 1500, platelets ≥
             100,000/µL, and hemoglobin ≥9.0 gm/dL.

          -  Patient has adequate organ function defined as a bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times ULN, AST and
             ALT &lt; 2.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN, 5.0 times the ULN with liver
             involvement), serum creatinine &lt;2.0 dL or estimated creatinine clearance ≥ 50 ml/min.

          -  Patient has received an anthracycline within 6 months prior to entry into the study.

          -  Patient has brain metastases unless asymptomatic and stable off glucocorticoids.

          -  Prior history of CHF, myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to enrollment,

          -  Patient has received chemotherapy, hormonal therapy (with the exception of LHRH for
             prostate cancer), immunotherapy, biological therapy, or radiotherapy within 4 weeks
             prior to the first study treatment.

          -  Patient has had major surgery within 4 weeks of the first study treatment.

          -  Patient has received G-CSF or GM-CSF within 4 weeks prior to first dose of study drug.

          -  Patient has baseline laboratory values that are outside normal ranges or those listed
             (see Inclusion Criteria), which are clinically significant as determined by the
