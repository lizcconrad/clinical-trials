    <measure>Change From Baseline on Physical Component Score of the Medical Outcomes Study HIV Health Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 96</time_frame>
    <description>The Survey is a brief, comprehensive health status measure used in studies of people with HIV/AIDS. Participants rate their health and mental/emotional condition, how much their health limits physical activities (eating, dressing, bathing, climbing stairs, walking one block, etc.) and social activities (for example, visiting with friends or relatives), and other questions that measure quality of life. The physical component summarizes answers to questions about physical status. Possible scores range from 0 to 100. A higher score indicates better health, and increases indicate improvement.</description>

    <description>The Effectiveness Scale of the TSQM evaluates the participant's satisfaction or dissatisfaction (1=extremely dissatisfied to 7=extremely satisfied) with the ability of the medication to prevent or treat the condition, the way the medication relieves symptoms, the amount of time it takes for the medication to start working, and other questions. Scores are converted to a range of 0 to 100. A higher score indicates greater satisfaction.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Score on Side Effects Scale of Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 96</time_frame>
    <description>The Side Effects scale of the TSQM asks if the participant experiences side effects (yes/no), and if so, how bothersome the side effects are, to what extent they interfere with physical health and ability to function (for example, strength and energy levels), to what extent they interfere with mental function (for example, ability to think clearly, stay awake, etc.), and to what extent the side effects affect the participants overall satisfaction with the medication. Scores are converted to a range of 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate less interference and/or less dissatisfaction.</description>

          -  Participants must provide written, voluntary informed consent to participate in the
             study.

          -  Participants must be naive to antiretroviral treatment with HIV RNA greater than or
             equal to 1,000 copies/mL at screening, and in the investigator's opinion, require
             antiretroviral therapy.

          -  Participant's vital signs, physical examination, and laboratory results must not
             exhibit evidence of acute illness.

          -  Participant has not been treated for an active acquired immune deficiency syndrome
             (AIDS)-defining opportunistic infection within 45 days of initiating study drug.
             Participants who are on stable maintenance therapy for an opportunistic infection may
             be enrolled after consultation with the Sponsor.

          -  Participant does not require and agrees not to take any drugs that are contraindicated
             or have significant pharmacokinetic interactions with study drugs during the course of
             the study. Participant agrees not to take any medication during the study, including
             over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, minerals, herbal preparations, alcohol, or
             recreational drugs without the knowledge and permission of the principal investigator.

          -  Female participants must be either postmenopausal for at least one year, surgically
             sterile, or must use a non-hormonal method of birth control that is acceptable to both
             the participant and investigator. All female participants must have a urine pregnancy
             test performed at screening visit and on Day minus 1/baseline, and results of both
             tests must be negative. Female participants may not be breastfeeding.

          -  Participants have received no prior treatment with an HIV-1 integrase inhibitor.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must not have history of an allergic reaction or significant sensitivity
             to the study drugs.

          -  Participants may not have an ongoing history of substance abuse or psychiatric illness
             that could preclude protocol adherence.

          -  Participant cannot have resistance to lopinavir/ritonavir, tenofovir, or emtricitabine
             based on the HIV-1 drug resistance genotypic test results at the screening visit.

          -  Participant may not have significant medical history of concomitant illness or disease
             that would adversely affect his/her participating in the study.

          -  Participants may not have received any investigational drug or investigational vaccine
             within 30 days prior to study drug administration.

          -  Participants may not have any of the following abnormal screening results: Hemoglobin
             &lt;= 8.0 grams/deciliter, absolute neutrophil count &lt;= 750 cells/microliter, Platelet
             count &lt;= 50,000 per milliliter, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamic-pyruvic
             transaminase [SGPT]) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic
             transaminase [SGOT]) &gt;= 3.0 x upper limit of normal (ULN), calculated creatinine
             clearance &lt; 50 milliliter/minute, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is positive.

          -  The investigator considers the participant to be an unsuitable candidate for the

            <groups_desc>The null hypothesis was that the response rate for the LPV/r + RAL arm was more than 20% lower than the response rate for the LPV/r + FTC/TDF arm. The planned sample size of 100 participants per treatment group provided 90% power to conclude that the LPV/r + RAL arm was non-inferior to the control arm, based on a non-inferiority margin of –20% (with a type I error rate of 0.05).</groups_desc>

            <non_inferiority_desc>The exact 95% confidence interval for the difference in response rates (LPV/r + RAL minus LPV/r + FTC/TDF) was used to assess non-inferiority. The LPV/r+RAL arm was considered non-inferior to the LPV/r+FTC/TDF arm because the lower limit of the confidence interval was &gt;/= -20%. Because the LPV/r+RAL arm was considered non-inferior based on the 20% margin, the results were assessed on a more rigorous 12% margin (-12%), as prespecified.</non_inferiority_desc>

        <title>Change From Baseline on Physical Component Score of the Medical Outcomes Study HIV Health Survey</title>
        <description>The Survey is a brief, comprehensive health status measure used in studies of people with HIV/AIDS. Participants rate their health and mental/emotional condition, how much their health limits physical activities (eating, dressing, bathing, climbing stairs, walking one block, etc.) and social activities (for example, visiting with friends or relatives), and other questions that measure quality of life. The physical component summarizes answers to questions about physical status. Possible scores range from 0 to 100. A higher score indicates better health, and increases indicate improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline on Mental Component of Medical Outcomes Study HIV Health Survey</title>
        <description>The Survey is a brief, comprehensive health status measure used in studies of people with HIV/AIDS. Participants rate their health and mental/emotional condition, how much their health limits physical activities (eating, dressing, bathing, climbing stairs, walking one block, etc.) and social activities (visiting with friends or relatives, etc.), and other questions that measure quality of life. The mental component summarizes answers to questions about emotional and mental wellbeing. Possible scores range from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicates better health, and increases indicate improvement.</description>

        <description>The Side Effects scale of the TSQM asks if the participant experiences side effects (yes/no), and if so, how bothersome the side effects are, to what extent they interfere with physical health and ability to function (for example, strength and energy levels), to what extent they interfere with mental function (for example, ability to think clearly, stay awake, etc.), and to what extent the side effects affect the participants overall satisfaction with the medication. Scores are converted to a range of 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate less interference and/or less dissatisfaction.</description>
