      The purpose of this study is to see if a patient's ability (and/ or parent) to read, write,
      and do basic math problems affects blood sugar control in children with type 1 diabetes
      mellitus.

      &quot;Literacy&quot; is defined as an individual's ability to read, write, and speak English, and
      compute and solve problems at levels of proficiency necessary to function on the job and in
      society, to achieve one's goals, and develop one's knowledge and potential, according to the
      National Literacy Act of 1991. The National Work Group on Health and Literacy reported that
      between 40 and 44 million persons in the United States have rudimentary literacy skills, and
      are unable to understand written materials that require only basic reading proficiency.
      Illiteracy has become an increasingly important problem, especially as it relates to
      healthcare. Literacy skills are paramount to effective self-management of type 1 and type 2
      diabetes mellitus. And, &quot;Diabetes Self-Management Education&quot; is the cornerstone of care for
      all individuals with diabetes who want to achieve successful health-related outcomes. Self
      care of diabetes plays a major role in achieving DCCT recommended level of hemoglobin A1C.
      Deficient self-management will lead to uncontrolled diabetes, resulting in multisystem
      complications, increasing exponentially the burden on our healthcare system. Structured
      education of individuals tailored to combat poor literacy skills is imperative in helping
      these individuals achieve good glycemic control. Hence we would like to evaluate literacy in
      our clinic so appropriate educational material can be developed to help patient with T1DM who
      have low literacy.
