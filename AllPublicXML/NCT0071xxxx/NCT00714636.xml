  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of a CSF repository is to collect samples of spinal fluid from controls and
      patients with neurologic disorders including but not exclusively ALS, Dementia, CRPS,
      neuropathies, and other neuromuscular diseases. This CSF repository will allow the use of CSF
      in biochemical studies of various neurologic diseases. It would also provide a supply of the
      necessary normal and disease control patients. CSF would be obtained from patients who are
      undergoing spinal taps for other reasons including diagnosis, treatment, or participation in
      clinical trials. We are proposing to collect an additional &lt; 3 ml of CSF from a lumbar
      puncture that is already being performed for diagnostic or therapeutic reasons, in order to
      store it in our laboratory for use in future research studies. No lumbar punctures will be
      initiated specifically for this protocol.

      The only specific procedures unique to this protocol is the collection of an additional 3ml
      or less of cerebrospinal fluid from a lumbar puncture already being performed and the
      collection of clinical information from the patients medical records. Lumbar puncture may be
      either a research procedure or a standard of care procedure, depending upon the reason for
      initiating the puncture. We will aliquot the additional fluid into a separate storage
      container and it will be maintained in the laboratory of Dr. Heiman-Patterson at -70 degrees.
      Clinical information including age, medical and neurological history, laboratory data, and
      pathologic information where indicated will be abstracted from the patient chart. All
      specimens and corresponding clinical information will be labeled with an identification
      number and sorted by diagnosis. There will be no patient identifying information kept with
      the specimens. The CSF sample may be used for studies performed by researchers at Drexel
      University College of Medicine or shared with collaborators. The CSF sample provided will
      only be used for projects that have approval by the IRB, but subjects will not be notified
      each time it is used for a study. If CSF sample is still available, consent can be withdrawn
      at any time by writing a letter to Dr. Heiman-Patterson requesting the withdrawal of the
      sample.

      Researchers will request control and disease specific samples to use in various research
      studies. There are no DNA studies.
