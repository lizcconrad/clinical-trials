      RATIONALE: American ginseng may reduce fatigue in patients with cancer. It is not yet known
      whether American ginseng is more effective than a placebo in treating cancer-related fatigue.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying American ginseng to see how well it
      works in treating patients with fatigue caused by cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius) as therapy for
           cancer-related fatigue as measured by the general subscale of the Multidimensional
           Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form (MFSI-SF).

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate toxicities and tolerability of American ginseng when used for cancer-related
           fatigue.

        -  To examine stress as a mediating variable on the effects of American ginseng on
           cancer-related fatigue.

        -  To explore the impact of American ginseng on various dimensions of fatigue as measured
           by the other subscales of the MFSI-SF, functional interference as measured by the Brief
           Fatigue Inventory (BFI), stress as measured by the Perceived Stress Scale, and well
           being as measured by the Profile of Mood States (POMS), as well as the single measure of
           fatigue.

        -  To determine clinically significant changes in fatigue scores using the global
           impression of change.

        -  To evaluate whether there are differences in the efficacy of American ginseng for
           fatigue based on minority populations.

      Tertiary

        -  To describe cortisol and cytokine values in fatigued cancer survivors and to evaluate
           the relationship of cortisol and cytokines to fatigue severity as well as to patterns of
           alterations previously documented in fatigued breast cancer survivors.

        -  To evaluate whether Wisconsin Ginseng impacts the expression of cortisol and cytokine in
           fatigued cancer survivors.

        -  To evaluate the role of cortisol and cytokine changes as the mechanism by which
           Wisconsin Ginseng can ameliorate cancer related fatigue.

        -  To evaluate the relationships between cytokine and cortisol levels with secondary
           outcomes such as mood and stress.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to baseline fatigue
      score (4-7 vs 8-10), disease status of current cancer (initial diagnosis vs recurrent
      disease), current treatment (chemotherapy, radiation, endocrine therapy [i.e., tamoxifen or
      aromatase inhibitors], or other targeted therapy) ( yes vs no), duration of all prior cancer
      treatment in patient's lifetime (none vs ≤ 180 days vs &gt; 180 days), and current tumor type
      (hematologic vs solid tumor malignancy). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral American ginseng twice daily for 14 days. Treatment repeats
           every 2 weeks for 4 courses until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily for 14 days. Treatment repeats every 2
           weeks for 4 courses.

      Patients are instructed to complete the Ginseng Symptom Experience Diary and the Linear
      Analogue Scale weekly. Patients also complete the Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom
      Inventory-Short Form (MFSI-SF), the Profile of Mood States (POMS), and the Brief Fatigue
      Inventory (BFI) questionnaires at baseline and periodically during study therapy.

      Patients who are not actively receiving chemotherapy or radiation therapy undergo blood and
      saliva sample collection at baseline and periodically during study therapy for correlative
      studies.

    <time_frame>Baseline and week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form (MFSI-SF) general subscale is a six-item subscale to measure the subjective experience of fatigue. The items include feeling &quot;pooped, worn out, fatigued, sluggish, run down and tired&quot;. Answers are on a 5-point scale, ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). The subscale scores were the sum of all six items. The scores were converted to a 100-point scale, with higher numbers indicating less fatigue. Change from baseline to week 4 was calculated by subtracting the baseline scores from the scores at week 4.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 4 in the General Subscale of the MFSI-SF</title>
        <description>Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form (MFSI-SF) general subscale is a six-item subscale to measure the subjective experience of fatigue. The items include feeling &quot;pooped, worn out, fatigued, sluggish, run down and tired&quot;. Answers are on a 5-point scale, ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). The subscale scores were the sum of all six items. The scores were converted to a 100-point scale, with higher numbers indicating less fatigue. Change from baseline to week 4 was calculated by subtracting the baseline scores from the scores at week 4.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline to Week 4 in the General Subscale of the MFSI-SF</title>
          <description>Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form (MFSI-SF) general subscale is a six-item subscale to measure the subjective experience of fatigue. The items include feeling &quot;pooped, worn out, fatigued, sluggish, run down and tired&quot;. Answers are on a 5-point scale, ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). The subscale scores were the sum of all six items. The scores were converted to a 100-point scale, with higher numbers indicating less fatigue. Change from baseline to week 4 was calculated by subtracting the baseline scores from the scores at week 4.</description>

        <description>Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) consist of 3 items that assess the severity of fatigue and 6 items that assess the impact of fatigue on daily functioning in a 10-points scale with 0 as no fatigue or does not interfere with daily functioning and 10 as bad fatigue or completely interferes. The scores for the six items were summed up to form a total interference score. The linear analogue scale of fatigue was a 10-points scale with 0 as no fatigue and 10 as bad fatigue. All scores were then transformed into 0 to 100 scale, with 100 as less fatigue/less interference. Change from baseline to week 4 was calculated by subtracting the baseline scores from the scores at week 4.</description>

          <description>Profile of Mood States (POMS) measures a variety of mood states including tension/anxiety, depression/dejection, anger/hostility, vigor/activity, fatigue/inertia and confusion/bewilderment. Each subscale consist of 5 items with a 5 points-scale (0=not at all, 1=a little, 2=moderately, 3=quite a bit and 4=extremely). The subscale scores were the sum of all five items. The scores were then transformed into a 100-point scale with higher numbers indicating less fatigue. Change from baseline to week 4 was calculated by subtracting the baseline scores from the scores at week 4.</description>

        <description>Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) consist of 3 items that assess the severity of fatigue and 6 items that assess the impact of fatigue on daily functioning in a 10-points scale with 0 as no fatigue or does not interfere with daily functioning and 10 as bad fatigue or completely interferes. The scores for the six items were summed up to form a total interference score. The linear analogue scale of fatigue was a 10-points scale with 0 as no fatigue and 10 as bad fatigue. All scores were then transformed into 0 to 100 scale, with 100 as less fatigue/less interference. Change from baseline to week 8 was calculated by subtracting the baseline scores from the scores at week 8.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 4 in the General Subscale of the MFSI-SF for Minority Populations</title>
        <description>Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form (MFSI-SF) general subscale is a six-item subscale to measure the subjective experience of fatigue. The items include feeling &quot;pooped, worn out, fatigued, sluggish, run down and tired&quot;. Answers are on a 5-point scale, ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). The subscale scores were the sum of all six items. The scores were converted to a 100-point scale, with higher numbers indicating less fatigue. Change from baseline to week 4 was calculated by subtracting the baseline scores from the scores at week 4.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline to Week 4 in the General Subscale of the MFSI-SF for Minority Populations</title>
          <description>Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form (MFSI-SF) general subscale is a six-item subscale to measure the subjective experience of fatigue. The items include feeling &quot;pooped, worn out, fatigued, sluggish, run down and tired&quot;. Answers are on a 5-point scale, ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). The subscale scores were the sum of all six items. The scores were converted to a 100-point scale, with higher numbers indicating less fatigue. Change from baseline to week 4 was calculated by subtracting the baseline scores from the scores at week 4.</description>
          <population>The analysis was not able to be done due to the low numbers of minorities accrued.</population>
