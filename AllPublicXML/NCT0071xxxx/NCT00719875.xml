  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety profile, tolerability, pharmacokinetics
      (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), of oral vorinostat in combination with oral capecitabine given
      on days 1-7 and 15-21 of a 28 day cycle in patients with advanced breast cancer, using RECIST
      criteria.

      This study was originally intended to be a phase 1/phase 2. The protocol was amended to make
      this study a phase 1 only.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed advanced breast cancer

          -  For the dose escalation phase: Patients must be refractory to standard therapy or for
             which no curative standard therapy exists, to be considered.

          -  For the phase II: Patients with histologically confirmed metastatic breast cancer who
             have had no more than 2 prior chemotherapy regimens for treatment of their metastatic
             breast cancer.

          -  Metastatic disease should not be progressing so as to require palliative treatment
             within 4 weeks of enrollment based on clinical assessment by the investigator.

          -  Development of new lesions or an increase in preexisting lesions on bone scintigraphy,
             CT, MRI or by physical examination. Patients in whom the sole criterion for
             progression is an increase in a biochemical marker, e.g., carcinoembryonic antigen
             (CEA), or an increase in symptoms, are not eligible.

          -  No radiotherapy, treatment with cytotoxic agents, or treatment with biologic agents
             within the 4 weeks prior to beginning treatment on this study (6 weeks for mitomycin
             or nitrosoureas). At least 2 weeks must have elapsed from any prior surgery or
             hormonal therapy. Patients must have fully recovered from the acute toxicities of any
             prior treatment with cytotoxic drugs, radiotherapy or other anti-cancer modalities
             (returned to baseline status as noted before most recent treatment). Patients with
             persisting, stable chronic toxicities from prior treatment ≤ grade 1 are eligible.

          -  Age ≥18 years.

          -  ECOG performance status ≤2 (Karnofsky ≥60%, see Appendix A).

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 3 months

          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  leukocytes ≥3,000/mcL

               -  absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL

               -  platelets ≥100,000/mcL

               -  total bilirubin within normal institutional limits

               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal

               -  creatinine within normal institutional limits OR

               -  creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m² for patients with creatinine levels above
                  institutional normal.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for
             the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
             immediately.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to vorinostat or capecitabine.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Women that are pregnant or breast-feeding are excluded from this study.

          -  HIV-positive patients are ineligible because these patients are at increased risk of
             lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy and the potential
             pharmacokinetic interaction between antiretroviral therapy and the investigational
             agents.

          -  Patient had prior treatment with an HDAC inhibitor. Patients who have received
             compounds with HDAC inhibitor-like activity, such as valproic acid, as anti-tumor
             therapy should not enroll in this study. Patients who have received such compounds for
             other indications, e.g. valproic acid for epilepsy, may enroll after a 30-day washout
             period.
