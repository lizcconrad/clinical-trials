      The research study examines the feasibility, implementation, and efficacy of the interactive
      expert system intervention for smoking cessation in the Chinese American population. The
      primary specific aim of the proposed research is to test the following hypotheses: 1)
      Proactive recruitment approach will be more effective in recruiting smokers who are in
      precontemplation (no intent to quit smoking in the next 6 months) than a reactive approach.
      2) Participants in the experimental condition receiving the interactive stage-matched expert
      system intervention plus a manual will be more likely to be abstinent at 12 and 18 than those
      in the control condition receiving a non-interactive standard manual. 3) Participants
      receiving the interactive expert system intervention will be more likely to report at least
      one quit attempt than those in the control condition at months 6, 12, and 18. 4) Participants
      receiving the interactive expert system intervention will be more likely to have a
      significant decrease in number of cigarettes smoked than those in the control condition at
      months 3, 6, 12, and 18. After the intervention adaptation and the pilot testing phase of
      study procedures, the study will achieve the above aims using a randomized trial targeting
      400 Chinese American Smokers with follow-up assessments at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months after
      baseline.
