  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to avoid to use a traumatic and iatrogenic examen (phlebography), the purpose of the
      study is to validate echography doppler in the diagnosis of asymptomatic related catheter
      related thrombosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phlebography is the gold standard for the diagnosis of asymptomatic catheter related
      thrombosis but can not be performed in about 15% of patients because of arm swelling and lack
      of superficial veins.

      Echography doppler is an easy, cheap and atraumatic way to make the diagnosis of deep vein
      thrombosis. The value of echography doppler has been proven for the diagnosis of symptomatic
      deep venous thrombosis of lower and upper limbs and for the diagnosis of proximal
      asymptomatic lower limbs.

      To validate the echography doppler we intend to correlate asymptomatic findings to the
      occurrence symptomatic related catheter related thrombosis.

      Patients with localized breast cancer treated with chemotherapy will be enrolled in the
      study. An echography doppler will be performed on day 8, 30 and 90 after catheter insertion.
      Findings in asymptomatic patients (thrombus visualisation, lack of vein compressibility,
      variation of physiologic vein blood flow) will thereafter be correlated with the presence or
      absence of clinical signs of catheter related thrombosis.

      In order to assess if they are risk factors for catheter related thrombosis, we will
      determine the level D-Dimer, microparticles and the results of generation thrombin tests
      before and 2 days after catheter insertion.
