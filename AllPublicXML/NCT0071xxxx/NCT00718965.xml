  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is aiming at assessing the efficacy and safety of AVE5530 (25mg and 50mg)
      in a double-blind comparison with placebo in the management of patients with primary
      hypercholesterolemia. The main objective is to evaluate the effects of AVE5530 on LDL-C level
      reduction as adjunct to a controlled diet. The effects of AVE5530 on other lipid parameters
      will be assessed as secondary objectives.

      The study will include a 2-week pre-randomization placebo lead-in phase and a double-blind
      treatment period of at least 12 months and can be variably extended up to approximately 18
      months.
