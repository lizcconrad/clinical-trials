  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using phase contrast MR Angiography with NOVA® Software, this study intends to
      identify,evaluate and map intracranial aneurysm development as well as develope a predicator
      for future morphological changes of aneurysms and possible risk of future rupture.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hemodynamic stress toward the wall of intracranial artery with associated genuine defects of
      wall remodeling capacity is one of many hypotheses of subarachnoid aneurysm development. In
      addition, hemodynamic stress toward an aneurysm wall may play a very significant role for the
      rupture of an aneurysm creating acute Subarachnoid hemorrhage. We think the Wall Shear Stress
      (WSS) measurement toward an intracranial arterial wall and intracranial aneurysmal wall may
      provide valuable information for understanding of intracranial aneurysm development as well
      as predicting future morphological changes of aneurysm and possibly risk of future rupture.
      This study is significant especially in the management of unruptured subarachnoid arterial
      aneurysm patients and identifying patients who have higher rupture risks for active
      treatments such as surgical clipping or coiling to prevent unnecessary but potentially risky
      procedures.

      Gadolinium MR Angiography with NOVA® Software will be used to measure the arterial wall shear
      stress (WSS) for patients with an intracranial arterial aneurysm. The aneurysm will be
      identified, blood flow, velocity, volume, vascular diameter and the direction of blood
      measurements will be taken using NOVA® Software at each point of interest. A WSS map of
      target intracranial artery and/or aneurysm sac will be created and matched with morphological
      features providing a clue to understand the the relationships between hemodynamic parameters,
      especially WSS and morphological changes.
