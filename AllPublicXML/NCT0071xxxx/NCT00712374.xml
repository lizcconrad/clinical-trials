  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In areas of seasonal malaria transmission the burden of severe disease and mortality due to
      malaria is mainly among children under 5 years of age. Intermittent preventive treatment
      (IPT) with antimalarial drugs given to all children once a month during the transmission
      season is a promising new strategy for malaria prevention. Studies in Senegal, Ghana, Mali
      and The Gambia have shown this approach can be highly effective. In Senegal, seasonal IPT
      with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) and one dose of artesunate resulted in a 90% reduction in
      incidence of clinical malaria in a recent trial in Senegal (Cisse et al., Lancet 2006). The
      purpose of the present project is to determine the public health impact and cost
      effectiveness of this intervention when it is delivered through the routine health service to
      communities in rural areas in Senegal. Demographic surveillance will be set up in the rural
      population of three districts (Mbour, Bambey and Fatick) which comprises approximately
      540,000 people, including 100,000 children under 5 yrs, and is served by 54 health posts, as
      an expansion of the area covered by the existing DSS of Niakhar. Information about births,
      deaths and migrations, household characteristics such as socioeconomic status, and
      vaccination status of children and their use of bednets, will be recorded in 6-monthly rounds
      of all households. In selected areas, deaths among children under 10 years will be
      investigated using verbal autopsies. Over four years from September 2008 - November 2011,
      seasonal IPT (three monthly administrations of SP (sulfalene-pyrimethamine) plus amodiaquine
      during the transmission season each year to children 3-59 months of age) will be introduced
      gradually, in a step-wedge design, by 9 health posts in 2008, by an additional 18 posts in
      2009, and another 18 in 2010 and 9 in 2011. At the end of each transmission season, a
      cross-sectional survey of 2400 children under 5 yrs of age, in which finger prick blood
      samples will be taken, will be used to estimate the prevalence of molecular markers of drug
      resistance to Plasmodium falciparum, the prevalence of anaemia and the nutritional status of
      children. Malaria incidence will be monitored by passive surveillance through health posts,
      health centres, and hospitals. Cost effectiveness will be assessed. Due to changes in the
      epidemiology of malaria in the study area, the upper age limit for inclusion was increased
      from 5 to 10 years old from September 2009.
