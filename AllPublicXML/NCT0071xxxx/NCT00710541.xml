  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-invasive ventilation is frequently applied in patients with acute exacerbation of COPD,
      but no evidence exists about the effect of long term application/home application.

      This study tests the hypothesis, that a daily, 6 hour application of non-invasive ventilation
      over one year improves survival, exercise capacity, and quality of life in patients with
      advanced stages of COPD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The key problem of COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) is chronic inflammation and
      obstruction of the small airways. This results in a largely elevated flow resistance and work
      of breathing. The lungs develop enlarged air spaces (emphysema) with a reduction of alveoli
      and respiratory surface. Consequences are flattening of the diaphragm and alterations in the
      thoracic skeleton. COPD patients in advanced stages develop insufficiency of the muscular
      ventilatory pump. The ventilatory pump may decompensate, if the load of the muscles overruns
      their capacities. Besides that, an unphysiologically high proportion of the cardiac pump
      volume must be spent for the demands of the ventilatory muscles. Hypercapnia, and later
      hypoxaemia, are indicators of a decompensated ventilatory pump.

      Theoretically, non-invasive ventilation (NIV) could be a treatment option for patients with
      advanced COPD and insufficiency of their ventilatory pump. Mechanical non-invasive
      ventilation provides support for the ventilatory muscles and might counterbalance the
      elevated intrinsic PEEP.

      The physiologic and quality of life aspects of long term application on non-invasive
      ventilation (over at least one year) will be assessed in this study.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Moderate or severe COPD with insufficiency of the ventilatory pump (according to GOLD
             stage IV). Stable disease since four weeks or more prior to randomisation. The COPD
             might be caused by whatever reason (smoking, Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, ....).
             Smokers can be included.

          -  Capillary PCO2 of 7 kPa (51,8 mmHg) or maximally 10 kPa (74 mmHg), combined with a pH
             of 7.35 or above. These gases must be measured after 30 minutes breathing room air in
             sitting position. Patients on long term oxygen treatment must inhale oxygen in their
             prescribed dose.

          -  Only patients in the age of 18 years or above can be included.

          -  Written information about all aspects of the study (available in German language) must
             be provided for each patient. Written informed consent prior to any measure of this
             protocol is necessary for inclusion.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a PCO2 of 10 kPa (74 mmHg) or above. These patients can be re-evaluated
             for inclusion after 4 weeks.

          -  Diseases of the lung or thorax besides COPD: Advanced pulmonary fibrosis, advanced
             bronchiectases, active tuberculosis, post tuberculosis syndrome, pneumonia, severe
             kyphoscoliosis, tracheostoma, neuromuscular diseases, or any other disorder, which
             might result in elevated PCO2.

          -  Patients on NIV.

          -  Body mass index of 35 kg/m² or above.

          -  Severe cardiac disease, NYHA IV, instable angina, severe cardiac arrhythmia,
             especially of ventricular origin (atrial fibrillation is not an exclusion criterion).

          -  Malignoma

          -  Disorders of the basal brain nerves with derangement of swallowing, or reflexes of
             swallowing and choking.

          -  Local derangement of the face, skin, tongue, upper airways, larynx and upper
             oesophagus.

          -  Severe chronic diseases except COPD, hindering the patient to follow the schedule of
             this study.
