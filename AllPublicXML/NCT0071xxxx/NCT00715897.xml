      Objective: Evaluate the effect of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) on patients with chronic
      neurological deficiency due to stroke.

      Methods: A prospective, randomized, control-crossed over trial including patients who had
      stroke 6-36 months prior to their inclusion. All patients had at least one motor dysfunction.
      After their inclusion patients were randomized to treated or cross group. The neurologic
      functions were evaluated by NIHSS, ADL, life quality and brain SPECT. Patients in the treated
      group were evaluated twice-at baseline and after HBOT. Patients in the cross group were
      evaluated three times-baseline, after 2 months control period of no treatment and after a
      consequent 2 month of HBOT. The following HBOT protocol was practice: 40 daily sessions, 90
      minutes each, 100% oxygen at 2ATA, 5 days/week,.

      Results: The study included 74 patients (8 were excluded). During the control period, in the
      cross group, NIHSS and the ADL had not changed, while in the treated group both significantly
      improved. After the cross-over, when the cross group received HBOT, NIHSS and ADL had
      significantly improved. Same trend of changes were in life quality. The SPECT correlated with
      the clinical improvement. The improvements were mostly in territories where there was a
      noticeable discrepancy between the CT and SPECT.

      Interpretation: In this study, for the first time, it was demonstrated that HBOT can induce
      neuroplasticity in patients with chronic neurologic deficiencies due to stroke. The
      beneficial effect of the HBOT is mostly in territories where there is a brain SPECT/CT
      mismatch.
