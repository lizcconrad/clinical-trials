  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to document prospectively the incidence of allergies of eczema, asthma and
      allergic rhinitis in 2 diverse cohorts (Singaporean and Indonesian) with contrasting
      lifestyles and socioeconomic development. The profile of microbial colonization in terms of
      species variety, as well as their genetic diversity will be studied in Singapore and
      Indonesia cohorts and to correlate these with clinical allergy.

      The main objective of the current study is to establish the relationship of gut microbiota
      and development of allergy in 2 populations with different socioeconomic status and
      prevalence of allergy (high in Singapore and low in Indonesia). A cohort of children will be
      followed prospectively from birth up to 2 years. Stool from different time points,
      environmental exposure data and clinical manifestations of allergy will be analyzed and
      recorded. Singapore and Indonesia will provide the South East Asian context in resolving
      early life influences associated with divergent allergy prevalence. By studying subjects
      below age two, this will provide valuable knowledge regarding the epidemiology of allergy and
      atopy in the first years of life, which is poorly documented in this age group. More
      importantly, the prospective nature and varied parameters included in this study (colony
      counts, species variety and genetic diversity of microbiota) will add to the global data and
      scientific evidence for the role of these factors in allergy development.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pre-delivery evaluation

               -  Either parent or sibling (ie first degree relative) has a history of atopy. This
                  will be evidenced by a doctor-diagnosis of asthma, allergic rhinitis or eczema
                  AND a positive skin prick test/specific IgE test to any of a panel of common
                  allergens.

               -  Parents agree to the child's participation in the study and sign the Informed
                  Consent.

               -  The subject and the parents are willing to comply with procedures and both child
                  and parents are able to keep to scheduled clinic visits.

               -  Both parents are at contactable range (with valid mobile or land line numbers)
                  for study team to arrange and schedule clinic visits and complete telephone
                  interviews.

        Post-delivery evaluation

          -  The subject is born full term (at least 37 weeks gestation).

          -  The subject does not have major congenital malformations/major illness as judged by
             the doctor.

          -  The subject is in otherwise good, stable health on the basis of medical history,
             physical examination.

          -  Family appears to be able to successfully complete this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The parent is, in the opinion of the investigator, mentally or legally incapacitated,
             preventing informed consent from being obtained.

          -  The parent is unable/ unwilling to comply with procedures.
