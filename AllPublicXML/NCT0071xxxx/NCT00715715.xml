  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic hepatitis B constantly produce the virus in the body. The disease of
      chronic hepatitis B is the body responding to the virus. Use of steroids can adjust this
      response. After taking steroids, viral production usually increases and liver function tests
      increase. After stopping steroids, viral production usually decreases. Many studies in the
      past have studied taking a low dose steroid before treating hepatitis B. Those studies have
      shown that low dose steroids help your body to clear the virus. The goal of this study is to
      improve the liver function by slowing viral growth.

      Asian patients who are older than 16 years of age and have HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B
      and good liver function will be entered in this study. Qualified patients also have positive
      hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) for at least 24 weeks before screening, evidence of
      chronic hepatitis on a baseline liver-biopsy sample obtained within 52 weeks before entry,
      evidence of HBV DNA by any commercial tests at least 4 weeks before screening, an high HBV
      DNA level (at least 20,000 IU/mL) at screening, and a high serum ALT level (1.0 to 5.0 times
      the upper limit of normal) at screening.

      This study involves experimental use of an approved drug (Prednisolone) on chronic hepatitis
      B patients. Patients will be involved in the study for up to 96 weeks from enrollment. There
      is no external sponsor, commercial sponsor nor federal agency on this study. The study will
      be conducted only at Maimonides Medical Center, its GI clinic and faculty practice. About 40
      subjects will be involved in the study overall. All the subjects will be filled up locally.

    <description>Patients that meet the requirements listed above will be selected sequentially. Blood tests, including liver function tests and hepatitis profiles will be taken. A liver biopsy will be done before the treatment to evaluate the severity of hepatitis.
For randomly selected patients not treated with steroids: The patients will receive 6 weeks of sugar pills (placebo) before taking Adefovir dipivoxil (Hepsera) 10 mg daily for a minimum of 52 weeks.
All patients will get another liver biopsy at week 48 to evaluate the improvement of liver inflammation after their treatment. Blood tests will be drawn in accordance with the standard treatment. Generally speaking, hospitalization is not required for this study.</description>
