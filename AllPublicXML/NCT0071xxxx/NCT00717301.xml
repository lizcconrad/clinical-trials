  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine if a specific blood protein, S-100B, can help
      predict who will have a traumatic abnormality on head CT scan after a concussion. We will
      compare the levels of this protein in the subject's blood to the initial head CT scan and to
      how the subject is feeling one month after injury. We hope that the information we collect in
      this trial will help us determine who needs a head CT scan after a concussion and who may be
      more likely to have trouble recovering from a concussion.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the ability of a serum S-100B to predict
      traumatic abnormalities on brain CT scan after mild traumatic brain injury (mild TBI). The
      secondary objective is to determine the relationship between initial S-100B levels and
      cognitive outcome at one month.
