    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire is a 33-item self-report measure designed to assess the type of eating behavior and is organized into 3 subscales (emotional eating, externally-induced eating, and restrained eating). Subjects rated the frequency of their eating behaviors using a 5-point scale, where 1=never, 2=seldom, 3=sometimes, 4=often, and 5=very often. The Restrained Eating subscale consisted of 10 items and the scores ranged from 10 (worse outcome) to 50 (better outcome).</description>

             healthy volunteers.

          -  Normal urinalysis on initial screening day defined as: negative glucose, negative or
             trace protein, and negative or trace hemoglobin

             pregnancy test, and agree to use effective contraception methods throughout study
             period and for 30 days after discontinuation of study drug. The following are
             considered effective methods of contraception: Combination or progestin-only birth
             control pills (oral contraceptives), vaginal contraceptive rings, contraceptive
             patches, Depo Provera, intrauterine devices, barrier methods with spermicide
             (condom/foam, diaphragm/ spermicide), abstinence. (Subjects who have had a tubal

        <title>Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire - Change in Restrained Eating Subscale Score</title>
        <description>The Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire is a 33-item self-report measure designed to assess the type of eating behavior and is organized into 3 subscales (emotional eating, externally-induced eating, and restrained eating). Subjects rated the frequency of their eating behaviors using a 5-point scale, where 1=never, 2=seldom, 3=sometimes, 4=often, and 5=very often. The Restrained Eating subscale consisted of 10 items and the scores ranged from 10 (worse outcome) to 50 (better outcome).</description>

        <title>Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire - Change in Emotional Eating A Subscale Score</title>
        <description>The Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire is a 33-item self-report measure designed to assess the type of eating behavior and is organized into 3 subscales (emotional eating, externally-induced eating, and restrained eating). Subjects rated the frequency of their eating behaviors using a 5-point scale, where 1=never, 2=seldom, 3=sometimes, 4=often, and 5=very often. The Emotional Eating A subscale (clearly labeled emotions) consisted of 9 items and the scores ranged from 9 (better outcome) to 45 (worse outcome).</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks</time_frame>
        <population>ITT (Intent-to-Treat): Included all subjects who were randomized, had a baseline measurement, and had at least one post-baseline fMRI measurement during the defined treatment phase.</population>
