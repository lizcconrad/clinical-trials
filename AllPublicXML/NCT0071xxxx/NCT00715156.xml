      This study is aimed at verifying the role and the efficacy of the recombinants allergens Pru
      p 1, Pru p 3 and Pru p 4, Bet v 1, Bet v 2 and Bet v 4 in the diagnosis of peach allergy

    <textblock>
      This study intend to verify whether the different levels of severity of the clinical allergic
      reactions to peach are associated to sensitization towards different allergenic molecules of
      peach. In particular, we will analyze the reactivity towards the peach allergens Pru p 1, Pru
      p 3 and Pru p 4 and towards the birch pollen allergens Bet v 1, Bet v 2 and Bet v 4. The
      patients (with allergic symptoms of any severity provoked by the consumption of peach) will
      be divided into two groups: the first group showing oral allergy syndrome (OAS), the second
      group showing systemic symptoms of different severity, up to anaphylaxis.

      All the patients will be submitted to: complete clinical investigation; skin prick test with
      a panel of common food/inhalant commercial extracts; skin tests by the &quot;prick + prick&quot; method
      with fresh fruits and vegetables; skin prick test with purified peach LTP (Pru p 3) The sera
      of the patients will be used for: immunoblotting with peach extract and immunoblotting
      inhibition with purified natural Pru p 3 and, if possible, recombinant Pru p 3, Pru p 1 and
      Pru p 4, using a pool of selected sera; CAP system with a predetermined panel of fruit and
      vegetable allergens; CAP system with recombinant allergens of peach and birch pollen: Pru p
      3, Pru p 1 and Pru p 4 for peach, Bet v 1, Bet v 2 and Bet v 4 for birch pollen. Finally, a
      statistical analysis will be carried out in order to verify if the two groups of patients
      will show significant differences in the allergens recognized. The results of this study will
      be a property of the Unit of Allergology and Immunology as stated by DM 17/2004 and will be
      presented as written publication or oral presentation at National and/or International
      Congresses of Allergy and Immunology, quoting the PHADIA company
