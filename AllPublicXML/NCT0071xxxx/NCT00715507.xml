    <textblock>
      To assess the clinical utility of the graphical medication monitor, results of the
      anesthetics for which the display was present will be compared to the results of the
      anesthetics in which there was no display.

      This study has two objectives: First, before the medication monitor is shown to
      anesthesiologists in a clinical setting, the PKPD models must be validated to assess the
      clinical reliability of the model-based predictions for patients undergoing general
      anesthesia. Second, once the PKPD models have been successfully validated, presenting it to
      anesthesiologists during administration of anesthesia will assess the impact of the graphical
      medication monitor. Differences in performance and patient care will be determined by
      comparing anesthesiologists who are presented with the monitor to those who care for patients
      without the monitor.
