  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will use both qualitative and quantitative research methods (mixed
      methods) to gather data that will support the eventual development of interventions for young
      men who have sex with men (YMSM) living with behaviorally acquired HIV infection. The overall
      goal of the study is to gain an understanding of the psychosocial/developmental needs of YMSM
      by focusing on two critical developmental issuesâ€”identity development and future life goals.
