      Background:

      A concentrate for bicarbonate haemodialysis acidified with citrate instead of acetate has
      been marketed in the recent years. The small amount of citrate used (one-fifth of the
      concentration adopted in regional anticoagulation) protects against intradialyser clotting,
      minimally affecting the calcium concentration. The aim of this study is to compare the impact
      of a citrate- and acetate-based dialysate on systemic haemodynamics, coagulation, acid-base
      status, calcium balance and dialysis efficiency.

      Methods:

      In 25 patients, 375 dialysis sessions, we will compare acetate (A) with citrate dialysate
      with (C+) or without (C) calcium supplementation (0.25mmol/L) in a randomized single blind
      cross-over study. Systemic haemodynamics will be evaluated using pulse wave analysis systems.
      Coagulation, acid-base status, calcium balance and dialysis efficiency will be assessed using
      standard biochemical markers.

      Introduction:

      A concentrate for bicarbonate haemodialysis acidified with citric instead of the less
      physiologic acetic acid has been successfully implemented in the United States in the past 7
      years [1-3]. Contrarily to traditional regional citrate anticoagulation, the small amount of
      citrate used in the acid concentrate (0.8 mmol/L only; about one-fifth of the concentration
      necessary to achieve anticoagulation [1,4,5]) affects the calcium concentration and the
      locally enhanced coagulation activation in a limited way, resulting in approximately 10%
      reduction in post-dialysis ionized calcium and in no measurable systemic anticoagulation [1].
      The absence of significant systemic repercussions is related to both, the low amount of
      citrate used but also the rapid conversion of citrate into bicarbonate taking place in the
      liver and muscles and determining a higher post-dialysis bicarbonataemia [1,6,7]. Despite the
      rapid citrate clearance, the local consequences of removing calcium from the blood clotting
      cascade has measurable positive effects on the dialyser life-span in the &quot;reuse&quot; modality and
      on the dialysis quality quantified by urea Kt/V [1,3]. The improvement in urea clearance was
      correlated to a postulated favourable effect on dialyser fibre permeability mediated by the
      intra-dialyser anticoagulants properties of citrate [1,3,8]. Considering the importance of
      limiting the biocompatibility related coagulation activation taking place in the
      extracorporeal circuit [9-17], disposing of a simple way to inhibit it without affecting the
      systemic coagulation and the bleeding risk [18] is very promising.

      Even if thousands of patients have been treated in the recent years with haemodialysis fluids
      based on citric instead of acetic acid, the haemodynamic tolerance (the reduction in ionized
      calcium concentration and the increase in bicarbonateamia could both result in a lower
      intra-dialytic blood pressure [19-25]) and the amount of systemic coagulation activation
      related to each one of the modalities, were not investigated.

      The aim of this randomized, controlled, single blind, cross-over study in single-use dialyser
      bicarbonate haemodialysis, is to detail the consequences on systemic haemodynamics,
      coagulation activation, acid-base status, calcium balance and dialysis efficiency of using
      citric instead of acetic acid in the haemodialysis fluids.

      Methods and patients:

      Twenty-five chronic haemodialysis patients (15 male and 10 female), dialysed 3 to 4 hours
      three times a week, clinically stable and without intercurrent illnesses, will be enrolled in
      the study. Using a single blind, cross-over design, the patients will be randomized in the
      two arms of the study beginning by either the traditional acetic acid (modality A) or the
      citric acid dialysate (modality C). In the following 3 weeks the modality will be weekly
      switched to the alternative one. Finally, with the intention to compensate the reduction in
      serum calcium induced by the citrate binding, both study arms will be completed with a week
      using a citric acid dialysate with a calcium supplementation of 0.25 mmol/L (modality C+).

      The haemodialyses will be performed using a 4008 H machine, equipped with a cartridge of
      bicarbonate Bibag©, and a high flux single use polysulfone membrane, all from Fresenius
      Medical Care (Bad Homburg, Germany). The prescribed dialyser effective surface area, dialysis
      fluid conductibility, temperature and composition (with the exception of acetate [3.0 mmol/L
      in A and 0.3 in C and C+], citrate [0 mmol/L in A and 0.8 in C and C+] and calcium [1.25 and
      1.50 mmol/L in A and C and 1.50 and 1.75 in C+]), and effective blood flow will be recorded
      at the enrolment in the study, and left unchanged for the following 5 weeks. The medications
      of the patients (including phosphate binders) will also be left unchanged.

      Serum BUN, creatinine, potassium, phosphate, calcium and whole blood pH, bicarbonate, and
      ionized calcium will be measured at the beginning and at the end of the third dialysis
      session of each week. Ionized and total calcium will also be measured at the beginning and at
      the end of the first dialysis session of each week. The prothrombin fragments 1+2 (F1+2) and
      thrombin-antithrombin complexes (TAT) will be determined at the beginning and at the end of
      the third dialysis session of each week [26]. Blood samples will be taken from the arterial
      limb of the shunt.

      Systolic and diastolic blood pressures and heart rate will be measured before starting every
      session, and then repeated at 30 min interval throughout the dialysis with an automated Blood
      Pressure Monitor 4008 (Fresenius Medical Care, Bad Homburg, Germany) integrated in the
      dialysis machine. Stroke volumes (integrated mean of the flow waveform between the current
      upstroke and the dicrotic notch) and peripheral resistances (ratio of mean arterial pressure
      to stroke volume multiplied by heart rate) will be evaluated between 5 and 10 minutes after
      starting the session and then every 45 minutes using a finger beat-to-beat monitor Finometer©
      (Finapres Medical Systems BV, Arnhem, The Netherlands). The use of isotonic saline (100-200
      ml) infusions to treat symptomatic hypotension or symptoms related to intravascular
      hypovolaemia will be registered.

      Kt/V will be calculated using a second generation single-pool Daugirdas formula (Kt/V =
      -ln(R-0.03) + [(4-3.5 x R) x (UF/W)] where R = post-dialysis BUN/pre-dialysis BUN, UF = net
      ultrafiltration and W = weight).

      The citrate accumulation during dialysis will be estimated calculating the calcium gap =
      │post-predialysis total calcium│- │post-predialysis ionized calcium│[6]. The value of 0.2
      mmol/L will be used as a cut-off to divide the patients in rapid (&lt; 0.2 mmol/L) and slow (≥
      0.2 mmol/L) metabolizers.

      Results will be expressed as mean ± SD. Statistical analyses will be performed using a
      statistical software package (SPSS 12.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Comparisons between
      laboratory and haemodynamic parameters will be done first with an ANOVA followed if
      significant by a paired t-test performed between the mean of the values obtained in each
      patient with each modality. Haemodynamic parameters as a function of the dialysis time will
      be compared using a trapezoidal estimation of the area under the curves followed by a
      Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test. With the intention of ameliorating the understanding of the
      haemodynamic changes, an evaluation of the maximum increase and decrease in each parameter
      will be added to the data analysis (see Figure 2 for an explanation of the calculation
      method). Percentages will be compared using a Fisher Exact test. In all cases, a P ≤ 0.05
      will be considered statistically significant; P will be expressed as ns (not significant),
      =0.05, &lt;0.05, &lt;0.01 and &lt;0.001.

      The protocol of the study has been approved by the local Ethical Committee. All the patients
      will give written informed consent prior to enrolment in the study.
