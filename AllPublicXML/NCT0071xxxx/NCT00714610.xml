    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare serum chromium and cobalt levels of patients who
      have undergone metal on metal total hip arthroplasty. It is unknown if the presence of
      bilateral well-functioning large-head metal-on-metal (MOM) total hip arthroplasties (THAs)
      leads to higher serum metal ion concentrations than unilateral MOM THA. Elevated levels
      (chromium, 17 μg/L; cobalt, 19 μg/L) have been associated with poorly functioning MOM THA
      with metallosis. Fourteen patients having undergone bilateral and 25 patients having
      undergone unilateral large-head primary MOM THA were compared. Harris Hip Scores, University
      of California Los Angeles activity scores, radiographs, serum creatinine, and serum cobalt
      and chromium levels were obtained.

      The objective of this study is to compare serum chromium and cobalt levels of patients who
      have undergone metal on metal total hip arthroplasty.

      The effect of the presence of bilateral large-head MOM THA on circulating metal ions levels
      has not been thoroughly studied. Metal ion levels in patients with unilateral MOM vs
      bilateral MOM resurfacing and small-head THA have been reported; however, to the
      investigators knowledge, no study has investigated the differences in serum metal ion levels
      in unilateral vs bilateral largehead (≥38 mm) MOM THA. The objective of this study was to
      compare serum cobalt and chromium levels in patients who have undergone unilateral vs
      bilateral large-head MOM THA to better understand the effect of the presence of bilateral
      implants on circulating metal ion levels. The investigators believe that further
      understanding baseline levels in well-functioning MOM THA will increase the clinical utility
      of checking serum metal ion levels in the workup of the painful MOM THA. The investigators
      hypothesis was that serum metal ion levels in patients with well-functioning bilateral
      large-head MOM THA would be higher than levels in patients with well functioning unilateral
      large-head MOM THA, but these levels would not approach those seen with metallosis.

        Two groups were identified: the first group having undergone unilateral large-head (≥38 mm)
        primary MOM THA and the second having undergone bilateral large-head primary MOM THA.
        Patients were at least 18 years old, were at least 1 year out from their index procedure,
        and had well-positioned components.

        Patients in both cohorts had cementless modular titanium alloy proximally porous-coated,
        tapered femoral stems (Biomet Taperloc or Bi-Metric; Biomet, Warsaw, Ind).

        All surgeries were done between the years of 2003 and 2009.
