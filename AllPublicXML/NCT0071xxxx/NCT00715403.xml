  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate the long-term safety of BIBF 1120 in terms
      of incidence and intensity of Adverse Events and changes in safety laboratory parameters.

      Secondary objectives are the collection of further safety data (vital signs), efficacy data
      and the determination of pharmacokinetic characteristics during long-term therapy with BIBF
      1120.

Patients with PD could enter the trial if they showed signs of clinical benefit. For patients with PD at screening, the RECIST assessment at screening was used as a new baseline value and PFS was the time from first treatment with the trial drug in this trial until the onset of progressive disease in this trial or death, whatever comes first.</description>

         15. Serum creatinine greater than 2 mg/dl (&gt; 176 µmol/L)

         16. Concomitant non-oncological diseases which are considered relevant for the evaluation
             of the safety of the trial drug

         17. Chemo-, radio-, or immunotherapy within the past four weeks prior to treatment with
             the trial drug

PFS was defined for patients without PD at screening as the time from first treatment with the trial drug in the previous trial until onset of PD or death, whatever comes earlier.
Patients with PD could enter the trial if they showed signs of clinical benefit. For patients with PD at screening, the RECIST assessment at screening was used as a new baseline value and PFS was the time from first treatment with the trial drug in this trial until the onset of progressive disease in this trial or death, whatever comes first.</description>
