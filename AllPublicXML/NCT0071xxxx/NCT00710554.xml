  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a 15 week (one week baseline and fourteen weeks treatment period), multicentre,
      double blind, randomised, placebo controlled, parallel group study to evaluate the efficacy
      of Sativex® in subjects with PNP, associated with allodynia. Subjects were screened to
      determine eligibility and completed a seven-day baseline period. Subjects then returned to
      the centre for assessment, randomisation and dose introduction. Visits occurred at the end of
      weeks two, six, ten and at the end of the study (treatment week 14) or earlier if they
      withdrew. A follow up visit occurred 28 days after completion or withdrawal. Subjects in this
      study were given the opportunity to be enrolled in an open label extension study.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Peripheral Neuropathic Pain on a 0-10 Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) Score at the End of Treatment (15 Weeks)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7 to Day 98</time_frame>
    <description>The peripheral neuropathic pain NRS was completed at the same time each day, i.e. bedtime in the evening. The patient was asked &quot;on a scale of '0 to 10', please indicate the number that best describes your pain or average pain in the last 24 hours&quot; where 0 = no pain and 10 = pain as bad as you can imagine. No pain relates to the time prior to the onset of pain. A negative value indicates an improvement in pain score from baseline.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Neuropathic Pain Scale Score at the End of Treatment (15 Weeks)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7 to Day 98</time_frame>
    <description>The NPS score is 0-100 sum of 10 individual pain scores (0-10 NRS, 0= no pain to 10 = most pain imaginable). A negative change from baseline indicates an improvement in pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Sleep Quality 0-10 Numerical Rating Scale Scores at the End of Treatment (15 Weeks)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7 to Day 98</time_frame>
    <description>The sleep disruption NRS was completed at the same time each day, i.e. bedtime in the evening. The patient was asked &quot;on a scale of '0 to 10', please indicate how your pain disrupted your sleep last night?&quot; where 0 = did not disrupt sleep and 10 = completely disrupted (unable to sleep at all). A negative value indicates an improvement in sleep disruption score from baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Baseline Mean Dynamic Allodynia Test Score at the End of Treatment (15 Weeks)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7 and Day 98</time_frame>
    <description>Dynamic allodynia was assessed by stroking the skin over the affected area five times with a standardised brush, designed specifically for sensory testing at 5 s intervals, and recording the pain severity on a 0-10 point scale (0= no pain to 10 = most pain imaginable). All strokes were of the same length, minimum 2 cm. Each dynamic allodynia score was calculated as the average of the five strokes.A negative change from baseline indicates an improvement in score.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Baseline Mean Punctate Allodynia Test Scores at the End of Treatment (15 Weeks)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7 and Day 98</time_frame>
    <description>Punctate allodynia was measured using an in-house built pressure algometer comprising a strain gauge connected to a metal filament with a diameter of 1 mm and blunt tip at baseline and end of study. The filament was manually directed against the skin at an angle of 90 degrees and a steadily increasing pressure applied until the patient verbally indicated that they perceived pain (punctate pressure pain threshold). Patients were asked to verbally rate the intensity of the pain elicited, choosing a number between 0 (no pain)and 10 (most intense pain imaginable).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subject Global Impression of Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 98</time_frame>
    <description>A 7-point Likert-type scale was used, with the question: 'Please assess the status of your pain due to peripheral neuropathy since entry into the study using the scale below' with the markers &quot;very much improved, much improved, slightly improved, no change, slightly worse, much worse or very much worse&quot;. At Visit 2 (Baseline) patients wrote a brief description of their pain caused by peripheral neuropathy which was used at end of treatment to aid their memory regarding their symptoms at study start. For each of above markers the number of participants were reported.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Brief Pain Inventory (Short Form) Scores at the End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7 and Day 98</time_frame>
    <description>The BPI-SF is a 14-item questionnaire that asks patients to rate pain over the prior week and the degree to which it interferes with activities on a 0 to 10 scale, where 0=no pain and 10=pain as bad as you can imagine. Severity is measured as worst pain, least pain, average pain, and pain right now. The severity composite score was calculated as the arithmetic mean of the four severity items(range 0-10). The minimum value is zero and maximum is 10. A higher score represents a poor outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Quality of Life EuroQol 5-D (Health Status Index) Score at the End of Treatment (15 Weeks)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7 and Day 98</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D questionnaire provided two outcomes:(1)A weighted health state index visual analogue scale (VAS); (2) A self-rated health status VAS. EQ-5D Health Status VAS Scale: 0 = worst health state imaginable to 100 = best health state imaginable. An increase in score indicates an improvement in condition.The weighted health state index used the same VAS as above but was calculated for each assessment without imputation to account for missing values i.e., if one or more individual items was missing then the whole index was missing.</description>

          <description>The sleep disruption NRS was completed at the same time each day, i.e. bedtime in the evening. The patient was asked &quot;on a scale of '0 to 10', please indicate how your pain disrupted your sleep last night?&quot; where 0 = did not disrupt sleep and 10 = completely disrupted (unable to sleep at all). A negative value indicates an improvement in sleep disruption score from baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Brief Pain Inventory (Short Form) Scores at the End of Treatment</title>
        <description>The BPI-SF is a 14-item questionnaire that asks patients to rate pain over the prior week and the degree to which it interferes with activities on a 0 to 10 scale, where 0=no pain and 10=pain as bad as you can imagine. Severity is measured as worst pain, least pain, average pain, and pain right now. The severity composite score was calculated as the arithmetic mean of the four severity items(range 0-10). The minimum value is zero and maximum is 10. A higher score represents a poor outcome.</description>

        <population>The primary population for the analysis of efficacy was the full analysis set, which included all randomised subjects who received at least one dose of test treatment and had on-treatment efficacy data.</population>

An increase in score indicates an improvement in condition.The weighted health state index used the same VAS as above but was calculated for each assessment without imputation to account for missing values i.e., if one or more individual items was missing then the whole index was missing.</description>
