    <measure>Change From Baseline in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) Total Score at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline(Week 0) and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>ADAS-cog assessed a range of cognitive abilities including memory, comprehension, orientation in time and place and spontaneous speech. Most items were evaluated by tests, but some were dependent on clinician ratings on a five point scale. There were in all 11 questions. Total scores were calculated as the sum of the individual components. Scores ranged from 0 to 70 with higher scores indicated greater dysfunction. The ADAS-Cog total score was the sum of the calculated scores for questions 1, 2, and 7, and the scores recorded on the case report form (CRF) for questions 3 to 6 and 8 to 11. When a score was missing for one of the questions, the total score was calculated as a weighted average of the scores provided for the remaining ten questions. The change from Baseline was obtained by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-randomization value. Baseline was Week 0 value. Data for adjusted mean is presented.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Clinical Dementia Rating - Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) Score at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline(Week 0) and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The CDR-SB is an interviewer administered scale and impairment is scored in each of categories: memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies and personal care. Impairment is scored on a scale in which none = 0, questionable = 0.5, mild = 1, moderate = 2 and severe = 3. The 6 individual category ratings, or &quot;box scores&quot;, were added together to give the CDR-Sum of Boxes which ranges from 0-18 (severe impairment). If there were any missing items then CDR-SB was set to missing and was not imputed. The change from Baseline was obtained by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-randomization value. Baseline was Week 0 value. Data for adjusted mean has been presented.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) Total Score at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>RBANS is an individually administered cognitive battery comprising 12 subtests across five domains (Attention, Language, Visuospatial/Constructional Abilities, and Immediate and Delayed memory). Total scores are calculated by adding up the scores for each of the 12 individual subtests and ranges between 0 and 311, where a low score indicates greater impairment. The change from Baseline was obtained by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-randomization value. Baseline was Week 0 value. Data for adjusted mean has been presented.</description>

The ADAS-Cog total score was the sum of the calculated scores for questions 1, 2, and 7, and the scores recorded on the CRF for questions 3 to 6 and 8 to 11. In cases where more than one question was missing, a total score was not be imputed. When a score was missing for one of the questions, the total score was calculated as a weighted average of the scores provided for the remaining ten questions. The change from Baseline was obtained by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-randomization value. Baseline was Week 0 value. Data for adjusted mean has been present</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Alzheimer's Disease Co-operative Study Group - Activities of Daily Living Inventory (ADCS- ADL) Total Score at Weeks 12, 24, 36 and 48</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) and Week 12, 24, 36 and 48</time_frame>
    <description>The ADCS-ADL is an interviewer-administered informant-based scale where the informant (caregiver) responds to 23 activities of daily living questions about the participant. The questions ranged from basic to instrumental activities of daily living and take approximately 20 minutes to complete. The Total score ranges from 0-78 and a higher score signified greater functional ability. The questionnaire was split into two types of questions, an initial question relating to whether a participant had completed a particular activity and then a follow on question which scored how much assistance the participant had required if they had performed that particular activity. The total score was calculated by adding up the responses for each of the individual activities. The change from Baseline was obtained by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-randomization value. Baseline was Week 0 value. Data for adjusted mean has been presented.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) Total Score at Week 24 and 48</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) and Week 24 and 48</time_frame>
    <description>The MMSE consisted of 11 items covering orientation, memory (recent and immediate), concentration, language and praxis. Scores ranged from 0 to 30, with lower scores indicating greater cognitive impairment. Scores for each of the 11 individual tests were not recorded on the CRF, therefore if any item was missing then the total score was be set to missing. The change from Baseline was obtained by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-randomization value. Baseline was Week 0 value. Data for adjusted mean has been presented.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale – Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) Total Score at Week 24</title>
        <description>ADAS-cog assessed a range of cognitive abilities including memory, comprehension, orientation in time and place and spontaneous speech. Most items were evaluated by tests, but some were dependent on clinician ratings on a five point scale. There were in all 11 questions. Total scores were calculated as the sum of the individual components. Scores ranged from 0 to 70 with higher scores indicated greater dysfunction. The ADAS-Cog total score was the sum of the calculated scores for questions 1, 2, and 7, and the scores recorded on the case report form (CRF) for questions 3 to 6 and 8 to 11. When a score was missing for one of the questions, the total score was calculated as a weighted average of the scores provided for the remaining ten questions. The change from Baseline was obtained by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-randomization value. Baseline was Week 0 value. Data for adjusted mean is presented.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Clinical Dementia Rating – Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) Score at Week 24</title>
        <description>The CDR-SB is an interviewer administered scale and impairment is scored in each of categories: memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies and personal care. Impairment is scored on a scale in which none = 0, questionable = 0.5, mild = 1, moderate = 2 and severe = 3. The 6 individual category ratings, or “box scores”, were added together to give the CDR-Sum of Boxes which ranges from 0-18 (severe impairment). If there were any missing items then CDR-SB was set to missing and was not imputed. The change from Baseline was obtained by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-randomization value. Baseline was Week 0 value. Data for adjusted mean has been presented.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) Total Score at Week 24</title>
        <description>RBANS is an individually administered cognitive battery comprising 12 subtests across five domains (Attention, Language, Visuospatial/Constructional Abilities, and Immediate and Delayed memory). Total scores are calculated by adding up the scores for each of the 12 individual subtests and ranges between 0 and 311, where a low score indicates greater impairment. The change from Baseline was obtained by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-randomization value. Baseline was Week 0 value. Data for adjusted mean has been presented.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in ADAS-Cog Total Score at Week 12, 36 and 48</title>
        <description>ADAS-cog assessed a range of cognitive abilities including memory, comprehension, orientation in time and place and spontaneous speech. Most items were evaluated by tests, but some were dependent on clinician ratings on a five point scale. There were in all 11 questions. Total scores were calculated as the sum of the individual components. Scores ranged from 0 to 70 with higher scores indicated greater dysfunction. The ADAS-Cog total score was the sum of the calculated scores for questions 1, 2, and 7, and the scores recorded on the CRF for questions 3 to 6 and 8 to 11. In cases where more than one question was missing, a total score was not be imputed. When a score was missing for one of the questions, the total score was calculated as a weighted average of the scores provided for the remaining ten questions. The change from Baseline was obtained by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-randomization value. Baseline was Week 0 value. Data for adjusted mean has been present</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in CDR-SB Score at Week 12, 36 and 48</title>
        <description>The CDR-SB is an interviewer administered scale and impairment is scored in each of categories: memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies and personal care. Impairment is scored on a scale in which none = 0, questionable = 0.5, mild = 1, moderate = 2 and severe = 3. The 6 individual category ratings, or “box scores”, were added together to give the CDR-Sum of Boxes which ranges from 0-18 (severe impairment). If there were any missing items then CDR-SB was set to missing and was not imputed. The change from Baseline was obtained by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-randomization value. Baseline was Week 0 value. Data for adjusted mean has been presented.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in RBANS Score at Week 12, 36 and 48</title>
        <description>RBANS is an individually administered cognitive battery comprising 12 subtests across five domains (Attention, Language, Visuospatial/Constructional Abilities, and Immediate and Delayed memory). Total scores are calculated by adding up the scores for each of the 12 individual subtests and ranges between 0 and 311, where a low score indicates greater impairment. The change from Baseline was obtained by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-randomization value. Baseline was Week 0 value. Data for adjusted mean has been presented.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Alzheimer’s Disease Co-operative Study Group – Activities of Daily Living Inventory (ADCS- ADL) Total Score at Weeks 12, 24, 36 and 48</title>
        <description>The ADCS-ADL is an interviewer-administered informant-based scale where the informant (caregiver) responds to 23 activities of daily living questions about the participant. The questions ranged from basic to instrumental activities of daily living and take approximately 20 minutes to complete. The Total score ranges from 0-78 and a higher score signified greater functional ability. The questionnaire was split into two types of questions, an initial question relating to whether a participant had completed a particular activity and then a follow on question which scored how much assistance the participant had required if they had performed that particular activity. The total score was calculated by adding up the responses for each of the individual activities. The change from Baseline was obtained by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-randomization value. Baseline was Week 0 value. Data for adjusted mean has been presented.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) Total Score at Week 24 and 48</title>
        <description>The MMSE consisted of 11 items covering orientation, memory (recent and immediate), concentration, language and praxis. Scores ranged from 0 to 30, with lower scores indicating greater cognitive impairment. Scores for each of the 11 individual tests were not recorded on the CRF, therefore if any item was missing then the total score was be set to missing. The change from Baseline was obtained by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-randomization value. Baseline was Week 0 value. Data for adjusted mean has been presented.</description>

        <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that occurred during the course of the trial after study treatment had started. An adverse event was therefore any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. An SAE was any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, are life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization or results in disability/incapacity, and congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in ADAS-Cog Scale in Participants With APOE4 Gene</title>
        <description>Genetic analyses was conducted to assess the effect of APOE4 carriage. ADAS-cog assessed a range of cognitive abilities including memory, comprehension, orientation in time and place and spontaneous speech. Most items were evaluated by tests, but some were dependent on clinician ratings on a five-point scale. There were in all 11 questions. Total scores were calculated as the sum of the individual components. Scores ranged from 0 to 70 with higher scores indicating greater dysfunction. The ADAS-Cog total score was the sum of the calculated scores for questions 1, 2, and 7, and the scores were recorded on the CRF for questions 3 to 6 and 8 to 11. When a score was missing for one of the questions, the total score was calculated as a weighted average of the scores provided for the remaining ten questions. Baseline was Week 0 value. The change from Baseline was obtained by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-randomization value.</description>

        <description>Genetic analyses was conducted to assess the effect of APOE4 carriage. The CDR-SB is an interviewer administered scale and impairment is scored in following categories: memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies and personal care. Impairment was scored on a scale in which none =0, questionable =0.5, mild =1, moderate =2 and severe =3. The 6 individual category ratings, or “box scores”, were added together to give the CDR-Sum of Boxes which ranges from 0-18, with higher score indicating severe impairment. If there were any missing items then CDR-SB was set to missing and was not imputed. Baseline was Week 0 value. The change from Baseline was obtained by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-randomization value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in RBANS Scale in Participants With APOE4 Gene</title>
        <description>Genetic analyses was conducted to assess the effect of APOE4 carriage. RBANS is an individually administered cognitive battery comprising 12 subtests across five domains (Attention, Language, Visuospatial/Constructional Abilities, and Immediate and Delayed memory). Total scores are calculated by adding up the scores for each of the 12 individual subtests and ranges between 0 and 311, where a low score indicates greater impairment. Baseline was Week 0 value. The change from Baseline was obtained by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-randomization value.</description>
