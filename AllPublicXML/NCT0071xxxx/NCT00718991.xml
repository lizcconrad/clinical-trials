  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This investigation is designed to assess the immediate and long-term angiographic patency
      outcomes of excimer laser recanalisation followed by PTA in the treatment of long (&gt;50 mm)
      infrapopliteal lesions in patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI)

      The Spectranetics Turbo elite™ excimer laser catheters are percutaneous intravascular devices
      constructed of multiple optical fibers around a guidewire lumen. The laser catheters transmit
      ultraviolet energy from the Spectranetics CVX-300® Excimer Laser System to the obstruction in
      the artery. The ultraviolet energy is delivered to the tip of the laser catheter to
      photo-ablate fibrous, calcific and atheromatous lesions, thus recanalizing diseased vessels.
