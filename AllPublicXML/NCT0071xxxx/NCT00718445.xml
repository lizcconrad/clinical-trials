  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to streamline disease research in ALS and other motor neuron diseases, we have
      joined a consortium of clinical centers (Hershey and University of Pittsburgh) who will
      collaborate on clinical and basic research projects. As part of this collaboration,
      de-identified clinical data from subjects at each institution will be entered into a joint
      database kindly provided and maintained by the ALS Hope Foundation. This database is password
      protected and contains only de-identified information. In addition to clinical data, any
      research specimens that are available through IRB approved tissue collections will be linked
      to the subject so that the collaborating investigators can share samples and have the maximum
      information. This will enhance the usefulness of each specimen.

      Once established, the database will provide a resource in which clinical data on a large
      number of patients along with tissue (blood, urine, muscle, csf, and autopsy) samples will be
      readily available. This will expedite research by circumventing the delays in collecting
      specimens prospectively and increase the number of specimens available by allowing the
      collaborating researchers access to each others specimens. In each case there will be a
      formal request placed to use specimens that are at the other institutions. These specimens
      will be used for research in the ALS Center of Hope at the Drexel University College of
      Medicine and shared with outside investigators with valid IRB approved protocols.
