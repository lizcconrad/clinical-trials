      The skin testing procedure, based on the Nordic Guidelines is the reference method for the
      biological calibration of in-House Reference Preparations (IHRP). The method is not intended
      for routine testing of allergen extracts. The use of this procedure is the basis for the
      definition of biological activity units: &quot;the activity of an allergen extract is 10,000
      Biological Units (BU) per ml (10 HEP per ml), when the extract provokes an specific skin
      reaction in the median sensitive patient with a wheal of the same size as a wheal provoked by
      a positive reference solution consisting of histamine 54.3 mmol/l (for example histamine
      dihydrochloride 10 mg/ml), when both solutions are administrated using the same technique
      (prick testing) on at least 20 individuals who are clinically allergic and cutaneously
      reactive to the allergen concerned&quot;.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Voluntarily signed informed consent form by the patient

          -  Patients should live in a geographic zone where allergy caused by Chortoglyphus
             arcuatus is a relevant problem.

          -  Patients should not be excluded due to low or high sensitivity to the allergen, when
             they otherwise fulfil the inclusion criteria.

          -  A positive case history with inhalant allergy related to exposure to the allergen to
             be tested.

          -  A positive prick test (mean wheal diameter &gt; 3 mm) when tested with a standardized
             extract prepared from the allergen source in question and/or a positive test for
             specific IgE.

          -  A mean wheal diameter &gt; 7 mm2 obtained in a prick test with histamine dihydrochloride
             10 mg/ml.

          -  Age: 18-50 years.

          -  Both genders

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Immunotherapy in the past 2 years with an allergen preparation known to interfere with
             the allergens to be tested.

          -  Use of drugs that may interfere with the skin reactions.

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Dermographism

          -  Atopic dermatitis (locally at the test site)

          -  Urticaria.
