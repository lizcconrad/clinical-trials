      This is a multi-centre UK study designed to evaluate if an educational intervention programme
      delivered to health care professionals can improve the use of evidence based treatments in
      the management of patients admitted to hospital with non-ST elevation Acute Coronary
      Syndrome. A total of 38 centres participated, half received the educational intervention.
      Patients were followed to hospital discharge. Patients were followed up at 6 months. Longer
      term follow up through the Office Of National Statistics will be performed.

      the management of patients admitted to hospital with non-ST elevation Acute Coronary

      discharge. Patients were followed up at 6 months and longer term follow up for mortality will
      be performed through the national databases.
