  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic techniques have been applied widely to the management of various common
      pediatric surgical diseases. Current evidence lacks sufficient quality to justify the
      widespread adoption of the laparoscopic approach to the repair of inguinal hernias within
      children. It is important to critically evaluate the efficiency and the potential risks of
      these new techniques before they can supplant open techniques as the treatment modality of
      choice. Numerous large case series of laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair have been reported
      with average length of stay, complication rates, recurrence rates and pain management scores
      that mirror those of open inguinal hernia repair. Only one randomized controlled trial has
      been performed to compare the open versus laparoscopic technique which has not provided
      answers regarding the potential benefits on young infants. Benefits of an open approach in
      children includes a shorter operative time, while the laparoscopic procedure is associated
      with less pain and a better cosmetic result.

      This study will compare open versus laparoscopic repairs of inguinal hernias. The primary
      outcome variable will be total dose of acetaminophen administered postoperatively for pain
      management. Secondary outcome variables include 1) Incidence of intraoperative complications
      such as compromise of testicular vessels, perforation of abdominal viscera; 2) Short-term
      outcomes such as operative time, rate of conversion from open to laparoscopic procedure,
      requirement for reoperation within 30 days, wound infection, acute hydroceles and
      post-operative length of stay; 3) Long-term outcomes such as recurrent inguinal hernia,
      testicular atrophy and; 4) Cost of hospitalization will be compared between the open and
      laparoscopic groups.

      Comparisons will be made in two groups of patients- patients with 1) unilateral hernias and
      2) bilateral hernias and will last for 2 years. 102 patients in the unilateral arm and 50
      patients in the bilateral arm will be randomized to each treatment group and each subject
      will be followed for up to 12 months following the surgical intervention. Two study
      evaluations by telephone (in addition to a single outpatient clinic visit already required as
      part of standard post-operative care) will be required of each research subject and his/her
      parent/guardian. The telephone evaluations will occur at 3 and 12 months following surgery.
      The standard post-operative clinic visit is scheduled at 2 weeks following surgery.
