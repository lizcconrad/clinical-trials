  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Projections from NHANES III indicate that approximately 12,000,000 U.S. adults â‰¥ 60 years of
      age have vitamin D insufficiency (serum 25(OH)D &lt; 50 nmol/L). A growing body of evidence
      suggests that vitamin D status may be important in biologic processes involved in the
      maintenance of physical function. To test the hypothesis that vitamin D insufficiency is
      associated with poorer muscle strength and physical performance, we propose to evaluate the
      role of vitamin D status (serum 25(OH)D) on physical function and falls in the CHS All Stars
      cohort, a population of advanced age. The specific aims are as follows:

      Specific Aim 1. To describe the prevalence and correlates of vitamin D insufficiency in
      adults of advanced age.

      Specific Aim 2. To examine the cross-sectional association between vitamin D status and
      muscle strength (leg and grip strength), physical performance (3 m/15 ft walk time, repeated
      chair stands, and standing balance), self-reported physical function (mobility, ADL and IADL
      disability), and falls.

      Specific Aim 3. To examine the longitudinal association between vitamin D status at baseline
      and incident disability (mobility, ADL and IADL disability) over 3 years of follow-up.

      Research Hypotheses: Low vitamin D status (25(OH)D &lt; 50 nmol/L) will be associated with (a)
      lower levels of muscle strength and physical performance; (b) higher levels of self-reported
      limitations in physical function and falls; and (c) greater odds of incident disability.

    <description>CHS All Stars is an ancillary study of the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), a longitudinal, observational, population-based study of the onset, progression, and course of heart disease and stroke in the elderly which began in 1988. The All Stars study reexamined the survivors of CHS to determine the likelihood of maintaining function later in life. A focus was to determine whether age-related biological factors are long-term predicators of functional aging which was assessed through a follow-up exam (Yr 18 visit conducted in 2005-06, n=1674 older adults, mean age =84 years) and 3 yrs of subsequent 6 month interval phone contacts. Vitamin D status (serum 25(OH)D and PTH) is being assessed in all CHS All Stars participants who provided a blood sample at the Yr 18 visit (n~1100).</description>

        Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), is a longitudinal, observational, population-based study
        of the onset, progression, and course of heart disease and stroke in the elderly which
        began in 1988. We are only examining those that participated in the the CHS All Stars which
        is from the same cohort of people who were still alive in 2005 when enrollment began. We
        approached everyone who was in the CHS study and asked them to participate in the CHS All
        Stars study. Blood samples were collected at the year 18 visit and analyzed for serum
        25(OH)D.
