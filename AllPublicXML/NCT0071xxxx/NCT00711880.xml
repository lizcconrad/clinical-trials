  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a six week, multicentre, double blind, randomised, placebo controlled parallel group
      study to evaluate the efficacy of Sativex®. Subjects with peripheral neuropathic pain
      characterised by allodynia, were screened to determine eligibility and entered a seven day
      baseline period. Subjects then returned to the centre for randomisation and dose
      introduction, and received either placebo or Sativex in a double blind manner for five weeks,
      with a follow up visit 7 to 10 days after the end of the treatment period. The primary
      efficacy measure was the difference in pain severity at the end of treatment, measured using
      a peripheral neuropathic pain 0 to 10 numerical rating scale.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Mean Daily Peripheral Neuropathic Pain on a 0-10 Numerical Rating Scale Score During the Last Seven Days of Treatment (End of Treatment)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 to Day 42</time_frame>
    <description>The neuropathic pain Numerical Rating Scale was completed at the same time each day, i.e. bedtime in the evening. The patient was asked &quot;on a scale of '0 to 10', please indicate the number that best describes your pain or average pain in the last 24 hours&quot; where 0 = no pain and 10 = worst possible pain. A negative value indicates an improvement in pain score from baseline.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Neuropathic Pain Scale Score at the End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 to Day 42</time_frame>
    <description>The Neuropathic Pain Scale (NPS) score consisted of a series of assessments of different aspects of pain (intensity, sharpness, hot, dull, cold, sensitive, itchy, unpleasantness, and surface compared with deep), each scored using 11-point Numerical Rating Scales. The NPS score is 0-100 sum of 10 individual pain scores (0-10 NRS, 0= no pain to 10 = most pain imaginable). A negative change from baseline indicates an improvement in pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Sleep Quality at the End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7 - Day 42</time_frame>
    <description>The sleep disruption NRS was completed at the same time each day, i.e. bedtime in the evening. The patient was asked &quot;on a scale of '0 to 10', please indicate how your pain disrupted your sleep last night?&quot; where 0 = did not disrupt sleep and 10 = completely disrupted (unable to sleep at all). A negative value indicates an improvement in sleep disruption score from baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Mean Pain Disability Index Score at the End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 - Day 42</time_frame>
    <description>The Pain Disability Index consisted of seven self-administered questions relating to the effect of the subject's chronic pain on their personal life (family/home responsibilities, social activity, sexual behaviour, life-support activity, recreation, occupation and self-care). Each assessment was scored on an 11-point Numerical Rating Scale ranging from 0 (which equals 'no disability') to 10 (which equals 'total disability'). The total Pain Disability Index is the unweighted sum of the seven Numerical Rating Scale scores. The maximum (worst) total score was 70.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Dynamic Allodynia Test Score at the End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7 and Day 42</time_frame>
    <description>Dynamic allodynia was assessed by stroking the skin over the affected area five times with a standardised brush, designed specifically for sensory testing at 5sec intervals, and recording the pain severity on a 0-10 point scale (0= no pain to 10 = most pain imaginable). All strokes were of the same length, minimum 2 cm. Each dynamic allodynia score was calculated as the average of the five strokes. A negative change from baseline indicates an improvement in score.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Static Allodynia Test Score at the End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 - Day 42</time_frame>
    <description>The static allodynia test involved applying pressure to a non-allodynic area (on the contralateral side to the identified allodynic area), and recording the pressure that caused pain to this area. Seventy five percent of the pressure that caused pain to the non-allodynic area (up to the subject's pain/pressure threshold) was then applied to the allodynic area, and an 11-point Numerical Rating Scale pain score recorded (between 0 (no pain)and 10 (most intense pain imaginable)). A negative value indicates an improvement in pain score from baseline.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Total General Health Questionnaire Score at the End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7 and Day 42</time_frame>
    <description>The General Health Questionnaire-12 is designed to measure non-psychotic mental disorders. It consists of 12 questions, scored on a 0 to 3 Likert scale to measure and compare psychological morbidity levels, where 0 represents better psychological health. The total General Health Questionnaire-12 score is the unweighted sum of the 12 scores. Zero indicates the best possible psychological health, 36 indicates the worst possible psychological health.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Mean Brief Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological Test Score for 'Selective Reminding' at the End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7 and Day 42</time_frame>
    <description>The Selective Reminding Test measures verbal learning and delayed recall through a multiple-trial list-learning paradigm. Patients are presented aurally with a list of 12 words for trial 1 and are asked to recall as many as possible. For trials 2-6, there is a selective presentation of only those words not recalled on the previous trial. Trial 7 is similar to the other trials but is assessed after an 11-minute delay. The score for the selective reminding test is the unweighted average of seven individual study results (min=0 and max=84) Higher scores indicate a better cognitive performance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Mean Brief Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological Test Score for '10/36 Spatial Recall' at the End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7 and Day 42</time_frame>
    <description>The 10/36 Spatial Recall Test assesses visual spatial learning and delayed recall. Patients are asked to view a 6 x 6 checkerboard with ten checkers for 10 seconds. They are then asked to recreate the pattern viewed on a blank checkerboard. The number of correct responses from three immediate trials and one delayed trial (7 minute delay) are recorded. The Total number of correct responses is the unweighted sum from the four trials. The score for the 10/36 spatial recall test was the unweighted average of four individual study results (min=0 and max=40). A higher score indicates better cognitive performance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Mean Brief Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological Test Score for 'Symbol Digit Modalities' at the End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7 and Day 42</time_frame>
    <description>The Symbol Digit Modalities Test measures complex attention and concentration in a task which also requires speed and accuracy in visual search and scanning. Patients are required to associate symbols with numbers and quickly generate the number when shown the symbol. The summary endpoint is the number of correct responses in 90 seconds. The symbol digit modalities test had a min of 0 and max score of 99. A higher score indicates better cognitive performance.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Mean Brief Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological Test Score for 'Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task' at the End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7 and Day 42</time_frame>
    <description>The Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task assesses sustained attention and concentration. A pre-recorded tape is used to present two series of 60 numbers, one every 3 seconds and one every 2 seconds. Patients are asked to add each number to the one immediately preceding it and give the result. The task summary score is the percentage of correct answers is calculated. The PASAT score range was 0% to 100%. Higher scores indicate a better cognitive</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Mean Brief Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological Test Score for 'Word List Generation' at the End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7 and Day 42</time_frame>
    <description>Word list generation measures verbal associative fluency. Patients are given 60 seconds to give as many words beginning with a particular letter. The Total is the unweighted sum of all admissible words over three different trials. Higher scores indicate a better cognitive performance (min=0, max= not defined).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Mean Pain Disability Index Score at the End of Treatment</title>
        <description>The Pain Disability Index consisted of seven self-administered questions relating to the effect of the subject’s chronic pain on their personal life (family/home responsibilities, social activity, sexual behaviour, life-support activity, recreation, occupation and self-care). Each assessment was scored on an 11-point Numerical Rating Scale ranging from 0 (which equals ‘no disability’) to 10 (which equals ‘total disability’). The total Pain Disability Index is the unweighted sum of the seven Numerical Rating Scale scores. The maximum (worst) total score was 70.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Mean Dynamic Allodynia Test Score at the End of Treatment</title>
        <description>Dynamic allodynia was assessed by stroking the skin over the affected area five times with a standardised brush, designed specifically for sensory testing at 5sec intervals, and recording the pain severity on a 0–10 point scale (0= no pain to 10 = most pain imaginable). All strokes were of the same length, minimum 2 cm. Each dynamic allodynia score was calculated as the average of the five strokes. A negative change from baseline indicates an improvement in score.</description>

        <description>The static allodynia test involved applying pressure to a non-allodynic area (on the contralateral side to the identified allodynic area), and recording the pressure that caused pain to this area. Seventy five percent of the pressure that caused pain to the non-allodynic area (up to the subject’s pain/pressure threshold) was then applied to the allodynic area, and an 11-point Numerical Rating Scale pain score recorded (between 0 (no pain)and 10 (most intense pain imaginable)). A negative value indicates an improvement in pain score from baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Mean Brief Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological Test Score for 'Selective Reminding' at the End of Treatment</title>
        <description>The Selective Reminding Test measures verbal learning and delayed recall through a multiple-trial list-learning paradigm. Patients are presented aurally with a list of 12 words for trial 1 and are asked to recall as many as possible. For trials 2-6, there is a selective presentation of only those words not recalled on the previous trial. Trial 7 is similar to the other trials but is assessed after an 11-minute delay. The score for the selective reminding test is the unweighted average of seven individual study results (min=0 and max=84) Higher scores indicate a better cognitive performance.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in the Mean Brief Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological Test Score for 'Selective Reminding' at the End of Treatment</title>
          <description>The Selective Reminding Test measures verbal learning and delayed recall through a multiple-trial list-learning paradigm. Patients are presented aurally with a list of 12 words for trial 1 and are asked to recall as many as possible. For trials 2-6, there is a selective presentation of only those words not recalled on the previous trial. Trial 7 is similar to the other trials but is assessed after an 11-minute delay. The score for the selective reminding test is the unweighted average of seven individual study results (min=0 and max=84) Higher scores indicate a better cognitive performance.</description>

        <description>The 10/36 Spatial Recall Test assesses visual spatial learning and delayed recall. Patients are asked to view a 6 x 6 checkerboard with ten checkers for 10 seconds. They are then asked to recreate the pattern viewed on a blank checkerboard. The number of correct responses from three immediate trials and one delayed trial (7 minute delay) are recorded. The Total number of correct responses is the unweighted sum from the four trials. The score for the 10/36 spatial recall test was the unweighted average of four individual study results (min=0 and max=40). A higher score indicates better cognitive performance.</description>
