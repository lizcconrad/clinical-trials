    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, activity and pharmacokinetics of a new
      investigational drug (HQK-1001) in healthy human volunteers. This study will also evaluate if
      there are differences in these parameters when HQK-1001 is administered in a fed versus a
      fasted state.
