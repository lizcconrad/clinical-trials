  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study, conducted at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, will examine how male
      teenage driving performance varies in the presence or absence of male teenage passengers. It
      will explore what information teen drivers and their passengers use when making decisions
      that affect their performance on the road.

      Male drivers under 18 years of age who have a Junior Operator's or Full License and have
      driven at least once in the month before enrolling in the study may be eligible to
      participate.

      In a university laboratory, participants sit in a 1995 Saturn sedan and operate the controls
      of the car just as they would those of any other car, during simulated drives in urban,
      suburban and rural areas. They are fitted with a head-mounted eye tracker that records their
      point of gaze in real time. On one drive, the subject drives alone; on another, a male
      passenger rides along. After the drives, the subject fills out some questionnaires.

      The purpose of this research is to examine how male teenage driving performance varies in the
      presence or absence of high versus low risk accepting male teenage passengers. Driving
      performance includes attention and risk measures including eye glance behaviors, speed
      management, following distance, closing speed and gap acceptance. To what extent does driving
      performance vary as a product of the male teen passenger risk- acceptance compared with no
      passenger present?
