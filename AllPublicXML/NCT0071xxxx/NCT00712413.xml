      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of Pylera when given twice a day. Pylera
      approved treatment schedule is 3 pills taken 4 times daily, in addition to omeprazole given
      twice daily. In this trial, subjects with confirmed Helicobacter Pylori infection will

      This study will include three phases: screening, treatment and follow-up.

      Screening: this phase will last a maximum of 15 days and subjects eligibility will be
      evaluated after informed consent signature. Urea breath test (UBT) will be performed in
      addition to routine baseline evaluations (physical, lab test, etc).

      Treatment: subjects will be treated for 10 days. A &quot;confirmation of eligibility&quot; visit will
      take place on Day 0 and an &quot;end-of-treatment&quot; visit will take place between days 9-14.

      Follow-up: approximately one month post-treatment, eradication of H. pylori will be confirmed
      through UBT
