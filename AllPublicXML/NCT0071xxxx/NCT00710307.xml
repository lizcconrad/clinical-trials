    <textblock>
      The purpose of the protocol is to describe the distribution of IGF-1 deficiency in the
      studied population of Idiopathic Short Children without Growth Hormone Deficiency or any
      other identified cause of short stature and not treated with recombinant Growth Hormone or
      IGF-1

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Short children, height ≤ -2.5 SDS

          -  Age ≥ 2 years

          -  With at least one normal or elevated peak GH response to a stimulatory test (peak GH ≥
             7 ng/mL) at the time of the study and/or at a given time-point during the last 12
             months

          -  Pre-pubertal

          -  Signed Informed Consent, including agreement to have blood samples taken for hormonal
             measurement and genetic analysis, by both parents or by Legally Acceptable
             Representatives when applicable and the child when applicable

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The following identified causes of short stature:

          -  GH-deficient short stature

          -  Other endocrine causes (hypothyroidism, Cushing's syndrome, parathyroid or vitamin D
             disorders, hypogonadism)

          -  Identified syndromes with genetic abnormalities (including Turner, Noonan and
             Russell-Silver syndromes)

          -  Chronic diseases including malnutrition, coeliac disease, chronic inflammation,
             muscular dystrophy, thalassaemia, blood disorders, severe liver or kidney disease and
             severe cyanotic heart disease

          -  Chronic diseases requiring treatment with chronically administered corticosteroids

          -  Skeletal dysplasia

             study

          -  Any mental condition that prevents both parents or Legally Acceptable Representatives
             and the child when applicable from understanding the nature, scope and possible
             consequences of the study, or any evidence of an uncooperative attitude
