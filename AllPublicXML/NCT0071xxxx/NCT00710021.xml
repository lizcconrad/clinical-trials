  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the impact of vitamin D3 on the expression of alpha
      interferon (IFN alpha) expression in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients with vitamin
      D deficiency.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease characterized by the production
      of autoantibodies with subsequent immune complex deposition and tissue inflammation. The role
      of interferon (IFN) alpha in the development of SLE has been repeatedly documented. Vitamin D
      deficiency is common among lupus patients. Vitamin D is recognized as a regulator of immune
      response. This study will explore the impact of vitamin D3 supplementation on IFN alpha
      expression in SLE patients.

      The study will last approximately 12 weeks and consist of three treatment groups: 1.)
      Participants will receive vitamin D3 2000 IU daily 2.) Participants will receive vitamin D3
      4000 IU daily 3.) Participants will receive a vitamin D3 placebo daily. There will be four
      study visits for each participant. Visits will occur at screening, study entry, and Weeks 6
      and 12. Physical examination, vital signs, and blood and urine tests will occur at all
      visits. For females of childbearing potential, a pregnancy test will be performed at
      screening and Week 6.

    <measure>qRT-PCR Fold Change in Ifit1 Gene Expression From Baseline to Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>0, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Ifit1 gene is one of three genes included in the definition of the alpha-interferon signature used for this study. This gene encodes an interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to measure gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained by blood draw. Gene expression is quantified as &quot;fold change&quot; relative to normal controls and is computed using a comparative CT (threshold cycle) method. A study hypothesis was that expression of alpha-interferon signature genes would decrease with increasing vitamin D levels. A decrease in gene expression from baseline to Week 12 is represented as a negative value (and vice versa).</description>

          <title>Modified SELENA-SLEDAI Score</title>
          <description>The modified Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment SLE Disease Activity Index (SELENA-SLEDAI) is calculated from 24 individual descriptors; scores may range from 0 (indicates inactive disease) to 105 (the maximum theoretical score). The SELENA-SLEDAI assesses disease activity for 10 days prior to and including the day of assessment. For this study, the SELENA-SLEDAI score was modified to include proteinuria defined by dipstick rather than 24 hour urine. A SELENA-SLEDAI score of 4 or less, indicative of stable disease, was a requirement to enter this study.</description>

        <title>Percent of Participants With IFN Alpha Signature at Week 6</title>
        <description>An Interferon (IFN) Alpha signature is defined as: expression of Mx1, Ifit1, or Ifi44 at a level greater than or equal to 4 standard deviations above the mean of a set of normal controls, or expression of 2 of the 3 genes at a level greater than or equal to 2 standard deviations above the mean of a set of normal controls. Gene expression was measured on peripheral blood samples using qRT-PCR. Missing data were assumed as signatures during calculation.</description>

        <title>qRT-PCR Fold Change in Ifit1 Gene Expression From Baseline to Week 12</title>
        <description>The Ifit1 gene is one of three genes included in the definition of the alpha-interferon signature used for this study. This gene encodes an interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to measure gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained by blood draw. Gene expression is quantified as “fold change” relative to normal controls and is computed using a comparative CT (threshold cycle) method. A study hypothesis was that expression of alpha-interferon signature genes would decrease with increasing vitamin D levels. A decrease in gene expression from baseline to Week 12 is represented as a negative value (and vice versa).</description>

        <title>qRT-PCR Fold Change in Ifi44 Gene Expression From Baseline to Week 6</title>
        <description>The Ifi44 gene is one of three genes included in the definition of the alpha-interferon signature used for this study. It encodes interferon-induced protein 44. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to measure gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained by blood draw. Gene expression is quantified as “fold change” relative to normal controls and is computed using a comparative CT (threshold cycle) method. A study hypothesis was that expression of alpha-interferon signature genes would decrease with increasing vitamin D levels. A decrease in gene expression from baseline to Week 6 is represented as a negative value (and vice versa).</description>

        <title>Change in Serum C3 Level From Baseline to Week 6</title>
        <description>C3 is a blood test that measures the activity of the complement component 3 (C3) protein. The normal C3 range is 75 to 135 mg/dL. Patients with active systemic lupus erythematosus may have a lower-than-normal level of C3. A decrease in C3 level over time may indicate disease activity. An increase in C3 from baseline to Week 6 is represented as a positive value (and vice versa).</description>

        <title>Change in Status for Anti-double-stranded DNA Autoantibody From Baseline to Week 6</title>
        <description>Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) may have autoantibodies (e.g., self against self) to double-stranded DNA. Double-stranded DNA is one of multiple diagnostic tests for SLE and levels may be associated with disease activity. A positive test for autoantibodies to double-stranded DNA is based on the normal range from the local laboratory. Change in status (+ or -) from baseline is evaluated.</description>

        <description>The modified Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment-Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) Disease Activity Index (SELENA-SLEDAI) score is a weighted scale score ranging from 0 to 105 based on the presence or absence of 24 manifestations of SLE. The SELENA-SLEDAI assesses disease activity for 10 days prior to and including the day of assessment. For this study, the SELENA-SLEDAI score was modified to include proteinuria defined by dipstick rather than 24 hour urine. Positive change in the SELENA-SLEDAI score indicate increased disease activity.</description>

        <title>Cardiorespiratory BILAG Status at Week 12</title>
        <description>The British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) assessment gives a grade for each of 9 body systems (e.g., domains). Grades reflect systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity as follows: A (severe), B (moderate), C (mild), D (inactive at present but previously affected), E (inactive and system never involved). To be randomized, subjects had to have mild or inactive disease (C,D,E) in all but the mucocutaneous system in which B(moderate) disease was also allowed. The percent of subjects experiencing A or B level activity at Week 12 is assessed for the “Cardiorespiratory-specific” body system.</description>

          <description>The British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) assessment gives a grade for each of 9 body systems (e.g., domains). Grades reflect systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity as follows: A (severe), B (moderate), C (mild), D (inactive at present but previously affected), E (inactive and system never involved). To be randomized, subjects had to have mild or inactive disease (C,D,E) in all but the mucocutaneous system in which B(moderate) disease was also allowed. The percent of subjects experiencing A or B level activity at Week 12 is assessed for the “Constitutional-specific” body system.</description>

        <title>Neuropsychiatric BILAG Status at Week 12</title>
        <description>The British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) assessment gives a grade for each of 9 body systems (e.g., domains). Grades reflect systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity as follows: A (severe), B (moderate), C (mild), D (inactive at present but previously affected), E (inactive and system never involved). To be randomized, subjects had to have mild or inactive disease (C,D,E) in all but the mucocutaneous system in which B(moderate) disease was also allowed. The percent of subjects experiencing A or B level activity at Week 12 is assessed for the “Neuropsychiatric-specific” body system.</description>
