        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men or women 18 years or older with diagnosis of type 1 or type 2 diabetes who have
             reported symmetrical painful symptoms in distal extremities for 1-5 years prior to the
             study and whose symptoms are attributable to sensorimotor diabetic peripheral
             neuropathy (DPN).

          -  Patients of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at
             screening/randomization, and must use medically acceptable methods of birth control.

          -  Patient has pain score of at least 4 on the 11-point Likert numerical rating scale at
             screening. Potential patients should not be informed of the pain intensity eligibility
             criterion prior to screening or randomization.

          -  Patient has a mean baseline week pain intensity of at least 4 on the 11-point Likert
             scale at the end of a one-week pre-treatment period and has completed at least 4 days
             of diary entries during the baseline week.

          -  Patient is on stable regimen of antidiabetes medication at screening that can be
             maintained during the study.

          -  Patient has hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ≤11% at screening.

          -  Patient has FPG ≤310 mg/dL at screening.

          -  Patient must have a minimum washout of greater than 5 times the half-life of the drug
             of any of several medications

          -  Patients currently treated with gabapentin or pregabalin at screening may be eligible
             for the study, but must have tapering period wherein the dose of gabapentin is reduced
             gradually over a period of at least 7 days plus a 2-day or 3-day washout of gabapentin
             or pregabalin, respectively, prior to start of the Baseline Week.

          -  Patient must have adequate eyesight to complete questions on the DiaryPro and SitePro.
             If a patient is unable to do so (for reasons other than severe eye disease) but a
             caregiver is available to complete these tasks following instruction from the patient,
             the caregiver may be trained to accomplish these tasks

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have previously not responded to treatment for DPN with gabapentin at
             doses of ≥1200 mg/day or pregabalin at doses ≥300 mg/day.

          -  Patients who previously experienced dose-limiting adverse effects that prevented
             titration of gabapentin to an effective dose.

          -  Patient has hypersensitivity to gabapentin.

          -  Patient is a nursing mother.

          -  Patient has used injected anesthetics or steroids within 30 days of baseline.

          -  Patient has certain conditions that could confound evaluation of painful DPN, in
             particular, amputations other than toes, non-diabetic neurologic disorders (e.g.
             phantom limb pain), and skin conditions affecting sensation in painful limbs.

          -  Patient has skin conditions in the area affected by the neuropathy that could alter
             sensation.

          -  Patient is in an immunocompromised state.

          -  Patient has an estimated creatinine clearance of &lt;60 ml/min calculated using the
             Cockroft Gault method (Appendix 3).

          -  Patient has had malignancy within past 2 years other than basal cell carcinoma.

          -  Patient has had gastric reduction surgery.

          -  Patient has severe chronic diarrhea, chronic constipation [unless attributed to drugs
             that will be washed out], uncontrolled irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or unexplained
             weight loss.

          -  Patient has any abnormal chemistry or hematology results that are deemed by the
             investigator to be clinically significant.

          -  Patient has a history of substance abuse within the past year.

          -  Patient has had 1 or more visits to an emergency room or hospital within the previous
             30 days due to hypoglycemia.

          -  Patient has a history of seizure (except for infantile febrile seizure) or is at risk
             of seizure due to head trauma.

          -  Patient has a history of pernicious anemia, untreated hypothyroidism, chronic
             hepatitis B or C, hepatitis within the past 3 months, or HIV infection.

          -  Patient has any other serious medical condition that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator would jeopardize the safety of the patient or affect the validity of the
             study results.

          -  Continuing use of any concomitant medication excluded by Inclusion Criterion 8.

          -  Patient has participated in a clinical trial of an investigational drug or device
             within 30 days of the screening visit
