    <time_frame>Up to 9 years</time_frame>
    <description>The SLICC/ACR Damage Index was assessed every 48 weeks and at the exit visit as a measure of disease activity. It was developed to assess the accumulated damage since the onset of the disease. The number of participants with worsening in their SLICC/ACR Damage Index score compared with Baseline have been presented. Worsening was defined as a change in score (post-Baseline visit score - Baseline score) &gt; 0. Baseline includes extension Year 1 Day 0 values for MITT participants treated with placebo in the parent study, and the last pre-treatment value in the parent study for MITT participants treated with Belimumab in the parent study. For years in which a participant was withdrawn from the study, the exit visit assessment was used in place of the Week 48 assessment for the year. This value was not carried forward through later years. Only those participants available at the specified time points (represented by n=X in the category titles) were analyzed.</description>

        <description>AE rates by SOC adjusting for participant-years on study drug anytime post Baseline are summarized, which included the follow up visits. Only treatment-emergent AEs are summarized. The event rate of an AE was calculated as the number of events per 100 participant years. Participant years were calculated as sum across all participants ([last visit of interval day - first visit of interval day + 1] divided by365). Participant years excluded between study gaps if participant had not started extension study on date of last visit of parent study.</description>

            <description>Participants received belimumab every 28 days by intravenous (IV) infusion at 1 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) or 10 mg/kg body weight. Participants who received either 1 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg belimumab in their parent studies continued to receive the same dose of belimumab. Participants randomized to receive placebo in the parent studies received 10 mg/kg beliumamb. Subsequently, the dose of belimumab for participants receiving 1 mg/kg was increased to 10 mg/kg .All participants also received SoC SLE therapy while participating in this trial.</description>

            <description>Participants received belimumab every 28 days by intravenous (IV) infusion at 1 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) or 10 mg/kg body weight. Participants who received either 1 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg belimumab in their parent studies continued to receive the same dose of belimumab. Participants randomized to receive placebo in the parent studies received 10 mg/kg beliumamb. Subsequently, the dose of belimumab for participants receiving 1 mg/kg was increased to 10 mg/kg .All participants also received SoC SLE therapy while participating in this trial.</description>

        <description>SAE rates by SOC adjusting for participants-years on study drug anytime post Baseline are summarized, which included the follow up visits. Only treatment-emergent SAEs are summarized. The event rate of an SAE was calculated as the number of events per 100 participant years. Participants years were calculated as = sum across all participants ([last visit of interval day - first visit of interval day + 1] divided by 365). Participants years excluded between study gaps if participant had not started extension study on date of last visit of parent study.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT) and Prothrombin Time (PT) at the Indicated Time Points</title>
        <description>Hematology parameters were assessed at Baseline, Week 4,12,24,36, and 48 during Year 1. From Year 2-9 hematology parameters were assessed at Week 24 and 48 ; Exit visit and at follow-up (up to 8 weeks post infusion). Change from Baseline in APTT and PT is summarized. The Baseline is defined as For Year 1, Day 0 values for MITT participants who were treated with placebo in the parent study, and the last pre-treatment value in the parent study for MITT participants who were treated with belimumab in the parent study. Change from Baseline is defined as the difference between the post-dose post-Baseline visit value and the Baseline value. Only those participants available at the specified time points (represented by n=X in the category titles) were analyzed. NA indicates standard deviation was not calculable for a single data point</description>

            <description>Participants received belimumab every 28 days by intravenous (IV) infusion at 1 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) or 10 mg/kg body weight. Participants who received either 1 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg belimumab in their parent studies continued to receive the same dose of belimumab. Participants randomized to receive placebo in the parent studies received 10 mg/kg beliumamb. Subsequently, the dose of belimumab for participants receiving 1 mg/kg was increased to 10 mg/kg .All participants also received SoC SLE therapy while participating in this trial.</description>

        <description>Hematology parameters were assessed at Baseline, Week 4,12,24,36, and 48 during Year 1. From Year 2-9 hematology parameters were assessed at Week 24 and 48 ; Exit visit and at follow-up (up to 8 weeks post infusion). Change from Baseline in Plt, Lymp, Leu, Eos, Baso, Mono, Neu, NeuBF, and NueS are summarized. The Baseline is defined as For Year 1, Day 0 values for MITT participants who were treated with placebo in the parent study, and the last pre-treatment value in the parent study for MITT participants who were treated with belimumab in the parent study. Change from Baseline is defined as the difference between the post-dose post-Baseline visit value and the Baseline value. Only those participants available at the specified time points (represented by n=X in the category titles) were analyzed. NA indicates standard deviation was not calculable for a single data point.</description>

            <description>Participants received belimumab every 28 days by intravenous (IV) infusion at 1 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) or 10 mg/kg body weight. Participants who received either 1 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg belimumab in their parent studies continued to receive the same dose of belimumab. Participants randomized to receive placebo in the parent studies received 10 mg/kg beliumamb. Subsequently, the dose of belimumab for participants receiving 1 mg/kg was increased to 10 mg/kg .All participants also received SoC SLE therapy while participating in this trial.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Hemoglobin (Hg) at the Indicated Time Points</title>
        <description>Hematology parameters were assessed at Baseline, Week 4,12,24,36, and 48 during Year 1. From Year 2-9 hematology parameters were assessed at Week 24 and 48 ; Exit visit and at follow-up (up to 8 weeks post infusion). Change from Baseline in Hg is summarized. The Baseline is defined as For Year 1, Day 0 values for MITT participants who were treated with placebo in the parent study, and the last pre-treatment value in the parent study for MITT participants who were treated with belimumab in the parent study. Change from Baseline is defined as the difference between the post-dose post-Baseline visit value and the Baseline value. Only those participants available at the specified time points (represented by n=X in the category titles) were analyzed. NA indicates standard deviation was not calculable for a single data point.</description>

            <description>Participants received belimumab every 28 days by intravenous (IV) infusion at 1 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) or 10 mg/kg body weight. Participants who received either 1 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg belimumab in their parent studies continued to receive the same dose of belimumab. Participants randomized to receive placebo in the parent studies received 10 mg/kg beliumamb. Subsequently, the dose of belimumab for participants receiving 1 mg/kg was increased to 10 mg/kg .All participants also received SoC SLE therapy while participating in this trial.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Hematocrit at the Indicated Time Points</title>
        <description>Hematology parameters were assessed at Baseline, Week 4,12,24,36, and 48 during Year 1. From Year 2-9 hematology parameters were assessed at Week 24 and 48 ; Exit visit and at follow-up (up to 8 weeks). Change from Baseline in Hematocrit is summarized. The Baseline is defined as For Year 1, Day 0 values for MITT participants who were treated with placebo in the parent study, and the last pre-treatment value in the parent study for MITT participants who were treated with belimumab in the parent study. Change from Baseline is defined as the difference between the post-dose post-Baseline visit value and the Baseline value. Only those participants available at the specified time points (represented by n=X in the category titles) were analyzed. NA indicates standard deviation was not calculable for a single data point.</description>

            <description>Participants received belimumab every 28 days by intravenous (IV) infusion at 1 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) or 10 mg/kg body weight. Participants who received either 1 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg belimumab in their parent studies continued to receive the same dose of belimumab. Participants randomized to receive placebo in the parent studies received 10 mg/kg beliumamb. Subsequently, the dose of belimumab for participants receiving 1 mg/kg was increased to 10 mg/kg .All participants also received SoC SLE therapy while participating in this trial.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Erythrocytes (Eryth) at the Indicated Time Points</title>
        <description>Hematology parameters were assessed at Baseline, Week 4,12,24,36, and 48 during Year 1. From Year 2-9 hematology parameters were assessed at Week 24 and 48 ; Exit visit and at follow-up (up to 8 weeks post infusion). Change from Baseline in Erythrocytes is summarized. The Baseline is defined as For Year 1, Day 0 values for MITT participants who were treated with placebo in the parent study, and the last pre-treatment value in the parent study for MITT participants who were treated with belimumab in the parent study. Change from Baseline is defined as the difference between the post-dose post-Baseline visit value and the Baseline value. Only those participants available at the specified time points (represented by n=X in the category titles) were analyzed. NA indicates standard deviation was not calculable for a single data point.</description>

            <description>Participants received belimumab every 28 days by intravenous (IV) infusion at 1 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) or 10 mg/kg body weight. Participants who received either 1 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg belimumab in their parent studies continued to receive the same dose of belimumab. Participants randomized to receive placebo in the parent studies received 10 mg/kg beliumamb. Subsequently, the dose of belimumab for participants receiving 1 mg/kg was increased to 10 mg/kg .All participants also received SoC SLE therapy while participating in this trial.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Calcium (Ca), Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Chloride, Magnesium (Mg), Phosphate (Phos), Potassium (K), Sodium (Na) at the Indicated Time Points</title>
        <description>Electrolytes parameters were assessed at Baseline, Week 4,12,24,36, and 48 during Year 1. From Year 2-9 electrolytes parameters were assessed at Week 24 and 48 ; Exit visit and at follow-up (up to 8 weeks post infusion). Change from Baseline in Ca,CO2, Chloride, Mg, Phos, K and Na were summarized. The Baseline is defined as For Year 1, Day 0 values for MITT participants who were treated with placebo in the parent study, and the last pre-treatment value in the parent study for MITT participants who were treated with belimumab in the parent study. Change from Baseline is defined as the difference between the post-dose post-Baseline visit value and the Baseline value. Only those participants available at the specified time points (represented by n=X in the category titles) were analyzed. NA indicates standard deviation was not calculable for a single data point.</description>

            <description>Participants received belimumab every 28 days by intravenous (IV) infusion at 1 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) or 10 mg/kg body weight. Participants who received either 1 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg belimumab in their parent studies continued to receive the same dose of belimumab. Participants randomized to receive placebo in the parent studies received 10 mg/kg beliumamb. Subsequently, the dose of belimumab for participants receiving 1 mg/kg was increased to 10 mg/kg .All participants also received SoC SLE therapy while participating in this trial.</description>

        <description>Other chemistries parameters were assessed at Baseline, Week 4,12,24,36, and 48 during Year 1. From Year 2-9 other chemistries parameters were assessed at Week 24 and 48 ; Exit visit and at follow-up (up to 8 weeks post infusion). Change from Baseline in BUN/Cr is summarized. The Baseline is defined as For Year 1, Day 0 values for MITT participants who were treated with placebo in the parent study, and the last pre-treatment value in the parent study for MITT participants who were treated with belimumab in the parent study. Change from Baseline is defined as the difference between the post-dose post-Baseline visit value and the Baseline value. Only those participants available at the specified time points (represented by n=X in the category titles) were analyzed.</description>

Participants who received either 1 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg belimumab in their parent studies continued to receive the same dose of belimumab. Participants randomized to receive placebo in the parent studies received 10 mg/kg beliumamb. Subsequently, the dose of belimumab for participants receiving 1 mg/kg was increased to 10 mg/kg .All participants also received SoC SLE therapy while participating in this trial.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Albumin (Alb) and Protein (Pro) at the Indicated Time Points</title>
        <description>Other chemistries parameters were assessed at Baseline, Week 4,12,24,36, and 48 during Year 1. From Year 2-9 other chemistries parameters were assessed at Week 24 and 48 ; Exit visit and at follow-up (up to 8 weeks post infusion). Change from Baseline in Alb and Protein were summarized. The Baseline is defined as For Year 1, Day 0 values for MITT participants who were treated with placebo in the parent study, and the last pre-treatment value in the parent study for MITT participants who were treated with belimumab in the parent study. Change from Baseline is defined as the difference between the post-dose post-Baseline visit value and the Baseline value. Only those participants available at the specified time points (represented by n=X in the category titles) were analyzed. NA indicates standard deviation was not calculable for a single data point.</description>

            <description>Participants received belimumab every 28 days by intravenous (IV) infusion at 1 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) or 10 mg/kg body weight. Participants who received either 1 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg belimumab in their parent studies continued to receive the same dose of belimumab. Participants randomized to receive placebo in the parent studies received 10 mg/kg beliumamb. Subsequently, the dose of belimumab for participants receiving 1 mg/kg was increased to 10 mg/kg .All participants also received SoC SLE therapy while participating in this trial.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in BUN and Glucose at the Indicated Time Points</title>
        <description>Other chemistries parameters were assessed at Baseline, Week 4,12,24,36, and 48 during Year 1. From Year 2-9 other chemistries were assessed at Week 24 and 48 ; Exit visit and at follow-up (up to 8 weeks post infusion). Change from Baseline in BUN and Glucose were summarized. The Baseline is defined as For Year 1, Day 0 values for MITT participants who were treated with placebo in the parent study, and the last pre-treatment value in the parent study for MITT participants who were treated with belimumab in the parent study. Change from Baseline is defined as the difference between the post-dose post-Baseline visit value and the Baseline value. Only those participants available at the specified time points (represented by n=X in the category titles) were analyzed. NA indicates standard deviation was not calculable for a single data point.</description>

            <description>Participants received belimumab every 28 days by intravenous (IV) infusion at 1 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) or 10 mg/kg body weight. Participants who received either 1 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg belimumab in their parent studies continued to receive the same dose of belimumab. Participants randomized to receive placebo in the parent studies received 10 mg/kg beliumamb. Subsequently, the dose of belimumab for participants receiving 1 mg/kg was increased to 10 mg/kg .All participants also received SoC SLE therapy while participating in this trial.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in BUN and Glucose at the Indicated Time Points</title>
          <description>Other chemistries parameters were assessed at Baseline, Week 4,12,24,36, and 48 during Year 1. From Year 2-9 other chemistries were assessed at Week 24 and 48 ; Exit visit and at follow-up (up to 8 weeks post infusion). Change from Baseline in BUN and Glucose were summarized. The Baseline is defined as For Year 1, Day 0 values for MITT participants who were treated with placebo in the parent study, and the last pre-treatment value in the parent study for MITT participants who were treated with belimumab in the parent study. Change from Baseline is defined as the difference between the post-dose post-Baseline visit value and the Baseline value. Only those participants available at the specified time points (represented by n=X in the category titles) were analyzed. NA indicates standard deviation was not calculable for a single data point.</description>

        <description>Other chemistries parameters were assessed at Baseline, Week 4,12,24,36, and 48 during Year 1. From Year 2-9 other chemistries were assessed at Week 24 and 48 ; Exit visit and at follow-up (up to 8 weeks post infusion). Change from Baseline in Cr and Urate were summarized. The Baseline is defined as For Year 1, Day 0 values for MITT participants who were treated with placebo in the parent study, and the last pre-treatment value in the parent study for MITT participants who were treated with belimumab in the parent study. Change from Baseline is defined as the difference between the post-dose post-Baseline visit value and the Baseline value. Only those participants available at the specified time points (represented by n=X in the category titles) were analyzed. NA indicates standard deviation was not calculable for a single data point.</description>

            <description>Participants received belimumab every 28 days by intravenous (IV) infusion at 1 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) or 10 mg/kg body weight. Participants who received either 1 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg belimumab in their parent studies continued to receive the same dose of belimumab. Participants randomized to receive placebo in the parent studies received 10 mg/kg beliumamb. Subsequently, the dose of belimumab for participants receiving 1 mg/kg was increased to 10 mg/kg .All participants also received SoC SLE therapy while participating in this trial.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT), Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP), Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST), Gamma-glutamyl Transferase (GGT) and Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) Levels</title>
        <description>Liver function parameters were assessed at Baseline, Week 4,12,24,36, and 48 during Year 1. From Year 2-9 liver function parameters were assessed at Week 24 and 48 ; Exit visit and at follow-up (up to 8 weeks post infusion). Change from Baseline in ALT, ALP, AST, GGT and LDH were summarized. The Baseline is defined as For Year 1, Day 0 values for MITT participants who were treated with placebo in the parent study, and the last pre-treatment value in the parent study for MITT participants who were treated with belimumab in the parent study. Change from Baseline is defined as the difference between the post-dose post-Baseline visit value and the Baseline value. Only those participants available at the specified time points (represented by n=X in the category titles) were analyzed.NA indicates standard deviation was not calculable for a single data point.</description>

            <description>Participants received belimumab every 28 days by intravenous (IV) infusion at 1 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) or 10 mg/kg body weight. Participants who received either 1 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg belimumab in their parent studies continued to receive the same dose of belimumab. Participants randomized to receive placebo in the parent studies received 10 mg/kg beliumamb. Subsequently, the dose of belimumab for participants receiving 1 mg/kg was increased to 10 mg/kg .All participants also received SoC SLE therapy while participating in this trial.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Bilirubin (Bili) Levels</title>
        <description>Liver function parameters were assessed at Baseline, Week 4,12,24,36, and 48 during Year 1. From Year 2-9 liver function parameters were assessed at Week 24 and 48 ; Exit visit and at follow-up (up to 8 weeks post infusion). Change from Baseline in Bili were summarized. The Baseline is defined as For Year 1, Day 0 values for MITT participants who were treated with placebo in the parent study, and the last pre-treatment value in the parent study for MITT participants who were treated with belimumab in the parent study. Change from Baseline is defined as the difference between the post-dose post-Baseline visit value and the Baseline value. Only those participants available at the specified time points (represented by n=X in the category titles) were analyzed. NA indicates standard deviation was not calculable for a single data point.</description>

            <description>Participants received belimumab every 28 days by intravenous (IV) infusion at 1 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) or 10 mg/kg body weight. Participants who received either 1 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg belimumab in their parent studies continued to receive the same dose of belimumab. Participants randomized to receive placebo in the parent studies received 10 mg/kg beliumamb. Subsequently, the dose of belimumab for participants receiving 1 mg/kg was increased to 10 mg/kg .All participants also received SoC SLE therapy while participating in this trial.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Immunoglobulin G (IgG) Levels</title>
        <description>Immunoglobulin (Ig) parameters were assessed at Baseline, Week 4,12,24,36, and 48 during Year 1. From Year 2-9 Ig parameters were assessed at Week 24 and 48 ; Exit visit and at follow-up (up to 8 weeks post infusion). Change from Baseline in Ig G were summarized. The Baseline is defined as For Year 1, Day 0 values for MITT participants who were treated with placebo in the parent study, and the last pre-treatment value in the parent study for MITT participants who were treated with belimumab in the parent study. Change from Baseline is defined as the difference between the post-dose post-Baseline visit value and the Baseline value. Only those participants available at the specified time points (represented by n=X in the category titles) were analyzed. NA indicates standard deviation was not calculable for a single data point.</description>

            <description>Participants received belimumab every 28 days by intravenous (IV) infusion at 1 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) or 10 mg/kg body weight. Participants who received either 1 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg belimumab in their parent studies continued to receive the same dose of belimumab. Participants randomized to receive placebo in the parent studies received 10 mg/kg beliumamb. Subsequently, the dose of belimumab for participants receiving 1 mg/kg was increased to 10 mg/kg .All participants also received SoC SLE therapy while participating in this trial.</description>

        <description>Immunogenic response was analyzed using serum samples for anti-belimumab antibody measurements in MITT population. Categories of response are Negative, Transient Positive (+) means single + response that does not occur at the final assessment, and Persistent + means + response that occurs at least 2 consecutive assessments or a single result at the final assessment. Only those participants available at the specified time points (represented by n=X in the category titles) were analyzed.</description>

            <description>Participants received belimumab every 28 days by intravenous (IV) infusion at 1 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) or 10 mg/kg body weight. Participants who received either 1 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg belimumab in their parent studies continued to receive the same dose of belimumab. Participants randomized to receive placebo in the parent studies received 10 mg/kg beliumamb. Subsequently, the dose of belimumab for participants receiving 1 mg/kg was increased to 10 mg/kg .All participants also received SoC SLE therapy while participating in this trial.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With IgG Values Below the Lower Limit of Normal by Year</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected to evaluate IgG levels at Baseline and at Weeks 12, 24 and 48 during Year 1. From Year 2-9, IgG was evaluated at Week 24 and 48 ; Exit visit and at follow-up visit (up to 8 weeks post last infusion). Number of participants with IgG immunoglobulin values below the LLN at each one year interval are presented. Baseline includes Extension Year 1 Day 0 values for MITT participants treated with placebo in the parent study, and the last pre-treatment value in the parent study for MITT participants treated with Belimumab in the parent study. If a participant had more than one response within a year, then the last response within the year interval (usually the Week 48 assessment) was summarized. Only those participants available at the specified time points (represented by n=X in the category titles) were analyzed.</description>

            <description>Participants received belimumab every 28 days by intravenous (IV) infusion at 1 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) or 10 mg/kg body weight. Participants who received either 1 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg belimumab in their parent studies continued to receive the same dose of belimumab. Participants randomized to receive placebo in the parent studies received 10 mg/kg beliumamb. Subsequently, the dose of belimumab for participants receiving 1 mg/kg was increased to 10 mg/kg .All participants also received SoC SLE therapy while participating in this trial.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With IgG Values Below the Lower Limit of Normal by Year</title>
          <description>Blood samples were collected to evaluate IgG levels at Baseline and at Weeks 12, 24 and 48 during Year 1. From Year 2-9, IgG was evaluated at Week 24 and 48 ; Exit visit and at follow-up visit (up to 8 weeks post last infusion). Number of participants with IgG immunoglobulin values below the LLN at each one year interval are presented. Baseline includes Extension Year 1 Day 0 values for MITT participants treated with placebo in the parent study, and the last pre-treatment value in the parent study for MITT participants treated with Belimumab in the parent study. If a participant had more than one response within a year, then the last response within the year interval (usually the Week 48 assessment) was summarized. Only those participants available at the specified time points (represented by n=X in the category titles) were analyzed.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Any SLICC/ ACR Damage Index Worsening (Change &gt; 0) From Baseline by Visit</title>
        <description>The SLICC/ACR Damage Index was assessed every 48 weeks and at the exit visit as a measure of disease activity. It was developed to assess the accumulated damage since the onset of the disease. The number of participants with worsening in their SLICC/ACR Damage Index score compared with Baseline have been presented. Worsening was defined as a change in score (post-Baseline visit score – Baseline score) &gt; 0. Baseline includes extension Year 1 Day 0 values for MITT participants treated with placebo in the parent study, and the last pre-treatment value in the parent study for MITT participants treated with Belimumab in the parent study. For years in which a participant was withdrawn from the study, the exit visit assessment was used in place of the Week 48 assessment for the year. This value was not carried forward through later years. Only those participants available at the specified time points (represented by n=X in the category titles) were analyzed.</description>

            <description>Participants received belimumab every 28 days by intravenous (IV) infusion at 1 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) or 10 mg/kg body weight. Participants who received either 1 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg belimumab in their parent studies continued to receive the same dose of belimumab. Participants randomized to receive placebo in the parent studies received 10 mg/kg beliumamb. Subsequently, the dose of belimumab for participants receiving 1 mg/kg was increased to 10 mg/kg .All participants also received SoC SLE therapy while participating in this trial.</description>

          <description>Participants received belimumab every 28 days by intravenous (IV) infusion at 1 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) or 10 mg/kg body weight. Participants who received either 1 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg belimumab in their parent studies continued to receive the same dose of belimumab. Participants randomized to receive placebo in the parent studies received 10 mg/kg beliumamb. Subsequently, the dose of belimumab for participants receiving 1 mg/kg was increased to 10 mg/kg .All participants also received SoC SLE therapy while participating in this trial.</description>
