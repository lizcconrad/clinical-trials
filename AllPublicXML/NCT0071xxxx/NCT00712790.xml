    <textblock>
      This Phase I/II trial will evaluate the safety and activity of chemo-radiotherapy comprising
      a regimen of Sorafenib chemotherapy plus SIR-Spheres yttrium-90 microspheres
      (chemo-radiotherapy, also known as &quot;chemo-SIRT&quot;), for first-line treatment of patients with
      primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in whom surgical resection is not feasible.

      This study is designed as a prelude to a planned future randomised comparative study that
      will compare the efficacy of Sorafenib plus SIR-Spheres versus Sorafenib alone, in this
      patient population.

          -  Haemoglobin &gt; 9.5 g/dL

          -  Total bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dL (SIR-Spheres should not be administered as a whole liver

          -  Creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL

          -  The blood results must be less than 29 days old at the time of confirming patient
             eligibility to receive protocol treatment.

             a patient who has OKUDA I or II inoperable HCC.

          -  Suitable for protocol treatment as determined by clinical assessment undertaken by the
             Investigator.

          -  Female patients must be either postmenopausal or, if premenopausal, must have a
             negative pregnancy test and agree to use two forms of contraception if sexually active
             during their study participation.

          -  Male patients must be surgically sterile, or if sexually active and having a
             pre-menopausal female partner then must be using an acceptable form of contraception.

          -  Hepatic arterial anatomy suitable for implantation of SIR-Spheres, as assessed by
             hepatic angiogram.

          -  Lung shunt fraction less than or equal to 20% as assessed by a Tc-99m macroaggregated
             albumin liver to lung breakthrough scan.

          -  Any ascites or other clinical signs of liver failure, on physical examination.

          -  Abnormal synthetic and excretory liver function tests (LFTs) as determined by serum

          -  Tumours amenable to surgical resection for cure at presentation.

          -  Greater than 20% lung shunting of the hepatic artery blood flow determined by Tc-99
             MAA scan.

          -  Pre-assessment angiogram and Tc-99 MAA scan that demonstrates significant and
             uncorrectable activity in the stomach, pancreas or bowel.

          -  Been treated with Capecitabine within the previous 8 weeks, or who will be treated
             with Capecitabine within 8 weeks of treatment with SIR-Spheres, due to the possible
             risk of potentiating or causing liver dysfunction.

          -  Subjects who have had hepatic artery directed therapy.

             been disease-free for at least five years.

          -  Presence of clinical signs of CNS metastases due to their poor prognosis and because
             progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound the evaluation of neurologic and

             infection (except viral hepatitis), symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable
             angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that
             would limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  Any of the following contraindications to angiography and selective visceral
             catheterization:

               -  Bleeding diathesis, not correctable by the standard forms of therapy.

               -  Severe peripheral vascular disease that would preclude arterial catheterization.

             (non English-speaking patients may use an interpreter).

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant or currently breastfeeding.

          -  For female subjects, unless postmenopausal or surgically sterile, unwillingness to
             practice effective contraception, as defined by the Investigator, during the study.
             The rhythm method is not to be used as the sole method of contraception.

          -  For male subjects, unwillingness to practice effective contraception (as defined by
             the Investigator) while taking part in this study, because the effect of the
             SIR-Spheres treatment on sperm or upon the development of an unborn child are unknown.

          -  Current enrolment in any other investigational drug or device study.
