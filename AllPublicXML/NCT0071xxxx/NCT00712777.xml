  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Topical brimonidine is a recently introduced alpha 2 receptor agonist which is used in the
      therapy of intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction in patients with open angle glaucoma.
      Although adequate IOP reduction is achieved in many patients there is a considerable degree
      of variability in IOP reduction among subjects. The reason for this interindividual
      variability is not entirely clear. Obviously differences in pharmacokinetic properties due to
      variable penetration of the drug through the cornea may be responsible. Alternatively,
      polymorphisms of the alpha-2 receptor may account for the differences in IOP-lowering
      efficacy of topical brimonidine. This hypothesis is tested in the present study.
      Polymorphisms of the alpha-2 receptor have been described in a number of previous studies. In
      addition, polymorphisms in the alpha-2 receptor gene have been shown to be functionally
      important, particularly a polymorphism of the alpha-2B receptor, which has a high allele
      frequency in caucasians.
