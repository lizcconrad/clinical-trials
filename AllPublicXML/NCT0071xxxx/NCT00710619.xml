    <textblock>
      This study is conducted in the United States of America (USA). The aim of this study is to
      investigate the at-home-administration of bypassing agents for treatment of bleeding episodes
      in patients with congenital haemophilia with inhibitors to factors VIII and IX. We are
      further investigating how bleeding episodes affect the quality of life of the patient and
      their family or caregivers.
