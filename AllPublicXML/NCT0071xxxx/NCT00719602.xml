  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than 1.5 million deaths of African children under 5 years of age have been due to
      Plasmodium falciparum malaria. When HIV and malaria are present as coinfections, they enhance
      each other's progression. The primary purpose of this study is to compare the malarial
      infection levels in HIV-infected infants and children receiving protease inhibitor (PI)- or
      non-nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based highly active antiretroviral
      therapy (HAART).

      The World Health Organization (WHO) reports 1 to 2 million malaria deaths annually, with most
      malaria-related deaths occurring in children. The malaria burden is compounded by the HIV
      epidemic, which is most prevalent in areas endemic for malaria, notably Sub-Saharan Africa
      where nine in ten children younger than 15 years of age are infected with HIV. The purpose of
      this study is to compare parasitemia levels in HIV-infected infants and children receiving
      PI- or NNRTI-based HAART regimens.

      This study will enroll a total of 140 participants, 35 from each of the 4 groups in IMPAACT
      P1060.

      This substudy will last until 24 weeks after the last P1060 enrollment or until P1060 study
      discontinuation. Participants must meet enrollment criteria for P1060 as well as additional
      criteria for this study. Study visits will occur as a part of P1060 study visits, all of
      which include a physical exam, blood collection, and assessments of HIV-related symptoms.

      Participants are also encouraged to return to the primary clinic site for intercurrent
      illness visits for assessment, thick and thin blood smear, and filter paper blood collection,
      however these visits are not mandatory for study participation.
