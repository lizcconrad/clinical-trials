      The primary objective of this study is to test the feasibility of a large-scale clinical
      trial of once-daily prophylaxis. The secondary objectives are to collect clinical efficacy
      outcomes so that we can better plan a large-scale study; we will estimate the effect size and
      variability of effect and resource utilization of once-daily prophylaxis to allow us to set a
      sample size for a definitive trial.

    <textblock>
      Hemophilia is an important and costly disorder; if left untreated, it may have serious
      consequences. The greatest impact of hemophilia occurs from recurrent bleeding into joints.
      The consequences of joint bleeding include pain associated with acute bleeding and later
      chronic arthropathy. Half of affected children with severe hemophilia have joint damage;
      joint damage is more frequent with increased bleeding. The prevention and treatment of
      bleeding is very expensive and therefore finding a cost-effective treatment is of high
      priority.

      Worldwide, two major treatment strategies have been used to prevent arthropathy - on demand
      therapy and factor prophylaxis. The goal of prophylaxis is to convert the severe to the
      moderate phenotype by providing circulating factor activity of greater than 1%. Patients with
      greater than 1% circulating factor VIII activity rarely have spontaneous hemarthroses.
      Therefore, the goal of providing circulating factor at this level is to eliminate spontaneous
      hemarthroses. The term primary prophylaxis suggests using preventative factor VIII
      replacement from a very early age. The term secondary prophylaxis is used to describe the
      application of prophylaxis at a later disease stage. In this study, secondary prophylaxis
      will be used.

      Once-daily prophylaxis is a novel application of hemophilia factor prophylaxis for youth and
      young adults. Before embarking on a costly definitive trial we feel that it is necessary to
      demonstrate that subjects will be willing to enroll and will be compliant with the therapy.
      Moreover, we need to establish an estimate of the effect of once-daily prophylaxis on
      bleeding rates, quality of life, and joint damage progression in order to design a definitive
      trial.
