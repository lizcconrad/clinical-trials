  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the reliability of a procedure for self-administering ethanol (alcohol)
      intravenously (through a vein), using a computer-assisted method. People ordinarily
      self-administer alcohol through drinking alcoholic beverages, but blood alcohol levels
      resulting from drinking vary greatly among individuals. For research on alcohol dependence
      and treatment, a tool for achieving precise blood levels is needed. In addition to testing
      this method of alcohol administration, the study will examine self-administration behavior
      and resulting breath alcohol concentration, the effects of alcohol on the participants, and
      differences between men and women in alcohol self-administration.

      Healthy normal volunteers between 21 and 45 years of age may be eligible for this study.
      Participants are assigned to one of two study groups. Group 1 undergoes three 7-hour study
      sessions and group 2 participates in two sessions, each of which includes the following
      procedures:

        -  Breathalyzer and urine tests for alcohol and illicit drug use.

        -  Urine pregnancy test for women.

        -  Light lunch.

        -  Questionnaire about health and recent drinking.

      Alcohol infusion: Subjects are seated in a comfortable chair and instructed on how to use a
      computer to give themselves a short infusion of alcohol through a catheter (plastic tube)
      that has been inserted into a vein in their the arm. Sensors are placed on their chest to
      monitor heart beat and their neck to record skin blood flow. At the start of the session,
      subjects complete questionnaires about any drug effects and urges to drink they may be
      feeling. They are trained on how to use the computer to administer alcohol and are then
      allowed to self-administer alcohol through the catheter any time they like, as long as their
      peak breath alcohol level does not exceed 0.1 g% (a level that would result from ingestion of
      4 to 6 drinks in most people). If that point is reached, the computer automatically
      inactivates self-administration until the level is lowered again. Breathalyzer readings are
      taken every 15 to 30 minutes. Subjects may read, watch television or videos or listen to
      music during the sessions.

      Recovery: At the end of the 2.5 hours of self-administration, the catheter is removed and
      subjects can eat, read, watch television and relax in the clinic until their breath alcohol
      level falls below 0.02 g%, usually after 2.5 to 3 hours, when they can go home by taxi or
      with a pre-arranged designated driver.

      Objective: The goal of this project is to characterize the computer-assisted
      self-administration of ethanol (CASE) paradigm by assessing intravenous (IV) alcohol
      self-administration behavior and the resulting breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) exposure
      and pharmacologic responses in healthy non-dependent participants. The study will also
      evaluate the test-retest reliability of alcohol self-administration and examine the influence
      of sex and recent drinking history, as well as the effect of acute stress cues on alcohol
      self-administration.

      Study population: Participants will be 21-60 year-old male and female social drinkers and
      binge drinkers in good health, as determined by medical history, physical exam, ECG and lab
      tests. Participants with Axis-I psychiatric illness including alcohol or substance dependence
      will be excluded.

      Design: The CASE system utilizes a model-based algorithm based on previously published
      methods to achieve and maintain pre-determined BrACs using IV alcohol infusions. The CASE
      system provides flexibility to participants in choosing when to push a button to receive
      alcohol, as well as flexibility to investigators in controlling the subsequent BrAC exposure.
      The CASE system allows the investigator to specify and assure the same BrAC increment across
      all participants, and is set up to prevent the BrAC from exceeding any pre-set upper limit
      (e.g., 100 mg%).

      Following screening, participants will undergo IV ethanol self-administration sessions.
      Participants will be enrolled in four groups: Group 1 will consist of the first 10
      participants who will participate in 3 self-administration sessions (a training session
      followed by 2 test sessions) to assess the test-retest reliability of alcohol
      self-administration behavior. Group 2 will consist of 50 participants, who will each
      participate in 2 self-administration sessions (a training session followed by a test
      session). During each session, participants will first undergo a directed priming period,
      lasting 25 min, where they will be prompted to push a button to receive small standardized
      alcohol infusions. This will be followed by an ad-lib period, lasting up to 2 hrs, where they
      will have free access to standardized IV alcohol infusions. During the session, BrAC will be
      measured, heart-rate and skin blood flow will be continuously recorded, and subjective
      perceptions of alcohol effects and urges will be assessed. Group 3 will consist of 15
      participants, who will undergo two identical progressive work self-administration sessions
      for evaluation of test-retest reliability. During each progressive ratio (PR) schedule
      session, participants will be required to push the button progressively higher number of
      times for each subsequent alcohol infusion over a 2.5 hr period. Group 4 will consist of 100
      participants, who will each participate in 2 sessions: one ad lib self-administration session
      and one PR schedule self-administration session. Group 5 will consist of 40 participants, who
      will undergo a baseline self-administration session followed by an interview session for
      construction of guided imagery scripts. Following this, participants will undergo three
      alcohol self-administration sessions, following exposure to personalized stress-, alcohol- or
      neutral-condition associated scripts, presented in randomized order on separate days.

      Outcome measures: The primary endpoint is the BrAC exposure (highest BrAC, average BrAC,
      area-under-the-BrAC-time-curve) achieved during the self-administration session.
      Additionally, changes in subjective perceptions of alcohol effects, as well as changes in
      heart rate will be evaluated. The influence of sex and recent drinking history as well as
      genetic polymorphisms on the self-administration of alcohol will also be examined.
      Furthermore, individual-specific cellular responses to alcohol exposure will be examined
      using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from participants selected based on genotypic
      and phenotypic variation in self-administration measures. Outcome measures for group 5 will
      include stress and alcohol cue-induced craving and self-administration.

      The CASE paradigm can be a valuable tool for evaluating determinants that may underlie
      self-administration behavior in humans. The effect of pharmacological agents on alcohol
      self-administration can be evaluated as a marker of the clinical effectiveness of these
      agents in the treatment of alcohol-dependence.

         11. &lt;TAB&gt;Use of prescription or OTC medications known to interact with alcohol within 2
             weeks of the study. These include, but may not be limited to: isosorbide,
             nitroglycerine, benzodiazepines, warfarin, anti-depressants such as amitriptyline,
             clomipramine and nefazodone, anti-diabetes medications such as glyburide, metformin
             and tolbutamide, H2-antagonists for heartburn such as cimetidine and ranitidine,
             muscle relaxants, anti-epileptics including phenytoin and phenobarbital codeine, and
             narcotics including propoxyphene, oxycodone and hydrocodone. Drugs known to inhibit or
             induce enzymes that metabolize alcohol should not be used for 4 weeks prior to the
             study. These include chlorzoxazone, isoniazid, metronidazole and disulfiram.
             Cough-and-cold preparations which contain anti-histamines, pain medicines and
             anti-inflammatories such as aspirin, ibuprofen, acetaminophen, celecoxib and naproxen,

             irregularities caused by hormonal contraception, as defined by irregularities in
             menstrual cycle length (cycles of &gt;36 days or &lt; 8 cycles per year), clinically
             significant menstrual periods that are heavier or lighter than usual, and/or
             accompanied by significant pain, cramping or nausea and vomiting that requires
             intervention.

        GROUP 6

        Group 6 will include heavy drinkers between the ages of 21 and 60 years, in good health.
        Unfortunately, heavy drinking does not have a universally agreed upon definition and the
        criteria used to define heavy drinking vary from study to study. There is evidence that
        incorporating both amount of alcohol consumed per occasion and amount of alcohol consumed
        per week is relevant to account for risk related to pattern of drinking and total
        consumption. Therefore in our study we will select heavy drinkers using a definition that
        takes into account both pattern of drinking and total consumption. For pattern of drinking,
        we will require our subjects to have on average at least one binge drinking day per week,
        using the NIAAA definition of 5 or more drinks for men and 4 or more drinks for women
        (NIAAA website). For total consumption, we will use an average of 15 or more drinks per
        week for women and 22 or more drinks per week for men as this level of drinking has been
        shown to confer increased risk of mortality.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. &lt;TAB&gt;Male and female participants between 21-60 years of age.

          2. &lt;TAB&gt;Male participants must have consumed an average of 22 or more standard drinks per
             week and females must have consumed an average of 15 or more standard drinks per week
             during the past 90 days. Average number of drinks per week will be calculated based on
             total number of drinks as measured by the timeline followback (TLFB) (e.g. for 90 days
             worth of data, total drinks divided by 90 and then multiplied by 7 will be the average
             number of drinks per week).

          3. &lt;TAB&gt;Participants must have on average at least 1 binge drinking day per week during
             the last 90 days, defined as a day in which 4 or more standard drinks were consumed
             for females and 5 or more standard drinks were consumed for males. Average number of
             binge drinking days will be calculated based on total number of binge drinking days
             from the TLFB (e.g. for 90 days worth of data, participants with a total of 13 or more
             binge drinking days will be eligible).

          4. &lt;TAB&gt;Participants must be able and willing to refrain from consuming alcohol 24 hours
             prior to each alcohol self-administration session. Participants that arrive after
             consuming alcohol less than equal to 24 hours prior to a self-administration study
             visit on more than 1 occasion will be withdrawn from the study.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. &lt;TAB&gt;Current or prior history of serious medical illness, including CNS,
             cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, endocrine, or
             reproductive disorders.

          2. &lt;TAB&gt;Positive hepatitis or HIV test at screening.

          3. &lt;TAB&gt;Abnormal findings on ECG, unless cleared for participation by Cardiology
             Department.

          4. &lt;TAB&gt;Current history of depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, psychotic disorder,
             obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), eating
             disorder, or any other Axis-I psychiatric disorders requiring intervention.

          5. &lt;TAB&gt;An aspartate transaminase (AST) or alanine transaminase (ALT) level more than 3
             times the upper limit of normal.

          6. &lt;TAB&gt;Current (past 12 months) diagnosis of substance use disorder other than alcohol
             use disorder, unless in early remission (no criteria met for at least 3 months).

          7. &lt;TAB&gt;Positive result on urine drug screen or breathalyzer test during initial or
             update visit under the screening protocol (14-AA-0181) most proximal to enrollment.
             Positive urine drug screen during more than 1 study visit or breathalyzer reading
             during more than 1 self-administration study visit will result in participant
             withdrawal from the study.

          8. &lt;TAB&gt;Currently seeking treatment for alcohol use disorder or having undergone
             inpatient or outpatient detoxification or treatment for alcohol problems in the past 6
             months.

          9. &lt;TAB&gt;History of significant withdrawal symptoms or presence of clinically significant
