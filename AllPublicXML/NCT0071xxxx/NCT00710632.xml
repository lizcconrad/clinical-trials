      RATIONALE: Screening tests may identify people with cancer who are at high risk of losing
      weight and help doctors plan better treatment.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well a new screening tool works in predicting
      weight loss in patients with cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To identify people with cancer who are at greatest risk of future weight loss by the
           development of a simple and practical screening tool.

        -  To estimate the reliability of the Appetite and Symptom Questionnaire (part 1).

        -  To develop a screening tool based on the ability of the optimal combination of items
           from the three measures (ASQ, MUST, CRP) to predict clinically significant weight loss
           over three months (part 2).

        -  To estimate the sensitivity and specificity at various cut-points of the developed
           screening tool in predicting clinically significant weight loss (&gt; 10% weight loss or
           between 5% and 10% weight loss with a BMI &lt; 20 kg/m^2) over three months (part 2).

      OUTLINE: This is a two-part study.

        -  Part 1: Patients are asked to complete the Appetite and Symptom Questionnaire (ASQ) on
           two occasions, one week apart.

        -  Part 2: Patients are screened at baseline for risk of malnutrition using the
           Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool. Blood samples are also taken at this time to
           establish the level of C-reactive protein and patients complete the ASQ. Patients are
           weighed using calibrated scales and height measurements are obtained. Patients are asked
           about unplanned weight loss over the previous 3-6 months. Patients are weighed again at
           3 months. Percentage weight loss is calculated at 3 months.
