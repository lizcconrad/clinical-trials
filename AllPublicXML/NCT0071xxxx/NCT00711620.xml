  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe sepsis is a disease of infectious origin with a high risk of death. Over the past
      decade, thymosin alpha1 have already provided clinicians with additional weapon in the fight
      against infectious diseases, but it is unknown whether thymosin alpha1 is effective in
      treating severe sepsis.
