      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of the Ross
      River Virus (RRV) Vaccine in a healthy young adult population. Other objectives of this study
      are to assess the immunogenicity of the RRV Vaccine in a healthy young adult population and
      to identify the optimal dose level of the RRV Vaccine in a healthy young adult population.

    <description>Randomization of a total of approx. 200 subjects to one of four treatment arms at 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive 1.25 µg of the RRV Vaccine with/without adjuvant (Al(OH)3), or 2.5 µg of the RRV Vaccine with/without adjuvant (Al(OH)3). Cohort 1 is subdivided into Cohort 1a (n = 60, i.e. 15 subjects per dose/adjuvantation combination) to receive the first vaccination on Day 0, with Day 7 safety data being reviewed by a Data Monitoring Committee and, following DMC recommendation, to receive the second vaccination at Day 21; Cohort 1b (n=140, i.e. 35 subjects per dose/adjuvantation combination) is to be vaccinated twice 21 days apart upon availability of DMC recommendation. Booster vaccination to follow 180 days after first vaccination.</description>
