  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if MTS-01 is effective in preventing
      radiotherapy-induced hair loss in patients receiving whole brain radiotherapy
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hair loss (alopecia) occurs commonly as a result of external beam radiotherapy to the brain,
      and contributes to the social isolation and distress of patients with cancer. MTS-01 is a
      topical gel formulation that can be applied to the scalp during delivery of radiotherapy
