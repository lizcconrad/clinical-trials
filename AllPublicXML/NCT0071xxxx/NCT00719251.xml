    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of high voltage pulsed current and low
      level laser therapy on the healing process of diabetic foot ulcers.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based in the literature review we concluded that LLLT and HVPC are effective in the healing
      wound. We did not meet outcomes of previous clinical studies, where compare the effectivity
      of two physical technologies. For the high prevalence of diabetic foot ulcers, the amputation
      risk and the consequent impairment and dysfunction in the quality of life, and the associated
      high costs for this health problem, it is important that new studies that identified
      effective treatment alternatives for promoting wound closure.

    <description>The patientÂ´s wounds were treated for 45 minutes with HVPC three times a week for 16 weeks or until their ulcers closed. The active electrode made of aluminum foil was secured directly over the wound, which previously had been loosely packed with sterile gauze soaked with 0.9% saline solution. The dispersive electrode was placed 5 cms proximal to the wound.The electrical stimulator Intelect 340 stim model (Chattanooga Group) produces a twin peaked pulse and was applied with the following parameters: continuous mode, submotor level, 100 Hz pulse frequency and 100microseconds pulse duration. Prior to the beginning the study the electrical stimulator was calibrated with oscilloscope (Tektronix TDS 1002 model).</description>

    <description>It was based to nursing intervention classification (NIC)46. These interventions were performed by a qualified nurse and included ulcer irrigation with physiological saline, sharp debridement as needed and maintenance of a moist wound environment with appropriate wound dressing. Patients were all educated regarding pressure off loading of the involved foot. All patients received standard wound care seven times a week for 16 weeks or until their ulcers closed.</description>
