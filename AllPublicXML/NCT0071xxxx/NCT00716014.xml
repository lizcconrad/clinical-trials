  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pachyonychia congenita (PC) is a rare, autosomal dominant keratin disorder affecting the
      nails, skin, oral mucosae, larynx, hair and teeth. Pathogenic mutations in keratin K6a, K6b,
      K16 or K17 act via a dominant negative mechanism, leading to manifestations of the disease.
      The most disabling PC symptom is a painful plantar blistering and keratoderma that requires
      use of ambulation devices in more than 50 percent of patients. Despite our understanding of
      the molecular basis of PC, current treatment is limited to mechanical removal of the thick
      calluses, non-specific topical keratolytics, and oral retinoids, none of which alleviates
      blistering or plantar pain satisfactorily. A public charity, PC Project, has been founded to
      support the development of treatments for PC (www.pachyonychia.org). In collaboration with
      this charity, a small company, TransDerm, Inc., has developed a small interfering RNA (siRNA)
      that specifically targets a mutation in one of the PC keratins, K6a. As this siRNA targets a
      single nucleotide mutation, it will only be effective against PC subjects harboring this
      specific mutation. There are currently only six known patients who carry this mutation in the
      International Pachyonychia Congenita Research Registry, but three of these patients live in
      Salt Lake City (a mother and two of her children). We propose to perform a Phase Ib clinical
      trial to test the safety and tolerability of TD101 in PC patients carrying an N171K mutation.
      We will complete treatment of the adult patient prior to recruitment of the minors.
