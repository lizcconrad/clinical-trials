      1. Aim:

           SoftTouch is a non-invasive device intending for use in the temporarily quantitative
           measurement of peripheral blood biomarkers. The aim of the clinical trial is to study
           the accuracy of the SoftTouch device compared with registered (FDA-approved) invasive
           and non-invasive devices.

        2. Hypothesis:

      Human physiological biomarkers may be measured from the color distribution of the internal or
      external (skin) tissue. The technology of the SoftTouch finger-mounted device is based on the
      color distribution of the peripheral blood tissue, which enables the measurement of certain
      biomarkers and vital signs under consideration.

      Description of the Method:

        1. The method of measuring non-invasive peripheral physiological parameters such as Pulse,
           Blood Pressure, Blood pH, SpO2, CO2, Hemoglobin, Blood Glucose, Hematocrit and
           additional physiological parameters is based on the color distribution of a human
           tissue. SoftTouch is a finger-mounted device incorporated a dedicated light source and a
           color image sensor similar to a digital camera. The light transverses and is reflected
           from the tissue under consideration. Analyzing the tissue color distribution of the
           sampled real-time video in the frequency color space time domain may provide certain
           information about the biomarkers and vital-signs under consideration. The current
           study's goal is to find out if the results accuracy are satisfactory compared with
           regulatory cleared devices by the FDA and other notified bodies.

        2. The Patient signals shall be recorded as is for algorithm improvement, future research
           of additional bio parameters and calibration.

        3. the device is declared calibrated if executed successfully on the entire recorded data.

        4. for non invasive blood glucose the device shall be provided to selected diabetic
           patients for the own use at home.
