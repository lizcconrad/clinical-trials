  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the degree of agreement between patients and
      their physicians regarding the &quot;story&quot; of the illness correlates with improved patient
      symptom control and quality of life. Another goal of the study is to examine the actual
      language used by patients and physicians in a specific clinical situation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the co-created therapeutic narrative in scheduled
      office visits between adult patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma and their medical
      oncologists in a community practice setting. The study will focus on the negotiation of the
      illness narrative and the semiotic (primarily linguistic) tools employed. The study will
      involve patients from a large community cancer center from Northeastern Pennsylvania (this
      center sees about 3,000 new patients each year). About 85% of patients with cancer in the
      United States are treated in this type of setting (National Cancer Institute, 2007), and so
      many results from this population are applicable to most cancer patients in the United
      States. The location of this study makes it very different from the majority of medical
      anthropological studies that are usually performed in urban academic medical centers or in
      sites outside of the United States or Western Europe. Although community cancer centers are
      the location of most of the treatment of patients with cancer in the United States, there are
      few to no studies published studying this patient population.
