    <textblock>
      Coronary artery disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality across the world and
      coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) is the most common surgical procedure for treatment.
      Patients with recurrent ischemic symptoms after CABG are most likely to have occluded or
      significantly stenosis in grafts or native coronary arteries. Therefore, there is a need to
      evaluate the patency of these vessel conduits after CABG. Until now, selective coronary
      angiography is the traditional gold standard for the assessment of both native coronary
      arteries and bypass grafts. But it is an invasive procedure that requires x-ray exposure,
      hospitalization, and includes a risk for complication. However, there is an alternative
      noninvasive method, multislice computed tomography (MSCT), with high specificity and
      excellent sensitivity for the detection of the coronary artery disease. It is even cheaper
      and takes shorter time to perform. Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to use MSCT to
      evaluate the patency and the quality of all grafts and native coronary arteries after CABG
      for more than two years. In addition, we will elucidate the relationship of these data and
      CABG procedures to review our experience.
