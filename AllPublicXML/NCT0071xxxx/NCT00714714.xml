      A study to compare the skin irritation potential of two marketed gels for acne treatment,
      each applied to half of the face of healthy volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At the Baseline Visit, following satisfaction of entry criteria and screening procedures, all
      subjects will be applying two products on their faces, each on half face. The side of face
      receiving each product is randomly assigned. One group will use tretinoin facial gel on the
      left side and adapalene facial gel on the right side of the face daily for two consecutive
      weeks after washing with study-supplied facial wash. The other group will use the same
      products, but on opposite sides of the face for two consecutive weeks after washing with the
      same study-supplied facial wash.

      Subjects will return to the study center every weekday morning for evaluation and for the
      morning application of both study products. Study personnel will monitor application on the
      weekdays. There will be a daily clinical evaluation of skin irritation by a blinded
      dermatologist and by subjects. At baseline and at the end of each week subjects will be
      photographed and have chromometer readings.

          <description>Adapalene facial gel was applied daily to one side of the face of all subjects in a split-face model. On weekdays during the two-week trial, the investigator scored Erythema on a scale of 0 (none) to 8 (severe) and Dryness on a scale of 0 (none) to 8 (deep). Also on weekdays during the two-week trial, subjects performed a self-assessment of Burning/stinging and Itching, which were scored on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe).</description>
