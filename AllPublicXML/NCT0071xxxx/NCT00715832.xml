  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study uses a molecule or particle that is found only on cancer cells and is unique to
      cancer cells, as it is not detected on normal tissue. The molecule is known as &quot;oncofetal
      antigen&quot; or OFA. Because OFA is unique to cancer, the investigators feel OFA could be used to
      educate the patients' own defenses to more effectively fight the cancer on her own, he or she
      is harboring. Although investigators found OFA to be present in large concentrations on all
      cancers, it was found to be especially abundant in breast cancers. Therefore, the
      investigators feel that this molecule would be a good target for stimulating patient defenses
      especially against breast cancer cells. To accomplish this, certain defense cells (immune
      cells) will be washed out from the patients' blood using a machine to which the patient is
      connected through two small cannulas placed into veins located in the patients' arms. Those
      cells will be manipulated in the laboratory with artificially engineered OFA. These
      &quot;reeducated&quot; cells will be injected into the skin of patients. There will be a series of
      three skin injections in 4 week intervals. It is hoped that this treatment will convert the
      patients' defenses to a point that effective anti cancer responses will be induced.
      Effectiveness of the treatment will be monitored with blood tests and assessment of the size
      of the cancers.

      The study is an open-label study to assess safety and immune responses to the universal tumor
      antigen OFA/iLRP. All patients will be immunized with 1 x 107 viable OFA/iLRP-loaded mature,
      autologous monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs). The DC vaccine will be administered
      intradermally into the proximal medial upper extremity, contralateral to the original site of
      breast cancer once every month for 3 months. Changes in the tumor will be documented. The
      patient will remain in the study unless toxicity or adverse side effects require
      discontinuation following RECIST and CTC guidelines, or if the patient withdraws for any
      other reason.
