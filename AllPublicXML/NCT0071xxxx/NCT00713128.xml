  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to determine how much nausea and or vomiting is caused by irinotecan-based
      chemotherapy in patients with colorectal cancer. Patients with colorectal cancer scheduled to
      receive their first cycle of an irinotecan-based chemotherapy regimen are eligible. Any
      chemotherapy agents administered in combination with irinotecan must have low-minimal
      potential to cause nausea and or vomiting. Examples of acceptable regimens would be
      irinotecan in combination with infusional fluorouracil and leucovorin (FOLFRI) with or
      without bevacizumab and irinotecan in combination with cetuximab. Patients who have received
      prior non-irinotecan-based chemotherapy are eligible providing they experienced no vomiting
      and no greater than mild nausea with their prior chemotherapy.

      Irinotecan is a camptothecin analog which exerts its cytotoxic effects by forming a covalent
      complex with topoisomerase I and DNA, resulting in inhibition of DNA re-ligation,
      accumulation of DNA double strand breaks and apoptotic cell death (1). Irinotecan is FDA
      approved for use in the front-line and second-line treatment of colorectal cancer. It has
      also demonstrated activity in a variety of other non-hematologic tumors. The recently updated
      ASCO antiemetic guidelines characterize irinotecan as having moderate emetic risk. (2).
      However, the emetogenic potential of this agent has been poorly characterized and there are
      no published prospective trials with emesis as a primary-end point. In addition there is a
      complete paucity of information on the potential of irinotecan to induce emesis beyond the
      first day after chemotherapy, so-called delayed emesis. Best characterized following
      cisplatin, delayed emesis is also associated with a number of other chemotherapy agents that
      similar to irinotecan appear to be moderately emetogenic such as carboplatin,
      cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin. Antiemetic prophylaxis for delayed emesis following
      irinotecan is not routinely prescribed at the present time. Prospectively obtained
      information on the potential of irinotecan to cause delayed emesis would be helpful in
      guiding appropriate antiemetic practice.
