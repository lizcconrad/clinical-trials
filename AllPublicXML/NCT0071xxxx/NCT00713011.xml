    <textblock>
      The study consists of a 12 week run-in period when all subjects are stabilized on a single
      dose of Avalide (300 mg/12.5 mg or 300mg/25mg dose) per day. After this 12 week run-in ends,
      subjects will be randomly assigned to start the addition of either Adalat XL or Tiazac XC for
      18 weeks of treatment. Subjects will have a 1 in 2 chance of receiving the study drug Adalat
      XL and a 1 in 2 chance of receiving the drug Tiazac XC. An end of treatment visit will be
      done 18 weeks after start of study drug. The expected duration of the study is 30 weeks. The
      purpose of this study is to compare the change in proteinuria, through a urine test, while
      taking study drug until high blood pressure (BP) is reduced to near normal levels in study
      subjects with diabetic nephropathy and hypertension.

    <description>Patients will receive Avalide (Irbesartan/ hydrochlorothiazide; 300 mg/12.5 mg per day or 300 mg/25.0 mg per day) during the 12 week screening period and during the 18 week treatment period. At baseline, patients will be provided with Adalat XL at a starting dose of 20 or 30 mg. Adalat XL will be titrated during the 18 week treatment period in order to optimize blood pressure.
