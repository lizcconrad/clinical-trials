    <textblock>
      A five week randomised-withdrawal phase (Part B) for a subset of subjects who took part in a
      38 week, multicentre, open label (Part A) follow-on study to evaluate, the maintenance of
      effect of, the development of tolerance through exposure to, and safety of, Sativex® in the
      treatment of subjects with neuropathic pain. Subjects returned to the centre for an end of
      treatment visit at week 38 of Part A (Visit 5, Day 266), followed by Visits 5b (week 39), 5c
      (week 43) and an end of study visit took place 28 days after Visit 5c or withdrawal from the
      study.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Daily Pain Severity on a 0-10 Numerical Rating Scale Score at the End of Treatment (Average of Last 7 Days Treatment)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0-35</time_frame>
    <description>The pain severity Numerical Rating Scale was complete at the same time each day, i.e. bedtime in the evening. The patient was asked &quot;on a scale of '0 to 10', please indicate the number that best describes your pain severity in the last 24 hours&quot; where 0 = no pain and 10 = pain as bad as you can imagine. No pain relates to the time prior to the onset of neuropathic pain. A negative value indicates an improvement in pain score from baseline.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline Neuropathic Pain Score at the End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7 to 35</time_frame>
    <description>The Neuropathic Pain Scale score is the 0-100 sum of 10 individual pain scores (0-10 Numerical Rating Scale, 0= no pain to 10 = most pain imaginable). A negative change from baseline indicates an improvement in pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects Who Failed Treatment at the End of the Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7 to time of last dose</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment failure was defined as follows:
A. Premature termination of Part B (Randomised-Withdrawal) study medication. All subjects who did not complete at least 28 days on Part B (Randomised-Withdrawal) study medicationOr:
B. An increase in pain, i.e. the mean pain 0-10 Numerical Rating Scale over seven consecutive days after Part B (Randomised-Withdrawal) randomisation had increased by at least 20% from the Part B (Randomised-Withdrawal) randomised treatment baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects With More Than a 20% Loss of Response at the End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0-35</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage change from baseline in mean 0-10 Numerical Rating Scale pain score was calculated. The percentage changes from baseline were classified and the number of subjects with 20% or greater loss of response to treatment (i.e. percent increase from baseline ≥ 20%) is presented.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Sleep Disruption 0-10 Numerical Rating Scale Score at the End of Treatment (Average of Last 7 Days Treatment)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0-35</time_frame>
    <description>The sleep disruption Numerical Rating Scale was completed at the same time each day, i.e. bedtime in the evening. The patient was asked &quot;on a scale of '0 to 10', please indicate how your pain disrupted your sleep last night?&quot; where 0 = did not disrupt sleep and 10 = completely disrupted (unable to sleep at all). A negative value indicates an improvement in sleep disruption score from baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subject Global Impression of Change at the End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7 to 35</time_frame>
    <description>A 7-point Likert-type scale was used, with the question: 'Please assess the status of your nerve pain since entry into the study using the scale below' with the markers &quot;very much improved, much improved, slightly improved, no change, slightly worse, much worse or very much worse&quot;. The number of subjects wo reported an improvement is presented.</description>

        <description>The pain severity Numerical Rating Scale was complete at the same time each day, i.e. bedtime in the evening. The patient was asked &quot;on a scale of '0 to 10', please indicate the number that best describes your pain severity in the last 24 hours&quot; where 0 = no pain and 10 = pain as bad as you can imagine. No pain relates to the time prior to the onset of neuropathic pain. A negative value indicates an improvement in pain score from baseline.</description>

The model incorporated the parent Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs).

The final model was then treatment group and parent RCTs, i.e. the treatment effect was adjusted for parent RCTs baseline.</groups_desc>
