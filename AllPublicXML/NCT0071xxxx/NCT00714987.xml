      -  ARDS is a severe pathology with high mortality and morbidity.Actual ventilatory
           management is clear for the set of the tidal volume and for the survey of the plateau
           pressure for the patients who require mechanical ventilation.

        -  The set of the PEEP (low or high levels) remains unclear : it seems that some patients
           need low levels of PEEP whereas anther need high levels; but there is no validated data
           that can discriminate them.

        -  We hypothesized that patients with low levels of EVLW ( measured with the Picco® system
           ) need low level of PEEP to ameliorate their oxygenation ( measured with the PaO2/FiO2
           ratio ) whereas patients with high levels of EVLW) need high levels of PEEP.
