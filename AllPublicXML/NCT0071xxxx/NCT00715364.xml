          -  Stroke is ischemic in origin, supratentorial, and radiologically confirmed (CT scan or
             diagnostic MRI) prior to enrolment.

          -  Patient is 24-48 hours from time of stroke onset when the first dose of NTx™-265
             therapy is administered. Time of onset is when symptoms began; for stroke that
             occurred during sleep, time of onset is when patient was last seen or was
             self-reported to be normal.

          -  Reasonable expectation of availability to receive the full 9 day NTx™-265 course of
             therapy, and to be available for subsequent follow-up visits.

          -  Reasonable expectation that patient will receive standard post-stroke physical,
             occupational, speech, and cognitive therapy as indicated.

          -  Female patient is either:

               1. not of childbearing potential, defined as postmenopausal for at least 1 year or

                  hysterectomy) or,

               2. if of childbearing potential, agrees to use two of the following effective
                  separate forms of contraception throughout the study, up to and including the
                  follow up visits: i) condoms, sponge, foams, jellies, diaphragm or intrauterine
                  device (IUD) contraceptives (e.g. implants, injectables, combined oral, etc.) OR

          -  Patients presenting with lacunar, hemorrhagic and/or brain stem stroke

          -  Patients classified as comatose, defined as a patient who requires repeated
             stimulation to attend, or is obtunded and requires strong or painful stimulation to
             make movements (NIHSS 1A score must be &lt;2)

          -  Women who have tested positive for pregnancy, or are breast-feeding, or are not using

          -  Alkaline phosphatase &gt; 2.5 x ULN

          -  AST or ALT &gt; 2.5 x ULN

          -  Creatinine &gt; 2.0 x ULN
