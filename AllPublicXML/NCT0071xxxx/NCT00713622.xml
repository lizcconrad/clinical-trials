      Zonisamide (Zonegran) and sodium valproate (Epilim) are both medicines approved to treat
      epilepsy.

      The purpose of this study is to find out the extent to which zonisamide may affect memory and
      concentration, compared to sodium valproate. This will be investigated using cognitive tests
      which are performed on a computer screen. Either zonisamide or sodium valproate will be added
      as a second medicine to the one patients are currently taking, carbamazepine (Tegretol),
      which will be continued throughout the study.

      It is planned that about 80 people across Europe will take part in this study. For the
      purpose of the study, patients will need to go to the study doctor's clinic 4 times and have
      5 telephone calls. Involvement in the study might be as long as 20 weeks, but it could be as
      short as 12 weeks. The length of the study and number of visits will depend on whether
      patients have an accurate recording of previous seizures already, how many seizures they have
      during the study, and whether they decide to continue or to stop treatment after the study is
      completed.

      Adult subjects with a clinical diagnosis of non-symptomatic (i.e., idiopathic or unknown
      cause) localisation-related epilepsy, with partial onset seizures with or without secondary
      generalisation, who are receiving fixed dose carbamazepine as their only therapy or can be
      transferred to carbamazepine (as their only therapy) in the two months before the study
      baseline. Subjects must require addition of another anti-epileptic drug (AED) to their
      anti-epileptic therapy, either because they continue to have seizures (i.e., are not
      controlled), or because they wish to switch to another AED for other reasons (e.g., they
      tolerate another drug better).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Subjects with a clinical diagnosis of non-symptomatic (i.e., idiopathic or
             cryptogenic) localisation-related epilepsy with partial onset seizures with or without
             secondary generalisation according to International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE)
             classification27. Diagnosis should be clinically established by history, by previous
             electroencephalogram (EEG) and by previous magnetic resonance imaging or computer
             tomography of the brain, consistent with localisation related epilepsy. No lower or
             upper limit of baseline seizures is defined.

          2. Able and willing to sign informed consent form (ICF) in accordance with the
             International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP)
             guidelines.

          3. Male or female subjects aged ≥18 years.

          4. Subjects taking carbamazepine as monotherapy at baseline or who can be transferred to
             carbamazepine monotherapy in the two months before the Screening Visit. Dose of
             carbamazepine is within that recommended by the SPC. Carbamazepine dose has not been
             altered during the previous 2 weeks prior to the start of the Baseline Period, or 6
             weeks if the Baseline Period is to be shortened due to the availability of a
             retrospective seizure history. The carbamazepine dose is to remain stable throughout
             the study.

          5. Subjects requiring addition of another AED, either because they continue to have
             seizures (are refractory), or because they wish eventually to switch to another AED
             for other reasons after the study completion (e.g. tolerability reasons).

          6. Female subjects of childbearing potential must not be pregnant (as confirmed by
             negative serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (βHCG) at screening and negative
             urine pregnancy test at baseline and during the study), must not be lactating and must
             use a medically acceptable form of contraception during the study and for at least 1
             month after discontinuation of study drug. Medically acceptable contraception is

                  documented replacement date. (If the replacement date is not available, the
                  device must not have been in situ for more than 5 years).

               -  Women more than 2 years post-menopause

               -  Abstinence Examples of contraception NOT acceptable include, but are not limited
                  to:· Conventional dose of combined OC (&lt; 50µg oestrogen)
