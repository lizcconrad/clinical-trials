      This study is for a new marketing authorization application for the seasonal vaccine strains
      in compliance with the Note for Guidance (NfG) on harmonization requirements for influenza
      vaccine from the Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP)

      Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the compliance, in terms of immunogenicity, of the inactivated, split-virion
           influenza vaccine NH 2008-2009 formulation with the requirements of the CHMP NfG
           CPMP/BWP/214/96.

        -  To describe the safety of the inactivated, split-virion influenza vaccine, NH 2008-2009
           formulation.
