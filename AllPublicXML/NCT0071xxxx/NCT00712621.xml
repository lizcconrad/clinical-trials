      Rationale: Determining quality of life in breast cancer patient after completing chemotherapy
      or radiation therapy or surgical procedures or any combination therapy.

      Intervention includes supportive care in terms of psychological support and moral boosting
      efforts by counseling breast cancer survivors which may enhance the well-being and quality of
      life of women who are treated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy or surgical procedures
      or any given combination therapy.

      PURPOSE: Randomized clinical trial study to compare the effectiveness of support system and
      counseling of breast cancer survivors on the well-being of women, who have completed various
      modes of treatment of breast cancer with the subjects who have no support system.

      Study Type: Quality of life and survival

      Study Design: Two arm randomized controlled clinical trial to study quality of life and
      survival of breast cancer patients after completion of chemotherapy or radiation therapy or
      surgery or any combination therapy. The stages from I to IV (metastases to other sites of the
      body) are included.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the quality of life in breast cancer patient after completing chemotherapy or
           radiation therapy or surgical procedures or any combination therapy in both Arms.

        -  Determine the effect of providing standard written materials in Arm I.

        -  Determine the effect of psychological support and moral boosting efforts by counseling
           breast cancer survivors which may enhance the well-being and quality of life of women
           who are treated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy or surgical procedures or any
           combination therapy in Arm II.

        -  Determine the effect of socioeconomic status on all available demographic area which is
           not a criteria for exclusion in both Arms.

        -  Determine psychosocial and mental state to measure wellness and good quality of life in
           both Arms.

        -  Determine the periodic medical care for related or unrelated problems of the disease
           which have a positive impact on the survival and quality of life in both Arms.
