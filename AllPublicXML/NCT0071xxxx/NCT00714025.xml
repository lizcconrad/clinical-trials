    <textblock>
      An open-label, single arm, non-randomized, single stage phase II study. 3 phases:Baseline,
      treatment/duration and Follow-up. All patients will be treated with RAD001 10 mg daily dose
      until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity death, or discontinuation from the study,
      for any other reason

    <textblock>
      An open-label, single arm, non-randomized, single stage phase II study. Baseline phase:
      Baseline evaluations will be performed within 2 weeks before the first dose study drug.

      Treatment phase/duration of treatment: All patients will be treated with RAD001 10mg PO daily
      dose until disease progression (by RECIST) or unacceptable toxicity death or discontinuation
      from the study for any other reason.

      Follow-up phase: All patients will have a follow-up visit scheduled 28 days after the last
      dose of the study drug to follow for AEs and SAEs that may have occured after discontinuation
      from the study. Any patient who is discontinued from treatment with RAD001 for any reason
      other than disease progression will continue to have tumor assessments until the patient has
      documented disease progression or start of additional anti-tumor therapy. Central radiology
      review and survival data collection will be performed. After discontinuation of RAD001 all
      patients will be followed up for survival until the final OS analysis is performed.
