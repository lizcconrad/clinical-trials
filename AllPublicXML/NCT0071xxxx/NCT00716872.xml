  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether an Internet-based program, Sleep Healthy
      Using the Internet (SHUTi, or &quot;Shut-Eye&quot;), can help to improve the sleep of people who are in
      remission from cancer and experiencing symptoms of insomnia.

      The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility of using an Internet program to improve
      the sleep of cancer patients with insomnia. Participants will receive access to the Internet
      program (called SHUTi, or &quot;Shut-Eye&quot;) as well as to self-hypnosis recordings designed to
      improve sleep. SHUTi provides an online, tailored educational program to individuals who are
      experiencing sleep difficulties, including those having difficulty falling asleep, waking in
      the middle of the night, and waking too early in the morning.
