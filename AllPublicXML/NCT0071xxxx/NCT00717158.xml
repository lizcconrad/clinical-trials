    <textblock>
      The ICAN Pilot project aims to evaluate the differences in economic, clinical and quality of
      life outcomes of a nutrition intervention involving lifestyle case management and medical
      nutrition therapy by a registered dietitian compared to usual medical care in obese persons
      with type 2 diabetes. The intervention is aimed at moderate weight loss (&gt; 5-10%),
      improvement in diet quality and an increase in physical activity.
