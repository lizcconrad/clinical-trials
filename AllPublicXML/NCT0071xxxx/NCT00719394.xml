    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human study of GSI-136, a gamma-secretase inhibitor being developed for
      the treatment of Alzheimer disease. This study will take place in Japan only and will provide
      an initial assessment of the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and
      pharmacodynamics (PD) of GSI-136 after administration of ascending single oral doses to
      healthy Japanese male subjects and healthy Japanese elderly male subjects.
