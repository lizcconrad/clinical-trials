      STUDY OBJECTIVES: To determine whether the addition of L-arginine to treatment as usual (TAU)
      in schizophrenia further improves and enhances therapeutic efficacy (positive, negative and
      depressive symptoms) and effectiveness of antipsychotic treatment

      STUDY POPULATION: Patients diagnosed (DSM-IV criteria) with schizophrenia or schizoaffective
      disorder

      Total expected number of patients: 14

      INVESTIGATIONAL COMPOUND: L-arginine capsules, 3 grams of L-arginine given twice a day (total
      daily dose of 6 grams/day)

      DURATION OF ACTIVE TREATMENT: 3 weeks followed by wash-out phase of 5 days and 3 weeks of
      second treatment phase (cross-over design)

      EVALUATION CRITERIA: Primary (efficacy) outcomes: PANSS scores. Secondary outcomes: Calgary
      Depression Scale for schizophrenia, CGI; AIMS, UKU-assessment of side-effects

      ASSESSMENT SCHEDULE: Treatment arm 1: Baseline, weeks: 1,2,3, wash-out phase; week 4,
      cross-over phase: treatment phase-2; weeks 5,6,7

      STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS: Analysis of variance of outcome measures with treatment as the
      between-subject factor and pre- and post-treatment scores as within- subjects factors.

      DURATION OF STUDY PERIOD: Patient recruitment to be completed in 12 months, study full
      completion 18 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the current study, our goals were to examine the clinical benefits of the nitric oxide
      (NO) donor and main precursor of NO, L-arginine, to further improve the symptoms of
      schizophrenia with minimum or no additional side-effects. L-Arginine is classified as a
      semi-essential or conditionally essential amino acid depending on the developmental stage and
      health status of the individual. Glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors have
      functional connections to the NO system in the brain. Dysfunction of connectivity of the
      neuroregulators glutamate and NO have been implicated in mechanisms of psychosis. Therefore,
      any downstream effects of NMDA dysfunction in schizophrenia may be ultimately mediated by the
      NO system at a cellular level. As an augmenting treatment to antipsychotic therapy, we
      examined the ability of L-arginine to further improve residual symptoms in the illness.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Total and Positive, Negative and General Psychopathology Subscale Scores at 3 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure was the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score and PANSS positive, negative and general psychopathology subscale scores. The PANSS is a 30-item scale used to evaluate the symptoms of schizophrenia. For each PANSS item, symptom severity was rated on a 7-point scale, from 1=absent to 7=extreme. The PANSS total score (30 items) ranges from 30 to 210 with a higher score indicating a greater severity of symptoms. The PANSS positive symptom subscale score (7 items) ranges from 7=absent to 49=extreme; the PANSS negative subscale score (7 items) ranges from 7=absent to 49=extreme; and the PANSS general psychopathology subscare score (16 items) ranges from 16=absent to 112=extreme.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Scale at 3 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Secondary Outcome Measure was the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale. The CGI is a 3-item scale that rates treatment response and monitors the clinical course of all psychiatric illnesses including schizophrenia. Within the CGI, the Severity of Illness was rated on a 7-point scale, 0=not assessed to 7=among the most severely ill patients. For Global Improvement, the total improvement following treatment as compared to at baseline of the trial was rated on a 7-point scale, 0=not assessed to 7=very much worse.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS) at 3 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Secondary Outcome Measure was the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophenia (CDSS). The CDSS is a 9-item scale that is used to rate the depressive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. For each CDSS item, symptom severity was rated on a 3-point scale, from 0=absent to 3=severe. The CDSS total score ranges from 0 to 27 with a higher score indicating a greater severity of symptoms.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Aged 18-65 years

          2. Diagnoses of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder using the Diagnostic and
             Statistical Manual-IV (DSM-IV) criteria

          3. Competent and willing to give informed consent

          4. Able to take oral medication and likely to complete the required evaluations.

          5. Medication remained stable 4 weeks prior to baseline.

          6. Female participants of child bearing capability must be willing to use adequate
             contraceptives (4.6.1a) for the duration of the study, and, willing to have a
             pregnancy test pretreatment and during the study.

        Adequate contraception is defined as use of contraceptive double barrier system (i.e.
        condom and spermicide) or contraceptive implant, oral contraceptive or injected depot
        contraceptive plus other form of contraceptive, i.e. condom. Females will be considered
        incapable of child bearing if they are one year postmenopausal or irreversibly surgically
        sterilised.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Relevant medical illness [serious renal, diabetes, hepatic, cardiac, low- or
             high-blood-pressure or other illnesses] in the opinion of the investigators. In
             particular, history of past or recent cardiac illness, MI and abnormal ECG and current
             treatments for cardiac illness. The results of the Laboratory Investigations (LFT,
             TFT, RFT, WBC, ECG, platelets, blood chemistry, lipids, weight/BMI) will be taken into
             account in determining the exclusion criteria.

               1. Relevant medical illness will be determined in the first instance by asking the
                  patients mental health care team if the patient has any medical
                  condition/problems. After consent has been obtained, the research nurse/research
                  doctor will then have access to the patient's notes and if necessary communicate
                  with his/her GP and will assess patient eligibility to take part in the clinical
                  trial by scrutinising the patient's past medical history, most recent blood
                  results, electrocardiograms, as well as any physical tests that have been
                  performed on the patient. If there are any deviations from the 'norm' the
                  investigators will assess the eligibility of the individual patient.

               2. Patients receiving active treatments for Herpes virus as L-arginine may

        <description>The primary outcome measure was the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score and PANSS positive, negative and general psychopathology subscale scores. The PANSS is a 30-item scale used to evaluate the symptoms of schizophrenia. For each PANSS item, symptom severity was rated on a 7-point scale, from 1=absent to 7=extreme. The PANSS total score (30 items) ranges from 30 to 210 with a higher score indicating a greater severity of symptoms. The PANSS positive symptom subscale score (7 items) ranges from 7=absent to 49=extreme; the PANSS negative subscale score (7 items) ranges from 7=absent to 49=extreme; and the PANSS general psychopathology subscare score (16 items) ranges from 16=absent to 112=extreme.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Mean Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS) at 3 Weeks</title>
          <description>The Secondary Outcome Measure was the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophenia (CDSS). The CDSS is a 9-item scale that is used to rate the depressive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. For each CDSS item, symptom severity was rated on a 3-point scale, from 0=absent to 3=severe. The CDSS total score ranges from 0 to 27 with a higher score indicating a greater severity of symptoms.</description>
