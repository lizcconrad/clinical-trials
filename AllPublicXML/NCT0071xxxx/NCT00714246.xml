    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II study. The phase I portion of the study will determine the maximum
      tolerated dose of bortezomib when administered in combination with carboplatin &amp; docetaxel
      and to determine the efficacy of the combination for patients with advanced NSCLC. Phase II
      will determine time to progression and overall survival and determine changes in serum
      proteomics patterns before &amp; after combination therapy.

    <textblock>
      A chemotherapy efficacy plateau' has been reached for the treatment of patients with advanced
      or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Platinum-based two-drug combination is considered
      the current standard of care for the treatment of advanced NSCLC. There is a need to develop
      novel regimens to improve the outcome for patients with advanced NSCLC. The combination of
      carboplatin and docetaxel is effective for therapy of advanced NSCLC. This combination
      results in improved survival and quality of life for patients with advanced NSCLC. Docetaxel
      exhibits preclinical synergy with bortezomib. Hence we plan to perform a phase I/II study to
      define the maximum tolerated dose of bortezomib that can be administered in combination with
      docetaxel and carboplatin and subsequently evaluate the efficacy of the regimen for patients
      with advanced NSCLC.
