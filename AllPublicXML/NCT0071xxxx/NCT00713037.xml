  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Before radiation treatment is given to treat chordomas, CT and MRI scans are used to create a
      three dimensional picture of the tumor using x-rays. The CT and MRI scans are used to
      determine the size and location of the area that will receive radiation treatment. The
      purpose of this research study is to see if combining the images from the FMISO-PET scan and
      the CT and MRI scans in radiation treatment planning changes the size and location of the
      area that will receive radiation treatment when compared to planning the radiation treatment
      with CT and MRI scans alone.

      -  In this research study we are determining whether the positron emission tomography (PET)
           investigation performed with the investigational radioactive substance FMISO can show
           areas of tumor with lower oxygen levels. There is evidence that tumor with low oxygen
           levels are more resistant to radiation therapy. CT and MRI scans are not able to detect
           these oxygen levels in tumors.

        -  Participants will be asked to have the FMISO-PET/CT scan at 2 different times. It will
           be performed 2 weeks before and 3 weeks after the participants first proton radiation
           treatment.

    <description>The study utilizes PET/CT scanning with (18F)-FMISO/CT in addition to standard used CT and MRI. Patients enrolled in this trial completed 2 PET/CT investigations, the first before proton radiation therapy and the second at a dose of approximately 30 Gy (24-36 Gy).</description>
