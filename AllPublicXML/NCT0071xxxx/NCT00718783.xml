  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retinoblastoma is a childhood tumor of the retina that affects approximately 1 in 18,000
      children. Retinoblastoma is more prevalent in Central America, where most patients present
      with advanced intraocular and extraocular disease. Therefore, we have formed collaboration
      with Central American investigators to provide us with frozen retinoblastoma tumors from
      patients undergoing routine enucleation. The objective of this protocol is to begin to
      identify the mutations and gene expression changes that occur in retinoblastoma cells
      following RB1 gene inactivation in order to more effectively target chemotherapy for treating
      bilateral retinoblastoma.

      This is a biology protocol with no treatment regimen associated. Following routine
      enucleation of the retinoblastoma affected eye, a portion of the tumor will be removed and
      flash frozen and sent to St. Jude for RNA and DNA analysis. Some tissue will undergo
      histopathological analysis and tissue microarrays will be isolated.
