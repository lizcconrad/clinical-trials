  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Standard liver retrieval procedures for transplantation from a deceased donor inevitably
      result in a &quot;reperfusion injury&quot; to the liver tissue. The purpose of this research study is
      to find out whether treatment of the liver with a &quot;preconditioning&quot; protocol before its
      removal from the donor will help reduce any of this injury.

      The &quot;preconditioning&quot; treatment being tested has two components. Firstly, a solution of
      glucose+insulin is infused and secondly, blood flow to the liver is stopped briefly (10
      minutes) and then resumed. Both strategies, individually, have been shown to reduce liver
      tissue injury in human studies.

      We hypothesize that combining both strategies will have a clinical benefit to patients and
      will improve liver function following transplant.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Liver transplantation is the only chance of cure for patients with end-stage liver disease.
      Unfortunately, standard organ preservation results in an ischemic-reperfusion injury (IRI) at
      the time of graft implantation. Novel strategies have been proposed to decrease reperfusion
      injury and improve graft function. This study will be the first to combine both strategies in
      a randomized, prospective trial. The intervention will occur during the retrieval surgery
      prior to cold preservation. Briefly, a glucose and insulin solution will be infused via the
      mesenteric vein at a controlled rate. Immediately prior to cross-clamping, blood supply to
      the liver will be restricted for 10 minutes and then resumed for 10 minutes before beginning
      cold preservation. All remaining surgical procedures, including the recipient surgery, will
      be performed by standard techniques. The liver recipient does not directly receive any
      intervention during this study.

    <description>A 20% dextrose+insulin infusion is administered to the liver via the mesenteric vein beginning after cannulation of the mesenteric vein and ending immediately prior to flushing with cold preservation fluid. Also, after completion of the visceral dissection but prior to cross-clamping, ischemic precondition will occur. This involves occluding the portal vein and hepatic artery to stop blood flow for 10 minutes, then restoring blood flow for 10 minutes.</description>
