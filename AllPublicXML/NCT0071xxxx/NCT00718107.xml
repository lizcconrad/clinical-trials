      The purpose of this study is :

        1. To assess the ALS patient's satisfaction related to a hospital stay on the neurology
           floor of Hahnemann Hospital.

        2. To compare the reported satisfaction of those individuals who stayed in a standard
           hospital room with those who stayed in Room 1455. Room 1455 is a room specifically set
           up with assistive technology related to environmental controls for individuals with
           disabilities.

        3. To look at frequency of use of the various pieces of adaptive equipment.
