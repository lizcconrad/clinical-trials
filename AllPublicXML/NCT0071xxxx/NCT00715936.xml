  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the integration of an early child
      'stimulation and care for development' intervention, either alone or in combination with an
      'enhanced care for nutrition' intervention, delivered by Lady Health Workers to families with
      infants and young children aged 0-24 months living in rural Sindh in Pakistan, has beneficial
      outcomes on child development (cognitive, language, motor and social emotional development)
      and child growth.

      In Pakistan, the &quot;National Program for Family Planning and Primary Healthcare&quot; delivers
      maternal and child health and nutrition services in rural and remote areas of Pakistan
      through community-based Lady Health Workers. The strengths of the programme include provision
      of services at grassroots levels, reinforcement of health and basic nutrition messages and
      community acceptability. Given, the growing recognition that optimal early child development
      (ECD) also requires the integration of psychosocial care; the PEDS-Trial has been proposed to
      evaluate the benefits of the addition of 'stimulation and care for development' interventions
      and the feasibility of scaling up an ECD strategy within the community healthcare system of
      Pakistan.
