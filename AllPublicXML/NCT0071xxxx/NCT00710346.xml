      The purpose of this study is to collect information and tissue samples from women with
      uterine fibroids. The samples will be used to study genes, proteins and other substances in
      order to better understand the disease process and improve fertility and reproductive health.

      Women who are scheduled to undergo hysterectomy, myomectomy or other surgery due to uterine
      fibroids or to an unusual variant of fibroid disease, such as HLRCC or benign metastasizing
      leiomyomatosis, may be eligible for this study.

      Tissue samples are collected from participants during surgery. The samples are coded and
      catalogued for research use. Data collected regarding the surgery include the sample
      location, surgery type, reason for surgery and the primary and secondary diagnoses.
      Additional data collected about the participant include date of birth, race, ethnicity,
      weight, height, smoking status, information about menstrual cycles, medications and family
      history.

      The long term goal of this protocol is to create a repository of well-characterized fibroid
      (leiomyoma) tissues in order to gather information that will lead to improved understanding
      of uterine fibroid growth and pathogenesis. It is expected that this initiative will
      eventually improve fertility and reproductive health of the millions of women who suffer from
      fibroids.

      To address the need for increased research in this field, the NICHD in collaboration with the
      Office of Research on Women s Health (ORWH) will establish a national fibroid tissue bank.
      This initiative will strengthen the science base, improve our understanding of how uterine
      fibroids develop and grow, and provide clues to more effective conservative management of
      fibroids. The rationale for this protocol is that a repository of well-characterized,
      well-preserved leiomyoma tissues will provide investigators interested in basic and
      translational research on fibroids the opportunity to study the condition. This will
      facilitate research because experiments conducted on the samples may be expected to improve
      understanding of the mechanism and pathophysiology of this disease.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Women aged 21-80 with uterine fibroids

          -  Medically indicated hysterectomy, myomectomy or other surgery for uterine fibroids.

          -  Samples from patients with unusual variants of fibroid disease (HLRCC, benign
             metastasizing leiomyomatosis) will be included. These samples may possibly not arise
             from the uterus proper, as the leiomyoma may have become located elsewhere in the
             body.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Inability to give consent or understand the consent forms.

          -  HIV-infected tissues will be excluded due to concern of equipment contamination.

          -  Hepatitis-infected tissues will be excluded due to concern of equipment contamination.
