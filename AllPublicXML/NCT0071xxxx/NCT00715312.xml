  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: The effect of positional distribution of dietary fatty acids on markers of
      inflammation and blood lipids metabolites on diets containing fatty acids such as oleic acid
      that are associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease is not widely studied.

      Hypothesis: There would be difference detected in the concentrations of markers of
      inflammation and blood lipid metabolites in human volunteers fed controlled diets.

      Study design: A randomized, double-blind, crossover clinical trial that involves 41 healthy
      volunteers. The volunteers will be selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. They
      will consume controlled diets for 5 weeks that provides 15% of energy from protein, 30% of
      energy from fat, and 55% of energy from carbohydrates. Volunteers will be assigned to each
      test diets which is cooked with novel olein, palm stearin or partially hydrogenated soybean
      oil in random order until all three diets has consumed by each person.

      Main study parameters: LDL-cholesterol
