    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of, and the immune
      response to a non-adjuvanted H5N1 influenza vaccine in an adult and elderly population and in
      specified risk groups. Furthermore, persistence of H5N1 influenza antibodies after
      vaccination with this vaccine will be assessed.
