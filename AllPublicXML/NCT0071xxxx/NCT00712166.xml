  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a 28-day course of
      aztreonam for inhalation solution (AZLI) in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), mild lung
      disease (forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1] &gt;75% predicted, and Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa (PA) infection.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CF patients often have lung infections that occur repeatedly or worsen over time. The lung
      infections are often caused by a bacteria called Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA). Treatment with
      antibiotics can stop or slow down the growth of the bacteria. The antibiotics may be given by
      mouth, intravenously (IV), or by inhalation as a mist. The purpose of this study was to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of AZLI, an investigational formulation of the antibiotic
      aztreonam and administered three times a day using the PARI eFlow® electronic nebulizer, in
      CF patients with PA and mild lung disease.

      In this study, participant eligibility was assessed at a screening visit that occurred up to
      14 days prior to the baseline visit (Day 0). Those participants who met eligibility criteria
      at Day 0 were randomized and began a 28-day course of blinded study treatment (AZLI or
      placebo TID). Participants returned for clinic visits at Day 14, an end of treatment visit at
      Day 28, and a follow up visit 14 days after the last dose of the trial drug (Day 42).

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire - Revised (CFQ-R) Respiratory Symptoms Scale (RSS) Score at Day 28</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 to Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>The CFQ-R is a validated patient-reported outcome measuring health-related quality of life for children and adults with CF. The CFQ-R contains both general and CF-specific scales. The CFQ-R was administered at Days 0, 14, 28, and 42. The endpoint was change in respiratory symptoms (e.g., coughing, congestion, wheezing) from Day 0 (baseline), assessed with the CFQ-R RSS (score range: 0-100; higher scores indicating fewer symptoms, higher health-related quality of life, or better functioning). Baseline CFQ-R RSS and age group (&lt;18 vs. &gt;=18 years) were included as covariates in the analysis.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Using Additional (Nonprotocol-specified) Antipseudomonal Antibiotics During Study</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 to Day 42</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants requiring additional antipseudomonal antibiotics (oral, intravenous [IV], or by inhalation), the time to use of these antibiotics, and the reasons for use was recorded. A binary variable was defined to indicate whether the participants needed any antipseudomonal antibiotics that were non-study drug via the oral, IV, or inhalation route between Day 0 (Baseline Visit) and Day 42 (Visit 5). Fisher's Exact Test was implemented on the intent-to-treat (ITT) and per protocol analysis sets to detect treatment effects on need for additional antipseudomonal antibiotics.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Hospitalized During Study</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 to Day 42</time_frame>
    <description>Hospitalization was defined as any hospital admission lasting for more than 1 calendar day that had been recorded as a serious adverse event (SAE) on the electronic case report form (eCRF). Binary variables were defined to indicate whether participants experienced any hospitalization. Number of hospitalizations was summarized by treatment group.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Log10 Pseudomonas Aeruginosa (PA) Colony Forming Units (CFUs) in Sputum at Day 28</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 to Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Sputum samples were collected at all study visits for quantitative and qualitative culture for PA. Sputum PA density was quantified by logarithm transformation of the CFU value with base 10. Change from baseline in sputum PA density was calculated as the difference between the log10 CFU values at Day 28 (Visit 4) and the baseline value. Missing data was not imputed. Baseline log10 CFU and age group (&lt;18 vs. &gt;=18 years) were included as covariates in the analysis.</description>

    <measure>Relative Change From Baseline in Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) Percent Predicted</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 to Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Spirometry was performed according to American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines at each visit. Treatment effect on the relative change from baseline in FEV1 percent predicted at Day 28 (Visit 4) was tested by the ANCOVA model using the ITT analysis set. Baseline FEV1 percent predicted and age group (&lt;18 vs. &gt;=18 years) were included as covariates in the analysis.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants were randomized at 39 sites in total: 34 in the United States, 1 in Canada, and 4 in Australia. Date of first screening was 16 June 2008, and date of last participant observation was 19 June 2009.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Planned trial size was approximately 140 participants randomized in 1:1 ratio to aztreonam for inhalation solution (AZLI) three times daily (TID) or placebo TID. 160 participants were randomized, 157 received blinded study drug (76 AZLI; 81 placebo). One participant who was randomized and treated with study drug discontinued the study.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire – Revised (CFQ-R) Respiratory Symptoms Scale (RSS) Score at Day 28</title>
        <description>The CFQ-R is a validated patient-reported outcome measuring health-related quality of life for children and adults with CF. The CFQ-R contains both general and CF-specific scales. The CFQ-R was administered at Days 0, 14, 28, and 42. The endpoint was change in respiratory symptoms (e.g., coughing, congestion, wheezing) from Day 0 (baseline), assessed with the CFQ-R RSS (score range: 0-100; higher scores indicating fewer symptoms, higher health-related quality of life, or better functioning). Baseline CFQ-R RSS and age group (&lt;18 vs. &gt;=18 years) were included as covariates in the analysis.</description>
        <time_frame>Day 0 to Day 28</time_frame>
        <population>Analysis on intent-to-treat (ITT) population (received at least part of 1 dose of AZLI/placebo). Missing baseline data not imputed.

          <description>The CFQ-R is a validated patient-reported outcome measuring health-related quality of life for children and adults with CF. The CFQ-R contains both general and CF-specific scales. The CFQ-R was administered at Days 0, 14, 28, and 42. The endpoint was change in respiratory symptoms (e.g., coughing, congestion, wheezing) from Day 0 (baseline), assessed with the CFQ-R RSS (score range: 0-100; higher scores indicating fewer symptoms, higher health-related quality of life, or better functioning). Baseline CFQ-R RSS and age group (&lt;18 vs. &gt;=18 years) were included as covariates in the analysis.</description>

        <description>The number of participants requiring additional antipseudomonal antibiotics (oral, intravenous [IV], or by inhalation), the time to use of these antibiotics, and the reasons for use was recorded. A binary variable was defined to indicate whether the participants needed any antipseudomonal antibiotics that were non-study drug via the oral, IV, or inhalation route between Day 0 (Baseline Visit) and Day 42 (Visit 5). Fisher’s Exact Test was implemented on the intent-to-treat (ITT) and per protocol analysis sets to detect treatment effects on need for additional antipseudomonal antibiotics.</description>

        <title>The Minimum Concentrations of Aztreonam That Inhibit 50% and 90% of All PA Isolates (MIC50 and MIC90, Respectively)</title>
        <description>Aztreonam susceptibility of PA isolates from expectorated sputum samples (collected at all visits) was assessed. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is the lowest concentration of antimicrobial agent that inhibits visible growth of a microorganism. The MIC50 and MIC90 for PA is the MIC required to inhibit the growth of 50% or 90% of PA isolates, respectively. Given that there might be multiple PA isolates for each participant, the MIC50 and MIC90 for PA was calculated using the MIC values for all PA isolates. The MIC50 and MIC90 were calculated by treatment group.</description>

          <title>The Minimum Concentrations of Aztreonam That Inhibit 50% and 90% of All PA Isolates (MIC50 and MIC90, Respectively)</title>
          <description>Aztreonam susceptibility of PA isolates from expectorated sputum samples (collected at all visits) was assessed. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is the lowest concentration of antimicrobial agent that inhibits visible growth of a microorganism. The MIC50 and MIC90 for PA is the MIC required to inhibit the growth of 50% or 90% of PA isolates, respectively. Given that there might be multiple PA isolates for each participant, the MIC50 and MIC90 for PA was calculated using the MIC values for all PA isolates. The MIC50 and MIC90 were calculated by treatment group.</description>
