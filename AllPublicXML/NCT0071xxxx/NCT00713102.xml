      The goal of this retrospective study is to describe emergency relevant illnesses occurring in
      airline passengers.

      An epidemiologic database documenting medical and surgical emergencies across European
      airlines will provide access to data potentially valuable for further flight-epidemiological
      research. Data on medical emergencies / per rpk (revenue passenger kilometres) are sparse and
      often based on data from a single airline. While handling the data the regulations of the
      data protection act of the Ethic commission of the Ruhr-University Bochum are fully
      respected. As noted, evaluation of the data will be completely anonymized without any
      information regarding the airline or other details than the passengers illness.

      Preview: The results of the study specified above will be submitted for publication in a peer
      review and Medline listed journal.

      Study Design: Retrospective, epidemiological study for the evaluation of medical and surgical
      emergencies on board airliners.

      Patients: In the context of a retrospective study approximately 20,000 patient data from 32
      European airlines are collected and statistically evaluated.

      Documentation: The direct documentation takes place through project responsible person into
      an electronic statistical data base.
