  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is conducted in Asia. The aim of this observational study is to evaluate the
      incidence of major hypoglycaemic episodes and other adverse events, and to evaluate efficacy
      while using insulin under normal clinical practice conditions. The switch from OAD treatment
      to insulin therapy will be determined by physician.
