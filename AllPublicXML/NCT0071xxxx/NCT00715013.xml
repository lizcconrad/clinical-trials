      Patupilone trial for patients with recurrent glioblastoma, which are planned for
      re-operation. Objectives: prolongation of PFS compared to patients with re-operation only,
      Patupilone tumor concentrations, pharmacokinetic, Perfusion in MRI pre - and post Patupilone.
      Translational research of tumor tissue exposed to patupilone.

        -  Trial with medicinal product

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prior to and after re-operation patients with recurrent glioblastoma receive the
      investigational drug Patupilone, a tubulin-inhibitor.

      The purpose of the trial is to prolong PFS in this patient population. Patupilone is already
      used in clinical trials of other tumor entities such as ovarian cancer, breast and lung
      cancer. Side effects are expected to be manageable.
