  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There have been numerous studies comparing various ACD measurements in phakic eyes,while
      researches comparing ACD in pseudophakic eyes are less extensive. With the recent popularity
      of presbyopia correction, measuring the ACD will facilitate differentiating pseudophakic
      accommodation from pseudoaccommodation. It is thus mandatory to verify the accuracy of ACD
      measurement of these devices since the innovation of various IOLs in the recent decade makes
      this task more complicated. In this study, we will assess the limitations of using Pentacam
      for ACD measurement in pseudophakic eyes and compare Pentacam measurement with IOLMaster and
      A-scan measurements.

      In this prospective study, ACD was measured in 90 phakic and 94 pseudophakic eyes by
      Pentacam, IOLMaster and A-scan. Correlations and differences between the three measurements
      were investigated. The accuracy in detecting the anterior lens surface in pseudophakic eyes
      was also assessed.Differences in ACD-Pen, ACD-IOLM, and ACD-A were analyzed using one-way
      analysis of variance (ANOVA). When an overall significance of P&lt; 0.05 was obtained, pair-wise
      comparisons were made using Tukey's multiple comparison t tests. The association between
      ACD-Pen, ACD-IOLM, and ACD-A was assessed using Pearson's correlation test. The distribution
      of erroneous ACD-Pen measurement for the three IOLs was analyzed with the chi-square test. In
      all analyses, P &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.

        Ninety phakic eyes were randomly selected for study from the outpatient clinic. Ninety-four
        pseudophakic eyes that had a standard clear cornea phacoemulsification with one of three
        acrylic IOLs (MA60BM, SA60AT, SN60AT) implanted into the capsular bag by the same surgeon
        were also studied.
