      This is a Phase 1 study during which patients with advanced/metastatic solid tumors will
      receive investigational study drug ARRY-334543 and capecitabine. Patients will receive
      increasing doses of study drug in combination with capecitabine in order to achieve the
      highest dose of study drug possible that will not cause unacceptable side effects. Patients
      will be followed to see what side effects the combination causes and what effectiveness the
      combination has, if any, in treating the cancer. Approximately 30 patients from the US and
      Canada will be enrolled in this study.

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of any advanced/metastatic cancer
             suitable for treatment with capecitabine. Pancreatic cancer is not allowed and
             patients with gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer are only eligible if
             prior treatment did not include a total gastrectomy.

          -  Target lesions may be in a previously irradiated field only if progression of the
             lesion has been clearly documented.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0, 1 or 2.

          -  Must be able to take and retain oral medications.

          -  Additional criteria exist.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active concomitant malignancies.

          -  Uncontrolled or symptomatic brain metastases (if a patient has brain metastases and is
             on steroids, the steroid dose must be stable for at least 30 days).

          -  Known dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency.

          -  Requiring intravenous (IV) alimentation.

          -  Known positive serology for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B and/or
             hepatitis C.

          -  Pregnancy or lactation.

          -  Chemotherapy, anticancer immunotherapy, monoclonal antibodies or biologics within 21
             days prior to first dose of study drug.

          -  Anti-EGFR and/or ErbB2 small molecule targeted therapy or hormonal anticancer therapy
             within 14 days prior to first dose of study drug.

          -  History of any hypersensitivity to or intolerance of capecitabine or any of its
             components, or to fluorouracil or any fluoropyrimidine therapy.

          -  Additional criteria exist.
