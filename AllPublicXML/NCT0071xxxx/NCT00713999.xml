    <textblock>
      A cross-sectional study of urogenital schistosomiasis and sexually transmitted infections
      (STI) prevalence and associated morbidity in a rural community in Madagascar. Clearance of
      infections and resolution of morbidity were subsequently studied in two phases following
      systematic anti-STI and anti-schistosoma treatment, respectively.

      The study was conducted in the Schistosoma haematobium high-endemic SIRAMA sugarcane
      plantation near the Ambilobe town in the northern province of Diego Suarez in Madagascar. A
      neighboring low-endemic village, Mataipako, was selected a control village. Participants aged
      15 to 49 years old from SIRAMA were included in the study if positive for S.haematobium egg
      in urine.

      A questionnaire addressing previous medical history and current urogenital symptoms was
      applied. A physical examination, including ultrasonophical (US) examination of urinary tract
      by transabdominal route, was undertaken. A pelvic examination, including transvaginal US was
      performed in women. In men, the prostate and the seminal vesicles were examined by
      transrectal US.

      The following sexually transmitted infections (STI) were systematically assessed:

        -  Neisseria gonorrheae

        -  Chlamydia trachomatis

        -  Mycoplasma genitalium

        -  Trichomonas

        -  Treponema pallidum

        -  Herpes simplex 1 and 2

      After baseline assessment, all participants (and partners) were systematically treated with
      an anti-STI regimen according to the existing guidelines by the Ministry of Health in
      Madagascar.

      Re-assessment by questionnaire, physical examination and sampling for STIs was undertaken 4
      weeks later followed by systematic praziquantel treatment to general community, including
      study participants.

      A final follow-up study following the baseline protocol was conducted 5 months later.
