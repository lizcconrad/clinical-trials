      Objectives: Examine the acute utility of immediate maintained cannulations of a newly
      implanted prosthetic arteriovenous access. Background: Recurrent failure of central
      catheterization is not uncommon. An alternative access is necessary for acute hemodialysis
      after the exhaustion of central veins. Methods: We constructed the access by cannulating two
      dialysis needle-catheters and securing them on the skin after the implantation of the graft.
      The access was used immediately and maintained for one week and thereafter used as a
      long-term access.
