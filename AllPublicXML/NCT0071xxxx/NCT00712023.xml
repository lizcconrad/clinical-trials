  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a custom-made forced-air warming mattress
      can prevent heat loss in patients undergoing vascular surgery better than a circulating-water
      mattress

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A reusable, custom-made forced-air warming mattress was made of a light to medium weight
      water resistant canvas, sewn like mattress with 2 arms placed underneath the patient. An open
      hole at proximal part of one arm was designed to attach with a hose of warm air delivery
      device. Small holes (2-3 mm2), 5 inches apart were punched on the upper surface of this
      mattress around the patient except for the area underneath the patient that the holes were 9
      inches apart. The weight of the patient will obstruct the air flow and prevent direct blowing
      of warm air onto the underside of patients. There is a special appendage connected to the
      upper part of mattress which can connect warm air to cover the patient's chest. There is a
      special appendage connected to the upper part of mattress which can convect warm air to cover
      the patient's chest. The mattress is 97 inches x 97 inches, with 2 arms of 25 inches x 16
      inches and a special appendage of 45 inches x 12 inches for covering the chest with warm air
      delivery. This size is proper for patient of 170 cm. height. In order to reuse it, the
      mattress can be washed, dried and sterilized by gas or autoclaved for more than 50 times. A
      sterile sheet well enhance the sterile environment of the operating field.
