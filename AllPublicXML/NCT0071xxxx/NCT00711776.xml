        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy Japanese adult males between 20 and 55 years of age, inclusive.

        Healthy subjects are defined as individuals who are free from clinically significant
        disease as determined by their medical history, physical examination, clinical laboratory
        examinations, vital sign, 12-lead ECG, immunology tests and urinary drug screen test.

          -  Bodyweight &gt;50 kg and body mass index (BMI) between 18.5 and 28.0 at screening.

          -  Subjects must be capable of providing written informed consent, which includes
             compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

          -  Baseline QTc interval &lt;450 msec.

          -  Non-smoker or ex-smoker having ceased smoking for at least 6 months.

          -  Clinical laboratory examination (AST, ALT, ALP and GGT) at screening are within the
             normal range.

          -  The subject is able to attend all visits and complete the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any clinically relevant abnormality identified on the screening physical examination,
             vital sign measurement, 12-lead ECG recording and/or clinical laboratory examination
             that is deemed by the principal investigator and/or medical monitor to make the
             subject ineligible for inclusion because of a safety concern.

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption exceeding, on average, 14 drinks/week (1 drink
             = 5 ounces (150 mL) of wine or 350 mL of beer or 1.5 ounces (45 mL) of 80 proof
             distilled spirits) within 6 months of screening.

          -  Positive for urine drug at screening.

          -  Positive for syphilis, HIV antibody, Hepatitis B surface antigen, Hepatitis C antibody
             or HTLV-1 antibody at screening.

          -  Donation of blood in excess of 400mL within 4 months or 200mL within 1 months prior to
             at screening.

          -  History of drug abuse, or current conditions of drug abuse or alcoholism.

          -  Participation in a clinical study or post-marketing study with an investigational or a
             non-investigational product or device within 4 months of preceding the first
             application of study medication.

          -  Participation in another clinical study or post-marketing study in which the subject
             is or will be exposed to an investigational or a non-investigational product or
             device.

          -  History of asthma, anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions, severe allergic responses.

          -  The subject has an allergy for any drug or idiosyncrasy. This excludes a pollen
             allergy without current symptoms.

          -  At the part obtaining keratinized layer, having exanthem, pigment abnormality, the
