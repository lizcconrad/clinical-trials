  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims at investigating the diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance angiography
      using the contrast agent Vasovist® in the detection of relevant vascular narrowing of the
      lower extremity. Patients who have been scheduled for intra-arterial conventional angiography
      are eligible for this trial.

  <detailed_description>

      Patients will only be included into the study if either MRA with extracellular contrast
      agents, computed tomography angiography, ultrasound or i.a. DSA have been performed
      beforehand and if the patient has been scheduled for an i.a. DSA to be performed. Vasovist®
      enhanced MRA imaging will be performed using a state-of-the-art 1.5T MR system. Recruitment,
      baseline examinations, Vasovist®-enhanced MRA of the vessel segments of interest and
      follow-up examinations will be performed in up to 8 radiological clinics in Europe. The
      safety follow-up period will be at least 12 hours but not more than 24 hours post injection
      of Vasovist® and includes the assessment of physical examinations and vital signs as well as
      the assessment of AEs. DSA must be carried out at least 12 hours after Vasovist®
      administration and only after the last follow-up visit has been performed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have Fontaine-stage III and IV and an indication for therapeutic i.a. DSA

          -  PAOD has to be confirmed by ECCM MRA, CTA, non-selective DSA, Doppler ultrasound (DUS)
             prior to the study.

          -  Patients who are willing to undergo the study MRA procedure with Vasovist

          -  Patients who are willing to comply with the study procedures (e.g. being followed-up
             for 12 hours after the Vasovist injection).

          -  Being clinically unstable and whose clinical course during the 12 hours observation
             period is unpredictable.

          -  Being scheduled for, or likely to require, any surgical intervention within 12 hours
