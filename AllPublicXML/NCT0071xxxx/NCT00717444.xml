  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this Stage 1 therapy development project, we plan to develop, formalize, and derive effect
      size estimates of a contingency management (CM) therapy that focuses on improving health,
      especially as related to increasing low intensity physical activities, such as walking,
      resistance training, and stretching. The Healthy Activities for Prize Incentives (HAPI)
      intervention will be targeted toward and tested within HIV-positive substance abusers who
      attend HIV drop-in centers. After initial therapy development in a Stage 1a pilot project
      with 9 patients, the therapy manuals and materials will be adapted and refined. In a Stage 1b
      controlled trial, we will recruit and randomize 70 substance abusing HIV-positive patients to
      (a) HAPI plus 12-step facilitation therapy or (b) contingency management for abstinence plus
      12-step facilitation therapy. Each intervention will consist of one weekly individual therapy
      session for 16 weeks. All participants will provide urine and breath specimens twice weekly
      that will be tested for opioids, cocaine, methamphetamine, marijuana and alcohol. Patients in
      both conditions will earn the chance to win prizes for submitting drug-negative specimens,
      and those randomized to the HAPI condition will also earn the chance to win prizes for
      engaging in healthy activities. Physical activity levels, drug use, psychological symptoms,
      and subjective and objective indicators of health (body mass index, waist circumference,
      blood pressure, viral load) will be measured pre-treatment and at months 2 and 4
      (post-treatment), as well as at a 7-month (3 months after treatment) follow-up evaluation.
      Compared to those receiving 12-step facilitation with contingency management for abstinence,
      we expect that those in the HAPI condition will participate in more physical activities,
      decrease drug use to a greater extent, evidence reduced depression, and show trends toward
      improvements in health indices. If effect sizes in at least the small to medium range are
      noted across all domains, we will consider the therapy appropriate for further evaluation in
      a Stage 2 therapy development study.
