  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis has greatly decreased but not abolished early-onset
      neonatal sepsis caused by GBS. According to current recommendations, the evaluation of
      infants at risk for GBS sepsis should include a complete blood count (CBC), WBC differential,
      a blood culture (BC) and a period of observation. The usefulness of CBC and BC in the
      evaluation process is not firmly established.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After implementation of appropriate guidelines, early-onset GBS sepsis has become a low
      incidence disease (CDC). Recent rates are as low as 0.34 cases /1000 live births. According
      to CDC recommendations, the evaluation of infants at risk for GBS sepsis should include a
      complete blood count (CBC), WBC differential, a blood culture (BC) and a period of
      observation. The usefulness of CBC and BC in the evaluation process is not firmly
      established. There are several reviews on the predictive value of CBC and putative markers of
      early onset neonatal sepsis, but there seems to be no ideal laboratory test to assist the
      clinician in the diagnosis (Fowlie 1998, Malik 2003, Ottolini 2003). Given the continuing
      concerns about the reliability of laboratory tests, one may ask the question of whether
      physical examination might be at least as good as haematological indices. We are not aware of
      studies assessing the value of physical examination vs CBC, in the evaluation of asymptomatic
      at risk newborns.

      The aim of this study was to compare two approaches in the management of infants at risk for
      GBS sepsis: laboratory tests (CBC, differential and BC) with observation vs clinical
      observation alone.

    <description>Asymptomatic infants born to GBS-positive mothers or to mothers with risk factors and incomplete prophylaxis were managed according to the CDC protocol. Blood cultures and CBC were performed and the infant was observed for 48 hours. Participating hospital were free to perform any additional test, such as CRP, MiniESR, etc</description>

    <description>Asymptomatic infants born to GBS-positive mothers or to mothers with risk factors and incomplete prophylaxis were managed with clinical observation only. Clinical surveillance was based on 3 signs: 1. Skin appearance (pink, pale, mottled, cyanotic); 2. Respiratory rate (&gt;50 or &lt;50 breaths per minute); 3. Dyspnea (Yes / No)</description>
