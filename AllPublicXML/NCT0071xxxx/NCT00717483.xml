  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The landmark study Diabetes Control and Complication Trial (DCCT) clearly showed that
      intensive insulin management delays the onset and progression of longterm complications in
      adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). The same clinic trial also showed increased
      rate of severe hypoglycemia which required assistance. The risks of severe hypoglycemia,
      defined as loss of consciousness or seizure associated with hypoglycemia, include lower
      HbA1C, younger age, higher insulin dose, male sex, lower parental socioeconomic status,
      non-Hispanic white ethnicity, longer duration of disease, the presence of psychiatric
      disorders, and underinsurance.

      The purpose of this protocol is to explore the relationship between hypoglycemic seizures and
      BMI.

      This is a retrospective study using questionnaire/survey/interview. We will give subjects a
      letter stating the purpose and describing the study. We will answer all questions they have
      about the study. Once the parents and patient verbally agree to participate in the study, we
      will proceed with the survey.
