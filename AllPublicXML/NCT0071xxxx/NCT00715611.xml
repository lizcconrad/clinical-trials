  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For patients with this type of cancer, the standard of care is treatment with chemotherapy.
      Radiation therapy is typically not used. This is because radiation to the entire lining of
      the lung has many side effects that are often severe including damage to the lung
      (pneumonitis). There is a new radiation technique using Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy
      (IMRT) that has been shown to reduce many of the side effects of standard radiation therapy.
      This type of radiation therapy specifically targets the lining of the lung, where you have
      your cancer, and reduces the risk of damaging the lung itself. The purpose of this study is
      to test the safety and implementation of standard pleurectomy/decortication (removal of the
      surface lining of the lung) performed at other centers. Patients will undergo
      pleurectomy/decortication chemotherapy and hemithoracic pleural IMRT to the pleura in
      patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma.

    <description>This is a multicenter phase II toxicity study of pleurectomy/decortication (P/D) followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) to the pleura in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma. Alternatively, chemotherapy may be administered in the neoadjuvant setting prior to P/D, followed by IMRT. Patients deemed resectable at the time of enrollment will undergo P/D with the goal of a macroscopic complete resection (MCR). Those with disease progression or severe toxicity will stop chemotherapy and undergo a PET scan.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Provide written informed consent to participate on the study

          -  Patients must have a pathologically confirmed diagnosis either at MSKCC or at the
             participating site of stage I-III malignant pleural mesothelioma

          -  Epithelioid or biphasic histology subtype (Note: patients with biphasic histology can
             have &lt; 10% sarcomatoid)

          -  No evidence of metastatic disease.

          -  Patient age ≥ 18 years but ≤ 80 years at the time of consent.

          -  Karnofsky performance status ≥ 80%

          -  Pulmonary Function Tests:

               1. For all patients: DLCO &gt; 40% predicted (corrected for Hgb)

               2. For patients enrolled post-P/D, only: FEV1 &gt;/= 35% (corrected for Hgb) (Note:
                  patients enrolled prior to P/D will have PFTs repeated pre-IMRT. If this criteria

             to the kidneys, an optional nuclear medicine kidney function scan may be performed
             prior to radiation therapy to determine the functional contribution of each kidney.
