    <textblock>
      Examine the efficacy of a stepped-care smoking cessation intervention for current and former
      smokers in chemical dependency treatment programs. We hypothesize that those who received the
      stepped-care intervention will be more likely to report smoking abstinence and drug or
      alcohol abstinence at 6 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to document and systematically investigate the use of smoking
      cessation strategies targeting substance abuse outpatient smokers at various level of
      readiness to quit smoking. Little is known regarding the best practices in treating tobacco
      use among clients in drug abuse treatment and very few drug abuse treatment programs
      currently offer smoking cessation services. The purpose of this developmental study is to
      develop and pre-test a stepped-care smoking cessation intervention in an outpatient drug
      abuse treatment program at a managed care setting that targets both current and former
      smokers. The stepped-care intervention consists of various components that aim at matching
      the treatment needs of smokers across the whole spectrum of smoking status and readiness to
      quit smoking. The following specific aims will be pursued:

        1. Develop a stepped-care smoking cessation intervention targeting both current and former
           smokers who are admitted to an outpatient drug abuse treatment program. Special
           attention will be paid to former smokers, as intervention techniques for them are not
           well developed. Also, intervention content will be modified from that used in smoking
           interventions with the general population to content that is targeted at smokers who are
           in drug abuse treatment

        2. Pre-test the efficacy of the stepped-care smoking cessation intervention.

        3. Examine the feasibility of implementing the stepped-care smoking cessation intervention.

        4. Examine the impact of the smoking intervention on drug and alcohol use outcomes at
           6-month post initiation of smoking cessation treatment.

    <description>Participants will receive self-help information handouts, expert system intervention that includes a stage-based manual and individualized written feedback reports plus in-person brief stage-appropriate counseling at baseline and 3-month assessment. Current smokers who indicate desire to quit smoking or former smokers who indicate high cravings for cigarettes will be offered nicotine replacement medications. Participants will receive three telephone counseling sessions delivered between baseline and 3 month at weeks 2, 4 and 8. As-needed telephone check-calls will be provided to participants on and 2 days after quit date, or to participants who have quit smoking and anticipate high risk situations.</description>
