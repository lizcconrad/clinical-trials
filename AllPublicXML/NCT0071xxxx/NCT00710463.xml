      Hypothesis: Hospital based, comprehensive pulmonary rehabilitation of patients with COPD in
      GOLD stage IV can be optimized by application of nocturnal non invasive ventilation.

      This hypotheses shall be tested by an observational trial, comparing rehabilitation effects
      of a prospectively observed group receiving non invasive ventilation, compared wiht a
      historical control group of patients who did received the same treatment without non invasive
      ventilation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non invasive ventilation is known to allow improvements if applied during endurance training,
      but this is technically difficult. Nocturnal application of non invasive ventilation is known
      to unload the ventilatory pump, reset the control of breathing, and improve sleep quality.

      The protocol also aimed to evaluate the acceptance of non invasive ventilation in patients
      undergoing a four week inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation programme.

        All patients were recruited at a single center, the rehabilitation hospital &quot;Klinikum
        Berchtesgadener Land&quot; at Germany.

        Patients entering the well defined, hospital based pulmonary rehabilitation programme after
        Januar 1, 2005 were additionally treated with nocturnal non invasive ventilation. The
        results of these patients were compared with a group of patients who underwent the same
        rehabilitation programme in the years 2003 to 2005, when non invasive ventilation was not
        availabe.
