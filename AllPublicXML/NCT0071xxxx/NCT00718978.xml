      The aim of this work was to present the investigators experience in the use of autologous
      three-cellular cultured skin substitutes (CSS) consisting of cultured keratinocytes,
      melanocytes and fibroblasts attached to a scaffold of hyaluronic acid. This method represents
      a surgical alternative in the treatment of a variety of pathologies, including burns, ulcers
      and giant nevi.

      Background and Objective:

      Permanent wound closure remains a limiting factor in the closure of extensive, full-thickness
      loss of substance. The aim of this work was to present our experience in the use of
      autologous three-cellular cultured skin substitutes (CSS) consisting of cultured
      keratinocytes, melanocytes and fibroblasts attached to a scaffold of hyaluronic acid. This
      method represents a surgical alternative in the treatment of a variety of pathologies,
      including burns, ulcers and giant nevi.

      Methods:

      CSS were obtained from full-thickness skin biopsies collected after enrollment of 11 patients
      in a study protocol approved by the local Institutional Review Boards of the &quot;La Sapienza&quot;
      University of Rome. CSS consisted of a structure characterized by the presence of a
      pluristratified epithelial cell surface with melanocytes (relation 1/20) and a basement of
      fibroblasts kept together by an esterified hyaluronic acid scaffold that can be surgically
      manipulated, and is gradually reabsorbed after implantation and substituted by the host
      connectival stroma.
