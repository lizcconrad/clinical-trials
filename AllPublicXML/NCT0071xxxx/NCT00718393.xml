    <textblock>
      Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a uniformly progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disorder
      for which there is no known cure. In a novel attempt to widen the search for potential
      therapeutic agents, a NINDS- led cooperative group performed an in-vitro screening program of
      1040 FDA approved drugs in over 28 assays relevant to various neurodegenerative disorders.
      Several cephalosporins showed hits in ALS relevant assays. Efficacy was noted in models
      suggesting increased expression of the astrocytic glutamate transporter, EAAT2, as well as
      models of superoxide dismutase mediated toxicity. Ceftriaxone is a third generation
      cephalosporin with good CNS penetration, a long half-life, and was effective in both types of
      ALS assays. Ceftriaxone has calcium binding activity, antioxidant properties, and rescues
      motor neurons in culture from chronic glutamate toxicity. Since completion of the original
      NINDS screen, Ceftriaxone has been shown to increase by three fold EAAT2 activity in rodent
      brains, due to ceftriaxone's ability to increase EAAT2 promotor activation This program is
      for the use of ceftriaxone in ALS for compassionate care. Currently ceftriaxone is approved
      by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating bacterial infections but not for
      treating ALS. However, there is an ongoing phase I study -by NEALS Consortium and the
      National Institute of Health- with three cohorts -a placebo group and two groups receiving
      either 2 or 4 grams of ceftriaxone daily-. Unfortunately there are only a limited number of
      patients being enrolled and the next phase of the project will not be undertaken until next
      year. At this point there are ALS patients unable to participate in this Phase I trial and
      unlikely to be alive when the next phase of study begins. Some of these patients want to
      receive the drug and are willing to pay for the drug and nursing care. We are therefore
      requesting a compassionate use protocol for these patients who request the medication and are
      willing to pay for the drug and nursing care to administer it. Dr. Terry Heiman-Patterson
      will supervise the administration and safety monitoring including labs for renal and hepatic
      function as well as IV site inspection.
