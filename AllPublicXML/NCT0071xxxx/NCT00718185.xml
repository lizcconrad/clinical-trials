      The study is being done to investigate what happens to sildenafil in the body and how long it
      takes to get rid of this drug. Understanding how long the drug stays in the body and how it
      is changed by the body will help doctors determine the best dose. We also want to learn how
      well the medicine works based on the size of the dose or amount in the bloodstream.

      There is no data regarding sildenafil drug disposition in infants and children with pulmonary
      hypertension. Sildenafil is used at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia for the treatment
      of pulmonary hypertension. Patients receiving sildenafil as standard of care will be
      approached for consent.
