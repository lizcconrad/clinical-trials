      The purpose of this study is to collect and evaluate long-term safety and effectiveness data
      on the Exactech® NOVATION ™ Ceramic Articulation Hip System (&quot;NOVATION ™ Ceramic AHS&quot;). Ten
      (10) years of follow-up data will be collected in this study. The first five (5) years of
      subject follow-up will involve clinical (Harris Hip Score, adverse events), radiographic, and
      self-assessment evaluation. The remaining five (5) years of subject follow-up will be
      accomplished with an outcomes questionnaire that will be completed by the subjects to
      evaluate the survivorship status of their hip replacement.

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Patient is undergoing primary hip surgery for symptomatic Non-inflammatory
             Degenerative Joint Disease (NIDJD). Composite diagnosis of NIDJD includes osteo/
             degenerative arthritis, traumatic arthritis, congenital hip dysplasia and avascular
             necrosis.

          2. Patient is 21 years of age or older at the time of surgery.

          3. Patient is skeletally mature (tibial and femoral epiphyses are closed).

          4. Patient is willing and able to return for follow-up as specified by the study protocol
             over a ten (10) year post-operative follow-up period; including 5 years of in-clinic
             visits followed by 5 years of mail-in questionnaire follow-up.

          5. Patient is female and of childbearing age, for whom a negative urine pregnancy test is
             obtained immediately prior to surgery.

          6. Patient does not meet any of the Exclusion Criteria.

          7. Patient agrees to participate and sign the Informed Consent Form.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Patient will be less than 21 years old at the time of surgery.

          2. Patient is skeletally immature.

          3. Patient presents with inflammatory degenerative joint disease.

          4. Patient has evidence of active infection, but not including asymptomatic urinary tract
             infection (UTI) if treated with antibiotics preoperatively.

          5. Patient is female and of child bearing age and is pregnant or whose pregnancy status
             is unknown.

          6. Patient has neurological or musculoskeletal disease that may adversely affect gait or
             weight bearing.

          7. Patient has known presence of active metastatic or neoplastic disease (active is
             defined as within the past 5 years. Does not include basal cell carcinoma in cases
             when a subject with this diagnosis has undergone radical excision of the lesion, has
             pathological proof that the lesion has clean and clear peripheral and deep borders,
             and the location of the lesion is not near the operative hip or on the affected
             extremity).

          8. Patient has poor bone quality (e.g., osteoporosis) where, in the investigator's
             opinion, there is inadequate bone to support the implant(s).

          9. Patient has the presence of a previous prosthetic hip replacement device (any type,
             including THA, surface replacement arthroplasty, endoprosthesis, etc.) in the
             operative hip joint.

         10. Patient is known to have presence of a highly communicable disease or diseases that
             may limit follow-up (e.g., immuno-compromised conditions, hepatitis, active
             tuberculosis, etc.).

         11. Patient is a prisoner.

         12. Patient is obese where obesity is defined as a Body Mass Index (BMI) greater than 35.
             BMI = Weight (lbs.) ÷ Height (in.)2 x 703

         13. Patient has neuropathic joints.

         14. Patient has known allergies to the implant materials.

         15. Patient is unwilling or unable to comply with postoperative rehabilitation
             instructions and weight bearing limitations.

         16. Patient's life expectancy is &lt; 5 years due to chronic diseases such as cancer,
             congestive heart failure, etc.

         17. Patient is unwilling or unable (e.g. cases of reduced mental capacity) to return for
             follow-up as specified by the study protocol over a ten (10) year post-operative
             follow-up period.

         18. Patient has reduced mental capability (permanent or temporary) that would prevent
             following pre-surgical and post-surgical instructions.

         19. Patient otherwise meets the study criteria but refuses to consent in writing to
             participate in the study.
