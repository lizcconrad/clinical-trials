      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of trauma-focused cognitive behaviour therapy
      (TF-CBT) versus eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) in the treatment of
      trauma survivors with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Patients will be randomly
      assigned to TF-CBT or EMDR. Follow-up assessments will be conducted at 3 and 12 months
      post-treatment. In addition to comparing the efficacy of the two protocols, an additional
      focus will lie on identifying predictors for treatment outcome.
