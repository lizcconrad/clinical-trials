  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of TENS in addition to routine care
      in patients with chronic pain of predominantly neuropathic origin, compared to treatment with
      routine care alone.&quot;

      Hypothesis:

      An eventually neuropathic pain component is needed to be identified and alleviated in chronic
      pain patients to improve the quality of rehabilitation.

      0-hypothesis:

        -  TENS is not better than than placebo, medication or standard rehabilitation program.

        -  A neuropathic pain component does not demand special considerations in rehabilitation of
           chronic pain patients.

      Setting:

      Skogli helse- og rehabiliteringssenter, Lillehammer, Norway. Center of Rehabilitation for
      chronic pain patients, rheumatic diseases and orthopedic postoperative patients.

      Duration:

      Until 18 months of intervention + 6 months of follow up and preparation.

      Intervention:

      Use of TENS during 3-4 weeks of hospitalization connected to multimodal rehabilitation
      (short-term efficacy). TENS or placebo-TENS is added to routine care.

      Follow-up:

      If patients want to continue the use of TENS/placebo-TENS at home, they will be offered to
      borrow equipment for 4 months. Questionnaires will be send at 2 and 4 months, both for the
      active group, the placebo group and for the group of patients who discontinued the use of
      TENS/placebo-TENS (long-term efficacy).
