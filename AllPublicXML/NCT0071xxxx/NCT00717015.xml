      We hypothesized that subjects with CYP2D6*10 alleles may have a lower steady state levels of
      endoxifen due to reduced conversion of tamoxifen to endoxifen.

      Primary objectives:

        -  To determine the steady state pharmacokinetics of tamoxifen and its metabolites

        -  To test the effects of genetic polymorphisms of CYP2D6 on plasma concentration of
           tamoxifen and its metabolites in hormone receptor positive women who are taking
           tamoxifen as adjuvant treatment for breast cancer.

        We aim to enroll 200 patients onto our study over a period of 2 years. Patients will be
        recruited from the oncology outpatient clinic in National University Hospital.
        Participation in the study will be strictly voluntary and written informed consent will be
        obtained from all subjects according to institutional and governmental guidelines. Consent
        will be obtained by attending doctors or co-investigators of the study prior to blood
        sampling.
