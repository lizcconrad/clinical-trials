  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine the feasibility of adjuvant chemotherapy and chemo-radiotherapy for
      patients with surgically resected adenocarcinoma of the stomach and gastro-esophageal
      junction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with localized gastric cancer often relapse either locally or systemically. A
      strategy to reduce relapses at common sites would be beneficial. Our prior trial has proved
      the feasibility of administering FOLFIRI regimen as adjuvant chemotherapy combined with
      adjuvant chemoradiation in patients with excised with curative intend gastric cancer. It
      would be important to improve the treatment involving active regimen as adjuvant chemotherapy
      and optimizing chemoradiation by introducing capecitabine as a radiosensitizer.
