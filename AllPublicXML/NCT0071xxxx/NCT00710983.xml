  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our group has discovered that routine vaccinations in childhood may have non-specific and
      sex-differential effects on overall mortality. The effects are so large that they may have
      marked effects on overall mortality and seriously distort female-to-male mortality rates in
      high-mortality settings. We recently experienced periods during which oral polio vaccine
      (OPV) was lacking. Hence, some children did not get the recommended OPV at birth. We were
      following all infants as a part of a vitamin A supplementation trial. Surprisingly, we
      discovered that not receiving OPV was associated with significantly lower mortality in boys,
      but not in girls. We bled a subgroup of the children. Receiving OPV at birth significantly
      dampened the immunological response to BCG given at birth in both sexes. Based on these
      observations, receiving OPV at birth may have two negative effects, first, it may increase
      male mortality, and second, it may interfere with immunity against tuberculosis. OPV at birth
      is given for logistic reasons, to boost polio immunity. There have been no polio cases in
      Guinea-Bissau for the last 10 years. Hence, there is every reason to test in a randomised
      trial whether not receiving OPV at birth is associated with 1) mortality, morbidity and
      growth and 2) immunological response to BCG.
