    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of pomegranate polyphenol pills (POM-X)
      and a placebo (sugar pill) on prostatic oxidative stress. The placebo is a pill that looks
      like the POM-X pill but does not have an active ingredient.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will receive POM-X or placebo pills daily for up to 4 weeks prior to undergoing
      radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer. Biomarkers in the blood, urine, and prostate
      tissue will be assessed.

             beyond to lymph nodes, bone, or visceral organs.

          2. Radical prostatectomy scheduled at Duke or Johns Hopkins.

          3. Initial prostate biopsy available for review with tumor involving 2 or more core
             biopsies based on pathologic review.

          4. Age â‰¥ 18 years of age.

          5. Willingness and ability to sign an informed consent document.

          7. No prior allergy to pomegranate dietary agents.

          8. No significant medical or psychiatric condition that would make the patient a poor
             protocol candidate.

          9. The patient agrees to stop taking dietary or vitamin supplements (lycopene, vitamin E,

         10. The patient is not taking LHRH agonists, androgen receptor blocking agents or
             finasteride, and has not undergone bilateral orchiectomy.

         11. Patient has not received experimental medications within the past six months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Significant concomitant medical or psychiatric condition that, in the opinion of the

          3. Known allergy to pomegranate juice.

          4. Subjects unable or unwilling to comply with protocol requirements.
