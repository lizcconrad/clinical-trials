      RATIONALE: Internal radiation uses radioactive material placed directly into or near a tumor
      to kill tumor cells. Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation
      directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of internal radiation therapy when
      given with or without external-beam radiation therapy and to see how well it works in
      treating patients with localized prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Evaluate the tolerability of 2 radiotherapeutic regimens (high dose-rate brachytherapy
           [HDR] with or without image-guided intensity-modulated hypofractionated external beam
           radiotherapy [EBRT]), as measured by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
           (CTCAE v3.0), in patients with localized prostate cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Identify any associations between dose-volume parameters for organs at risk and the rate
           and severity of genitourinary or gastrointestinal adverse events.

        -  Evaluate patient preference with regard to selection of a second treatment (a second HDR
           brachytherapy session or an EBRT session).

        -  Evaluate patient-reported health-related quality of life (HRQOL) as measured by
           validated HRQOL instruments for 5 years.

        -  Describe the probability of freedom from biochemical and clinical failure.

        -  Describe the probability of freedom from salvage androgen suppression.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo high dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy (2 fractions ≥ 5 hours apart).
      Beginning 2-4 weeks after completion of the first HDR brachytherapy session, patients undergo
      either a second session of HDR brachytherapy (2 fractions ≥ 5 hours apart) OR image-guided
      intensity-modulated hypofractionated external beam radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week for
      3 weeks.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, prior to the second treatment session, at 1 and 6
      months after completion of treatment, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually for 2
      years.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 and 6 months, every 6 months
      for 3 years, and then annually for 2 years.
