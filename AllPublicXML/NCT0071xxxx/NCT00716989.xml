  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the vaccination is to induce humoral (antibody) and intracellular (T lymphocyte)
      responses. Various data show that intradermal vaccination is more efficient than
      intramuscular vaccination: the humoral response is statistically better after intradermic
      vaccination, compared to intramuscular vaccination, even in target populations such as older
      subjects or immunosuppressed patients

      Realisation of 2 groups of healthy subjects with 2 intradermal injection of 50 µl of
      tuberculin + 2 intradermal injection of 50 µl of physiological serum. 5 biopsy performed on 2
      Tuberculin injection site, 2 physiological serum site and 1 on healthy skin site :

        -  Group A : healthy young subjects(18 to 40 years old) : 18 subjects

        -  Sub-group A1 (biopsy 30 minutes after injection) : 6 subjects

        -  Sub-group A2 (biopsy 4 hours after injection) : 6 subjects

        -  Sub-group A3 (biopsy 72 hours after injection) : 6 subjects

        -  Group B : healthy old subjects(60 to 75 years old) : 18 subjects

        -  Sub-group B1 (biopsy 30 minutes after injection) : 6 subjects

        -  Sub-group B2 (biopsy 4 hours after injection) : 6 subjects

        -  Sub-group B3 (biopsy 72 hours after injection) : 6 subjects

      Determination of the best time (30 minutes, 4 hours or 72 hours)for intradermal vaccination
      caracteristics after group A and B data analysis. From these results, last group of
      immunosuppressed patients performed:Group C with 6 immunosuppressed patients (18 to 60 years
      old)
