    <textblock>
      The PACT Study (Physical Activity after Cancer Treatment) is a unique study within the field
      of cancer rehabilitation in Denmark. It differs from other studies mainly due to the
      intervention itself. A combination of physiological, health educational and therapeutic
      elements will be tested. These components are incorporated into a one-year training program
      for mixed groups (i.e. men + women, with varying cancer diagnoses) to encourage them to
      enhance their well.-being and quality of life. The overall aim of this approach is to place
      increased focus on the treated cancer patient's introduction to and exploitation of both
      physiological and psychosocial yields through physical exercise. Whether or not the study
      results bear a positive effect, they are expected to support new knowledge in rehabilitation
      for cancer survivors.

      The PACT ('Physical Activity after Cancer Treatment') Study is a multidisciplinary
      collaborative study carried out by the University Hospitals Centre for Nursing and Care
      Research (UCSF) and the Finsen Center (Oncology and Hematology Clinics) of the Copenhagen
      University Hospital (Rigshospitalet), Copenhagen, Denmark. The project draws in cancer
      patients who have undergone chemotherapy and who are now disease-free or at a stable phase in
      their illness and have good prognoses.

      The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of a 12-month rehabilitation program
      comprising supervised and structured physical exercise training (body conditioning;
      strength-building; relaxation; massage), patient education and coaching combined with a
      home-based physical exercise group component and will include a control group. Groups of
      12-15 patients will be formed (mixed genders; different oncological and hematological
      diagnoses) who will train together once weekly during the intervention period. Participation
      in a training program with peers is seen as a positive motivational factor that stimulates
      and challenges the patient through physical activity, to use his/her own resources to
      establish sustainable coping strategies.
