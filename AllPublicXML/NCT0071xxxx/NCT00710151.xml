  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to investigate cognition in long term survivors of Primary
      Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL). Sometimes caregivers as well as patients who no
      longer have the disease report cognitive problems such as reduced memory or attentional
      dysfunction and decreased quality of life. Unfortunately, little is known about what may
      contribute to this cognitive dysfunction in part because PCNSL is a rare disease and
      sensitive tests have not often been used in the research studies. This project is being
      conducted to help understand what factors, such as radiation, may contribute to cognitive
      dysfunction and better define the relationship between brain structure and thinking in people
      who have had PCNSL.

      This is an international, multi-center project that will enroll as many as 118 subjects of
      which approximately 35 will be enrolled at Oregon Health &amp; Science University (OHSU).
      Neuropsychological testing will consist of a battery of paper and pencil tests that examine
      abilities such as memory, motor skills, attention and speed of information processing.
      Questionnaires that assess quality of life will also be administered. These noninvasive tests
      are administered by a trained examiner or neuropsychologist and last about 30 minutes.
      Subjects will also undergo an MRI of the head which provides a picture of the brain's
      structure by placing an individual inside a powerful magnet. Statistical analyses will
      examine the relationship between the neuropsychological test scores and magnetic resonance
      (MR) images as well as examine the contribution of factors such as radiation, age, surgery,
      chemotherapy etc. to cognition.
