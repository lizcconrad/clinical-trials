      RATIONALE: Morphine may reduce pain in patients who have undergone radiofrequency ablation to
      remove bone metastases.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well morphine works after radiofrequency
      ablation of painful bone metastases in patients with cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Measure the efficacy of morphine sulfate at 8 weeks after radiofrequency ablation (RFA)
           of bone metastases.

      Secondary

        -  Assess minimum and average pain and analyze use of morphine sulfate before and after
           RFA.

        -  Determine disease progression by CT scan of bone.

        -  Evaluate the percentage of relief associated with RFA, specifically patient
           satisfaction, quality of life, anxiety, depression, and physical performance during RFA.

        -  Assess complications and side effects related to RFA and the evolution of possible side
           effects associated with morphine sulfate therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients complete a pain questionnaire over 1 week before undergoing radiofrequency ablation
      (RFA). Patients also complete questionnaires about pain, physical performance, quality of
      life (QOL), and anxiety at baseline.

      Bone metastases are removed by radiofrequency ablation (RFA). After surgery, patients receive
      acetaminophen and patient-controlled analgesic (PCA) morphine sulfate. PCA morphine sulfate
      continues with a dose increase of 50% bolus every 24 hours. Patients with maximum pain less
      than or equal to that at inclusion receive standard morphine sulfate therapy instead.

      Data concerning the total dose of PCA morphine sulfate; minimum, average, and maximum pain
      intensity; side effects and complications of RFA; and total dose of morphine sulfate (or
      equivalent) is collected daily.

      Pain is assessed at 4 and 8 weeks after RFA. Patients complete follow-up questionnaires about
      physical performance, QOL, and anxiety at 12 weeks. Patients also undergo a CT scan at 12
      weeks.
