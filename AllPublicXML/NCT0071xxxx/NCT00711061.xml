      The purpose of this study is to compare the cardiovascular risks of growth hormone deficient
      young adult males who have completed growth hormone therapy to healthy young adult males.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adults with growth hormone deficiency are at risk for cardiovascular disease. What age this
      begins is not known.

      The objectives of this study are to compare the following measurements between growth hormone
      deficient young males 3-7 years post completion of growth hormone treatment and age related
      healthy controls:

        1. Carotid artery imaging

        2. Metabolic and cardiac parameters

        3. Body composition measurements
