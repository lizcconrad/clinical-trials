      In this study, the concentration of antibody to the vaccine one year, three and five years
      after vaccination in subjects who were vaccinated with GSK Biologicals' meningococcal vaccine
      GSK134612 in a previous study (whose objectives &amp; outcome measures are presented in a
      separate protocol posting with NCT number =00471081) will be evaluated. The safety and immune
      response of a booster dose of vaccine GSK134612 administered at 5 years post-primary
      vaccination will also be evaluated. In addition, the immune response to a dose of vaccine
      GSK134612 administered to age-matched controls not previously given a meningococcal vaccine
      will be evaluated.

      This protocol posting has been updated further to protocol amendment 2, dated 28 october
      2010. The sections impacted are summary, study design, outcome measures, intervention, and
      eligibility criteria.

      GSK Biologicals has developed a meningococcal conjugate vaccine (GSK134612). This candidate
      vaccine has been shown to be well tolerated and immunogenic in toddlers.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the antibody persistence at approximately 1 year, 3
      years and 5 years post-administration of one dose or two doses of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)
      Biologicals' meningococcal vaccine GSK134612 when given to healthy toddlers 9-12 months of
      age. To evaluate, the safety and immunogenicity of a booster dose of GSK134612 administered
      to all eligible subjects at 5 years after the primary vaccination. To evaluate the safety and
      immunogenicity in a new group of subjects aged 5-6 years (naive control group) who will
      receive a single dose of vaccine GSK134612.
