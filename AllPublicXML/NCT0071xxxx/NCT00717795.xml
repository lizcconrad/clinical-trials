  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn how many lung cancer survivors will agree to a physical
      activity program. We also want to know if lung cancer survivors benefit from this program.
      This information will help us to develop our services for lung cancer survivors.

At this time, the PA intervention will be offered at no cost to the participants in the control condition. If the waitlist participant chooses to complete the PA intervention after the 12 week waitlist period, program satisfaction will be assessed after study completion.</description>

        In total, we will recruit and enroll a random sample of 70 lung cancer survivors who are at
        least one year post thoracic surgical resection and have no evidence of NSCLC or any other
        cancer at the time of study enrollment and not receiving any adjuvant treatment.

          -  Evidence of significant medical cognitive or psychiatric disturbance sufficient, in
             the investigator's judgment, to preclude participation in the intervention
