  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how often women have problems passing their urine
      (voiding) after TVT (Tension Free Vaginal Tape) surgery. This will help us to better
      understand normal voiding function after surgery as well as to find factors that may help us
      predict who will have problems after surgery.
