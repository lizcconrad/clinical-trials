  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical investigation is designed to describe the long-term safety and efficacy of the
      CVRx Rheos Baroreflex Hypertension Therapy System in patients who participated in the
      DEBuT-HT study beyond the original follow up period (4-months or longer). The information
      obtained in this trial is intended to support regulatory approvals and market release of this
      therapy.

    <textblock>
      This extension study, designed as a long-term follow up, will monitor the course of the
      disease and its treatment safety and efficacy by collecting the appropriate data and using
      data collected under the long term provisions of the DEBuT-HT study to describe and analyze
      the changes in ongoing drug treatment, the programming parameters of the implanted active
      device and any occurring adverse events over a period of up to 13 months after implant
      surgery in the DEBuT-HT trial. Annual follow-ups of up to five years are planned subsequently
      to the 13-month follow-up period.
