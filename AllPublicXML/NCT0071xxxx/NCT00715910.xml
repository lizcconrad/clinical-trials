  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the concentration of antibody to the vaccine one year, three and five years
      after vaccination in subjects who were vaccinated with GSK Biologicals' meningococcal vaccine
      GSK134612 and Menactra® in a previous study (whose objectives &amp; outcome measures are
      presented in a separate protocol posting with NCT number =00454909) will be evaluated. The
      safety and immune response to a booster dose of vaccine GSK134612 administered at 5 years
      post-primary vaccination and a primary vaccination of a newly enrolled group with GSK 134612
      vaccine will also be evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GSK Biologicals has developed a meningococcal conjugate vaccine (GSK134612). This candidate
      vaccine has been shown to be well tolerated and immunogenic in subjects as of 12 months of
      age.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the antibody persistence at approximately 1 year, 3
      years and 5 years post-administration of one dose of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals'
      meningococcal vaccine GSK134612 as compared to Menactra® (meningococcal serogroups A, C,
      W-135 and Y-diphtheria toxoid conjugate vaccine, sanofi pasteur) when given to healthy
      adolescents/ adults 11 to 25 years of age In addition, the safety and immunogenicity of a
      booster dose of GSK134612 administered to all eligible subjects at 5 years after the primary
      vaccination will be evaluated.

      Another cohort of subjects (naïve control group) 15 to &lt;31 years of age will be offered a
      dose of MenACWY-TT vaccine at the same time to allow for evaluation of a primary (naïve
      control group) and booster dose within the same study.

      This Protocol Posting has been updated following Protocol Amendment 1, May 2010 and Protocol
      Amendment 2, May 2011.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>At Year 5, subjects in Nimenrix 1, Menactra and Nimenrix 2 groups received a booster dose of Nimenrix. During booster phase, subjects in Nimenrix 1 and Nimenrix 2 groups were pooled. An additional naïve control group 15 to &lt; 31 years of age was enrolled at Year 5.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 818 subjects were enrolled in the study. Year 1, 3 and 5 included only those subjects who came for the visits during these persistence years.</pre_assignment_details>
