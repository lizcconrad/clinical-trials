    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if it is feasible and safe to use the REG1
      Anticoagulation System instead of unfractionated heparin during percutaneous coronary
      intervention (PCI) in subjects with coronary artery disease (CAD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study drug, REG1, is the first specific, direct-acting, antidote-controlled anticoagulant
      ever described. Regado is developing REG1 for use in patients suffering from acute coronary
      syndrome who undergo coronary revascularization procedures. These procedures, which include
      coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), put
      patients at high risk for therapy-related bleeding complications. REG1 is being developed
      initially to increase therapeutic flexibility and improve patient outcomes in coronary
      revascularization procedures.

      REG1 is a two-component system, consisting of an aptamer-based anticoagulant and its matched
      antidote. The REG1 anticoagulant component (RB006) is a single-stranded, nucleic acid
      aptamer. RB006 selectively and potently binds to and inhibits Factor IXa, a protein critical
      to blood coagulation. The antidote component, RB007, is a complementary nucleic acid that
      binds to and neutralizes RB006. The binding of RB007 to RB006 causes the predictable and
      rapid reversal of the RB006 effect and allows the patient's blood to return to normal.

    <description>ii. The REG1 anticoagulation system consists of a drug (RB006) and antidote (RB007). The drug (RB006) is administered via IV bolus to achieve anticoagulation. The antidote (RB007) is administered as an IV bolus dose at approximately 10% the total reversal dose followed by the remaining dose several hours later to counteract RB006 induced anticoagulation.</description>
