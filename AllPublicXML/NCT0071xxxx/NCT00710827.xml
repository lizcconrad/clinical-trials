      Explorative objectives: Change in grip strength (Subgroup only: optional for sites with
      experienced in testing muscle function); Change in physical performance test i.e. lower limb
      muscle strength (subgroup only; optional for sites experienced in testing muscle function).
      Please note that the 2 explorative objectives mentioned above must be performed together. All
      measured at baseline, week 30, week 54, no safety measure. Safety parameters Prostate safety:
      digital rectal examination (DRE) Measured at screening, week 30+ 54, safety measure.
      International prostate symptom score (IPSS): International prostate symptom score (IPSS)
      Measured at screening, week 18, 30, 42, 54, safety measure. Laboratory tests for lipids
      (total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides) and liver function
      tests (aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT)) Measured at
      screening, week 6, 18, 30, 42, 54, safety measure. Standard laboratory tests for androgen
