  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I multicenter study that will be conducted in the United States and consists
      of a double-blind, placebo-controlled, SAD stage, followed by a double-blind, placebo
      controlled MAD stage. The study will be conducted in approximately 65 adult patients between
      18 and 80 years old who have RA.
