      Objective: The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of the monolayer
      preparation (Cyto Lyt or Thin prep) to the routine use of Papanicolau methods on the analysis
      of specimens obtained using EUS-FNA.

      Introduction: The presence of a pathologist during an endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine
      needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) is often a luxury. In addition, preparation of multiple slides
      for a fine needle aspiration can be time-consuming for the gastroenterologist who waits for
      verbal feedback on the adequacy of the specimen. Often, a timely diagnosis is needed to
      direct patient management. Currently, there is no established standard of care for EUS-FNA
      preparation. A liquid based cytologic fixative preparation (Thin-prep or CytoLyt), is a
      well-established process used by pathologists for evaluating cervical smears. It has not yet
      been adopted or accepted for EUS-FNA. This method combines multiple aspirates on a single
      slide, thereby decreasing the number of slides that need to be processed and interpreted by
      the pathologist

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with known or suspected malignancy (solid mass or lymph node) that are
             undergoing EUS will be eligible to participate in this study.

          -  Target lesions such as ascites and cystic lesions will not be considered for this
             study. However, if a patient has an abnormal solid lesion and abnormal lymph node in
             addition to the ascites or cystic lesion, they may still be considered for the study.
             That is, the solid lesions and abnormal lymph nodes are appropriate target lesions for
             this study.

          -  No evidence of dementia or altered mental status that would prohibit the giving and
             understanding of informed consent, and no evidence of psychiatric risk that would
             preclude adequate compliance with this protocol.

          -  Subject must provide signed written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects that have had a previous EUS-FNA are eligible for this study

          -  Target lesions such as ascites and cystic lesions will not be considered for this
             study.
