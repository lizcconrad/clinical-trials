      The purpose of the potential research study participant registry is to keep potential
      research subjects informed about any future research studies in which they may meet the
      criteria for enrollment. The purpose of this study is also to assist current and future
      clinical trials with recruitment of subjects.

      Methods:

      Subjects will self identify themselves via the UCDMC Dermatology website to complete a survey
      regarding their interest in learning about future dermatology clinical research projects.
      Subjects provide contact information and check of a list of potential topics of interest.

      Procedures:

      Potential participants will find a link on the UCDMC Dermatology website to our registry. The
      potential participant will read information about the registry. If they wish additional
      information, they can follow a link to the potential research registry consent form. At this
      stage, the potential participant may answer, &quot;no&quot; to the consent form and they will be
      redirected back to the Clinical trials website. If they answer, &quot;yes&quot; then they will be
      linked to the registry questionnaire. The potential subject would then decide if they want to
      participate in the registry and if so what information they want to provide. The Clinical
      Research Coordinators would contact potential study participants to see if they meet the
      eligibility criteria for any of our current studies.
