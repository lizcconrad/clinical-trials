  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer patients often experience multiple physical, functional and psychosocial symptoms, but
      have limited support while being at home between treatments and during rehabilitation.
      WebChoice is a novel Internet support system that extends traditional health services into
      patients' homes. The system allows patients to monitor symptoms over time, and provides
      access to evidence-based self-management options tailored to their reported symptoms as well
      as a communication area where patients can ask questions to a clinical nurse specialist in
      cancer care and exchange experiences with other cancer patients.

      This randomized clinical trial:

        1. Tests the effects of WebChoice on primary outcomes of symptom distress, quality of life,
           depression and health service use, and secondary outcomes of self-efficacy, social
           support . We will also analyze:

        2. Relationships between primary and secondary outcomes;

        3. How patients' symptom distress varies over time;

        4. Patients' preferences for participation in decision making about symptom management

        5. How patients use WebChoice, such as frequency of use, duration, most used components;

        6. How patients' experience WebChoice's usefulness and ease of use;

        7. Patterns and content of patients' communication with the cancer nurse and other
           patients.

      325 cancer patients (189 breast cancer and 136 prostate cancer patients) were recruited from
      throughout Norway through advertisements and invitation letters and the Norwegian Cancer
      Registry. Patients were randomly assigned to WebChoice or the control group that received
      usual care. Patients are being followed with 5 repeated measures over 12 months. Data are
      being collected through questionnaires, from system logs, and from interviews that were
      conducted in subset of experimental group patients. The primary hypothesis will be tested
      with Repeated Measures ANCOVA techniques. The other research questions will be answered using
      various inferential and descriptive techniques and through content analysis of messages and
      transcripts of patient interviews. This study can make a significant contribution to reduce
      unnecessary suffering and improve the quality of life for a large group of cancer patients.
