  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 120 patients with chronic hepatitis C will be enrolled in a study of viral kinetics and
      liver gene expression before and during combination therapy with peginterferon and ribavirin.
      Adult patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection who have compensated liver
      disease and have not received interferon in the past will be randomized into one of four
      groups. Groups A and C will undergo liver biopsy before starting peginterferon therapy and
      Groups B and D will undergo biopsy 6 hours after the initial dose of peginterferon.
      Furthermore, Groups C and D will receive a run-in period of 4 weeks of ribavirin therapy
      before starting peginterferon. All patients will receive the standard recommended doses of
      peginterferon alfa 2a (180 mcg sc weekly) and ribavirin (1000 or 1200 mg daily for genotypes
      1, 4-6 and 800 mg daily for genotype 2 and 3) for up to 48 weeks (24 weeks for genotype 2 and
      3). All patients in Groups C and D, irrespective of genotype, will be pretreated with
      ribavirin at a dose of 1000 or 1200 mg, depending on patient body-weight. After the initial
      peginterferon injection, patients will have blood taken and symptoms recorded at 6, 24, 48,
      72 hours and weekly thereafter for four weeks to assess viral kinetic response. Liver biopsy
      tissue taken before or 6 hours after the initial dose of peginterferon will be assessed by
      standard light microscopy and also subjected to RNA extraction and microarray analysis of
      mRNA expression. Patients will be monitored carefully during therapy and tested regularly for
      HCV RNA levels. Therapy will be given for 48 weeks, but will be discontinued early for
      patients with genotype 1 infection if HCV RNA levels do not decline by at least 2 log IU/ml
      by week 12 (lack of an early virological response) or do not decline to undetectable levels
      by week 24 (lack of HCV RNA clearance). Patients with other genotypes with be treated for a
      full course of therapy regardless of early responses. After completing therapy, patients will
      be followed at 4 to 8 week intervals and undergo repeat medical evaluation with liver biopsy
      24 weeks after stopping therapy.

      The primary clinical criterion for success of therapy is a sustained virological response, as
      marked by the absence of HCV RNA from serum at least 24 weeks after stopping. The focus of
      this study, however, will be on viral kinetics comparing patients who were pretreated with
      ribavirin (Groups C and D) to those who were not (Groups A and B) as well as on gene
      expression studies assessing the effects of peginterferon on intrahepatic mRNA profiles by
      comparing Group A and B and the effects of ribavirin by comparing Group A to Group C and
      Group B to Group D. Results will also be compared between different HCV genotypes. These
      studies are aimed at assessing the mechanisms of action of peginterferon and ribavirin
      against HCV and evaluating the basis for the lack of virologic response to combination
      therapy.

      Adult patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection who have compensated liver
      disease and have not received interferon in the past will be randomized into two groups;
      group A will undergo liver biopsy before starting peginterferon therapy and groups B will
      undergo biopsy 6 hours after the initial dose of peginterferon. All patients will receive the
      standard recommended doses of peginterferon alfa 2a (180 mcg sc weekly) and ribavirin (1000

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Age 18 years or above, male or female

        Presence of HCV RNA (with or without anti-HCV) in serum at levels of at least 10,000 IU/ml.

        Willingness to undergo liver biopsy before or 6 hours after an initial injection of
        peginterferon.

        Written informed consent.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Previous adequate treatment with any form of type I interferon (standard alpha interferon,
        peginterferon, beta interferon). Adequate treatment is considered at least 12 weeks of
        therapy.

        Other antiviral therapy within the last 6 months.

        If cirrhosis is present, decompensated liver disease, as marked by bilirubin greater than 4
        mg percent, albumin less than 3.0 gm percent, prothrombin time greater than 2 sec
        prolonged, or history of bleeding esophageal varices, ascites or hepatic encephalopathy.

        Serum ALT or AST levels greater than 1000 micro/L (greater than 25 times ULN). Such
        patients will not be enrolled but may be followed until three consecutive determinations
        are below this level.

        Pregnancy or current breastfeeding. In women of child bearing potential or in spouses of
        such women, inability to practice adequate contraception, defined as vasectomy in men,
        tubal ligation in women, or use of condoms and spermicide, or birth control pills, or an
        intrauterine device until 6 months after the end of treatment with ribavirin given the
        potential for teratogenicity.

        Significant systemic or major illnesses including congestive heart failure, organ
        transplantation, serious psychiatric disease or depression, human immunodeficiency virus
        (HIV) infection, and angina pectoris.

        Pre-existing anemia (hematocrit less than 33 percent) or known history of hemolytic anemia.
        In patients in Groups C and D, liver biopsy will not be performed if hemoglobin levels fall
        to below 11 g/dl during ribavirin monotherapy. Epopoetin alfa or darbopoietin alfa therapy
        will be available to achieve an adequate hematocrit if clinically indicated for patients in
        all groups.

        Immunosuppressive therapy with either corticosteroids (more than 5 mg of prednisone daily
        on a chronic basis) or major immunosuppressive agents (such as azathioprine or
        6-mercaptopurine). Patients receiving a short-course of corticosteroids for acute allergic
        reactions or asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations (less than 2
        weeks of therapy) will be eligible for the study after 4 weeks off therapy.

        Evidence of another form of liver disease in addition to viral hepatitis (for example
        autoimmune liver disease, Wilson's disease, alcoholic liver disease, hemochromatosis, alpha
        1 antitrypsin deficiency). Patients with concomitant non-alcoholic steatohepatitis but no
        other form of chronic liver disease will not be excluded from this study.

        Evidence of coronary artery disease or cerebral vascular disease, including abnormalities
        on exercise stress testing in patients with defined risk factors who will be screened for
        evidence of underlying coronary artery disease.

        Active substance abuse, such as alcohol, inhaled or injection drugs within the previous
        year.

        Evidence of hepatocellular carcinoma; either alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels greater than
        200 ng/ml (normal less than 9 ng/ml) and/or ultrasound (or other imaging study)
        demonstrating a mass suggestive of liver cancer.

        Clinical gout.

        Active, serious autoimmune disease such as systemic lupus erythematosis, ulcerative
        colitis, Crohn s disease or rheumatoid arthritis that in the opinion of the investigators
        might be exacerbated by therapy with alpha interferon.

        These exclusion criteria are considered the standard relative contraindications to
        peginterferon and ribavirin therapy.
