  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the benefits and risks of lixisenatide (AVE0010), in
      comparison to placebo, as an add-on treatment to basal insulin with or without metformin over
      a period of 24 weeks of treatment, followed by an extension.

      The primary objective is to assess the effects of lixisenatide when added to basal insulin on
      glycemic control in terms of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) reduction at Week 24.

      The secondary objectives are to assess the effects of lixisenatide when added to basal
      insulin on body weight, 2-hour postprandial plasma glucose (PPG) after standardized meal
      challenge test, percentage of patients reaching HbA1c less than 7 percent (%), percentage of
      patients reaching HbA1c less than or equal to 6.5%, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), change in
      7-point self-monitored plasma glucose (SMPG) profiles, change in basal insulin and total
      insulin doses; to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and anti-lixisenatide
      antibody development.

      Patients who complete the 24-week main double-blind treatment would undergo a variable
      double-blind extension treatment, which ends for all patients at approximately the scheduled
      date of Week 76 visit (Visit 25) for the last randomized patients.

      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted at 111 centers in 15 countries between July 29, 2008 and February 8, 2011. The overall duration of treatment was at least 76 weeks (24 weeks main double-blind treatment; variable double-blind extension treatment).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 879 patients were screened of which 383 (43.6%) were screen failures; main reason for screen failure was glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values being out of the defined protocol range (greater than or equal to 7% and less than or equal to 10%). A total of 496 patients were randomized.</pre_assignment_details>

The on-treatment period for this efficacy variable is time from the first dose of study drug and up to 3 days after the last dose of study drug, on or before Visit 12 (Week 24) or Day 169 if Visit 12 is not available, and before the introduction of rescue therapy. For a patient to be included in mITT population, both baseline and at least 1 post baseline assessment for at least 1 efficacy variable, were required.</description>
          <population>mITT population:all randomized patients who received at least 1 dose;had baseline,at least 1 post-baseline efficacy assessment, irrespective of compliance with study protocol/procedures. LOCF was used. Number of patients analyzed=patients with baseline and at least 1 post-baseline HbA1c assessment during on-treatment period.</population>
