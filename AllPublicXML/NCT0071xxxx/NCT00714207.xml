  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine if a school-based multi-session group smoking
      cessation program is more effective than a single session group program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators reformatted two group smoking cessation programs (the NOT program of the
      American Lung Association and Kicking Butts), both of which involve 50 minute sessions
      delivered once weekly, into a program that could be delivered during school lunch periods
      (25-30 minutes) twice weekly. Smoking status was subsequently assessed over the 12 month
      period following the intervention,
