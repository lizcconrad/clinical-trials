    <measure>Change From Baseline to Endpoint in Number of Contiguous Activated Voxels Meeting Predefined Threshold in Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC) on Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) as a Measure of Prefrontal Cortical Activation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Endpoint (Week 2 or last observation after baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome was the change from baseline in number of contiguous activated voxels in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at Week 2(or last observation after baseline). Each voxel is compared to the reference wave form. If it differs from that value p&lt;0.05, the voxel is considered active. fMRI is a brain imaging technique that identifies neuronal activation related to specific tasks or sensory stimulation. Increased neuronal activity increases blood flow and oxygen content to the activated part of the brain, altering fMRI signal.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Endpoint in Mean Response Latency in the 2-Back Working Memory Test at Endpoint - Mean Performance Speed</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Endpoint (Week 2 or last observation after baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>The 2-Back is a verbal working memory test in which random letters are presented visually every 4 sec, with each stimulus lasting 500 msec. Subjects are asked to make a yes/no response following each letter indicating whether it was the same or different from the letter presented two earlier. The load on working memory was the ordering, retention, updating, and manipulation of 2 letters and consideration of the relationship to a 3rd newly presented letter, which could have been a target or a nontarget. The change from baseline in response latency at endpoint is presented here.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Endpoint (Week 2 or last observation after baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>The patient's evaluation of excessive daytime sleepiness was measured by the patient reported measure, ESS (Johns1991). The ESS score was based on responses to questions referring to 8 everyday situations (eg, sitting and reading, talking to someone, being stopped in traffic) and reflected a patient's propensity to fall asleep in those situations. The ESS score was derived from the sum of the values from questions corresponding to the 8 situations. Scores for the ESS ranged from 0 to 24, with a higher score indicating a greater daytime sleepiness. Change from baseline to endpoint is presented.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Endpoint (Week 2 or last observation after baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a brain imaging technique that identifies neuronal activation in regions related to specific tasks or sensory stimulation such as language, vision, hearing, and short-term memory. When neuronal activity increases, blood flow increases to that part of the brain with an increase in the oxygen content of the blood. Increase in oxygen content causes the fMRI signal in that part of the brain to change, and is the basis of the BOLD effect. The percent change in BOLD signal from Baseline to 2 weeks or last observation after baseline is presented here.</description>

    <description>During anatomic scanning (and prior to functional runs when anatomic scanning was not performed), a modified continuous 10 minute attention task (&quot;Psychomotor Vigilance Test [PVT]-like task,&quot; nearly identical to the PVT but for absence of performance feedback) was run to obtain a measure of vigilance in the scanner—in this instance, the &quot;+&quot; symbol appeared at random (mean inter trial interval of 5 seconds, range 2 - 10 seconds) but disappeared when subject pressed a button. Subject performance speed was measured. Change in subject performance speed from Baseline to Endpoint is presented.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Endpoint in Number of Contiguous Activated Voxels Meeting Predefined Threshold in Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC) on Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) as a Measure of Prefrontal Cortical Activation</title>
        <description>The primary outcome was the change from baseline in number of contiguous activated voxels in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at Week 2(or last observation after baseline). Each voxel is compared to the reference wave form. If it differs from that value p&lt;0.05, the voxel is considered active. fMRI is a brain imaging technique that identifies neuronal activation related to specific tasks or sensory stimulation. Increased neuronal activity increases blood flow and oxygen content to the activated part of the brain, altering fMRI signal.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Endpoint in Mean Response Latency in the 2-Back Working Memory Test at Endpoint - Mean Performance Speed</title>
        <description>The 2-Back is a verbal working memory test in which random letters are presented visually every 4 sec, with each stimulus lasting 500 msec. Subjects are asked to make a yes/no response following each letter indicating whether it was the same or different from the letter presented two earlier. The load on working memory was the ordering, retention, updating, and manipulation of 2 letters and consideration of the relationship to a 3rd newly presented letter, which could have been a target or a nontarget. The change from baseline in response latency at endpoint is presented here.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Endpoint in the Number of Contiguous Voxels Meeting the Predefined Threshold in the Posterior Parietal Cortex (PPC)</title>
        <description>The outcome was the change from baseline in number of contiguous activated voxels in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at Week 2(or last observation after baseline). Each voxel is compared to the reference wave form. If it differs from that value with p&lt;0.05, the voxel is considered active. fMRI is a brain imaging technique that identifies neuronal activation related to specific tasks or sensory stimulation. Increased neuronal activity increases blood flow and oxygen content to the activated part of the brain, altering fMRI signal.</description>

        <description>The RTI is a measure of simple and choice reaction time, movement time and spatio-temporal vigilance during simple and 5 choice reaction time trials. This task also permits measurement of anticipatory/premature responding and perseverative responding. The patient responded to a yellow spot appearing on the screen by letting go of the press pad and touching the location in which the spot appeared. The yellow spot appeared in any 1 of 5 locations in the 5 choice reaction time phase. The change from baseline to endpoint in median correct latency is presented.</description>

          <title>Reaction Time Index (RTI) Median Correct Latency, Five Choice Test From the CANTAB Battery-Change From Baseline to Endpoint</title>
          <description>The RTI is a measure of simple and choice reaction time, movement time and spatio-temporal vigilance during simple and 5 choice reaction time trials. This task also permits measurement of anticipatory/premature responding and perseverative responding. The patient responded to a yellow spot appearing on the screen by letting go of the press pad and touching the location in which the spot appeared. The yellow spot appeared in any 1 of 5 locations in the 5 choice reaction time phase. The change from baseline to endpoint in median correct latency is presented.</description>

        <description>OTS is a spatial planning test based on the Tower of London and the CANTAB Stockings of Cambridge test, and measures frontal lobe function. Patient shown 2 displays containing 3 colored balls and a row of boxes containing numbers. The patient was shown one demonstration problem and then solves 3 additional problems (easy). Problems increased in complexity, from one to six moves. With additional problems (hard) the patient had to work out how many moves the solutions required in their heads. Mean change from baseline to endpoint in number of choices to correct for hard problems is presented.</description>

        <title>Epworth Sleepiness Scale Change From Baseline to Endpoint</title>
        <description>The patient’s evaluation of excessive daytime sleepiness was measured by the patient reported measure, ESS (Johns1991). The ESS score was based on responses to questions referring to 8 everyday situations (eg, sitting and reading, talking to someone, being stopped in traffic) and reflected a patient’s propensity to fall asleep in those situations. The ESS score was derived from the sum of the values from questions corresponding to the 8 situations. Scores for the ESS ranged from 0 to 24, with a higher score indicating a greater daytime sleepiness. Change from baseline to endpoint is presented.</description>

When neuronal activity increases, blood flow increases to that part of the brain with an increase in the oxygen content of the blood. Increase in oxygen content causes the fMRI signal in that part of the brain to change, and is the basis of the BOLD effect. The percent change in BOLD signal from Baseline to 2 weeks or last observation after baseline is presented here.</description>

        <title>Number of Contiguous Activated Voxels Meeting Predefined Threshold in the PPC on fMRI by 2-Back Working Memory Test-Change From Baseline; Subgroup-Responders in 2 Back Memory Test</title>
        <description>This is a subgroup analysis of responders on the 2-back working memory test for the number of voxels (voxels that differ significantly from reference wave form) in Posterior Parietal Cortex (PPC). A responder in the 2-back working memory test was defined as a patient showing a response latency of less than 713 ms at endpoint. This is based on baseline data from the matched control population in a functional imaging study in patients with obstructive sleep apnea. The change from Baseline to Endpoint in the number of activated voxels for each treatment group among the responders is presented.</description>

        <title>Number of Contiguous Activated Voxels Meeting Predefined Threshold in the Thalamus on fMRI by 2-Back Working Memory Test-Change From Baseline; Subgroup-Non Responders in 2 Back Memory Test</title>
        <description>This is a subgroup analysis of non-responders on the 2-back working memory test for the number of voxels meeting the predefined threshold (voxels that differ significantly from reference wave form) on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). A non-responder in the 2-back working memory test was defined as a patient showing a response latency of 713 ms or greater at endpoint. The change from Baseline to Endpoint in the number of activated voxels in the thalamus for each treatment group among the non-responders is presented.</description>
