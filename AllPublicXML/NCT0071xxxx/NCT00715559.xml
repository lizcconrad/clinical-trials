  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether cysteamine bitartrate, an FDA-approved drug
      for a non-psychiatric condition, is safe and effective for the treatment of major depression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a chronic, disabling illness affecting about 17% of the
      general population. Despite advances in treatment, about two-thirds of patients fail to
      respond to an initial trial of pharmacotherapy. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a
      neural growth-promoting polypeptide found in the central nervous system, and has been
      implicated in the pathophysiology and potential treatment of MDD. A multitude of studies have
      shown low levels of BDNF in subjects with MDD, which have normalized after treatment with an
      antidepressant. Traditional antidepressants such as serotonin reuptake inhibitors may
      increase BDNF via an indirect intracellular pathway. The current study drug, cysteamine
      bitartrate (Cystagon), is FDA approved for the treatment nephropathic cystinosis and has been
      shown to increase BNDF in neuronal tissue, and to stimulate cell growth. Cysteamine has
      already been investigated in humans as a potential treatment for Huntington's Disease. Given
      the evidence of decreased levels in major depression, and subsequent increase post-treatment
      with antidepressants, BDNF may play a key role in developing novel treatments for patients
      who have failed conventional agents. Therefore, drugs that can demonstrably increase central
      BDNF, such as cysteamine, may have significant potential as novel antidepressant medications.

    <measure>Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)</measure>

    <measure>Clinical Global Impression Scales for Severity (CGI-S) and Improvement (CGI-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This set of scales measures &quot;global&quot; improvement in a patient's level of symptoms, without reference to a particular condition (ie depression). GCI-S is a measure of severity, which ranges from 0 (not ill) to 7 (severely ill). CGI-I is a measure of change, with a score of 4 indicating no change, 1 indicating very much improved and 7 indicating very much worse.</description>

    <measure>Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report (QIDS-SR16)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This is a self-report which measures the level of depression severity. I ranges from 0 (no illness) to 27 (severe illness).</description>

    <measure>Systematic Assessment for Treatment Emergent Effects (SAFTEE)</measure>
    <time_frame>weekly, for 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SAFTEE is used to measure somatic and other symptoms which may arise during the course of a clinical trial. This is a non-quantitative instrument that does not yield a numeric score. Instead, it provides study subjects the opportunity to check off symptoms listed on a checklist and indicate if the severity of the symptoms is &quot;mild&quot; &quot;moderate&quot; or &quot;severe.&quot; The reported values represent symptoms that were indicated at any point during the 8 week trial at a level of &quot;moderate&quot; or &quot;severe&quot; that also represented a change from a baseline-line pre-intervention SAFTEE assessment.</description>

    <description>All enrolled participants will begin open treatment with cysteamine on the first visit of the experimental period (after screening, medical clearance and medication washout period if necessary). The dosing schedule is a flexible regimen starting at 150 mg PO three times daily. After one week, patients without intolerable side effects will increase the dose to 300 mg three times daily. The titration schedule will continue up to a maximum of 1800 mg a day. In case of adverse events, the investigator may decrease the dose by 150 mg daily.</description>

        <description>This set of scales measures &quot;global&quot; improvement in a patient's level of symptoms, without reference to a particular condition (ie depression). GCI-S is a measure of severity, which ranges from 0 (not ill) to 7 (severely ill). CGI-I is a measure of change, with a score of 4 indicating no change, 1 indicating very much improved and 7 indicating very much worse.</description>

        <title>Systematic Assessment for Treatment Emergent Effects (SAFTEE)</title>
        <description>The SAFTEE is used to measure somatic and other symptoms which may arise during the course of a clinical trial. This is a non-quantitative instrument that does not yield a numeric score. Instead, it provides study subjects the opportunity to check off symptoms listed on a checklist and indicate if the severity of the symptoms is &quot;mild&quot; &quot;moderate&quot; or &quot;severe.&quot; The reported values represent symptoms that were indicated at any point during the 8 week trial at a level of &quot;moderate&quot; or &quot;severe&quot; that also represented a change from a baseline-line pre-intervention SAFTEE assessment.</description>
