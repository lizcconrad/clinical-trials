    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well giving an umbilical cord blood transplant together with
      cyclophosphamide, fludarabine phosphate, and total-body irradiation (TBI) works in treating
      patients with hematologic disease. Giving chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide and
      fludarabine phosphate, and TBI before a donor umbilical cord blood transplant helps stop the
      growth of cancer and abnormal cells and helps stop the patient's immune system from rejecting
      the donor's stem cells. When the healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient
      they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells,
      and platelets. Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can make an immune response
      against the body's normal cells. Giving cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil after
      transplant may stop this from happening.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the one year survival of patients undergoing umbilical cord blood
      transplantation (UCBT) after a myeloablative preparative regimen consisting of
      cyclophosphamide (CY), fludarabine phosphate (fludarabine [FLU]), and fractionated total body
      irradiation (TBI).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Incidence of transplant-related mortality (TRM) at 6 months.

      II. Chimerism at multiple time points.

      III. Incidence of neutrophil engraftment at day 42.

      IV. Incidence of platelet engraftment 6 months.

      V. Incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) grade II-IV and grade III-IV at day
      100.

      VI. Incidence of chronic GVHD at day 100, 1 year and 2 years.

      VII. Incidence of clinically significant infections at 6 months, 1 year and 2 years.

      VIII. Incidence of disease free survival at 1 and 2 years.

      IX. Incidence of relapse at 1 and 2 years.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive myeloablative conditioning comprising fludarabine phosphate intravenously
      (IV) over 30 minutes on days -8 to -6, cyclophosphamide IV on days -7 and -6, and undergo TBI
      twice daily (BID) on days -4 to -1. Patients then undergo single- or double-unit UCBT on day
      0.

      Patients receive GVHD prophylaxis comprising cyclosporine IV over 1 hour every 8 or 12 hours,
      then cyclosporine orally (PO) (if tolerated), on days -3 to 100 with taper on day 101.
      Patients also receive mycophenolate mofetil IV every 8 hours on days 0 to 7 and then PO (if
      tolerated) three times daily (TID) on days 8-30. Mycophenolate mofetil is tapered to BID on
      day 30 or 7 days after engraftment if there is no acute GVHD, and then tapered over 2-3 weeks
      beginning on day 45 (or 15 days after engraftment if engraftment occurred &gt; day 30) after
      engraftment if there continues to be no evidence of acute GVHD.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 months, 1 year, and 2
      years.

                  the Patient Care Conference or equivalent group such as the pediatric leukemia
