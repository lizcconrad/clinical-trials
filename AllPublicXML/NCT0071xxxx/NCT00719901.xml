  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of obatoclax when given
      together with bortezomib and to see how well they work in treating patients with relapsed or
      refractory multiple myeloma. Obatoclax and bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving obatoclax together with
      bortezomib may kill more cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of obatoclax
      mesylate when given in combination with bortezomib in patients with relapsed or refractory
      multiple myeloma. (Phase I) II. To evaluate the response rate (complete response, partial
      response, and very good partial response) in patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the duration of progression-free and overall survival of these patients.

      II. To evaluate the incidence of toxicities of this regimen in these patients. III. To
      explore the utility of genetic markers based on initial evidence that they are predictive of
      drug responsiveness and/or successful target inhibition.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I, dose-escalation study of obatoclax mesylate followed
      by a phase II study.

      Patients receive obatoclax mesylate IV over 3 hours and bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, 8, and
      11. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months until disease
      progression and then every 6 months for up to 3 years.
    </textblock>
  </detailed_description>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    This trial was terminated due to slow accrual and the drug supply of Obatoclax during the phase
    I; therefore, the phase II portion will never open.

    <description>DLT was defined as any events that is determined to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to the combination of bortezomib and GX15-070 (as determined by the investigator) and occurring during the first cycle of treatment, irrespective of whether the toxicity resolved. Hematologic DLT measures were assessed using the continuous variables as the outcome measures (primarily nadir and percent change from baseline values) as well as categorization via Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3 standard toxicity grading.</description>

    <measure>Toxicity as Assessed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) CTCAE v 3.0 (Phase II)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Toxicity is defined as adverse events that are classified as either possibly, probably, or definitely related to study treatment. The maximum grade for each type of toxicity will be recorded for each patient, and frequency tables will be reviewed to determine toxicity patterns. In addition, we will review all toxicities data that is graded as 3, 4, or 5 and classified as either &quot;unrelated or unlikely to be related&quot; to study treatment in the event of an actual relationship developing. Adverse events and toxicities will be evaluated using all patients who have received any study treatment.</description>

        <description>Toxicity is defined as adverse events that are classified as either possibly, probably, or definitely related to study treatment. The maximum grade for each type of toxicity will be recorded for each patient, and frequency tables will be reviewed to determine toxicity patterns. In addition, we will review all toxicities data that is graded as 3, 4, or 5 and classified as either “unrelated or unlikely to be related” to study treatment in the event of an actual relationship developing. Adverse events and toxicities will be evaluated using all patients who have received any study treatment.</description>
