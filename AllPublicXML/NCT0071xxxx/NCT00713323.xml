      Sativex® in relieving neuropathic pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a 38 week, multicentre, open label (Part A) follow-on study to evaluate, the
      maintenance of effect of, the development of tolerance through exposure to, and safety of,
      Sativex® in the treatment of subjects with neuropathic pain. The study provided continued
      availability of Sativex® to subjects who completed the preceding double-blind neuropathic
      pain studies. Consenting, eligible subjects who had participated in previous GW Pharma Ltd
      (GW) randomised, placebo-controlled clinical studies entered the study (Visit 1, Day 0) and
      commenced dosing. Study visits took place at Week 2 (Visit 2, Day 14), Week 14 (Visit 3, Day
      98), and Week 26 (Visit 4, Day 182). Subjects returned to the centre for an end of treatment
      visit at week 38 (Visit 5, Day 266). All subjects received Sativex®. This was followed by a
      five week randomised-withdrawal phase (Part B) for a subset of subjects. An end of study
      visit took place 28 days after Visit 5 (or 5b or 5c) or withdrawal from the study.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Parent Study Baseline in Mean Pain 0-10 Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) Score During the Last 4 Weeks of Open-label Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>38 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The average pain NRS was complete at the same time each day, i.e. bedtime in the evening. The patient was asked &quot;on a scale of '0 to 10', please indicate the number that best describes your pain or average pain in the last 24 hours&quot; where 0 = no pain and 10 = pain as bad as you can imagine. No pain relates to the time prior to the onset of pain. A negative value indicates an improvement in pain score from baseline.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Parent Study Baseline in Mean Neuropathic Pain Scale (NPS) Score at End of Open-label Treatment (Week 38)</measure>
    <time_frame>38 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The NPS score is 0-100 sum of 10 individual pain scores (0-10 NRS, 0= no pain to 10 = most pain imaginable). A negative change from baseline indicates an improvement in pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Parent Study Baseline in Mean Sleep Quality 0-10 NRS Score at the End of Open-label Treatment (Week 38)</measure>
    <time_frame>38 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The sleep disruption NRS was completed at the same time each day, i.e. bedtime in the evening. The patient was asked &quot;on a scale of '0 to 10', please indicate how your pain disrupted your sleep last night?&quot; where 0 = did not disrupt sleep and 10 = completely disrupted (unable to sleep at all). A negative value indicates an improvement in sleep disruption score from baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subject Global Impression of Change</measure>
    <time_frame>week 38</time_frame>
    <description>A 7-point Likert-type scale was used, with the question: 'Please assess the status of your pain since entry into the study using the scale below' with the markers &quot;very much improved, much improved, slightly improved, no change, slightly worse, much worse or very much worse&quot;. At Visit 2 (Baseline) patients wrote a brief description of their pain which was used at Week 5 to aid their memory regarding their symptoms at study start. For each of above markers the number of participants were reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Parent Study Baseline in Mean EuroQol-5D Weighted Health State Index Score at the End of Open-label Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>38 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D questionnaire provided two outcomes:(1)A weighted health state index visual analogue scale (VAS); (2) A self-rated health status VAS. EQ-5D Health Status VAS Scale: 0 = worst health state imaginable to 100 = best health state imaginable. An increase in score indicates an improvement in condition.The weighted health state index used the same VAS as above but was calculated for each assessment without imputation to account for missing values i.e., if one or more individual items was missing then the whole index was missing.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Parent Study Baseline in Mean EuroQol-5D Self-rated Health Status Visual Analogue Scale Score at the End of Open-label Treatment</measure>

    <description>The EQ-5D questionnaire provided two outcomes:(1)A weighted health state index visual analogue scale (VAS); (2) A self-rated health status VAS. EQ-5D Health Status VAS Scale: 0 = worst health state imaginable to 100 = best health state imaginable. An increase in score indicates an improvement in condition.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of Adverse Events as a Measure of Subject Safety</measure>
    <time_frame>42 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The number of subjects who reported an adverse event during Part A of the study is presented (including the follow-up period of 28 days following cessation of opel-label treatment).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Parent Study Baseline in Mean Intoxication 0-10 Numerical Rating Scale Score at the End of Open-label Treatment (38 Weeks)</measure>
    <time_frame>38 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The patient was asked &quot;on a scale of '0 to 10' please indicate the average level of your intoxication due to medications over the last 24 hours&quot; (0=no intoxication and 10=extreme toxication). A negative value indicates an improvement in pain score from baseline.</description>

        <description>The average pain NRS was complete at the same time each day, i.e. bedtime in the evening.

No pain relates to the time prior to the onset of pain. A negative value indicates an improvement in pain score from baseline.</description>

        <description>The EQ-5D questionnaire provided two outcomes:(1)A weighted health state index visual analogue scale (VAS); (2) A self-rated health status VAS. EQ-5D Health Status VAS Scale: 0 = worst health state imaginable to 100 = best health state imaginable. An increase in score indicates an improvement in condition.The weighted health state index used the same VAS as above but was calculated for each assessment without imputation to account for missing values i.e., if one or more individual items was missing then the whole index was missing.</description>
