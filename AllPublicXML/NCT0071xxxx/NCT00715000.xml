      This prospective randomised study comparing administration of a hypo-osmolar oral hydration
      solution with the classical hydration via IV (intravenous) infusion in premature infants of
      more than 32 weeks GA (gestational age) aims to determine whether administration of a
      hypo-osmolar oral hydration solution is as efficient as intravenous infusion.

    <textblock>
      In order to prevent dehydration of the premature infant during the first days of life,
      enteral nutrition with milk must be complemented by an additional fluid supply, commonly
      administered intravenously. We propose to perform a prospective randomised multi-centric
      study comparing administration of a hypo-osmolar oral hydration solution with the classical
      hydration via IV (intravenous) infusion in premature infants of more than 30 weeks GA
      (gestational age).

      We define success as a weight loss inferior to 15 % of birth weight and a weight at day 15
      superior to birth weight. Failure was defined hence as a weight loss superior to 15% of birth
      weight or a weight at day 15 inferior to birth weight or a severe complication or death.
      Major violations of the protocol in the study group will be counted as failures. The other
      objectives were to determine whether oral hydration demonstrates practical advantages: less
      complications in initial management, more comfort for the baby and less technical challenges
      for the nurses/doctors in charge. Furthermore to evaluate the clinical tolerance of oral
      hydration from a nutritional point of view and to examine it's effects on intestinal function
      (defecation, gastric residues), signs of intestinal inflammation and GI flora.
