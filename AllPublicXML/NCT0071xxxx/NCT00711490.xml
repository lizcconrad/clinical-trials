    <textblock>
      Objective: Diabetic macular edema (DME) is a frequent manifestation of diabetic retinopathy,
      a leading cause of blindness in the United States. The only proven treatment for DME is laser
      photocoagulation. Sirolimus has been shown to inhibit the production, signaling and activity
      of many growth factors relevant to the development of diabetic retinopathy. Therefore, this
      study will investigate the safety and efficacy of multiple sirolimus injections in patients
      with DME.

      Study Population: Eligibility criteria include central macular thickening &gt; 260 microns and
      visual acuity 20/32 or worse in one or both eyes.

      Design: Five participants will be enrolled into this open-label pilot study. After receiving
      a 20 μL (440 μg) subconjunctival injection in the study eye at baseline and Month 2, the
      participants will be re-evaluated every two months for at least one year for possible
      additional injections. During follow-up, participants will not undergo re-injection if they
      show significant clinical improvement or treatment success, defined as no intraretinal fluid
      or cysts present on optical coherence tomography (OCT) OR 100% reduction in excess retinal
      thickness over 260 microns on OCT OR no leakage on fluorescein angiography (FA). Beginning at
      Month 4, participants will be assessed for treatment failure, defined as loss of 15 or more
      letters of vision compared to baseline at two consecutive visits OR a 50% or greater increase
      in total retinal thickness as measured by OCT at two consecutive visits. Individual
      participants deemed treatment failures will continue receiving sirolimus injections, but will
      be allowed to receive focal laser therapy for any amenable leaking microaneurysms at Month 4.
      Beginning at Month 6, focal laser therapy will be permitted for both treatment failures and
      participants who do not meet the criteria of a treatment success. Participants will have the
      option of continuing treatment until a common termination date of one year.

      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome is the change in visual acuity in the study eye at six
      months compared to baseline. Secondary outcomes include changes in visual acuity in the study
      eye at one year as compared with baseline, changes in retinal thickness as measured by OCT
      and changes in fluid leakage in the macula as demonstrated by FA at six months, one year and
      throughout the study period in the study and fellow eyes. Safety outcomes include number and
      severity of systemic and ocular toxicities, adverse events and infections, and the number of
      participants withdrawn from study therapy.

             hysterectomy or vasectomy) are exempt from using two methods of contraception.
             However, female participants with a tubal ligation (or male participants who have a
             female partner with a tubal ligation) are not exempt, and are required to practice
             another acceptable method of birth control.

             control).

          4. Participation in an investigational trial within 30 days of study entry that involved
             treatment with any drug that has not received regulatory approval at the time of study
             entry.

          5. History of cancer (other than a non-melanoma skin cancer) diagnosed within the past
             five years that could be worsened by immunosuppression.*

             *The risk of immunosuppression must be determined by an oncology consultation prior to
             enrollment.

          6. Laboratory values outside normal limits and considered clinically significant by the
             investigator.

        Study Eye Inclusion Criteria

          1. Best-corrected Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) visual acuity score
             of ≤ 74 letters (i.e., 20/32 or worse).

          2. Definite retinal thickening due to diabetic macular edema based on clinical exam
             involving the center of the macula that is not refractory to further therapy as based
             on the investigator's clinical judgment.

        Study Eye Exclusion Criteria

          1. Macular edema is considered to be due to a cause other than diabetic macular edema.

          2. An ocular condition is present such that, in the opinion of the investigator, visual
             acuity would not improve from resolution of macular edema (e.g., foveal atrophy,
             pigmentary changes, dense subfoveal hard exudates, nonretinal condition, etc.).

          3. An ocular condition is present (other than diabetic retinopathy) that, in the opinion
             of the investigator, might affect macular edema or alter visual acuity during the
             course of the study (e.g., vein occlusion, uveitis or other ocular inflammatory
             disease, Irvine-Gass Syndrome, etc.).

          4. Substantial cataract that, in the opinion of the investigator, is likely to be
             decreasing visual acuity by three lines or more (i.e., cataract would be reducing
             acuity to 20/40 or worse if eye was otherwise normal).

          5. History of focal/grid macular photocoagulation within 12 weeks (three months) prior to
             study entry.

          6. History of panretinal scatter photocoagulation (PRP) within four months prior to study
             entry.

          9. History of major ocular surgery (including cataract extraction, scleral buckle, any
             intraocular surgery, etc.) within prior six months or anticipated within the next six
             months following study entry.

         10. History of (Yttrium Aluminium Garnet) YAG laser capsulotomy performed within two
             months prior to study entry.

         11. Exam evidence of external ocular infection, including conjunctivitis, chalazion, or
             significant blepharitis.

        <title>Change in Visual Acuity From Baseline to 6 Months</title>
        <description>Visual acuity was measured using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) protocol. This acuity is measured as letters read on an ETDRS eye chart and the letters read equate to Snellen measurements. For example, if a participant reads between 84 and 88 letters the Snellen measurement is 20/20.</description>
