  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the bioequivalence of the test product
      Hospira Iron Sucrose 20 mg/mL (Hospira, Inc.) to the reference product Venofer® 20 mg/mL
      following intravenous administration to healthy subjects.

    <textblock>
      Iron is essential to the synthesis of hemoglobin (Hb) to maintain oxygen transport and to the
      function and formation of other physiologically important heme and nonheme compounds. Iron
      deficiency may be caused by blood loss during dialysis, increased erythropoiesis following
      administration of epoetin, and insufficient absorption of iron from the gastro-intestinal
      tract. Most dialysis patients require intravenous iron supplementation to replenish iron
      stores.

      Iron sucrose is used to replenish body iron stores in patients with iron deficiency on
      chronic hemodialysis and receiving erythropoietin. In these patients iron deficiency is
      caused by blood loss during dialysis procedure, increased erythropoiesis, and insufficient
      absorption of iron from the gastrointestinal tract. Most hemodialysis patients require
      intravenous iron to maintain sufficient iron stores to achieve and maintain a hemoglobin
      level of 11-12 g/dL.

      Subjects who fulfill the inclusion/exclusion criteria after screening will be randomized to
      receive 100 mg of iron sucrose as either Hospira Iron Sucrose or Venofer®.
