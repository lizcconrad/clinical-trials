  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SRACE is an multicenter observational database of outcomes for patients who are hospitalized
      with an acute coronary events. SRACE includes over 20 hospitals in Shanghai China that have
      enrolled a total of more than 3,000 patients since 2005, with an annual enrollment of 500
      patients. The major purpose of the SRACE program is to evaluate the prognosis of patients
      admitted to the hospital due to acute coronary events, comparing different therapeutic
      strategies, in-hospital transferring system, and so on. All participating physicians receive
      confidential quarterly reports showing ther outcomes side-by-side with the aggregate outcomes
      of all participating hospitals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      consecutive patients with STEMI who presented symptoms within 12 hours and treated by primary
      PCI in Shanghai, were enrolled in the prospective sysytem. Several strategies were applied in
      these patients, including physician vs. patient transfer strategy, upsteam vs. downstream
      strategy, Firebird stent vs. Excel stent (bio-absorbable SES), etc. Once the patient was
      randomized to one of these study, he will be denied to the others. Clinical and angiographic
      outcomes were compared, with the final purpose to find an optimal strategy in treating AMI
      patients.
