    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, non-randomized, open-label registry of consecutive patients with
      CAD treated by stent-assisted PCI using at least one CypherTM stent. Up to 1000 pts will be
      included in the registry. The registry is conducted for the evaluation of the impact of
      CypherTM Sirolimus-eluting stent implantation in the &quot;real world&quot; of interventional
      cardiology. Informed consent will be obtained from patients meeting the inclusion criteria
      before the initiation of any study specific procedures. Consecutive patients treated with the
      use of the CypherTM stent will be included in the registry. Baseline and post-procedure blood
      samples will be used to perform platelet function analysis using the Accumetrics Ultegra RPFA
      (Rapid Platelet Function Assay).

      All patients will be followed from enrollment through the hospital discharge for any
      clinically significant event (death, myocardial infarction, TLR, TVR, major or minor
      bleeding). A follow-up telephone assessment of death, myocardial infarction,
      revascularization, and medical treatment will be conducted by experienced research personnel
      at 30 days, 6 months, 1 year and at least 2 years. All site reported deaths, myocardial
      infarctions and revascularizations will be adjudicated by an independent Clinical Events
      Committee for all 1000 patients enrolled in the trial. An interim analysis of the first 750
      patients will be conducted and data forwarded to FDA.

    <description>Indications for use: The CYPHER™ Sirolimus-eluting Coronary Stent is indicated for improving coronary luminal diameter in patients with symptomatic ischemic disease due to discrete de novo lesions of length less than or equal to 30 mm in native coronary arteries with a reference vessel diameter between 2.5 and 3.5 mm. Long-term outcome (beyond 12 months) for this permanent implant is unknown at present.</description>

        Patients 18 years of age or older undergoing PCI and requiring the placement of at least
        one drug-eluting stent will be included to this study. For this registry, consecutive
        patients, that will have coronary percutaneous intervention with the CypherTM at the Green
        Hospital of Scripps Clinic, will be enrolled. It is estimated that up to 1000 patients will
        be included in the registry enrolled over a four year period. It is expected that
        enrollment will conclude in March 2009.

          7. De novo and restenotic lesions, including ISR, radiation failure

          8. Be reliable, cooperative and willing to comply with all protocol-specified procedures
             and follow-up

          9. Able to understand and grant informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Confirmed pregnancy at the time of index PCI

          2. Has known allergies to aspirin, and to both clopidogrel (PlavixTM) and ticlopidine
             (TiclidTM)

          3. Has known allergies or contraindication to heparin and Bivalirudin (AngiomaxTM)

          4. Known allergy or sensitivity to any component of a Sirolimus-eluting stent
