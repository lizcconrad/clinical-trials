  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of pioglitazone on reducing airway
      inflammation in cystic fibrosis and characterize the amount and timecourse of pioglitazone
      elimination from the body.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Progressive loss of lung function due to chronic infection and inflammation is the primary
      cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with CF. Current therapies directed at treatment
      of chronic P. aeruginosa infection (e.g. aerosolized tobramycin, azithromycin) provide
      short-term improvement in pulmonary function; however, persistence of the
      infection/inflammation causes the inevitable loss of lung function. PPARgamma is a nuclear
      transcription factor which is known to reduce activation of NFKB, a central mediator of
      airway inflammation in CF. Recent studies demonstrate that PPARgamma expression is reduced in
      patients with CF and may offer a potential therapeutic target to combat airway inflammation
      in CF. Pioglitazone is a thiazolidinedione whose principal pharmacological target it
      PPARgamma. The purpose of this pilot study is to determine the
      pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of pioglitazone and effect on reducing airway inflammation
      in cystic fibrosis.
