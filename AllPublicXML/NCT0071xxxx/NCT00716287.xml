  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anti-angiogenic targeted therapies are used in a wide range of solid tumors including NSCLC,
      breast cancer, GISTs, CRC, renal cell carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. Somatic
      mutations in genes related to tumorigenesis have been associated with treatment response
      whereas germline gene variants have been associated with tumor risk, prognosis and treatment
      related toxicity.Study objectives are:

        1. To characterise the prevalence and clinicopathological associations of germline and
           somatic variation in genes involved in the angiogenic pathway in healthy donors and
           unselected cancer patients

        2. To examine the association between angiogenic gene variants and outcome in patients
           receiving anti-angiogenic therapy

      Angiogenesis plays a key role in the process of tumour growth and metastases. Anti-angiogenic
      targeted therapies are currently used in a wide range of solid tumors including lung, breast,
      colorectal, kidney and liver cancer. Somatic variants in genes related to tumorigenesis have
      been associated with treatment response, whereas germline gene variants have been associated
      with tumor risk, prognosis and treatment related toxicity. In this study we propose to (1) To
      characterise the prevalence and clinicopathological associations of germline and somatic
      variation in genes involved in the angiogenic pathway in healthy donors and unselected cancer
      patients (2) to examine the association between angiogenic gene variants and outcome in
      patients receiving anti-angiogenic therapy. Genes related to angiogenesis to be characterised
      include those encoding platelet derived growth factor receptors, vascular endothelial growth
      factors, vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, K-Ras, B-Raf, and c-kit. Results from
      this study may (1) identify patients who are more likely to respond to anti-angiogenic
      targeted therapy, thus maximising drug efficacy and (2) to identify further targets for
      potential anti-angiogenic drug therapies.
