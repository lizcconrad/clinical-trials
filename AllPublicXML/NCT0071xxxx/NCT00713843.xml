    <textblock>
      Background of the study: Manual Therapy applied to patients with non-specific neck pain has
      been investigated several times, both internationally and nationally. In the Netherlands
      different types of manual therapy treatment exist. Manual Therapy, as practiced under the
      Utrecht School, has not been subject of a randomized controlled trial. There is a need to
      evaluate the effectiveness of this type of manual therapy.

      Objective of the study: This trial will investigate the effectiveness of Manual Therapy in
      the short and long-term up to 52 weeks in patient with (sub) acute (minimal two weeks) and
      chronic (maximum 52 weeks) since last episode of neck pain. Functional state, pain and global
      perceived effect are the outcome variables.

      Study design: The study is a single blind randomized controlled trial.

      Study population: Men and women aged 18 to 70 years old with neck pain for at least two
      weeks.

      Intervention: The experimental group will be treated with manual therapy for a period of six
      weeks. The control group will be treated with physical therapy (usual care) also for a period
      of six weeks.

      Primary study parameters / outcome of the study: Global Perceived Effect (GPE) and the Neck
      disability index (NDI-DV ) will be applied.

      Secondary study parameters / outcome of the study: Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain and
      SF36 (Quality of life). The Multidimensional Health Locus of Control(MHLC ),
      Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire, Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ-DLV) will
      also be measured.

      Detailed information about Manual Therapy according to the Utrecht School Manual Therapy
      (MTU)

      MTU is based on assessing the patient's individual preference of functioning by documenting
      and interpreting their natural asymmetry in anatomical form, posture and movements. The
      normal asymmetry and variability of human form and movement function have been specified.
      Asymmetrical forms can be related to the asymmetrical movement function.

      In addition to the general diagnostics, MTU is characterized by specific diagnostics. By
      means of this specific manual-therapeutic analysis the individual preference of functioning
      model of the patient is drawn up through analysis and interpretation of the individual
      asymmetry in form, posture and movement. Some explanations of the measurements and movements
      are: (preferred) hand folding; (preferred) arm folding; which eye is master eye; leg use in
      (preferred) kicking of a ball. The purpose here is to describe the optimal direction and
      position of movement axes for all joints according to this model.

      When composing this model, firstly the individual characteristics (a number of preferred
      movements, a number of asymmetrical aspects of posture and form) are assessed. Documentation,
      notation and interpretation of these characteristics take place according to a protocol.

      The objective of MTU is to optimize the positioning of movement axes in the joints. To
      achieve this, three-dimensional movements in the joints are executed repeatedly. To purpose
      fully position the movement axes the therapist should (repeatedly) perform passive joint
      movements with low velocity and high accuracy. In addition to examining the individual
      preference of movement, exploratory examination is carried out to recognize possible red
      flags and to determine the treatment indication.

      Treatment is based on preferred movements found in the patient and the interpretation
      according to the protocol of these movements and not on the complaint of the patient. It is
      executed by applying passive articular movements in the spinal joints and the joints of the
      extremities. During this process physiological joint limitations are carefully observed;
      traction or high-velocity movements will not be applied, as may be the case in other forms of
      manual therapy.

      The diagnostic examination of other forms of manual therapy focuses on joint function,
      stability, movement patterns, range of movement, and the severity of disorders. To diagnose
      the patients complaints, palpation of passive accessory and passive intervertebral movements
      are used. The results yield information as to tenderness (pain), restricted intersegmental
      motion (stiffness), and spasm (muscle tension).

    <arm_group_label>1 Manual Therapy Utrecht</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Manual Therapy Utrecht (MTU) During the first consultation the manual therapist enquires about the complaints of the patient. The manual therapist conducts a number of measurements according to protocol. During treatment preferred movements are executed by the manual therapist in the patient's joints. The treatment techniques used by the manual therapist are very gentle mobilizations, without high velocity thrust techniques and are in general painless. In Manual Therapy Utrecht (MTU) it is common to give advices and recommend exercises.
A treatment session lasts between 30 and 60 minutes (repeated after one or two weeks). The maximum number of sessions is six.
The manual therapist has a minimum of five years of working experience.</description>

    <arm_group_label>2 Physical Therapy - Exercise Therapy</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The physical therapist conducts a complaint related function examination. Treatment consist of active exercises, manual traction or stretching and massage. The aims of active exercises are improvement of strength, mobility and movement coordination. Specific mobilization techniques are not a part of physiotherapeutic treatment. Treatment sessions take place no more than twice a week with a maximum of nine sessions (approximately 30 minutes) with a minimum of twenty minutes on active exercise therapy combined with instruction.
To prevent overlap with MTU (experimental arm), physical therapists are selected who are not (also) trained as manual therapists or have started this education.
The physical therapist has at least five years of working experience.</description>
