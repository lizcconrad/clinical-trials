    <textblock>
      Background: Recent data indicate that home nocturnal hemodialysis (8 hours of hemodialysis at
      home for 5-6 nights per week) may have substantial cardiovascular benefits, including
      regression of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, improved LV ejection fraction and blood
      pressure control. Nevertheless, this dialysis modality is only feasible in a highly-selected
      minority of ESRD patients, who can self-manage their dialysis treatment at home. In-centre
      nocturnal hemodialysis (INHD), administered as 7-8 hours of hemodialysis in hospital for 3
      nights per week, represents an appealing and practical alternative. As this is a novel form
      of therapy, there has been no definitive study examining the cardiovascular impact of INHD to
      date.

      Objective: To determine the effects of INHD on LV mass, global and regional systolic and
      diastolic function, and other cardiovascular biomarkers in patients with ESRD.

      Hypothesis: Conversion from conventional hemodialysis to INHD is associated with favourable
      changes in cardiac structure and function in patients with ESRD.

      Rationale for Using Cardiac MRI: Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) has emerged as the
      new gold standard for measuring LV mass, volume, global and regional myocardial function. Its
      accuracy and precision make it the imaging modality of choice for studying the small number
      of patients currently undergoing or awaiting INHD.

      Study Design and Population: This is a prospective cohort study of adult ESRD patients who
      are currently receiving conventional in-centre hemodialysis and will be converted to INHD.
      Patients will be managed as per standard clinical practice (e.g. blood pressure, anemia
      management) established for the INHD program, and no therapeutic intervention will be
      performed as part of this study. All eligible patients will undergo two serial CMR
      examinations: within 2 weeks prior to conversion and at 52 weeks following conversion to
      INHD. We also plan to recruit a population of control patients who have elected to remain on
      conventional HD. These individuals will be asked to undergo the same set of investigations at
      baseline and 12 months thereafter.

      Outcome: The primary endpoints are the temporal changes in LV mass and size, global and
      regional diastolic and systolic function at 52 weeks after conversion to INHD, as measured by
      cardiac MRI. Secondary endpoints include changes in myocardial tissue characteristics, blood
      pressure, mineral metabolic parameters, anemia control, serum troponin, norepinephrine, brain
      natriuretic peptide, markers of inflammation and quality of life.

      Significance: The provision of an enhanced dialysis regimen has emerged as the most promising
      avenue through which to modify the dismal cardiovascular outcomes in patients receiving
      chronic hemodialysis. INHD represents a means of administering such therapy to a broad
      spectrum of dialysis patients for whom home therapies would not be feasible. The proposed
      study will be the first to precisely define the cardiac impact of INHD using CMR. The
      findings may justify large randomized controlled trials evaluating clinical outcomes. If INHD
      is proven to be effective, it will have a major impact on the management and outcome of many
      patients with ESRD in Canada.
