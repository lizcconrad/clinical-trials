  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neuromuscular condition characterized by
      weakness, muscle wasting, fasciculations and increased reflexes. Depending on the site of
      onset, individuals with ALS progressively lose control of their skeletal muscles; bulbar or
      the extremities. As symptoms worsen and spread, muscle atrophy becomes apparent and upper
      motor neuron symptoms such as spasticity complicate gait (in lower limb involvement) and
      manual dexterity (in upper limb involvement). The patients progress to a state of profound
      disability and have great difficulty in communicating; some may even be entirely &quot;locked in&quot;
      to their bodies. The capacity for simple communication could greatly improve their quality of
      life.

      New technologies are giving people with disabilities alternate communication and control
      options. One such instrument is the EEG-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) which can
      provide both communication and control functions to those who have lost muscle control. By
      recording electroencephalographic (EEG) signals or brain waves from the scalp and then
      decoding them, the Wadsworth BCI allows people to make selections on a computer screen [i] In
      this study we will be investigating the feasibility of using EEG-based Brain-Computer
      Interface technology as a communication solution for individuals with ALS. The specific
      question addressed will be: Can individuals with ALS use the BCI for communication when they
      present with extreme loss of neuromuscular control and severe communication impairments? The
      goal of the project is to determine whether this device is a practical and realistic means
      for individuals with ALS to communicate. The study is intended to evaluate both the
      complexity of the system and the degree to which each participant will be able to
      communicate. Trials will consist of asking the subject to follow a series of simple
      instructions and complete certain tasks while using the BCI.

      This study design requires that the individual live in the Philadelphia region. Please
      contact the Wadsworth Center of the New York State Department of Health and State University
      of New York at Albany directly if you reside outside of this area.
