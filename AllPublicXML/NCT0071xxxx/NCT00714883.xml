  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the target lesion failure rate of the NEVO
      Sirolimus-eluting Coronary Stent System.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The NEVO™ stent will not be commercialized. Cordis decided to close the study after 3 years.
    This decision took the absence of safety signals into account.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with atherosclerotic CAD ;

          -  The subject must be &gt;/= 18 years of age;

          -  Female of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days
             prior to enrollment;

          -  Diagnosis of angina pectoris as defined by stable angina pectoris Canadian
             Cardiovascular Society Classification (Class I, II, III) OR non-ST segment elevation
             acute coronary syndrome (Braunwald Classification B&amp;C) OR OR non-ST segment elevation
             myocardial infarction ≥ 48 hours from the time of study index procedure OR
             asymptomatic subjects with a positive stress test;

          -  Indicated treatment of up to two lesions in one or two major coronary arteries (1
             target lesion in each of 2 vessels or 2 target lesions in 1 vessel). The target vessel
             diameter must be &gt;/= 2.25mm and &lt;/= 3.5 in diameter (visual estimate);

          -  Target lesion length &lt;/= 28 mm able to be treated with a single stent. If required,
             additional Conor Sirolimus stents should be used to treat dissections, etc

          -  Patient or Legally Authorized Representative must provide written informed consent
             prior to the procedure using a form that is approved by the Independent Ethics
             Committee.

          -  The patient is willing to comply with all specified follow-up evaluations.

          -  The target lesion has been successfully crossed with the intracoronary guidewire which
             is positioned intraluminally in the distal vessel.

          -  The target lesion diameter stenosis is &gt;50% and &lt;100% based on a visual estimate.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  ST-elevation MI within 72 hours prior to the index procedure and/or creatine kinase
             (CK) &gt;2 times the local laboratory upper limits of normal on the day of the index
             procedure.

          -  The patient has undergone target vessel revascularization within 6 months prior to the
             intended enrolment procedure.

          -  Prior stent within 5 mm of target lesion(s);

          -  Ostial target lesion(s);

          -  Unprotected left main coronary disease with &gt;/= 50% stenosis;

          -  Angiographic evidence of thrombus within target lesion(s);

          -  Total coronary occlusion or TIMI grade 0 or 1 in the target vessel;

          -  Bifurcation disease involving a side branch &gt;/= 2 mm in diameter;

          -  Target lesion(s) within a coronary bypass graft (e.g., saphenous vein or arterial
             graft);

          -  Significant calcification or angulation in the target vessel that, in the
             Investigator's opinion, may preclude stent delivery and deployment;

          -  Recipient of heart transplant;

          -  Subject with a life expectancy less than 12 months;

          -  Known allergies to the following: aspirin, any thienopyridine, heparin, cobalt
             chromium, contrast agent (that cannot be managed medically), or sirolimus that cannot
             be managed medically;

          -  The patient has contraindication to ASA or to any thienopyridine agent.

          -  Currently participating in an investigational drug or device study that has not
             completed the primary endpoint or that clinically interferes with the study endpoints;

          -  Known bleeding or hypercoagulable disorder;

          -  Known or suspected active infection at the time of the study procedures;

          -  Subject is known to be a prisoner, mentally incompetent, and/or alcohol or drug
             abuser;

          -  Subject has had major surgical or interventional procedures unrelated to this study
             within 30 days prior to this study or planned surgical or interventional procedures
             within 30 days of entry into this study, or planned coronary PCI through the end of
             the study.

          -  The patient is currently taking systemic immunosuppressant therapy;

          -  The patient has co-morbid condition(s) that could limit the patient's ability to
             participate in the study, compliance with follow-up requirements or impact the
             scientific integrity of the study.
