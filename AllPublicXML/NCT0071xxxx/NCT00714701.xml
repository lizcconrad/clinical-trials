      CAPS4 is a study at Johns Hopkins Hospital to study the diagnosis and long-term outcomes of
      screening patients with an increased inherited risk for pancreatic cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is a deadly disease and the only hope for improvement of survival is early
      detection. Certain genetic syndromes are associated with a high risk of pancreatic cancer and
      screening for pancreatic cancer has become a relatively new strategy for familial pancreatic
      cancer. . Our pancreatic cancer research group at Johns Hopkins and others have shown that
      screening with EUS and/or abdominal imaging tests such as CT/MRI can detect a relatively high
      number of significant pancreatic neoplasms (7-18%) in asymptomatic high risk individuals with
      an inherited predisposition for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma This is a clinical, early
      detection translational study that will directly influence patient care. This long term study
      follows the successful completion of single center Cancer of the Pancreas (CAPS) 1 and CAPS 2
      studies at Johns Hopkins, and the ongoing CAPS 3 multicenter study. GENERAL AIM: This is a
      study that aims to evaluate the diagnostic yield, quality of life, and clinical outcomes of a
      clinical screening and surveillance program for individuals at-risk for pancreatic cancer and
      to validate a candidate panel of biomarkers for early detection of pancreatic neoplasia. The
      3 specific groups to be screened and followed are individuals from familial pancreatic cancer
      kindreds (who have 2 or more affected relatives and have an estimated risk 16-57 times that
      of controls), patients with familial Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, patients with a known BRCA-2,
      BRCA-1, PALB2, PRSS or p16 germline mutation.

             the liver, chronic hepatitis (The estimated glomerulfiltration rate (eGFR) will be
             calculated based on age, race, and serum creatinine, using the on-line calculator at
