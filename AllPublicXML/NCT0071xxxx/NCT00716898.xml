      The purpose of the study is to determine the Pharmacokinetics of Low Molecular Weight Heparin
      (LMWH) in Cancer patients, and compare it to the Pharmacokinetics of LMWH in Patients without
      cancer. We also intend to detect any correlation between heparanase blood and urine levels
      and the Pharmacokinetics of LMWH.

      Scientific background. The increased risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) in cancer has long
      been recognized (1). Since first described by Trousseau in 1865, many aspects of this complex
      relationship are still obscure (2). Cancer patients have an increased risk for developing
      thrombosis. Similarly, patients presenting with idiopathic VTE are considered to have a
      higher risk of developing cancer (3). Approximately 10% of patients with idiopathic VTE
      harbor an underlying malignancy that can be detected by an extensive diagnostic work-up (4).
      Clinical data indicate that cancer alone is associated with a 4.1- fold risk of thrombosis,
      and chemotherapy increases the risk to 6.1- folds (5). Cancer patients develop postoperative
      VTE at least 2- folds more than patients without cancer undergoing the same surgical
      procedure (6). Treatment of VTE involves the administration of heparin, low molecular weight
      heparin (LMWH) or coumarin derivatives. Beside its anticoagulant effects, LMWH may also have
      an anti-tumoral effect (7-12). The use of LMWH relative to coumarin derivatives was
      associated with improved survival in patients with solid tumors who did not have metastatic
      disease at the time of an acute VTE (9). Moreover, addition of LMWH to chemotherapy increased
      survival of patients with small cell lung cancer (10).

      Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are ubiquitous macromolecules associated with the cell
      surface and extracellular matrix (ECM) of a wide range of cells of vertebrate and
      invertebrate tissues. Heparin is structurally related to heparan sulfate (HS), but has higher
      N- and O-sulfate contents (13). Mammalian endoglycosidase, capable of partially
      depolymerizing HS chains and commonly referred to as heparanase, has been identified in a
      variety of cell types and tissues, primarily cancer cells, activated cells of the immune
      system, platelets, and placenta (14-17). Heparanase is synthesized as a latent 65 kDa
      precursor whose activation involves proteolytic cleavage at two potential sites located at
      the N-terminal region of the molecule (Glu109 -Ser110 and Gln157 -lys158), resulting in the
      formation of two protein subunits that heterodimerize and form the active heparanase enzyme
      (18). Expression of heparanase correlates with the metastatic potential of human tumor cells
      (14-16, 19). Furthermore, elevated levels of heparanase were detected in the urine of some
      patients with aggressive metastatic disease (20). Heparin, LMWH, non-anticoagulant and
      chemically modified species of heparin (21, 22), as well as other polysaccharides (23, 24)
      which inhibit experimental metastasis, also inhibit tumor cell heparanase, while other
      related compounds had a small or no effect on both parameters (21-24). Recently, we
      demonstrated that the anticoagulant activities of heparin and LMWH can be neutralized by
      their pre-incubation with heparanase. Transgenic mice overexpressing heparanase, exhibited a
      hyper-coagulable phenotype expressed by a markedly shorter base-line APTT compared to control
      mice (25). These results may suggest that resistance to heparin, described in patients with
      malignancies (26, 27), could be attributed, in part, to high levels of heparanase often
      observed in cells (28, 29) and body fluids (20) of patients with an aggressive malignant
      disease. Degradation of heparin and LMWH by heparanase in vivo may be relevant in situations
      in which heparanase is over-expressed, and treatment with heparin or LMWH is needed (e.g.,
      deep venous thrombosis in patients with pancreatic carcinoma) (29, 30). The pharmacokinetics
      of LMWH (i.e. the time course of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and degradation) as
      reflected by its effects upon factor Xa activity, was elucidated in several subgroups of
      patients (e.g. patients with renal failure, pregnant womenâ€¦), but to the best of our
      knowledge was not addressed in patients with advanced solid tumors.

      Objectives &amp; expected significance. In view of the above described biological significance of
      the heparanase enzyme, and taking into account our recent in vitro and in vivo results
      (heparanase capability to cleave heparin and LMWH; and the altered coagulation profile in
      transgenic mice overexpressing heparanase) (25), we propose to focus on the following
      specific aims:

      I) Measure plasma and urine heparanase levels in patients with advanced cancer suffering from
      VTE, and compare it to controls without cancer.

      II) Elucidate the pharmacokinetics of LMWH in patients with advanced solid tumors (AST)
      suffering from VTE, and compare it to the pharmacokinetics of LMWH in patients with unstable
      angina pectoris.

      III) Determine the correlation between heparanase blood levels and the pharmacokinetics of
      LMWH, if any.
