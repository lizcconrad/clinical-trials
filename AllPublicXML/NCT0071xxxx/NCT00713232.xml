      We will construct a Chinese Picture Naming test which include 60 items with various word
      frequency and familiarity and is arranged by their familiarity in daily life.

      Then we will collect the normative data for this test using normal subjects of various age
      and educational level.

      In this study, we will first construct a Chinese Picture Naming Testing following the format
      of Boston Naming test. We will use the original 60 items from BNT and also choose another 100
      items of objects with various frequency using the word frequency data from the Linguistic
      Corpus of the Academia Sinica. Colored pictures will be constructed accordingly. University
      students will be recruited to name the pictures and to judge the familiarity and image
      agreement for these pictures. Then, we will choose 60 pictures of according to the principles
      of 1. high image agreement 2. high naming agreement 3. including items of various familiarity
      and word frequency 4. double or triple phoneme words 5. including the original BNT items as
      possible. The 60 pictures will be arranged by their familiarity to construct the Chinese
      Picture Naming Test.

      Then, we will recruit normal subjects of various age group and educational level to to the
      Naming test and to construct the preliminary norm.
