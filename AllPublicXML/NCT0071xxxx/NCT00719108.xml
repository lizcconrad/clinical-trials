        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy male or female subject

          2. Age between 18 and 45 years (both inclusive)

          3. Considered generally healthy upon completion of medical history, physical examination
             and biochemical investigations as judged by the Investigator.

          4. Body Mass Index (BMI) between 18.0 and 35.0 kg/m2 (both inclusive)

          5. Non-smoker, defined as no nicotine consumption for at least one year.

          6. Signed and dated informed consent obtained before any trial-related activities.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous participation in this trial or other clinical trials within the last 3
             months.

          2. Pregnant, breast-feeding or intention of becoming pregnant or not using adequate
             contraceptive measures.

          3. Clinically significant abnormal hematology or biochemistry screening tests, as judged
             by the Investigator.

          4. Any serious systemic infectious disease during the four weeks prior to the first dose
             of test drug, as judged by the Investigator.

          5. History of any illness that, in the opinion of the Investigator, might confound the
             results of the trial or pose risk in administering the trial drug to the subject. In
             particular, subjects with significant cardiovascular disease, anemia (below the lower
             limit of normal) or hemoglobinopathy will not be allowed to enter the trial.

          6. History of alcohol or drug abuse within the past 5 years and/or any positive test for
             drugs of abuse at screening.

          7. Positive test for hepatitis B or C or HIV positive at screening or in the past.

          8. Use of prescription drugs within 3 weeks preceding the first dosing of insulin, except
             for oral contraceptives/hormonal implants.

          9. Use of any insulin product in the past.

         10. Use of non-prescription drugs, except routine vitamins, within 2 weeks prior to the
             first dose of the test drug. Occasional use of acetaminophen will be permitted.

         11. Blood donation of more than 500 mL (or considerable blood loss) within the last 12
             weeks.

         12. History of multiple and/or severe allergies to drugs or foods or a history of severe
             anaphylactic reaction.

         13. Known or suspected allergy to trial products or related products.

         14. Mental incapacity, unwillingness or language barriers precluding adequate
             understanding or co-operation.
