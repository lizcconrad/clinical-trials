    <textblock>
      Protocol designed to test blood samples from blood donors of whole blood and blood components
      using a new investigational screening test (PRISM Chagas) that detects antibody to T. cruzi
      (Chagas infection). Results will be compared to the current T. cruzi antibody screening
      assay. Specimens positive with the screening assay will be further tested with a new
      investigational Chagas confirmatory assay [Enzyme Strip Assay (ESA) Chagas]. Additional
      specimens collected under separate protocols or sourced from suppliers will also be provided
      to the clinical sites for testing with PRISM Chagas assay and ESA Chagas.
