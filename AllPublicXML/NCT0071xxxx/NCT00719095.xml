      There has been an alarming increase in abuse of prescription opioids in recent years. This
      project aims to develop an effective outpatient treatment for prescription opioid (PO) abuse
      that combines an intensive behavioral therapy with a pharmacotherapy regimen of buprenorphine
      detoxification and naltrexone maintenance.

      There has been an alarming increase in abuse of prescription opioids in recent years. This
      project aims to develop an effective outpatient treatment for prescription opioid (PO) abuse
      that combines an intensive behavioral therapy with a pharmacotherapy regimen of buprenorphine
      detoxification and naltrexone maintenance. Aim 1) Conduct a randomized, three-parallel-groups
      clinical trial (Study 1) to determine a buprenorphine dose-tapering schedule that prevents
      the poor retention and relapse that undermine many opioid detoxification regimens. Aim 2)
      Conduct a randomized, three-parallel-groups clinical trial (Study 2) to determine a duration
      of naltrexone therapy that sustains opioid abstinence following the buprenorphine
      detoxification.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  For inclusion in the proposed studies, subjects must be &gt; 18 years old and in good
             health. Subjects must meet DSM-IV criteria for opioid dependence and FDA qualification
             criteria for buprenorphine treatment, including a history of opioid dependence and
             significant current opioid use (i.e., opioid-positive urines). Subjects must also be
             seeking or willing to accept opioid detoxification.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Because the primary focus of the proposed research is to develop an efficacious
             intervention for prescription opioid abuse that employs a buprenorphine taper and
             subsequent naltrexone maintenance, individuals who require ongoing opioid therapy for
             pain or other chronic medical conditions will be excluded from participating.

          -  Individuals with evidence of an active psychiatric disorder that may interfere with
             consent or participation in the research (e.g., psychosis, manic-depressive illness,
             organic psychiatric disorders), significant medical illness (e.g., cardiovascular
             disease) or who are pregnant or nursing will be excluded from participation.
