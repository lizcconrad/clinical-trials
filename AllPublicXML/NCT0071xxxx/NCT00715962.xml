    <textblock>
      Low mobility, defined as being limited to bed or chair, is common during acute
      hospitalization. This study will evaluate the impact and safety of a hospital walking program
      for older patients during acute general medical hospitalization. Participants who are 65
      years of age or older, will be randomized to usual care (UC) or to a hospital walking program
      (WP), which includes twice daily walks with assistance, provision of necessary ambulatory
      devices, and a behavioral intervention strategy designed to encourage out of bed activity.
      Throughout hospitalization, the WP and UC veterans will were wireless monitors on the thigh
      and ankle that measure activity. The primary goal will be in increase the length of time
      veterans spend out of bed and to assure this out of bed activity is safe.

      Background: Low mobility, defined as being limited to bed or chair, is common during acute
      hospitalization. The candidate's work has demonstrated low mobility to be associated with
      adverse outcomes including functional decline, need for new nursing home admission, and death
      even after controlling for illness severity and comorbidity. Objective: Using a Phase II
      trial design, the impact and safety of a hospital walking program for older patients during
      acute general medical hospitalization will be evaluated.

      Project Design: 100 patients, age 65 years admitted to the medical wards at the Birmingham
      VAMC will be recruited within 48 hours of hospitalization and followed for 14 days after
      enrollment or until discharge, which ever comes first. Exclusion criteria will include: (1)
      Delirious based on positive Confusion Assessment Method (CAM); (2) Mini Mental State
      Examination Score &lt; 17; (3) Patient on isolation; (4) Inability to ambulate 2 weeks prior to
      admission; (5) Having a medical diagnosis deemed by the primary physician to be a
      contraindication to ambulation; (6) patient with an imminently terminal illness; and (7)
      Non-English speaking. Participants will be randomized to either usual care (UC) or to a
      hospital walking program (WP), which includes twice daily walks with assistance, provision of
      necessary ambulatory devices, and a behavioral intervention strategy designed to encourage
      out of bed activity. Throughout hospitalization, the WP and UC veterans will wear on the
      ipsilateral thigh and ankle wireless monitors that measure horizontal and vertical
      orientation with respect to gravity. Previously validated by the candidate to assess levels
      of mobility during hospitalization, the output will be used to calculate the length of time
      patients spent lying, sitting, and standing or walking, using pre-defined criteria. Other
      daily measures will include orthostatic blood pressure, functional assessments, and
      assessment of falls and symptoms over the previous 24-hours. The primary outcome measure is
      time out of bed as measured by the wireless monitors. Importantly, our goal is to assess not
      only the amount of mobility that occurred as a result of the hospital walking program but
      that which occurred beyond the intervention. In our previous VA-funded study, patients spent
      an average of 17.1% or 4.1 hours out of bed per 24-hour period of time (s.d. 2.9). Our goal
      is to increase this by 50% or 2 hours to an average of 6.1 hours. This results in an effect
      size of 0.69 standard deviation units. A sample size of 45 per group provides 90% power to
      detect this 2-hour difference in the amount of time patients spend out of bed at the = .05
      level.

      Significance: at present there is a paucity of data regarding the impact or safety of a
      hospital walking program for general medical patients. Results of this study will enable
      researchers to determine the safety and efficacy of the walking program for older veterans
      during hospitalization and will provide information regarding effect size for a definitive
      intervention trial.

    <description>Throughout the hospital stay, both the WP and UC patient wore a triaxial accelerometer on the ipsilateral thigh and ankle. The patient's skin was assessed regularly to assure there is no evidence of irritation. The wireless monitors were used to quantify the amount of mobility that occurs daily for each patient with researchers being blinded to the outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>4-6 weeks after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The UAB Study of Aging Life-Space Assessment (LSA) is a validated tool that measures mobility and function based on the distance which a person reports moving during the four weeks preceding the assessment. Life-space &quot;levels&quot; range from within one's dwelling to beyond one's town. A life-space composite score is calculated based on life-space level, degree of independence in achieving each level, and the frequency of attaining each level. Scores range from 0 - 120 with higher scores indicating greater community mobility.</description>

Behavioral encouragement of out of bed activity: Using social cognitive theory, participants in the walking program group will be encouraged to complete a brief diary about out of bed activities like sitting up for meals of walks to the bathroom. They will be provided with information regarding the importance of being out of bed a praise for any attempts. They will be asked to set out of bed time activity goals daily.

        <title>Life-Space Assessment Score</title>
        <description>The UAB Study of Aging Life-Space Assessment (LSA) is a validated tool that measures mobility and function based on the distance which a person reports moving during the four weeks preceding the assessment. Life-space &quot;levels&quot; range from within one’s dwelling to beyond one’s town. A life-space composite score is calculated based on life-space level, degree of independence in achieving each level, and the frequency of attaining each level. Scores range from 0 - 120 with higher scores indicating greater community mobility.</description>
