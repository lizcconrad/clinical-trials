  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study medication CYT006-AngQb is a vaccine, consisting of angiotensin II (Ang II), the
      naturally occurring octapeptide coupled onto the surface of virus-like particles (VLP). This
      form of presenting Ang II to the immune system induces a B-cell mediated immune response
      characterized by the generation of specific antibodies (IgG and IgM) against Ang II. The
      CYT006-AngQb vaccine is administered by subcutaneous (s.c.) injection. Immunization against
      angiotensin II may offer a valuable alternative to conventional drugs for the treatment of
      hypertension.
