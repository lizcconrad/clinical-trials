    <textblock>
      In this open-label study of patients with advanced melanoma 20 evaluable patients will be
      recruited.

      The drug substance, AGI-101H, is a whole cell, allogeneic melanoma vaccine, representing a
      mixture (1:1 ratio) of two therapeutic gene modified human melanoma cell lines, referred to
      as Mich1H6 and Mich2H6, which has been gamma-irradiated to render the cells non-proliferative

      Patients will receive treatment for up to 26 weeks. Progression at any time point requiring
      systemic treatment with, for example with chemotherapy or cytokines will lead to withdrawal
      of this patient from the study.

      The dose chosen is 5 x 107 viable cells/dose.

      Total number of patients: 20 evaluable patients will be enrolled in the study.

      Dosage: 5 x 107 live cells. No dose modification is planned.

      Administration: Subcutaneous (s.c.)

      Duration of treatment: Patients will receive treatment for up to 26 weeks. Progression at any
      time point requiring systemic treatment with, for example with chemotherapy or cytokines will
      lead to withdrawal of this patient from the study. All surviving patients of this AGITAM
      trial will be offered the opportunity to transfer to a follow-up treatment protocol with AGI
      - 101H. In this case treatment may continue every 4 - 8 weeks until progression or death or
      withdrawal unless such therapy is contraindicated or patient does not wish to continue.

      Reference therapy: Not applicable.

      Description of medicinal product: The drug substance, AGI-101H, is a whole cell, allogeneic
      melanoma vaccine, representing a mixture (1:1 ratio) of two therapeutic genemodified human
      melanoma cell lines, referred to as Mich1H6 and Mich2H6, which has been gamma-irradiated to
      render the cells non-proliferative. There is no recommended International Non-proprietary
      (INN) Name for the drug substance.

      Methodology: In this open-label study of patients with advanced melanoma, one dose of AGI -
      101H vaccine will be administered s.c.. 20 evaluable patients will be recruited. An
      independent data monitoring committee (DMC) will review all safety data after the first 10
      injections and then after another 10 injections (20 injections in total). Up to that second
      DMC meeting all patients have to stay in the hospital for a 2 hours observation; after the
      analysis of the 20 vaccinations the DMC will review the safety data and may recommend
      reverting to normal outpatients setting.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have given signed informed consent for participation in the study prior
             to any study-related procedures being performed and not part of normal medical care,
             with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the patient at any time
             without prejudice to their future medical care

          -  Age ≥18 years of age and ≤75 years of age

          -  Histologically confirmed, unresectable stage 3 or 4 measurable (RECIST criteria),
             cutaneous melanoma or unknown primary with melanoma metastases

          -  Life expectancy of at least 30 weeks and an ECOG performance status of X 1

          -  Adequate renal and liver function as defined by serum creatinine and total bilirubin
             levels no greater than 1.5 times the Investigational Site's upper normal laboratory

          -  Normal clotting

          -  The patient is willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the
             study, including 2 hours of follow up observation after the injections (until DMC
             lifts it after analysis of the first 20 injections) during the course of the trial,

             but are not limited to, uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia, recent (within 3 months)
             myocardial infarction, uncontrolled major seizure disorder, spinal cord compression,
             superior vena cava syndrome, or any psychiatric disorder that prohibits obtaining
             informed consent

          -  Patients who are known to be serologically positive for Hepatitis B (patients
