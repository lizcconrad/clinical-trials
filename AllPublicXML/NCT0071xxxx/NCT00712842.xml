    <textblock>
      A variety of studies demonstrate that ocular blood flow is altered in diabetes and retinal
      perfusion abnormalities have been proposed to contribute to the pathogenesis of diabetic
      retinopathy.

      Various animal and human studies have demonstrated that retinal and optic nerve blood flow
      increase in response to diffuse luminance flicker. Based on studies with ERG, this effect has
      been attributed to augmented activity in the retinal ganglion cells and associated axons
      indicating a coupling mechanism between neuronal activity and retinal blood flow. Whereas a
      variety of studies describe the effects of flickering light on retinal and optic nerve head
      blood flow, the knowledge about this coupling in the diabetic retina is sparse.

      In view of the fact that neural activity and blood flow are strongly coupled in the human
      retina, one could hypothesize that neurodegenerative changes in the retina could contribute
      to the vascular dysregulation and in turn lead to changes of ocular perfusion. The
      investigators set out to investigate whether the coupling of neural activity and blood flow
      is impaired in patients with early stage diabetic retinopathy compared to those in healthy
      volunteers.
