      Open-label phase 1b trial. Study treatment will be administered in 3 week cycles.

      There are two distinct parts in this study:

        -  Part 1: Dose escalation from IMO-2055

        -  Part 2: Once a recommended phase 2 dose is found additional tolerability and
           pharmacodynamics will be explored

      -  Part 1: Dose escalation of IMO-2055, including 3 dose groups. Once a recommended phase 2
           dosage (RP2D) of IMO-2055 given concomitantly with FOLFIRI and cetuximab is found the
           selected cohort will be expanded by an additional 6 to 9 patients (to a total of 12
           patients) for confirmation of the RP2D and combination treatment regimen.

        -  Part 2: A final cohort of 12 patients (Cohort 6) will be enrolled simultaneously to
           explore tolerability and pharmacodynamics in patients treated with the RP2D of IMO-2055
           in combination with FOLFIRI with cetuximab.

             time, without prejudice.

          6. All clinically significant adverse events of any prior chemotherapy, surgery or
             radiotherapy must have resolved to CTCAE v3.0 grade ≤ 1. Neuropathy of CTCAE v3.0
             grade ≤ 2 will be allowed but the neuropathy should be closely monitored throughout
