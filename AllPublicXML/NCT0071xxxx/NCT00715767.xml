    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, multi-center intervention trial comparing two educational programs on
      healthcare provider performance in the Botswana national hospital system. This study
      addresses the critical question of how to effectively and consistently measure and associate
      CPR knowledge and psychomotor skills, enabling the optimization of the learners' environment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Context: The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that more than 16 million people die
      from cardiovascular diseases each year, accounting for more than one-third of global deaths.
      Almost half of these deaths take place in hospitalized settings. Standard acute medicine
      education programs have had limited success in training hospital based healthcare providers
      to acquire, retain, and transfer knowledge and skills to impact patient outcomes in both
      developed and developing countries. There is a gap between the cognitive knowledge and
      critical thinking skills attained during courses and the technical and team skills actually
      performed by hospital-based healthcare providers. This gap between existing knowledge and
      performed skills restricts care delivery, underutilizes available resources, and contributes
      to the number of preventable deaths. This gap is further accentuated in resource limited
      settings, where barriers to implementation of successful acute medicine training programs are
      often accentuated.

      Primary Objective:

      1. To determine selected cognitive knowledge and critical thinking skills which are
      associated with technical and team skills performance assessed immediately following Basic
      Life Support (BLS) for Health Care Providers course training.

      Secondary Objectives:

      1. To identify cultural, healthcare environment and educational barriers that currently
      impede acquisition, retention, and transfer of knowledge and skills in acute medicine
      educational programs in resource limited settings.

    <description>Cognitive Assessment:
Knowledge base and critical thinking will be evaluated by a 50-question BLS multiple-choice examination. At the designated 4 cognitive assessments in the study (pre-course, immediately post course, 3 months and 6 months) 50 equivalent questions will be used to cover all core BLS objectives. Technical Skills Assessment:
Primary outcome measures of adequacy of chest compressions and ventilations as well as key actions for each of the 3standardized basic life support skill tests during 3-minute testing scenarios. Video review by 2independent experts will be utilized for objective assessment of time and order dependent skills, and manikin output will be utilized to assess qualitative effectiveness of skills (adequate ventilation, compression, and defibrillation).
Survey Instrument for Barriers to Acute Medicine Education:
A survey tool will be used to identify barriers to acute medicine education implementation and efficacy.</description>
