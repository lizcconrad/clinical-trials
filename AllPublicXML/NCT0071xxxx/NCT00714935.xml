  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Decision Aids (DA) to inform patients about health care options and help them to participate
      in their care choices are widely advocated. The main argument for offering patients a choice
      is that patients' preferences vary, and health professionals cannot always know what is
      &quot;best&quot; for an individual, specially when different outcomes have different benefits and risk
      profiles. The standard modes of treatment for patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) are
      coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, medication, and angioplasty. All three
      treatments for CAD work better when combined with cardiac risk factor modification behavior
      (CRFMB). CRFMB is important for the general public, but it is even more important for people
      with CAD because people with CAD have more at stake. In this RCT study we will evaluate the
      effectiveness of a CAD-DA with and witout an additional decision counseling program (DCP) on
      health outcomes and quality of life to improve enhancement of adherence to cardiac risk
      modification behavior. The CAD-DA is developed by the Ottawa Health Research Institute and
      Division of Clinical Epidemiology at Montreal General Hospital, for CAD patients facing the
      decision of making lifestyle changes to lower their cardiac risk factors. It provides
      patients with information about what they can you do to prevent the disease from progressing.
      The DCP is designed to systematically guide patients through the process of deciding what
      cardiac risk modification behaviors are important for them to carry out. A RCT where 360 CAD
      patients &gt; 18 of age scheduled for an angiogram at Rikshospitalet University Hospital in
      Norway (RH) will be randomly assigned to: (1) CAD-DA group where subjects will receive, for
      take home, the CAD-DA prior to their scheduled angiogram; (2) DCP group where subjects in
      addition to the CAD-DA will receive an individual decisional counseling program (DCP) from a
      trained nurse counselor in their homes prior to their angiogram; and (3) the control group
      who will receive &quot;usual care&quot;. Data will be collected at four points: at the initial visit
      (T1), 2 months (T2), 4 months (T3) and 6 (T4) months after angiogram
