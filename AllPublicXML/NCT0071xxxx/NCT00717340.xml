      This is a standard Phase 1b and 2a, multi-center, study design that will examine the safety,
      tolerability, maximum tolerated dose, and overall response rate of tivozanib (AV-951) and
      paclitaxel in a breast cancer.

      In the Phase 1b study, only the doses of tivozanib (AV-951) will be escalated from 0.5 mg/day
      to 1.5 mg /day. All subjects will receive doses of weekly paclitaxel chemotherapy.

      The Phase 2a study portion of the study was not conducted.

    <description>Tivozanib (AV-951):
Subjects in the Phase 1b study will receive 1 dose of tivozanib (AV-951) on Day -5 (± 2 days) for PK sampling prior to Cycle 1 only.
Thereafter in the Phase 1b and 2a study, subjects will receive tivozanib (AV-951) once daily for 3 weeks beginning on Day 1, followed by 1 week off treatment (1 cycle = 4 weeks). On days when paclitaxel and tivozanib (AV-951) are co-administered, AV-951 will be administered immediately following the end of the paclitaxel infusion.
Paclitaxel: Phase 1b study and Phase 2a study:
All subjects will receive IV paclitaxel 90 mg/m2, administered over 1 hour once a week for 3 weeks, followed by 1 week off (1 cycle = 4 weeks).</description>
