    <textblock>
      This study will involve the use of a new medicine called GW642444 being developed for the
      treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The purpose of the
      study is to see how safe and how well tolerated the study drug is when it is given as a
      liquid by mouth or by injection into a vein. In addition the study will measure how much of
      the medicine gets into the bloodstream when it is given by mouth, by injection into a vein
      and inhaled, and how long the body takes to get rid of it.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single-centre, open-label, dose-ascending study in 9 healthy male subjects to
      establish safe and well tolerated systemic exposure safety margins for GW642444 following
      intravenous and oral dosing to support future studies. Additionally a single inhaled dose of
      GW642444M will be administered to provide data to estimate inhaled bioavailability of
      GW642444 and the extent of renal excretion following dosing via this route. It is planned to
      administer four, dose-ascending, intravenous administrations of GW642444 during treatment
      periods 1, 2, 3 and 5; the inhaled dose would be administered in treatment period 4 and the
      oral dose in treatment period 6. The sequence of treatment administration may be altered if
      required for logistical reasons, however doses of intravenous and oral GW642444 will be
      administered strictly in dose ascending order. All intravenous doses will be administered as
      an infusion given at a constant rate over a 1 hour period.
