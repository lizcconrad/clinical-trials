    <textblock>
      The study proposes that a workshop-based educational experience which utilizes a standardized
      preceptor training session, a standard skills assessment checklist, and videotaped feedback
      will improve student comfort and confidence in performing the pediatric physical examination
      and will provide information to improve the curriculum offerings.

      The baseline clinical experience of third year medical students rotating through the
      clerkship varies, depending on previous clerkships and volunteer opportunities previously
      encountered. The less experienced third year medical student may require more time and
      feedback to develop competency. The availability and experience of clinical preceptors and
      background of the patient may also play a role in the development of pediatric physical
      examination skills. Other institutions have offered standardized approaches to teaching the
      health maintenance physical exam. To address these issues, we propose a workshop-based
      educational experience to (1)determine whether offering a workshop that standardizes exposure
      to physical exams for junior medical students will improve opportunities to practice physical
      exam skills in a non-threatening environment, (2)promote immediate feedback to the student
      that allows for self-reflection by viewing a videotape of their performance, (3)delineate how
      physical exam skills change in junior medical students throughout the year, and (4)evaluate
      the inter-rater variability of preceptors teaching health maintenance exams to students
      rotating through the pediatric clerkship.
