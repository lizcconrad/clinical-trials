      The purpose of this study is to investigate what effects, if any, picoplatin has on the heart
      rhythm.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase 1 and 2 studies have demonstrated that picoplatin, a next-generation platinum analogue
      designed to avoid drug resistance, has activity when administered IV in a variety of cancers.
      Preclinical and clinical studies indicate that picoplatin may be effective in platinum
      refractory or resistant cancer.

      Preclinical data in beagle dogs have shown that picoplatin had no effect on cardiovascular
      function, including the QT interval. In the cumulative human trial experience, the
      cardiovascular serious adverse events that have occurred are consistent with events expected
      in patients with advanced malignant disease and do not suggest any propensity toward
      drug-related serious ventricular arrhythmias or sudden death.

      The purpose of this trial is to conduct a formal study to specifically evaluate the effect of
      picoplatin on the QT/QTc interval as measured by the ECG, and to correlate QTcF interval with
      plasma total and ultrafilterable platinum concentrations. This study is also being conducted
      to ensure the safety of picoplatin with regard to the QT/QTc interval. Patients who choose to
      participate in this study will also be given the opportunity to continue to receive
      picoplatin until limited by toxicity or disease progression.
