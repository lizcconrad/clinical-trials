  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn about how patients who have looked up cancer-related
      information on the internet talk with their doctors. We are interested in these conversations
      even if the patients do not think they will talk about the information with their doctor
      during their visit. We will audio record doctor-patient visits and listen to these recordings
      to learn about how patients who have looked up cancer-related internet information talk to
      their doctors and how their doctors talk to them. We will also give patients questionnaires
      before and after their appointments to learn about what they think about communicating with
      their doctors.

    <description>Patients in Category 1 are those who report before the visit that they intend to discuss cancer-related internet information and report after the visit that they did discuss such information. The coding of these patients' consultations with their physicians and analysis of their pre- and post-consultation questionnaires will address Aims 1 and 2.</description>

    <description>Patients in Category 2 are those who report before the visit that they intend to discuss cancer-related internet information, but report after the visit that they did not discuss such information. This category is important as our previous research indicates that sometimes patients do not discuss information because they feel there is not enough time or because the information is irrelevant or repetitive. These patients' audio recordings will be checked to verify that there was no internet information discussion. These audio recordings will not be coded.
However, assessment of these patients' questionnaires will aid in addressing Aim 3 and may provide some pilot data on why patients who initially intend to discuss internet information do not.</description>

    <description>Patients in Category 3 are those who report before the visit that they do not intend to discuss cancer-related internet information and do not discuss it. Assessment of these patients' questionnaires will aid in addressing Aim 3. These audio recordings will not be coded. It is important, however, that these consultations be audio recorded for two reasons: First, it allows the physician to remain blinded to the intent of the patient to discuss internet information. Second, it provides a method of verifying that the patient really did not discuss internet information. Although not expected, it is possible for a patient to go into a consultation without intending to discuss internet information, but does end up discussing it. We will note if this occurs.</description>
