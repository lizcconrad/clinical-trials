  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a functional electrical stimulation device,
      the SurgiStim3, decreases pain, pain medications and/or edema in patients undergoing anterior
      cruciate ligament repair.

    <description>Electrical stimulation device that provides interferential, high voltage pulsed current and neuromuscular waveforms in sequence. The device runs continuously for the first 2 days following surgery, then runs 3 times a day for 1 hour on days 3 through 42.</description>

    <description>The placebo device is programmed to run for the same amount of time, at the same schedule, using the same waveforms as the functional device over the course of the 42 days. The placebo device, however, will only increase to 80% of the patient-set amplitude after a one minute set-up period and will only turn on for 6 seconds of every minute (3s ramp up, 1s on time, 2s ramp down).</description>
