    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-humans study of GSI-136, a drug being developed for the treatment of
      Alzheimer Disease. The main purpose of this study is to determine whether GSI-136 is safe and
      tolerable in healthy young and healthy elderly subjects. The amount of drug in the body and
      the effects of the drug on the body will also be evaluated at certain timepoints.

        &lt;Inclusion:

          1. Men or women of nonchildbearing potential (WONCBP) aged 18 to 50 years or greater than
             65 years, inclusive, at screening. WONCBP may be included if they are either
             surgically sterile (hysterectomy and/or oophorectomy) or postmenopausal for greater
             than 1 year (with follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH] level greater than 38 mIU/mL) and
             must have a negative pregnancy test result within 48 hours before test article
             administration. Women who are surgically sterile must provide documentation of the
             procedure by an operative report or by ultrasound scan. Sexually active men must agree
             to use a medically acceptable form of contraception during the study and continue it
             for 12 weeks after test article administration.

          2. Body mass index (BMI) in the range of 18.0 to 30.0 kg/m2 and body weight greater than
             50 kg.

        3) The elderly subjects must be generally healthy, but may be enrolled with a stable,
        chronic illness, if it is well controlled and does not interfere with the primary objective
        of the study. Subjects may be included with clinically important deviations from normal
        limits in medical history, physical examination findings, vital sign measurements, 12-lead
        ECGs, or clinical laboratory test results that are associated with stable, chronic, and
        well-controlled medical conditions.

        Exclusion:

          1. Any history or presence of chronic respiratory disorder or disease including but not
             limited to asthma, sleep apnea, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

          2. Any significant cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, respiratory, gastrointestinal,
             endocrine, immunologic, dermatologic, hematologic, neurologic, or psychiatric disease.

          3. Presence or history of thyroid disease, symptomatic vertigo, significant cardiac
             valvular disease, congestive heart failure, angina pectoris, significant cardiac
             arrhythmia, or seizures.
