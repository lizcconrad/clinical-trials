    <measure>Reduction From Baseline in Mean IOP at Week 12, Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Calculated as Baseline IOP minus Week 12 IOP, LOCF. IOP measured using 1 of 3 methods: Goldmann applanation tonometry (preferred method, if feasible), Perkins tonometry, or TonoPen. IOP was measured twice and if the measurements were less than or equal to (≤) 2 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) of each other, the mean of the 2 readings was recorded as the IOP at that time point. Otherwise, a third IOP measurement was taken and the median IOP recorded.</description>

    <description>Participants with ≥15% IOP reduction from baseline at both Week 4 and Week 12. Calculated as (post baseline IOP minus baseline IOP) divided by IOP, multiplied by 100%. IOP measured using 1 of 3 methods: Goldmann applanation tonometry (preferred method, if feasible), Perkins tonometry, or TonoPen.

    <description>An investigator's causality assessment was the determination of whether there existed a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to an adverse event (AE). If the investigator did not know whether or not investigational product caused the event, then the event was handled as &quot;related to investigational product&quot; for reporting purposes.</description>

IOP measured using 1 of 3 methods: Goldmann applanation tonometry (preferred method, if feasible), Perkins tonometry, or TonoPen.

Otherwise, a third IOP measurement was taken and the median IOP recorded.</description>

        <description>Calculated as Baseline IOP minus Week 1 IOP (observed). IOP measured using 1 of 3 methods: Goldmann applanation tonometry (preferred method, if feasible), Perkins tonometry, or TonoPen. IOP was measured twice and if the measurements were ≤ 2 mmHg of each other, the mean of the 2 readings was recorded as the IOP at that time point. Otherwise, a third IOP measurement was taken and the median IOP recorded.</description>

        <title>Mean IOP at Week 12</title>
        <description>IOP measured using 1 of 3 methods: Goldmann applanation tonometry (preferred method, if feasible), Perkins tonometry, or TonoPen. IOP was measured twice and if the measurements were ≤ 2 mmHg of each other, the mean of the 2 readings was recorded as the IOP at that time point. Otherwise, a third IOP measurement was taken and the median IOP recorded.</description>
