    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Reported a Lower Need to Practice Safe Sex Following HPV Vaccination and the Percentage of Participants That Reported a Higher Need to Practice Safe Sex Following HPV Vaccination</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>Participants' perceptions for the need to practice safe sex following HPV vaccination was measured using a safer sexual behaviors subscale, which was comprised of the following five questions:
After getting vaccinated against HPV …
You feel that condom use during sex is less necessary.
You feel it is still just as important to have as few sexual partners as possible.
You feel that it is less important to talk to your sex partners about safe sex.
You think it is still just as important to use a condom every time you have sex.
You will be less worried about having unprotected sex. Those who were categorized in the &quot;lower need for safer sexual behaviors (NSSB)&quot; group had a summary score that was less than the median and those in the &quot;higher NSSB&quot; group had a summary score that was equal to or higher than the median.</description>

    <measure>Need for Safer Sexual Behaviors (NSSB) (Evaluated by Using the &quot;12-item Knowledge About HPV and HPV Vaccine&quot; Measure)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>To characterize young women's risk perceptions, sexual behaviors, and sexually transmitted infections (STI) diagnoses over the 48 weeks after initial vaccination, the relationship of baseline &quot;12-item Knowledge About HPV and HPV Vaccine&quot; measure was used to evaluate the need for safer sexual behaviors.</description>

    <measure>Visit Compliance Via the Telephone Response System (TRS) Versus the Vaccine Report Card.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 through Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Visit compliance is the total number of days participants actually called the TRS or completed the VRC divided by the total number of days expected to call the TRS or complete the VRC, multiplied by 100%.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse Events (AE) Reported Among Participants Who Were Randomized to the Telephone Response System (TRS) or Vaccine Report Card (VRC).</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 through Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Rate of AEs is the total number of AEs divided by the total number of participants. The rate is not a percentage bur rather it could be above 1 or less than 1. This outcome measure looked at number of AEs reported, by grade; number of AEs &gt; Grade 3 identified; and number of AEs &gt; Grade 3 evaluated within 24 or 48 hours.</description>

             culture, HIV-1 DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or plasma HIV-1 RNA &gt; 1,000
             copies/ml

          -  HIV treatment history that falls in one of the following categories:

        Group A: ART naïve or if ART-exposed, has not received HAART for at least the six months

             preceding study entry. Use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents and inhaled or
             topical corticosteroids are not exclusion criteria

          -  Known or suspected disease of the immune system (other than HIV), i.e., malignancy,

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Reported a Lower Need to Practice Safe Sex Following HPV Vaccination and the Percentage of Participants That Reported a Higher Need to Practice Safe Sex Following HPV Vaccination</title>
        <description>Participants’ perceptions for the need to practice safe sex following HPV vaccination was measured using a safer sexual behaviors subscale, which was comprised of the following five questions:
After getting vaccinated against HPV …
You feel that condom use during sex is less necessary.
You feel it is still just as important to have as few sexual partners as possible.
You feel that it is less important to talk to your sex partners about safe sex.
You think it is still just as important to use a condom every time you have sex.
You will be less worried about having unprotected sex. Those who were categorized in the “lower need for safer sexual behaviors (NSSB)” group had a summary score that was less than the median and those in the “higher NSSB” group had a summary score that was equal to or higher than the median.</description>
