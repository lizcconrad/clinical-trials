    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look for evidence of bacteria in the urine or bladder of
      people with overactive bladder. Because you do not have overactive bladder, your
      participation in this study will be used as a comparison to those who have overactive
      bladder.

    <description>Sterile specimens were obtained from subjects. The urethra was prepared with Betadine and an 8Fr urethral catheter passed into the bladder and urine obtained in a sterile container. Bladder washings were obtained after urine was completely emptied from the bladder via the catheter. Saline (60ccs) was used to vigorously irrigate the bladder 2-3 times through the 8 Fr catheter. The bladder washings were then collected and placed in a sterile container. The experimental cultures included 100ml inoculated on Blood Agar, MacConkey Agar and Brucella Blood Agar, incubated for 72 hours at 35-37 C in ambient atmosphere supplemented with 5-8% carbon dioxide. Colonies were counted to quantify the cfu/ml and all growth of any organism was reported. Organisms were then identified using standard microbiologic techniques.</description>
