  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is hypothesized that oral naltrexone will improve inflammation of the bowel by increasing
      endogenous enkephalin levels in subjects with active Crohn's disease. This is especially
      important in children who often are suffering from nutritional deprivation which retards
      their growth.

      The key objectives are to:

        1. Evaluate the effects of low dose naltrexone in children with Crohn's Disease by using
           the Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI), plasma inflammatory markers,
           weight, and pediatric quality of life survey.

        2. To determine the safety and toxicity of low dose naltrexone in pediatric subjects with
           active Crohn's Disease.

        3. Assess the potential mechanism by which naltrexone exerts its action by measuring plasma
           opioid (enkephalin and endorphin levels) and proinflammatory cytokines.

      The present proposal is designed as double-blinded placebo controlled study involving 30
      children between 6-17 years of age with active Crohn's disease. Children will be treated with
      either naltrexone or placebo for the first 8 weeks then all subjects will receive active
      naltrexone drug the last 8 weeks. A one month follow-up appointment will be scheduled 4-weeks
      after completion of the active drug for safety and to assess Crohn's activity. Low dose
      naltrexone (LDN) will be dispensed in either capsules at a dose of 4.5 mg for those ages 10
      years or older and in liquid form at 0.1 mg/kg for those under age of 10 or less than 45 kg.
      Half of the subjects in the first 8 weeks will be randomized to placebo which will be either
      capsules filled with avicel (see section 6.0) or diluent (flavored water) if in liquid form.
      Children are eligible who are not of child-bearing potential or are using two means of
      effective birth control, have a Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) of at least
      31 points, and have the confirmed diagnosis of Crohn's disease by either endoscopic or
      radiographic tests.

    <description>Secondary outcome was efficacy on clinical activity. Mean pretreatment PCDAI scores in patients had moderate to severe disease activity at baseline were compared between those who received placebo for 8 weeks and those who received active experimental drug, naltrexone.
The PCDAI score is a number unit that is calculated from symptoms scores by the subject over a 7-day period prior to the visit, laboratory values, height &amp; weight, and physical exam findings. A score of 10 and under denotes &quot;remission&quot;. Mild disease (score of 11-30); moderate disease (score of 31-45), a severe disease (scores greater than 45. A decline of 10 points or more is considered &quot;response to therapy&quot;. The score can range from 0 to &gt;60 Patient must have a PCDAI score of equal or greater than 30 to qualify for this study (i.e., moderate to severe disease).</description>

    <description>IMPACT III was a pediatric Crohn's specific quality of life survey used in this study. It examines five major categories influencing the quality of life in children with Crohn's disease including bowel symptoms, systemic symptoms, emotional well-being, social well-being, and body image perception. The IMPACT-III uses 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5 for all answers. The outcome score ranges from 35 to 175, with higher scores suggesting better quality of life. So an increase in score denotes improved Quality of life.</description>

          <description>The PCDAI score is a number unit that is calculated from symptoms scores by the subject over a 7-day period prior to the visit, laboratory values, height &amp; weight, and physical exam findings. A score of 10 and under denotes &quot;remission&quot;. Mild disease (score of 11-30); moderate disease (score of 31-45), a severe disease (scores greater than 45. A decline of 10 points or more is considered &quot;response to therapy&quot;. The score can range from 0 to &gt;60 Patient must have a PCDAI score of equal or greater than 30 to qualify for this study (i.e., moderate to severe disease).</description>

        <description>IMPACT III was a pediatric Crohn's specific quality of life survey used in this study. It examines five major categories influencing the quality of life in children with Crohn’s disease including bowel symptoms, systemic symptoms, emotional well-being, social well-being, and body image perception. The IMPACT-III uses 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5 for all answers. The outcome score ranges from 35 to 175, with higher scores suggesting better quality of life. So an increase in score denotes improved Quality of life.</description>
