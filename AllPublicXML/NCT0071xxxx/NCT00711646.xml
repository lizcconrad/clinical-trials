      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of Sativex® in
      subjects diagnosed with MS and spasticity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was an eight week (two weeks baseline, six weeks treatment), multicentre, double blind,
      randomised, placebo controlled parallel group study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and
      tolerability of Sativex® in subjects diagnosed with MS and spasticity. Subjects were screened
      to determine eligibility and completed a two week baseline period. Subjects then returned to
      the site for assessment, randomisation and dose introduction. Visits occurred at the end of
      treatment week two and at the end of the study (treatment week six) or withdrawal.

    <measure>Assessment of Change From Baseline in the Mean Spasticity 0-10 Numerical Rating Scale Score.</measure>
    <time_frame>0-52 days</time_frame>
    <description>The spasticity Numerical Rating Scale was completed at the same time each day, i.e. bedtime in the evening. The patient was asked &quot;on a scale of '0 to 10', please indicate the number that best describes your average spasticity in the last 24 hours&quot; where 0 = no spasticity and 10 = worst ever spasticity. For the analysis, end of treatment was defined as the mean of the last seven days in the study or the last three days if the subject withdrew due to worsening spasticity or lack of efficacy. A negative value indicates an improvement in spasticity score from baseline.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Ashworth Scale Score at the End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 0 - 52</time_frame>
    <description>The mean Ashworth Scale score across muscle groups was calculated using only those muscle groups with a score of greater than or equal to two at baseline. All 20 muscle groups were assessed for spasticity (using a 1-5 scale): 1= no increase in muscle tone to 5= passive movement is difficult and affected part is rigid in flexion or extension. The score for all 20 muscle groups were added to give a total score out of 100; minimum score was 20. A decrease in score indicates an improvement in condition.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Spasm Frequency Score at the End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 0 - 52</time_frame>
    <description>Each day subjects recorded in their diary the frequency of their spasms using the following scoring system: 0 = no spasms, 1 = one or fewer spasms per day, 2 = between one and five spasms per day, 3 = six to nine spasms per day, 4 = ten or more spasms per day or continuous contraction. For the analysis, end of treatment was defined as the mean of the last seven days in the study or the last three days if the subject withdrew due to worsening spasticity or lack of efficacy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Motricity Index Score for the Arms</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7 and 52</time_frame>
    <description>Arm - 3 movements were pinch grip, elbow flexion and shoulder abduction. The total arm score was the addition of the score for the 3 arm movements. One point was then added to give a maximum score of 100; minimum was 1 point. Where both arms were assessed, the average of the two limbs scores was used as the assessment score; otherwise the affected limb total score was used. An increase in score indicates an improvement in condition..</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient's Global Impression of Change in Condition at the End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 52</time_frame>
    <description>A 7-point Likert-type scale was used, with the question: 'Please assess the change in your condition since entry into the study using the scale below' with the markers &quot;very much improved, much improved, slightly improved, no change, slightly worse, much worse or very much worse&quot;. At Visit 2 (Baseline) patients wrote a brief description of their condition which was used at end of treatment to aid their memory regarding their symptoms at study start. For each of above markers the number of participants were reported.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of Adverse Events as a Measure of Subject Safety</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0-52</time_frame>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Motricity Index Score for the Legs</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7 and Day 52</time_frame>
    <description>Ankle dorsiflexion, knee extension and hip flexion were assessed and scored to give a maximum of 100%. The Motricity Index score (scale 1-100) was recorded for limbs that had an associated Ashworth Scale score, which was greater than or equal to two at baseline.</description>

        <description>The spasticity Numerical Rating Scale was completed at the same time each day, i.e. bedtime in the evening. The patient was asked &quot;on a scale of '0 to 10', please indicate the number that best describes your average spasticity in the last 24 hours&quot; where 0 = no spasticity and 10 = worst ever spasticity. For the analysis, end of treatment was defined as the mean of the last seven days in the study or the last three days if the subject withdrew due to worsening spasticity or lack of efficacy. A negative value indicates an improvement in spasticity score from baseline.</description>

        <description>The mean Ashworth Scale score across muscle groups was calculated using only those muscle groups with a score of greater than or equal to two at baseline. All 20 muscle groups were assessed for spasticity (using a 1-5 scale): 1= no increase in muscle tone to 5= passive movement is difficult and affected part is rigid in flexion or extension. The score for all 20 muscle groups were added to give a total score out of 100; minimum score was 20. A decrease in score indicates an improvement in condition.</description>

One point was then added to give a maximum score of 100; minimum was 1 point.

          <title>Change From Baseline in Mean Motricity Index Score for the Arms</title>
          <description>Arm - 3 movements were pinch grip, elbow flexion and shoulder abduction. The total arm score was the addition of the score for the 3 arm movements. One point was then added to give a maximum score of 100; minimum was 1 point. Where both arms were assessed, the average of the two limbs scores was used as the assessment score; otherwise the affected limb total score was used. An increase in score indicates an improvement in condition..</description>
