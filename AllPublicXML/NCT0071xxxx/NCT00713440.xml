      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the reduced incretin effect and the
      paradoxical glucagon responses during oral glucose ingestion and isoglycaemic iv glucose
      infusion observed in patients with type 2 diabetes are causes (non-inducible in lean healthy
      subjects without family history of diabetes) or consequences (inducible) of the diabetic
      state.

    <textblock>
      The incretin effect is severely reduced in patients with type 2 diabetes. This
      pathophysiological trait is accompanied by an almost abolished insulinotropic effect of the
      incretin hormone glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and a reduced
      insulinotropic potency of the other incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1).
      Furthermore, recent studies suggest that hypersecretion of glucagon during oral glucose
      ingestion, as opposed to a normal suppression of glucagon during isoglycaemic intravenous
      (iv) administered glucose, further attenuates the incretin effect in patients with type 2
      diabetes.

      However, it remains unclear whether the severely reduced incretin effect and its accompanying
      pathophysiological traits characterizing patients with type 2 diabetes can be induced
      temporarily in healthy subjects by a short period of glucose homeostatic dysregulation.

      In this study the incretin effect will be measured using 50-g oral glucose tolerance test and
      isoglycaemic iv glucose infusion and meal test in 10 healthy Caucasian subjects without
      family history of diabetes before and after dysregulation of glucose homeostasis using high
      calorie diet, physical inactivity and administration of adrenocortical steroids
