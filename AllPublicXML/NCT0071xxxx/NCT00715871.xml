    <description>Subjects received an amount of &quot;liquid nicotine cigarettes&quot; (containing 1.5mg of nicotine each) based on the amount of nicotine the subjects had been receiving from cigarettes. The number of &quot;liquid nicotine cigarettes&quot; received by each subject was reviewed, and adjusted (if necessary), every two weeks for the duration of the 12-week study.</description>

    <description>The Smoke-Break nicotine delivery device is a &quot;liquid nicotine cigarette&quot; designed to mimic the act of smoking. It is an NRT (nicotine replacement therapy) similar in concept to the nicotine patch, gum, and lozenge, except the nicotine is delivered in a way designed to duplicate the cigarette smoking experience. The Smoke-Break nicotine delivery device is non-invasive.</description>
