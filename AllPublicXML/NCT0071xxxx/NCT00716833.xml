    <textblock>
      This randomised placebo controlled double-blinded bicentre study (phase III) was designed to
      evaluate the preemptive and postoperative analgetic impact of etoricoxibe in open abdominal
      and thoracic surgery. Etoricoxib selectively inhibits isoform 2 of cyclo-oxigenase enzyme
      (COX-2).

      Therefore 120 patients (ASA-risk 1-2) with upcoming abdominal or thoracic surgery should be
      included into this study. Patients are randomly allocated to either the preemptive or the
      postoperative Etoricoxibe group. These two groups are divided each into two arms. Preemptive
      group patients get Etoricoxibe either twice (before and after surgery) or just a single
      preoperative dose. Postoperative group patients get placebo before surgery and either a drug
      application or a placebo again after surgery (so called 2x2 factorial study design).

      Cumulative use of morphine as assessed within first 48 hours after surgery is the primary
      trial outcome indicating the analgesic potency of Etoricoxibe.

      In addition, changes in patients level of sensibilisation will be measured with help of
      quantitative sensory testing (a standardised procedure) before and after surgery (secondary
      outcome). In addition pharmacogenetic testing will provide information about genetic
      aberrations (so called polymorphisms) of the patients enzymes that should be compared to the
      individual reaction regarding Etoricoxibe.

      The results will give hint about the analgesic impact of etoricoxibe in acute postoperative
      pain. There will be findings for preemptive analgesia and nerval processes. All this could
      lead to an improvement of postoperative pain relief while administrating preemptively a COX-2
      selective inhibitor before surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Etoricoxib (brand name Arcoxia worldwide; also Algix and Tauxib in Italy) is a new COX-2
      selective inhibitor (approx. 106.0 times more selective for COX-2 inhibition over COX-1).
      Doses are 120 mg/day for acute pain. Current therapeutic indications are: treatment of
      rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, chronic low back pain, acute
      pain and gout. Note that approved indications differ by country.

      Like any other COX-2 selective inhibitor, Etoricoxib selectively inhibits isoform 2 of
      cyclo-oxigenase enzyme (COX-2). This reduces the generation of prostaglandins (PGs) from
      arachidonic acid. Among the different functions exerted by PGs, their role in the
      inflammation cascade should be highlighted. COX-2 selective inhibitor (aka &quot;COXIB&quot;) showed
      less marked activity on type 1 cycloxigenase compared to traditional non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID). This reduced activity is the cause of reduced
      gastrointestinal toxicity.

      Quantitative sensory tests (QST) are techniques employed to measure the intensity of stimuli
      needed to produce specific sensory perceptions. They are used to evaluate a sensory detection
      threshold or other sensory responses from supra-threshold stimulation. The common physical
      stimuli are (i) touch-pressure, (ii) vibration, and (iii) coolness, warmth, cold pain, and
      heat pain. In QST, the subject must be able to comprehend what is being asked by the test,
      alert and not taking mind-altering medications, and not biased to a certain test outcome.
