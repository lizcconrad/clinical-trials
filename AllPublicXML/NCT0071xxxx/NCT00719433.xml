  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine whether task-oriented, robot-aided therapy is more
      effective than conventional physical and occupational therapy at promoting functional
      recovery of the affected arm in chronic hemiparetic stroke patients.

      Robotic therapy will be performed with ARMin, which is a robotic arm exoskeleton that permits
      3D movements of both proximal and distal arm joints. Combined with an audiovisual display,
      this device allows virtual training of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and therapeutic
      gaming. A patient-responsive controller enables the assistance of the device only as needed.
      Chronic stroke patients (&gt;6 months post stroke) will be randomly assigned to either an
      experimental or a control group. The experimental group will perform task-related intensive
      therapy with the support of ARMin. Therapists will treat the patients of the control group
      with standard motor relearning therapy.
