    <textblock>
      Although the long saphenous vein remains the most commonly used conduit in coronary
      revascularization, traditional open vein harvest may lead to significantly impaired wound
      healing and post-operative pain. To this end, endoscopic saphenous vein harvesting techniques
      have been shown to reduce post-operative morbidity. Studies have shown that endothelial
      integrity and luminal nitric oxide synthase (NOS) are better preserved with novel &quot;no-touch&quot;
      techniques; however, the effect and the associated mechanism of endoscopic vein harvest on
      endothelial integrity and function remain unknown. Therefore, in the present proposal, we
      will collect the saphenous vein segements immediately after harvesting, reperfusion, and
      grafting, and then use enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA), immunohistochemical
      staining (IHC), and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect the expression and
      distribution of endothelial NOS (eNOS), endothelin-1 (ET-1), vascular cell adhesion
      molecule-1 (VCAM-1), intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and platelet endothelial
      cell adhesion molecule-1(PECAM-1) at protein and RNA levels in the endothelium of saphenous
      veins. The major aim of this study is to elucidate the effect and mechanism of endoscopic
      saphenous vein harvesting on endothelial properties as compare to conventional open vein
      harvest technique.
