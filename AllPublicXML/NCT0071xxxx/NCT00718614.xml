  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is evidence from a variety of animal studies that choroidal blood flow is under neural
      control. Recent results in humans indicate that a light/dark transition is associated with a
      short lasting reduction in choroidal blood flow. Several observations indicate that the
      changes in choroidal perfusion are triggered at least in part by neural mechanisms.
      Particularly, we have shown that during unilateral dark/light transition both eyes react with
      choroidal vasoconstriction strongly indicating a neural mechanism for blood flow regulation.
      Investigation of changes in choroidal blood flow during light/dark transition may represent
      an interesting approach to study neural dysregulation at the level of the eye in patients
      with IDDM. Accordingly, the hypothesis of reduced choroidal blood flow responses to a
      light/dark transition in patient with IDDM will be tested. This response in choroidal blood
      flow will be correlated to parameters of diabetic neuropathy and diabetic retinopathy.
