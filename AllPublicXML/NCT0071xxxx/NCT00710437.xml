  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During elective carotid endarterectomy surgery, dexmedetomidine, an FDA approved medication,
      is now given as part of our standard anesthetic regimen based upon its reported ability to
      decrease anesthetic requirements and improve the peri-operative hemodynamic profile without
      compromising the EEG monitoring that is used during these procedures. Although this is
      consistent with our clinical impression, the effects of dexmedetomidine on the perioperative
      course and EEG monitoring have not been objectively evaluated at our institution.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fifty sequential patient records will be identified from a search of the OR surgical
      schedules and reviewed: 25 patients before the introduction of dexmedetomidine and a standard
      anesthetic protocol and 25 patients after the introduction of the protocol. Data will be
      collected during an individual review of the pre-operative anesthetic evaluation, the
      intra-operative anesthetic record and the post-anesthesia care unit record and collated in an
      Excel spread sheet kept on a secure personal computer in the PI's office. All personal
      identifiers will be removed and the patients numbered sequentially before and after
      introduction of the clinical protocol. The data collected will be used to characterize the
      intraoperative anesthetic requirements, effects on EEG activity and the immediate
      postoperative recovery period. The review is expected to require 2 months to complete.

      This review will be restricted to records that already exist. No therapeutically removed
      tissues will be collected. There will be no additional tests. No blood samples will be
      collected. No additional procedures are involved in this study activity. There is no
      incomplete disclosure.

      The resources and personnel are currently available to complete this review. The entire
      project including data collection, analysis and summarization will be completed by the PI.
