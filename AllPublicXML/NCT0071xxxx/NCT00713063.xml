      The purpose of this study is to test the effect of a moderate-intensity aerobic exercise
      intervention for smokers interested in quitting smoking. We expect that this project will
      contribute much needed knowledge about the role of aerobic exercise in smoking cessation. If
      the efficacy of moderate-intensity, aerobic exercise for smoking can be established, smokers
      may have a valuable adjunct to more traditional smoking cessation approaches.
