    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is that many plasma proteins are altered in concentration and
      structure in preeclampsia and the elucidation of these alterations will add to the poorly
      understood pathophysiology of preeclampsia. In this study we will compare the maternal plasma
      proteomes of early-onset severe preeclampsia versus healthy controls, compare protein
      expression and quantification of the maternal plasma proteome at the time of diagnosis of
      EOS-preeclampsia to the plasma proteome of the same affected subject at 48 hours post
      delivery and we will verify the placental expression of differentially expressed or
      post-translationally modified proteins found in the plasma of women with EOS-preeclampsia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preeclampsia affects 7-10% of all pregnancies and is directly responsible for 50,000 maternal
      deaths and 900,000 perinatal deaths each year. Preeclampsia remains unpredictable and
      incurable except through premature delivery of the fetus. It is essential that a better
      understanding of preeclampsia is obtained.

      Proteomics offers a methodology for identification and quantification of each protein
      fraction found in human plasma in both disease and health. Since proteins are the basic
      elements of human biology, it is anticipated that alterations in protein posttranslational
      modification or total protein expression would be indicative and diagnostic of a disease
      state. Because proteins are recognized to act as messengers through hormone action, act as
      enzymes to catalyze important organic reactions and serve as structural components of the
      human body, they are the most representative of the current state of metabolic and structural
      activity in both the naive and disease state.

      Two groups of patients will be enrolled: (1) Patients with EOS-preeclampsia (N=60) and (2)
      healthy patients with normal pregnancies (N=240). The patients with EOS-preeclampsia will be
      matched (1:4) with contemporaneous control patients who are carrying a singleton gestation at
      a similar gestational age. To measure changes in proteins, we will compare proteins in the
      blood plasma of women with EOS-preeclampsia before and after pregnancy. We will also compare
      the blood plasmas of healthy versus EOS-preeclamptic women for differences in plasma
      proteins. Finally, we will examine the placental RNA of patients with EOS-preeclampsia and
      healthy patients delivered at 35-37 weeks gestation.
