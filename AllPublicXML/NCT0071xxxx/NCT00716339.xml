      Purpose:

      The aim of this study was to compare the effect of ciliary body training as proposed by
      manufacturers of accommodating IOLs and patient motivation on the pseudoaccommodative ability
      with a standard intraocular lens (SA60AT).

      Setting:

      Department of Ophthalmology, Medical University of Vienna.

      Methods:

      This randomized, controlled, examiner-masked study comprised 80 eyes of 40 patients that
      underwent standard cataract surgery. Patients were randomly assigned to a &quot;motivated&quot; or
      &quot;non-motivated&quot; (control) group. In the motivated group, subjects were told to take part in a
      special protocol to improve their near-reading ability after cataract surgery and were
      instructed not to use near adds for at least 3 months. Follow-up examinations included
      best-corrected distance visual acuity (VA), distance-corrected near VA, best-corrected near
      VA, defocus curve and reading speed, as well as pilocarpine-, cyclopentolate- and
      nearpoint-induced IOL shift assessed with partial coherence interferometry.
