      This is a multi-center, evaluator-blinded, randomized, comparative study designed to assess
      the safety, efficacy, and PK of daptomycin in pediatric participants ages 1 to 17 years,
      inclusive, with cSSSI caused by Gram-positive pathogens. Participants will be enrolled into
      age groups and given age-dependent doses over a period of up to 14 days. Participants will be
      stratified by age group to receive either daptomycin or SOC (recommended as vancomycin,
      clindamycin or semisynthetic penicillin) in a ratio of 2:1, respectively. Participants may
      continue on oral therapy following completion of IV study drug administration and provided
      that the participant meets all criteria for conversion to oral therapy, including clear
      clinical improvement and availability of an oral agent to which the pathogen is susceptible.
      The choice of oral therapy will be left to the discretion of the Investigator. February 11,
      2015 released from post marketing requirement to include subjects aged 3 months - &lt; 1 year.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through 14 days after last dose of study drug</time_frame>
    <description>A TEAE was defined as any treatment-emergent adverse event (AE) that occurred from the time of first dose of the study drug through the last study evaluation or pre-existing adverse AEs that were aggravated in severity or frequency during the dosing period. The percentage of participants with at least 1 TEAE, with at least one drug-related AE (drug-related included &quot;possibly related&quot; or &quot;related&quot; as deemed by the Investigator; it also included events if causality was missing), and who discontinued from treatment due to a TEAE is presented. A summary of serious and other non-serious adverse events regardless of causality is located in the Reported Adverse Events module.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With an Overall Therapeutic Response at Test of Cure Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through 14 days after last dose of study drug</time_frame>
    <description>The assessment of therapeutic response was determined by comparing a participant's signs and symptoms at the test of cure visit (up to 14 days after last dose) to those recorded at baseline. Participants were classified as &quot;Success&quot; or &quot;Failure&quot; by combining their clinical and microbiological efficacy responses. Resolution of clinically significant signs and symptoms associated with the skin infection present at study baseline was considered &quot;Success&quot; by the Investigator. These participants were deemed both clinically cured and microbiologically eradicated. For participants whose clinical course could not be clearly defined as improved, a clinical outcome of &quot;Failure&quot; was rendered. In addition, if it was determined that the primary site of infection required additional antibiotic treatment, the assessment of clinical response was &quot;Failure.&quot; If the Investigator was unable to determine a response because the participant was lost to follow-up, the assessment was &quot;Unable to evaluate.&quot;</description>

        <description>A TEAE was defined as any treatment-emergent adverse event (AE) that occurred from the time of first dose of the study drug through the last study evaluation or pre-existing adverse AEs that were aggravated in severity or frequency during the dosing period. The percentage of participants with at least 1 TEAE, with at least one drug-related AE (drug-related included &quot;possibly related&quot; or &quot;related&quot; as deemed by the Investigator; it also included events if causality was missing), and who discontinued from treatment due to a TEAE is presented. A summary of serious and other non-serious adverse events regardless of causality is located in the Reported Adverse Events module.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With an Overall Therapeutic Response at Test of Cure Visit</title>
        <description>The assessment of therapeutic response was determined by comparing a participant's signs and symptoms at the test of cure visit (up to 14 days after last dose) to those recorded at baseline. Participants were classified as &quot;Success&quot; or &quot;Failure&quot; by combining their clinical and microbiological efficacy responses. Resolution of clinically significant signs and symptoms associated with the skin infection present at study baseline was considered &quot;Success&quot; by the Investigator. These participants were deemed both clinically cured and microbiologically eradicated. For participants whose clinical course could not be clearly defined as improved, a clinical outcome of “Failure” was rendered. In addition, if it was determined that the primary site of infection required additional antibiotic treatment, the assessment of clinical response was “Failure.” If the Investigator was unable to determine a response because the participant was lost to follow-up, the assessment was &quot;Unable to evaluate.&quot;</description>
