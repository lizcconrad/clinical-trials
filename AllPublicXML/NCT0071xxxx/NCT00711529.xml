  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Premenopausal women with breast cancer who receive endocrine therapy (e.g. tamoxifen) and/or
      chemotherapy are at risk for experiencing premature menopause because of their treatment. The
      resulting symptoms, most notably hot flashes, can cause significant detriment to a patient's
      quality of life. Treatment for menopausal symptoms with the gold standard of hormone
      replacement therapy is not done routinely as it is unclear whether it can increase risk of
      tumor recurrence. In addition, many medical oncologists feel it is contraindicated in this
      population, especially among women whose breast cancers have estrogen receptors. This has
      lead to an increased interest in options other than estrogen replacement in the treatment of
      hot flashes, though most investigations of alternative medications have shown a suboptimal
      response.

      Recent studies have suggested that non-drug treatments using alternative or complementary
      therapies may be effective. Specifically, hypnosis has been promoted as a means to control
      hot flashes, though it has not been tested in a randomized fashion. In accordance with the
      National Cancer Institute's recent initiatives to expand the goals of clinical trials to
      include symptom management studies, our purpose is to evaluate the role of complementary and
      alternative therapies for improvement of symptoms in women with breast cancer. Specifically,
      we plan to evaluate the use of hypnotherapy for the treatment of therapy-induced hot flashes
      in breast cancer survivors. We intend to recruit 60 women into a pilot feasibility trial
      comparing hypnotherapy to the drug gabapentin (NeurontinÂ®) for the treatment of
      therapy-induced hot flashes in eligible women who are receiving care at the Breast Health
      Center. We have chosen gabapentin based on recent studies showing it may be an effective
      non-estrogen treatment for this indication.

      We will identify patients who are experiencing at least one daily hot flash as a result of
      the treatment they received for their breast cancer for participation. When enrolled, they
      will be randomized into either the treatment arm, in which they will receive daily
      gabapentin, or the experimental arm, in which they will undergo weekly hypnotherapy.

      Our study hypothesis is that hypnotherapy will be more effective than gabapentin in the
      control of hot flashes in this population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Roughly half of women diagnosed with pre-menopausal breast cancer will have hormone
      receptor-positive tumors, which will make them candidates for anti-estrogen therapies. Both
      endocrine therapy and ovarian ablation have also been shown to improve outcomes in this
      population.

      Hot flashes are a frequent side effect in women receiving anti-estrogen therapy for breast
      cancer, and have been shown to have a significant impact on patients' quality of life. For
      example, it has been reported that hot flashes in breast cancer survivors are more severe and
      result in a more significant impact on quality of life measures when compared with healthy
      women.

      Hormone replacement, the gold standard for the treatment of hot flashes in postmenopausal
      women, is contraindicated in this population. Non-hormonal drug therapies have been explored
      for the treatment of hot flashes in this population of women with moderate results. In
      randomized controlled trials, venlafaxine has been shown to reduce self-reported hot flashes
      in patients with breast cancer by 25-61%. However, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors
      (SSRIs) and selective norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may interfere with the
      metabolism of tamoxifen, a common treatment for estrogen-receptor positive breast cancers, by
      inhibiting the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) enzyme. Gabapentin is a gamma-aminobutyric acid
      (GABA) analogue commonly used for the treatment of seizure disorders and neuropathic pain.
      There is some evidence to demonstrate its efficacy in hot flashes to be equivalent to
      estrogen and superior to antidepressants in postmenopausal women.

      In a pilot study of 22 women with breast cancer on tamoxifen, the use of gabapentin for four
      weeks reduced the frequency of hot flashes by 44.2%, and decreased the hot flash severity
      scores by 52.6%. These results were confirmed in a larger study of 420 breast cancer
      survivors who were randomized to receive gabapentin 300mg/d, gabapentin 900mg/d, or placebo.
      The 900mg/d dose of gabapentin was the most effective; decreasing the frequency of hot
      flashes by 49% at four weeks. In the group receiving 900mg of gabapentin daily, there was a
      12% withdrawal rate at 4 weeks, and 17% at 8 weeks, owing to side effects and subjective
      inefficacy.

      Hypnosis or hypnotherapy, defined as the induction of a deeply relaxed condition that allows
      the patient to suspend critical faculties and allow suggestibility, has been shown to be
      effective in not only reducing the daily frequency of hot flashes (by 59%), but also in
      improving quality of life variables such as insomnia in patients with breast cancer. However,
      this therapy has never been compared directly to pharmacotherapy in the treatment of
      therapy-induced hot flashes in patients with breast cancer.

      In response to the NCI's 2006 initiatives to expand the goals of clinical trials and include
      symptom management studies, we are interested in evaluating the role of complementary and
      alternative therapies for improvement of symptoms in women with breast cancer. This trial is
      to determine whether hypnotherapy, administered in a standard way, can improve the frequency
      of hot flashes and breast cancer specific quality of life in women diagnosed with
      pre-menopausal breast cancer. We propose to evaluate this through a pilot feasibility study
      which will randomize participants to an eight week course of gabapentin or hypnosis.

The median number of daily hot flashes for the first week (7 days) of participation is used as baseline. The median number of daily hot flashes for the fourth week (over 7 day interval) is reported for the week four time point. The median number of daily hot flashes for the eighth week (over 7 day interval) is reported for the week eight time point (study completion). Of the 13 women randomized to the hypnotherapy arm, 2 women were ineligible and therefore not included in analysis. Two women were unable to initiate treatment and did not submit diaries. An additional two women completed treatment but lost their diaries, leaving 7 diaries for analysis at baseline. Of the 14 randomized to receive gabapentin, 6 dropped out of the study and did not submit diaries.</description>

    <description>The patients kept daily hot flash diaries, including the total number of hot flashes they characterized as mild, moderate,severe and very severe. Hot flash severity scores were calculated by assigning one point to each mild hot flash, two points for each moderate hot flash, three points for each severe hot flash and four points for each very severe hot flash. The hot flash severity score for a 24 hour period was the sum of these scores. The score was calculated for each day in the diary. For each subject, median scores were calculated for each week (7 day period) of participation. The median hot flash severity score for the first week was considered the baseline. The median hot flash severity score for the fourth week is considered the week 4 time point. The median hot flash severity score for the eighth week is considered the week 8 time point. The median result for the group was then calculated at each of the timepoints.</description>

The absolute number of hot flashes in a 24 hour period is &quot;number of daily hot flashes.&quot; The median number was calculated for each week of data. The median number of daily hot flashes for the first week (7 days) of participation is used as baseline. The median number of daily hot flashes for the fourth week (over 7 day interval) is reported for the week four time point. The median number of daily hot flashes for the eighth week (over 7 day interval) is reported for the week eight time point (study completion). Of the 13 women randomized to the hypnotherapy arm, 2 women were ineligible and therefore not included in analysis. Two women were unable to initiate treatment and did not submit diaries. An additional two women completed treatment but lost their diaries, leaving 7 diaries for analysis at baseline. Of the 14 randomized to receive gabapentin, 6 dropped out of the study and did not submit diaries.</description>

        <title>Number of Daily Hot Flashes</title>
        <description>Patients kept daily diaries of their hot flashes. The absolute number of hot flashes in a 24 hour period is &quot;number of daily hot flashes.&quot; The median number was calculated for each week of data. The median number of daily hot flashes for the first week (7 days) of participation is used as baseline. The median number of daily hot flashes for the fourth week (over 7 day interval) is reported for the week four time point. The median number of daily hot flashes for the eighth week (over 7 day interval) is reported for the week eight time point (study completion). A total of 15 diaries were submitted (7 hypnotherapy, 8 gabapentin). One person in each arm stopped recording in her diary before the 4 week mark.</description>

        <title>Hot Flash Severity Score</title>
        <description>The patients kept daily hot flash diaries, including the total number of hot flashes they characterized as mild, moderate,severe and very severe. Hot flash severity scores were calculated by assigning one point to each mild hot flash, two points for each moderate hot flash, three points for each severe hot flash and four points for each very severe hot flash. The hot flash severity score for a 24 hour period was the sum of these scores. The score was calculated for each day in the diary. For each subject, median scores were calculated for each week (7 day period) of participation. The median hot flash severity score for the first week was considered the baseline. The median hot flash severity score for the fourth week is considered the week 4 time point. The median hot flash severity score for the eighth week is considered the week 8 time point. The median result for the group was then calculated at each of the timepoints.</description>

The HFRDIS is a sum of the scores in each category, so that total score can range from 0 (no symptoms) to 100 (10 severe symptoms). These surveys were conducted at the time of enrollment (baseline), after four weeks of treatment, and at the conclusion of the study (8 weeks). All women who were randomized were included in the baseline analysis (with the exception of 2 women excluded from the hypnotherapy arm who were deemed ineligible after randomization).</description>

        <title>Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Score (HFRDIS)</title>
        <description>The HFRDIS is a validated survey of 10 questions asking patients to rate ten hot flash-related symptoms on a scale of 0-10. The HFRDIS is a sum of the scores in each category, so that total score can range from 0 (no symptoms) to 100 (10 severe symptoms). These surveys were conducted at the time of enrollment (baseline), after four weeks of treatment, and at the conclusion of the study (8 weeks). Of 11 eligible women in the hypnotherapy arm, 2 never initiated treatment, and 3 did not complete the survey at this time point. Of the 14 eligible women in the gabapentin arm, 3 never initiated treatment, and 3 dropped out of the study before the 4 week time point.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>We were unable to meet recruitment goals because of 1) lower-than-anticipated rate of referrals, and 2) subjects' unwillingness to randomization. This resulted in small numbers that limit interpretation of results.</limitations_and_caveats>
