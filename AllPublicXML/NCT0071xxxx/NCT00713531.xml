      The purpose of this study is to assess populations in Thailand at high risk for HIV-1
      infection for potential efficacy trials of candidate HIV vaccines to include:

        1. assess incidence of HIV-1 and volunteer retention

        2. describe early viral load and CD4 counts

        3. assess participant willingness to participate in HIV vaccine efficacy trials and other
           HIV prevention trials

        4. describe volunteer risk behavior

      Prospective cohort study of HIV-negative participants who will receive voluntary counseling
      and testing (VCT) for HIV-antibody in conjunction with questionnaires on risk behavior,
      willingness to participate in HIV vaccine trials and other HIV prevention trials at 4 month
      intervals for a period of 1 year. This study will follow 1000 HIV-negative volunteers with an
      expected minimum of 15-20 incident HIV-infections based on a minimum incidence rate of
      1.5/100 person-years. Weighted incidence estimates will be calculated with exact 95%
      confidence intervals.
