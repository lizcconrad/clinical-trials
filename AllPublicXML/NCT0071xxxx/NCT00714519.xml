        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Provide written informed consent, which consists of reading, signing and dating the
             informed consent document after the Investigator, sub-Investigator or other designated
             study staff member has explained the study procedures, risks, and contact information.
             If the subject is unable to read or sign the informed consent, or unable to comprehend
             the information provided in the consent process, a legal guardian, decision making
             proxy, or next of kin must provide written consent, and if possible, subject must
             verbally assent to receiving an experimental treatment for their wound.

          2. Are at least 18 years of age.

          3. Are expected to remain in the Nursing Home for the duration of the study (22 days).

          4. Have one or more partial-thickness wounds (including wounds with excoriation, erosion
             or denuded skin, or ulceration to subcutaneous fat, but with no fascia, muscle, tendon
             or bone visible) on the trunk or proximal extremity (arm above the elbow, leg above
             the knee) which

               -  have been present for at least 2 days but less than 6 weeks;

               -  measure greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to40 cm2 in total
                  denuded area; and,

               -  are connected by areas of erythema (for multiple wounds).

          5. Are capable of maintaining an adequate nutritional intake during the study.

          6. Are in an acceptable state of health and nutrition with pre-albumin levels of greater
             than or equal to 15 mg/dl (0.015g/l), serum albumin greater than or equal to 3.0 g/dl
             (30g/l), alkaline phosphatase greater than or equal to the lower limit of normal, and
             have no abnormal laboratory values that, in the opinion of the Medical Supervisor,
             place the subject at risk for the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Have more than 64 cm2 of total denuded wound area, including target and non-target
             wounds.

          2. Have a full-thickness wound within 4 cm of any target wound.

          3. Have clinical evidence of bacterial or fungal infection of the target wound.

          4. Have target wound(s) that involves tunneling, sinus tracks, shear injury, arterial
             occlusive disease or bony prominence or joint with the exception that target wounds
             may be over dorsal spinous processes, coccyx, ischial tuberosities or sacroiliac
             joints (but may not be full thickness).

          5. Are moribund, or has a severe burn, immunodeficiency disorder, hematologic disorder,
             metastatic malignancy or uncontrolled diabetes mellitus.

          6. Are known to have acrodermatitis enteropathica (zinc deficiency).

          7. Are being treated with systemic steroids, immunosuppressive agents, radiation or
             chemotherapy.

          8. Have been treated with enzymatic debridement to the target wound(s) within 2 days
             prior to enrollment.

          9. Have a known sensitivity to ingredients of Xenaderm Ointment.

         10. Are using or have used another investigational agent (not including devices such as
             hearing aids, pace makers, etc.) within 30 days prior to Visit 1.
