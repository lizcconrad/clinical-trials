    <textblock>
      The treatment of rheumatoid arthritis has improved considerably in recent years with the
      understanding that better outcomes can be achieved by optimising the dosage schedule of
      conventional drugs that suppress the inflammatory response in joints. Furthermore, the
      development of protein based drugs that are given parenterally (i.e. by subcutaneous
      injection or intravenous infusion), known as biologics, have given rise to even better
      clinical results. However, despite this over 60% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis can
      still be expected to have an unacceptably high degree of disease activity and the
      prohibitively high cost of biologic therapy has resulted in rationing following NICE review.
      Therefore there is a need for more effective and less costly treatment.

      The proposed study is designed to test potential drug interactions between one such candidate
      oral treatment, tranilast, and the gold standard therapy for rheumatoid arthritis,
      methotrexate, which is given as a once weekly oral, intramuscular or intradermal regimen. The
      drug to be tested, tranilast, an analogue of a naturally occurring molecule that regulates
      inflammatory responses, is currently used in the treatment of allergic inflammation and has
      recently been shown to be effective in an animal model of multiple sclerosis. Tranilast is an
      analogue of a naturally tryptophan metabolite. Laboratory studies of cell biology indicate
      that this molecule inhibits a number of key inflammatory pathways and the function of white
      blood cells that play a critical role in the inflammatory features of rheumatoid arthritis.
      The aim of this study is to assess whether tranilast may be useful for the treatment of RA.
      In an animal model of rheumatoid arthritis, initial assessment showed that prophylactic
      administration of tranilast interfered with the development of disease. Therapeutically, in
      an animal model of arthritis, tranilast was very effective, and reduced all aspects of the
      disease, including joint swelling, clinical score, and histological damage in a
      dose−dependent fashion, and reduced pain. This degree of benefit compares well with
      therapeutics that have been highly successful in humans, such as anti−TNF therapy.
      Furthermore studies at the Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology Division, Imperial College
      suggest that tranilast has a greater analgesic effect than the potent steroid dexamethasone
      at effective anti−inflammatory doses

      THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK:The treatment outcomes in rheumatoid arthritis have dramatically
      improved with the recognition that the inflammatory component of disease needs to be
      suppressed optimally at every stage in its evolution. However, all existing conventional oral
      therapies are associated with limited efficacy and loss of effectiveness over time.
      Furthermore all of these therapies are associated with significant toxicity and tolerability
      problems. Another approach to treatment involves the use of biologic (protein based),
      parenterally administered therapies directed against important inflammatory molecules or
      cells involved in disease pathology. Despite the notable success of anti−TNF therapy, which
      is one of these biologics,approximately one third of patients do not respond adequately and
      the costs of drug production are very high.

      This causes rationing in all healthcare economies. There is therefore a need for new, safe,
      well tolerated and effective drugs that are cost effective. Tranilast (a tryptophan
      metabolite) is already licenced in Japan for the treatment for allergy. Basic science studies
      including those undertaken at The Kennedy Institute indicate that this drug suppresses the
      activity of a number of key inflammatory mediators as well as the activation of lymphocytes
      (white blood cells) responsible for the perpetuation of inflammation and associated tissue
      destruction in rheumatoid. Therefore, there was a rationale to test the effectiveness of
      tranilast in vivo for the treatment of arthritis. In an animal model of arthritis, tranilast
      effectively reduces joint swelling and read outs of pain. Since tranilast is well tolerated
      and safe in the licenced treatment indication in man, it is timely to test its effectiveness
      in rheumatoid arthritis. The majority of patients with this condition are treated with
      methotrexate often in combination with other anti−rheumatoid drugs. The current study is a
      prelude to a larger randomised controlled study investigating the efficacy of tranilast in
      rheumatoid arthritis.

      PURPOSE:This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of an oral
      medication, tranilast, in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who are on another disease
      modifying medication, methotrexate.

      DESIGN:The study is a randomised crossover pilot study with an optional higher dose open
      label phase.

      METHOD:During the study the patient will either receive tranilast (300mg twice a day) or a
      placebo drug for a period of seven days. The patient will then have a seven day break
      followed by another period of seven days in which the patient will receive the other
      medication. They will attend the clinic on at least 6 occasions(screening, day 2,3 8 and 9
      then on 5 occasions in session 2 plus a follow up session. During the study blood samples
      will be taken to assess safety and serum concentrations of the study drug and interactions
      with methotrexate.
