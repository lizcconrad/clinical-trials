    <textblock>
      This is a a prospective study of the WallFlex™ Biliary Partially-covered Stent designed to
      collect data to support regulatory clearance by the FDA in the United States and to determine
      the functionality of the WallFlex™ Biliary Partially Covered Stent as a Palliative treatment
      for malignant bile duct obstruction.
