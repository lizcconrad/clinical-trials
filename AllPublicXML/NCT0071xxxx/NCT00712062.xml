  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if pemetrexed is effective in the treatment of
      primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) that has either worsened during treatment or
      has returned after completing treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the aggressive upfront use of methotrexate-based chemotherapy, primary central
      nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) almost uniformly results in recurrence or progression and
      death. Palliative chemotherapy offers an improvement in time-to-progression, symptom control,
      quality of life, and potentially, survival. However, no established chemotherapy regimen for
      recurrence exists and new treatments are needed. Pemetrexed is a rationale strategy for
      therapeutic palliation of recurrent or progressive PCNSL, given its mechanism of action,
      convenient administration, single agent efficacy, its well established management algorithms,
      and its evidence of safety and efficacy in systemic malignancies.
