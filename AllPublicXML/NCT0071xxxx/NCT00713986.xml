    <textblock>
      Acute procedural pain in neonates may be alleviated by non-pharmacological procedures. This
      study objective is to test the efficacy regarding pain attenuation of 3 interventions
      (skin-to-skin contact versus glucose 25% versus skin to skin associated to glucose 25) versus
      control in healthy newborn infants submitted to intra-muscular vaccination for Hepatitis B at
      48-72 hours of life.
