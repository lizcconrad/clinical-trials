        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age &gt; or = 18.

          2. Has relapsed or refractory disease as defined by the following:

               -  CLL - refractory to or relapsed after at least 2 prior therapies, including
                  fludarabine, alone or in combination. Patients should not be eligible for
                  transplantation (patients who are candidates for transplantation and have
                  declined transplantation are eligible for this study).

               -  B-cell NHL - refractory to or relapsed after at least 1 prior chemotherapy
                  regimen and having received rituximab as a single agent or in combination with
                  other therapies.

               -  AML - refractory to or relapsed after at least 1 cycle of induction chemotherapy.
                  Patients over the age of 70 who are not appropriate candidates for chemotherapy
                  are eligible for this study.

               -  MM - refractory to or relapsed after at least 2 prior chemotherapy regimens,
                  including bortezomib and thalidomide or lenalidomide (except if the drug is
                  contraindicated in a patient then this requirement is waived).

          3. Disease status requirement:

               -  For CLL patients, symptomatic disease that mandate treatment.

               -  For B-cell NHL patients, has measurable disease by CT scan.

               -  For AML patients, has &gt; 10% blasts in the bone marrow for refractory or relapsed
                  disease and &gt; 20% blasts in the bone marrow if no prior chemotherapy.

               -  For MM patients, has measurable disease defined by at least 1 of the following 3
                  measurements: serum M-protein &gt; or = to 1 g/dL, urine M-protein &gt; or = to 200
                  mg/24 h, or serum free light chain (FLC) assay with involved FLC level &gt; or = to
                  10 mg/dL provided serum FLC ratio is abnormal.

          4. WHO performance status of â‰¤ 2.

          5. For men and women of child-bearing potential, willing to use adequate contraception
             (i.e., latex condom, cervical cap, diaphragm, abstinence, etc.) for the entire

          6. Is able to provide written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Had radiotherapy, radioimmunotherapy, biological therapy, chemotherapy, or treatment
             with an investigational product within 4-weeks prior to screening.

          2. For CLL or NHL patients, had treatment with a short course of corticosteroids for
             symptom relief within 1-week prior to screening.

          3. Had alemtuzumab therapy within 12-weeks prior to screening.

          4. For AML patients, had treatment with hydroxyurea within 1-week prior to screening.

          5. Is pregnant or nursing.

          6. Has significant, ongoing co-morbid conditions which would preclude safe delivery of
             the study drug.

          7. Has had a transplant with current active graft-versus-host-disease.

          8. Has known active central nervous system involvement of the malignancy.

          9. Has active, serious infection requiring systemic therapy. Patients may receive
             prophylactic antibiotics and antiviral therapy at the discretion of the treating
             physician.

         10. Has significant renal or liver dysfunction.

         11. Has severe thrombocytopenia requiring platelet transfusion support, unless the
             diagnosis is AML.

         12. Has a positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies.

         13. Has active hepatitis B or C. Patients with serologic evidence of prior exposure are
             eligible.

         14. Has poorly controlled diabetes mellitus.

         15. Has taken a medication that is a potent inhibitor or inducer of cytochrome P450 3A4
             within 1-week prior to screening.
