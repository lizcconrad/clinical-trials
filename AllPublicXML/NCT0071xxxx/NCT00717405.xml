  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single arm study will assess the efficacy and safety of preoperative treatment with
      Avastin combined with Herceptin-based chemotherapy in patients with primary inflammatory
      HER2-positive breast cancer. Patients will be treated with a total of 8 cycles of
      pre-operative chemotherapy + Avastin + Herceptin. The anticipated time on study treatment is
      3-12 months, and the target sample size is &lt;100 individuals.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a Pathological Complete Response (PCR) According to the Sataloff Classification</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline through Week 25 (Up to 6 months)</time_frame>
    <description>PCR was assessed at the time of definitive surgery according to Sataloff classification and centrally reviewed by an independent committee under blinded conditions. Pathological response was defined based on the therapeutic response at the primary tumor site and axillary lymph nodes. Primary tumor response criteria were as follows: T-A (Total / near total therapeutic effect), T-B (Subjectively greater than [&gt;] 50 percent [%] therapeutic effect but less than [&lt;] T-A), T-C (&lt;50% therapeutic effect, but effect evident), T-D (No therapeutic effect). Axillary lymph node response: N-A (Evidence of therapeutic effect, no metastases), N-B (No therapeutic effect, no nodal metastases), N-C (Nodal metastasis but evident therapeutic effect), N-D (Nodal metastasis with no therapeutic effect). T-A and N-A or T-A and N-B responses were defined as PCR and all other tumor responses as non-responders. Participants with missing values were considered as non-responders.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a PCR According to the Chevallier Classification</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline through Week 25 (Up to 6 months)</time_frame>
    <description>PCR was assessed at the time of definitive surgery according to Chevallier classification and centrally reviewed by an independent committee under blinded conditions. The Chevallier classification for grading of therapeutic effect related to the primary tumor site and axillary lymph nodes was defined by microscopic changes as follows - Grade 1: Disappearance of all tumors either in the breast or in the nodes, Grade 2: Persistence of carcinoma in situ in the breast only and no nodal invasion, Grade 3: Presence of invasive carcinoma with stromal alteration, Grade 4: Presence of invasive carcinoma without modification. Grade 1 response was considered as PCR. Participants with missing values were considered as non-responders.</description>

Participants underwent surgery (mastectomy) after neoadjuvant treatment, maintaining trastuzumab (6 mg/kg). Adjuvant treatment: Participants received radiotherapy 2-4 weeks after surgery and lasted for 4-6 weeks, 6 mg/kg IV trastuzumab q3w and 15 mg/kg IV bevacizumab q3w administered along with/after the radiotherapy (administered up to a cumulative [neoadjuvant + adjuvant] total of 18 injections each. Hormonal therapy (at investigator discretion) after the end of radiotherapy was administered for 5 years, if participant was hormone receptor positive.</description>

        <description>PCR was assessed at the time of definitive surgery according to Sataloff classification and centrally reviewed by an independent committee under blinded conditions. Pathological response was defined based on the therapeutic response at the primary tumor site and axillary lymph nodes. Primary tumor response criteria were as follows: T-A (Total / near total therapeutic effect), T-B (Subjectively greater than [&gt;] 50 percent [%] therapeutic effect but less than [&lt;] T-A), T-C (&lt;50% therapeutic effect, but effect evident), T-D (No therapeutic effect). Axillary lymph node response: N-A (Evidence of therapeutic effect, no metastases), N-B (No therapeutic effect, no nodal metastases), N-C (Nodal metastasis but evident therapeutic effect), N-D (Nodal metastasis with no therapeutic effect). T-A and N-A or T-A and N-B responses were defined as PCR and all other tumor responses as non-responders. Participants with missing values were considered as non-responders.</description>
