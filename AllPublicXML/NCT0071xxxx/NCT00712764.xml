  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autoregulation is the ability of a vascular bed to maintain blood flow despite changes in
      perfusion pressure. For a long time it had been assumed that the choroid is a strictly
      passive vascular bed, which shows no autoregulation. However, recently several groups have
      identified some autoregulatory capacity of the human choroid. In the brain and the retina the
      mechanism behind autoregulation is most likely linked to changes in transmural pressure. In
      this model arterioles change their vascular tone depending on the pressure inside the vessel
      and outside the vessel. In the choroid, several observations argue against a direct
      involvement of arterioles. However, the mechanism behind choroidal autoregulation remains
      unclear. Adenosine, an endogenous purine metabolic end product with a potent vasodilatory
      effect on multiple vascular beds, leads to an increase in retinal and choroidal vessel
      diameter. The present study aims to investigate whether adenosine plays a role in choroidal
      autoregulation during a decrease in ocular perfusion pressure, which will be achieved by an
      increase in intraocular pressure.

      Pressure/flow relationships will be investigated in the absence and presence of adenosine.
