  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the benefits and risks of lixisenatide (AVE0010), in
      comparison to placebo, as an add-on treatment to sulfonylurea without or with metformin, over
      a period of 24 weeks of treatment, followed by an extension.

      The primary objective is to assess the effects of lixisenatide when added to sulfonylurea
      with or without metformin on glycemic control in terms of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c)
      reduction (absolute change) at Week 24.

      The secondary objectives are to assess the effects of lixisenatide on percentage of patients
      reaching HbA1c less than (&lt;) 7 percent (%); percentage of patients reaching HbA1c less than
      or equal to (&lt;=) 6.5%; body weight; fasting plasma glucose (FPG); beta-cell function assessed
      by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) beta; 2-hour postprandial plasma glucose (PPG),
      glucagon, insulin, proinsulin, and C-peptide after a standardized meal challenge test in a
      sub-study in all patients in selected centers; to evaluate safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics (PK) and anti-lixisenatide antibody development.

      Patients who complete the 24-week main double-blind treatment would undergo a variable
      double-blind extension treatment, which ends for all patients at approximately the scheduled
      date of Week 76 visit (Visit 25) for the last randomized patient.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted at 136 centers in 16 countries between July 08, 2008 and January 14, 2011. The overall duration of treatment was at least 76 weeks (24 weeks main double-blind treatment; variable double-blind extension treatment).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 1438 participants were screened of which 579 (40.3%) were screen failures; main reason for screen failure was glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values being out of the defined protocol range (greater than or equal to 7% and less than or equal to 10%). A total of 859 participants were randomized.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Glucose Excursion at Week 24</title>
        <description>Glucose excursion = 2-hour PPG minus plasma glucose 30 minutes prior to the standardized meal test (performed in selected sites), before study drug administration. Change was calculated by subtracting baseline value from Week 24 value. The on-treatment period for this efficacy variable is time from the first dose of study drug and up to last dosing day of study drug, on or before Visit 12 (Week 24) or Day 169 if Visit 12 is not available, and before the introduction of rescue therapy. For a patient to be included in mITT population, both baseline and at least 1 post baseline assessment for at least 1 efficacy variable, were required.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Fasting C-peptide and 2-hour Postprandial C-peptide at Week 24</title>
        <description>The fasting C-peptide and the 2-hour postprandial C-peptide blood samples were drawn during a standardized meal challenge test (performed in selected sites). Change was calculated by subtracting baseline value from Week 24 value. The on-treatment period for this efficacy variable is time from the first dose of study drug and up to last dosing day of study drug, on or before Visit 12 (Week 24) or Day 169 if Visit 12 is not available, and before the introduction of rescue therapy.For a patient to be included in mITT population, both baseline and at least 1 post baseline assessment for at least 1 efficacy variable, were required.</description>
