  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low dose of aspirin is the main cause of gastro-duodenal ulcer. The best prevention is not
      definite particularly in patients without history of ulcer and infected by H. pylori.The aim
      of the study is to evaluate the gastric damage induced by aspirin in patients with H. pylori
      infection but who have any history of ulcer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to compare the protective effect of H. pylori eradication versus
      Pantoprazole versus placebo on the gastric damage induced by low dose of aspirin. Treatment
      are attributed by randomisation. Patients are followed for 6 months and gastric damage are
      evaluated by endoscopy at the end of this period.
