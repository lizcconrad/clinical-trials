  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment with MMF often results in adverse GI events, which can lead to dose reductions of
      MMF and decreased graft function. Enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium (MYFORTIC*) was
      developed as an alternative formulation of MPA to improve upper GI tract side effects. An
      improvement in the severity of GI side effects could result in an increased tolerance to MPA
      and an improvement in patient quality of life. This study will use the GSRS to evaluate
      improvement in gastrointestinal symptoms.

      This study will evaluate the change in the total gastrointestinal symptom rating scale (GSRS)
      score at baseline versus month 1,at baseline versus month 3 and at baseline versus month 6
      after conversion from MMF to PRMYFORTIC* .
