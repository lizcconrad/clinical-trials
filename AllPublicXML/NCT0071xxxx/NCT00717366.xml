  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This sequential study will assess the efficacy and safety of multiple doses of intravenous
      (IV) methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta (MIRCERA), and will determine the optimum
      starting dose for maintenance treatment of anemia in children with chronic kidney disease on
      hemodialysis. Pediatric participants will remain on epoetin alfa, epoetin beta or darbepoetin
      alfa during the screening period, after which they will receive IV MIRCERA monthly, at a
      starting dose related to the previous weekly epoetin or darbepoetin alfa dose. Depending on
      the response achieved, another group may be selected to receive a higher or a lower dose.

    <measure>Change in Average Hb Concentration Between Baseline and Evaluation Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day -20 to Day 1), Evaluation Period (Week 17 to Week 21)</time_frame>
    <description>A time adjusted average baseline Hb concentration for each individual was calculated using an area under the curve (AUC) approach from all available Hb measurements taken during the baseline period (Day -20 to Day 1). The average evaluation period Hb concentration for each individual was calculated using the same method, from all their available measurements taken during the evaluation period (Week 17 to Week 21). The change in Hb concentration between the baseline and evaluation periods was calculated by subtracting the baseline Hb concentration from the evaluation period Hb concentration.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day -20 to Day 1), Evaluation Period (Week 17 to Week 21)</time_frame>
    <description>A time adjusted average baseline reticulocyte count for each individual was calculated using an AUC approach from all available reticulocyte counts taken during the baseline period (Day -20 to Day 1). The average evaluation period reticulocyte count for each individual was calculated using the same method, from all their available measurements taken during the evaluation period (Weeks 17 to 21). The change in reticulocyte count between the baseline and evaluation periods was calculated by subtracting the baseline reticulocyte count from the evaluation period reticulocyte count. Relative reticulocytes were recorded conversion to absolute values was performed.</description>

    <description>Tmax was defined as the time (in hours) to achieve Cmax (Cmax was defined as the highest serum concentration observed over all sample collection timepoints [as provided in timeframe]). The median time, among all participants, was reported.</description>

    <description>t1/2 was defined as the time (in hours) measured (from all sample collection timepoints [as provided in timeframe]) for the serum concentration to decrease by one half. The t1/2 was calculated as natural logarithm of 2 divided by λz; where λz = terminal elimination rate constant.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta (MIRCERA) IV injection at a starting dose based on an intermediate conversion factor from their previous Erythropoiesis-stimulating Agent (ESA) dose (4 * previous weekly epoetin dose [international units {IU}]/250 or 4 * previous weekly darbepoetin alfa dose [micrograms {mcg}]/1.1) once every 4 weeks for 20 weeks. Participants who will complete the 20 weeks of treatment with hemoglobin (Hb) level within ± 1 grams per deciliter (g/dL) of their baseline Hb level and within the target range of 10-12 g/dL will enter an optional 52-weeks safety extension period.

          <description>Participants received methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta (MIRCERA) intravenous (IV) injection at a starting dose based on an intermediate conversion factor from their previous Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agent (ESA) dose (4 * previous weekly epoetin dose [international units {IU}]/250 or 4 * previous weekly darbepoetin alfa dose [micrograms {mcg}]/1.1) once every 4 weeks for 20 weeks. Participants who completed the 20 weeks of treatment and had hemoglobin (Hb) level within ± 1 grams per deciliter (g/dL) of their baseline Hb level and within the target range of 10-12 g/dL, entered an optional 52-weeks safety extension period.

        <description>A time adjusted average baseline Hb concentration for each individual was calculated using an area under the curve (AUC) approach from all available Hb measurements taken during the baseline period (Day -20 to Day 1).

The change in Hb concentration between the baseline and evaluation periods was calculated by subtracting the baseline Hb concentration from the evaluation period Hb concentration.</description>
