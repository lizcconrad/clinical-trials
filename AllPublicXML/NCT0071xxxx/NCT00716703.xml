    <textblock>
      Computed tomography (CT) scan using intravenous contrast (CT IV) as the sole type of contrast
      material, was studied as one method of evaluating children with suspected appendicitis. We
      felt that this technique could provide physicians with a faster and better-tolerated
      alternative to CT imaging which involves patients drinking oral contrast or needing rectal
      contrast administered.

      SPECIFIC AIMS

        1. To test an imaging protocol using CT IV for the evaluation of suspected appendicitis in
           children in the setting of a pediatric emergency department (ED).

        2. To determine test performance characteristics (specificity, sensitivity and diagnostic
           accuracy) of CT IV in detecting appendicitis in children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was to be a prospective cohort study imaging pediatric patients (3-18 years old) in whom
      the diagnosis of appendicitis was suspected, but not clinically apparent. Patients that were
      to have a CT performed would be invited to participate and if enrolled, would be imaged using
      CT scan with IV contrast alone.

      CT scans would be interpreted in real time by a resident radiologist and/or an attending
      radiologist. ED evaluation would remain unchanged and patient disposition would be based on
      the discretion of the ED provider using all information (patient exam, labs, surgical
      consultation as needed and the results of the CT scan).

      CT scan performance would be determined by comparison of the CT interpretation with patient
      final outcomes as determined by either (1) pathology reports - in patients that went on to
      have surgery (appendectomy) or (2) clinical phone follow up at 24 hrs and then 1 week after
      ED discharge.

      Performance of CT would be compared between the resident and the attending radiologists.

      Further, we would compare the time to obtain a CT scan (defined as ED triage time - Time to
      CT) between our study cohort and a retrospective cohort of patients who had received CT scan
      in the ED for evaluation of appendicitis pre-study (CT using BOTH IV and oral contrast).
