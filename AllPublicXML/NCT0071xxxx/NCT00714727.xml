      The object of this research study is to test a standardized set of acupuncture points on
      migraine patients to reduce frequency and intensity of headaches. Acupuncture has been
      studied in prior research but the treatment points have varied between subjects, making it
      difficult to replicate studies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be recording daily headache activity on personal digital assistants (PDA's) for
      12 weeks before and 12 weeks after 8 weeks of acupuncture intervention. MIDAS, HIT-6 and
      BDI-II measurements will be done at the beginning of the study (12 weeks pre-intervention),
      directly before the intervention, directly after, and 12 weeks post-intervention.
      Measurements will be compared before and after intervention. This is a follow-up to a
      successful earlier study when these same acupuncture points were used on subjects with
      chronic daily headache, the majority being migraine.
