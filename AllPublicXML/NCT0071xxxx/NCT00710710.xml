  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial is conducted in order to evaluate the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of BI
      2536 in the treatment of unresectable advanced pancreatic cancer as first line or second line
      therapy. A secondary aim is to identify the most suitable dosage regimen for the further
      phase II and III clinical programme of BI 2536. To achieve this objective, two dosage
      regimens are compared in patients receiving first line therapy.
