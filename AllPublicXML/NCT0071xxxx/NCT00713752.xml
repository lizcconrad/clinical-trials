      The purpose of this study is to establish normal values for neuropsychological testing in HIV
      negative Thais stratified by age (1 decade) and education (no certificate or primary school
      certificate, less than high school certificate or vocational certificate, high school
      certificate or higher vocational certificate or diploma, Bachelor degree or higher.

      The Southeast Asia Research Collaboration with Hawaii (SEARCH) operates or collaborates on
      several neuroAIDS research protocols. To allow accurate interpretation of neuropsychological
      data, normative data that are obtained in a similar population are needed. Currently, there
      are limited such data available for this purpose.

      The SEARCH 001 study evaluated the neurocognitive changes before and after highly active
      antiretroviral therapy in 30 HIV positive subjects and has also enrolled 230/300 proposed
      HIV-negative controls for this purpose. Normative data tables typically require many more
      individuals so that age and education strata can be established. We now propose to enroll up
      to 1000 HIV-seronegative individuals for this purpose.
