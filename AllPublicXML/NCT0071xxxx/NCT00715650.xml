      This study will address the problem that claimants with psychiatric disabilities who apply
      for and receive disability benefits go on to work less than those whose claims are denied.

      The objective of this research is to conduct a 6-month randomized clinical trial comparing
      participants assigned to Benefits Counseling and to those assigned to the control condition,
      VA Orientation. Benefits Counseling is an adaptation of two counseling approaches to foster
      veterans' involvement in work and work-related activity compared to the control condition, VA
      Orientation. The first approach helped recipients of Social Security disability benefits for
      psychiatric illness return to work in part by alleviating beneficiaries' concerns that they
      would lose their benefits if they worked. The second approach is a Motivational Interviewing
      approach that showed great promise in engaging veterans with psychiatric disabilities in
      compensated work therapy.

    <description>This counseling consists of four sessions each approximately 60 minutes each. The four sessions are organized as follows: a) Orientation to Benefits Counseling: Your Benefits and Your Goals b) Work and Claims c) Financial Review: Implications of Your Work Plan and d) Your Plans After the Benefits Notice. The first session focuses on the disability application process as a non-confrontational way to explore attitudes towards work. The second session more directly addresses the claimant's attitudes about work and beliefs about whether work will prevent receipt of disability benefits. The third session addresses the same issue as the second, ambivalence about work and disability, from a financial perspective. The fourth session occurs after the disability determination has been made, and it is possible the veteran may feel differently about a benefit that has been awarded.</description>
