      The purpose of this study is to assess the response to Taxotere (docetaxel) chemotherapy
      given as a primary treatment to patients with early and rapid PSA rising after prostatectomy
      for high risk disease.

    <textblock>
      Patients with high-risk prostate cancer have a high probability of PSA failure after radical
      prostatectomy. However, more than half of these patients will remain free of PSA recurrence
      for more than 10 years. To the contrary, patients with early PSA recurrence and a doubling
      time less than 10 months have a mortality rate approaching 50% at 10 years despite hormone
      therapy. Although androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) remains the standard treatment for
      patients with early and rapidly rising PSA after prostatectomy, this treatment is not
      curative on the long term for most patients. The recent demonstration of activity of Taxotere
      (docetaxel) in a high proportion of patients with advanced metastatic disease has stimulated
      a great interest in it use at an earlier stage of the disease. Recent studies performed in
      animal models of prostate cancer suggested that the response rate of prostate cancer cells to
      docetaxel-induced cell death was significantly enhanced by androgen stimulation in
      AR-positive, androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells (i.e. before ADT). Therefore, this
      protocol proposes to assess the response rate to primary Taxotere chemotherapy in patients
      with early and rapid PSA rising after prostatectomy for high risk disease.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma on a radical prostatectomy.

          2. Prior radical prostatectomy within less than 2 years from the time of first PSA rise.

          3. Demonstration of biochemical recurrence based on a PSA detectable &gt;0.03 less than 24
             months after radical prostatectomy and confirmed on 2 additional tests.

          4. PSA doubling time over three values must be &lt;= 9 months for PSA &gt;=0.4 and PSA &lt;=10. If
             PSA is &gt;10, there is no need for PSA doubling time.

          5. Karnofsky performance status (KPS) &gt;=70%

          6. Adequate organ function as defined by hemogram with haemoglobin &gt;8.0, platelet &gt;100
             000, white blood cell &gt;3,500, creatinine clearance &gt;=60 cc/min and normal liver
             function tests.

          7. Neoadjuvant hormone therapy prior to radical prostatectomy is allowed provided that
             the total duration of therapy did not exceed 6 months.

          8. Subjects must have signed an informed consent document stating that they understand
             the investigational or nature of the proposed treatment.

          9. Subjects must be willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans,
             laboratory tests and other procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinical significant cardiac disease (New York Heart Association Class III/IV), or
             severe debilitating pulmonary disease.

          2. Uncontrolled serious active infection.

          3. Anticipated duration of life less than 2 years.

          4. Less than 5-year history of successful treatment for other cancers or concurrent
             active non prostate cancer other than non melanoma dermatologic tumors and non-muscle
             invasive bladder tumors.

          5. Peripheral neuropathy &gt;=2 grade 2

          6. Concurrent experimental treatment or involvement in other clinical trials involving
             drugs.

          7. Other severe acute or chronic medical conditions including psychiatric diseases or
             significant laboratory abnormality requiring further investigation that may cause
             undue risk for the subject's safety.

          8. Subjects who participated in another clinical study/received investigational product
             within 30 days of screening for this study.
