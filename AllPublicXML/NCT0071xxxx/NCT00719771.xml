  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the difference between pre-operative and
      post-operative levels of patient satisfaction, shoulder function, radiographic alignment,
      shoulder pain and patient satisfaction in patients receiving a Global® AP™ shoulder
      prosthesis for glenohumeral arthritis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients selected for inclusion will present for primary shoulder arthroplasty with a
             diagnosis of osteoarthritis and will consent to participate.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Are under 18 years of age or over 70

          -  Diagnosis of AVN, Inflammatory Arthritis, Fracture or Malunion.

          -  Have a hemi-arthroplasty

          -  Have destruction of the proximal humerus that precludes rigid fixation of the humeral
             component

          -  Have arthritis with insufficient cuff tissue

          -  Have had a failed rotator cuff surgery

          -  Have loss of musculature, neuromuscular compromise or vascular deficiency in the
             affected limb rendering the procedure unjustified

          -  Have evidence of active infection

          -  Present with a condition of neuromuscular compromise of the shoulder (e.g.,
             neuropathic joints or brachial plexus injury with a flail shoulder joint) - Have a
             known active metastatic or neoplastic disease

          -  Are unwilling or unable to comply with a rehabilitation program or would fail to
             return for the postoperative follow-up visits prescribed by the protocol

          -  Are skeletally immature.

          -  Have a known allergic reaction to implant metals, polyethylene or a tissue reaction to
             corrosion or wear products

          -  Have other conditions such as central nervous system disturbances, alcohol or drug
             addiction, etc. that may make effective evaluation of the joint replacement difficult
             or impossible

          -  Are currently participating in another clinical study

          -  Are taking &gt; 10mg/day corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone) excluding inhalers, within 3
             months prior to surgery

          -  Are currently involved in any personal injury litigation, medical legal or worker's
             compensation claims.
