      The objective of this study is to provide Maraviroc on a compassionate use basis to
      antiretroviral treatment experienced patients infected with CCR5-tropic HIV-1 with urgent
      unmet medical needs and who, in the opinion of the physician, require Maraviroc to form a
      viable regimen.
