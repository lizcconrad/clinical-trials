    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of the medical device &quot;Excilor® Forte&quot; in the treatment of
      toenail onychomycosis. Half of the participants will receive the tested product and the other
      half will receive a comparator (Amorolfin 5%). Patients will be followed during 6 months.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Variation of the percentage of healthy surface after 30, 60, 120, and 180 days between both treatments, and versus baseline. Evaluation is done by digital analysis of photographs of the great, infected toenail</measure>
    <time_frame>After 30, 60, 120 and 180 days of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects with a great toenail, affected by onychomycosis, were treated with the test medical device or reference product, respectively. After 180 days, blind assessment of the percentage of healthy surface (primary efficacy endpoint) of the great toenail was performed to evaluate changes from baseline between both treatment groups. Additionally, blind assessment of the percentage of healthy surface of the great toenail will be performed at all other visits (day 30, 60, and 120, respectively) to evaluate changes from baseline between both treatment groups</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of clinical efficacy by the investigator, assessing the following parameters: onychomycosis evolution, onycholysis, dystrophy, discoloration, and nail thickening, following treatment with test medical device versus reference product.</measure>
    <time_frame>After 30, 60, 120 and 180 days of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Onycholysis, nail distrophy, nail discoloration, and nail thickening was evaluated by a blinded investigator, using the following scores: 0 = none, 1 = very slight, 2 = slight, 3 = moderate, and 4 = severe. Onychomycosis evolution was scored as follows: 1 = failure (aggravation, increase total infected area), 2 = status quo, 3 = improvement (decrease of total infected area), 4 = success: disappearance of the total infected area. In order to compare changes in nail dystrophy, discoloration, and nail thickening between baseline and day 180, five categories were reduced to two categories (none to slight versus moderate to severe). The Mc Nemar test for paired data was used to test if there was a change in nail dystrophy, discoloration, and nail thickening between baseline and day 180. A chi-square test test was performed to compare changes between both treatments in onychomycosis evolution.
Note: scores are used and for this reason, no units of measure can be assigned.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of microbiological efficacy of the product, using KOH staining and fungal culture on D0 and D180 versus reference product.</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline (day 0) and after 180 days of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Patients with positive KOH staining were included in the study. In addition, a fungal culture was performed to identify the involved species. At day 180, a new KOH staining and fungal culture was performed to evaluate the impact of each treatment on both microbiological parameters.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of product tolerance at each visit during the trial, assessed by the investigator by clinical evaluation and subject interrogatory.</measure>
    <time_frame>After 30, 60, 120 and 180 days of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator assigned a score from 0 (bad tolerance) to 3 (very good tolerance).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of the quality of life of the subjects using a validated questionnaire (NailQoL) before (baseline), after 60 and 180 days of treatment with test product, versus comparator.</measure>
    <time_frame>After 60 and 180 days of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>A NailQol global score of 0 corresponds with a quality of life never altered by onychomycosis, whereas a score of 100 corresponds to a quality of life that is always affected by onychomycosis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subject evaluation using an evaluation questionnaire, performed at each visit.</measure>
    <time_frame>After 30, 60, 120 and 180 days of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>A questionnaire was included to evaluate product usability and functionality of Excilor Forte. The questionnaire was completed at each evaluation point (day 30, 60, 120, and 180, respectively). General questions were asked regarding the cosmetic effect (e.g. smoothening, brightening effect, conventional packaging..), overall satisfaction (e.g. smell, fits daily routine ...), product application (e.g. ease of application, drying time, stress-resistance, combination with top coat...), purchase intent and tolerance were asked. Subjects needed to score as follows: strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, strongly disagree, not concerned. Data were summarized in frequencies.</description>
