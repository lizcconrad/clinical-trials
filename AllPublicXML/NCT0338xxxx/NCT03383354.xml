  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emerging evidence suggests that sleep-related disturbances such as sleep-disordered breathing
      (e.g. sleep apnea), sleep fragmentation, abnormal sleep architecture, and periodic limb
      movements (PLMs) are closely linked with adverse health outcomes such as cardiovascular
      events, hospital admissions and mortality. However, data supporting some of these
      associations is inconclusive. The Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre sleep clinic has
      collected a detailed set of physiological variables from adults who underwent daytime and
      overnight sleep studies at the Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre Sleep Laboratory from 2004
      till present. Data exists on more than 5,000 subjects with various disturbances of sleep. The
      investigators plan to link the Sunnybrook Sleep Laboratory data with various health
      administrative databases based at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES). The
      primary objective of this study is to determine whether the presence of various findings on
      polysomnography (e.g. obstructive sleep apnea, sleep structure / fragmentation, physiological
      characteristics such as arousals and periodic limb movements in sleep) are associated with
      different adverse health outcomes such as cardiovascular events, cancer, depression, hospital
      admissions, emergency department visits and mortality.

      The investigators will conduct a population-based cohort study using linked provincial health
      administrative data (based at ICES) and clinical sleep data from the Sunnybrook Health
      Sciences Centre Sleep Laboratory.

      ICES holds an individual-level, longitudinal, coded, linkable and secure and privacy
      protected health databases on most publicly funded health services for the Ontario population
      eligible for universal health coverage since 1991
      (http://www.ices.on.ca/Data-and-Privacy/ICES-data). The records in ICES data include
      information on physician claims submitted to the Ontario Health Insurance Plan, discharge
      summaries of emergency department visits and hospital stays and for those 65 years and older
      medical drug claims to the Ontario Drug Benefit Program. These databases will be linked using
      unique encoded identifiers and analysed at ICES.

      In Ontario, details on physician and hospital services are captured in several health
      administrative databases; of these databases, the investigators plan to use the following
      datasets among others: (i) the Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) physician services
      database; (ii) the Canadian Institute for Health Information Discharge Abstract Database;
      (iii) the Ontario Registered Persons Database; (iv) Ontario Registrar General - Death (Vital
      Stats); and (v) the Ontario Stroke Registry.

      ICES is a prescribed entity under section 45 of Ontario's Personal Health Information
      Protection Act (PHIPA). Section 45 is the provision that enables analysis and compilation of
      statistical information related to the management, evaluation and monitoring of, allocation
      of resources to, and planning for the health system. Section 45 authorizes health information
      custodians to disclose personal health information to a prescribed entity, like ICES, without
      consent for such purposes.

        We will retrospectively analyze data from patients who underwent a daytime or night-time
        sleep study at the Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre Sleep Laboratory. We plan to link
        sleep-related data using patients' last and first name, date of birth, gender and postal
        code, to health administrative data housed at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative
        Sciences (ICES). The full date of birth and full postal code are required to establish
        precise linkages with ICES outcomes data.
