  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common peripheral entrapment neuropathy with
      involving compression of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel. Although many conservative
      managements of CTS, the effectiveness of these methods is insignificant or only persist for a
      short duration. The technique of nerve hydrodissection is now commonly used for peeling the
      nerve from surrounding soft tissue, which may help allow the impulse to pass, and rescue the
      nerve with ischemic damage. However, the exact effect and interval of hydrodissection are
      unknown because of the lack of well-designed studies Hence, investigators design a
      randomized, double- blind, controlled trail to assess the therapeutic effect of
      ultrasound-guided nerve hydrodissection in patients with CTS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After obtaining written informed consent, 60 patients, clinically diagnosed with
      mild-to-moderate CTS were inclused and randomized into three groups. Group A, patients
      received one-session of ultrasoung-guided nerve hydrodissection with 10cc normal saline;
      Group B, patients received one-session of ultrasoung-guided nerve hydrodissection with 5cc
      normal saline; Group C (control group), patients received one-session of ultrasoung-guided
      nerve hydrodissection with 0.5cc normal saline. The injection syringe was covered to obscure
      the nature of its contents and patients were asked to turn their head away so that they would
      not see the procedure. As a result, patients were blinded to the treatment condition. The
      primary outcome is visual analog scale (VAS) and secondary outcomes include Boston Carpal
      Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire (BCTQ), cross-sectional area (CSA) of the median nerve, sensory
      nerve conduction velocity of the median nerve, and global assessment of treatment. The
      evaluations were performed pretreatment as well as on the 2nd week, 1st, 3rd and 6th month
      after injecton.

BCTQ includes two subscale (11 questions in symptom severity and 8 questions in functional status).
