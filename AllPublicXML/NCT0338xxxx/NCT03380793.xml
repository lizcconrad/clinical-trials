      To assess the efficacy, safety, tissue distribution of target organ and Population
      Pharmacokinetic (PPK) of morinidazole and sodium chloride injection with surgery in patients
      with suppurative or gangrenous appendicitis

    <textblock>
      Acute appendicitis is among the most common cause of acute abdominal pain. In patients with
      complicated acute appendicitis, postoperative, broad-spectrum antibiotics are always
      recommended. Metronidazole, a member of the nitroimidazole drug class, is included in the
      regimens recommended for improving anaerobic bacteria coverage. The sideeffects of
      metronidazole include a metallic taste, nausea, transient neutropenia, and peripheral
      neuropathy. Antimicrobial resistance to metronidazole has emerged after several decades of
      worldwide use of the drug. Morinidazole, a National Class I Antimicrobial, is a new type of
      third-generation nitroimidazole antimicrobial that is used for treating amoebiasis,
      trichomoniasis, and anaerobic bacterial infections, and which exhibits greater activity and
      less toxicity than metronidazole.

      Morinidazole and Sodium Chloride Injection used in pelvic inflammatory disease or
      appendicitis cases had been approved by CFDA in 2014. This phase 4 study is to assess the
      efficacy, safety, tissue distribution of target organ and Population Pharmacokinetic (PPK) of
      morinidazole in patients with suppurative or gangrenous appendicitis.
