  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regional anaesthesia is a frequently used procedure. Currently, blockades are increasingly
      carried out without nerve stimulation. The risk of nerve lesion is about 3 %. Industrial
      efforts frequently referred to ultrasound optimisation of the regional anaesthesia cannula.
      In order to optimise patient safety, the benefit of both procedures (stimulation and
      ultrasound) should be combined and both procedures optimised. In this study, the influence of
      the needle electrode size on the stimulability of the nerve ischiadicus should be determined.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are various methods of performing regional anesthesia. In recent years, the focus has
      been on ultrasound-supported regional anaesthesia, and the stimulation methods that were
      often used in the past were no longer used or used less frequently. The combination of both
      methods may be an additional safety aspect and can contribute to an improved blocking
      quality. In addition to the best possible ultrasound quality, an optimal stimulation quality
      is also required. The investigators plan to carry out dual-guidance blockages of the
      ischiadic nerve with various regional anaesthesia needles (manufacturer of the used needles:
      Pajunk Medical Produkte GmbH, Geisingen, Germany; Teleflex Medical GmbH, Kernen, Germany).
      All regional anaesthesia cannulae are approved for the planned blockades of humans in
      Germany.

    <intervention_model_description>The selection of the puncture cannula for regional anaesthesia is not up to the performing anaesthetist, as is usual in the clinical standard, but is made randomly on the basis of a random list. The blockade is carried out by two anaesthetists experienced in regional anaesthesia, who have the principle of dual control. The ultrasound image acquired during the blockade is recorded in the form of an ultrasound video for subsequent evaluation. The recorded ultrasound videos are stored pseudonymously on the server of the Klinik für Anästhesiologie m. S. operativ Intensivmedizin reported to the data protection department.</intervention_model_description>
