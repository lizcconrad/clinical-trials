  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The training of the respiratory muscles seems to be fundamental in people who require a high
      physical demand. There is abundant scientific evidence that relates the respiratory variables
      and the limitation to exercise. The published studies are athletics and cycling, however it
      is scarce in football. Objective. To assess the effects of inspiratory muscle training on
      lung function and sports performance in soccer players.

      Objective. To assess the effects of inspiratory muscle training (EMI) on lung function,
      inspiratory muscle strength and athletic performance in soccer players.

      Method. Participants will be randomized into two groups: experimental (G-IMT) and sham
      (Gn-IMT). The two groups will perform a protocol of 12 weeks of training (4 days / week) with
      the PowerBreathe device. The G-IMT will use progressive resistance loads up to 80% of the
      Mmax, while the Gn-IMT will use the device with a minimum load (10% PImax) during the 12
      weeks. All participants will have the following tests before and after the intervention and 3
      months after the end of the program: spirometry (FVC, FEV1), PImax, biophotogrammetry, and
      fit 30/15 test. For the statistical analysis, a 2-factor variance analysis will be performed
      for repeated measures and Pearson's correlations. The statistical significance will be set
      with a value of p &lt;0.05. The effect size will be calculated using the partial eta-square.

    <description>Biofotogrametry is a tool used to measure the thoracic expansion, the respiratory pattern and its cadence; by recording a video of the breathing pattern that observes the pre- and post-breathing of the subjects.
The unit of measurement in which the results are expressed for the variable thoracic extension will be in cm, and for the respiratory pattern and its percentage cadence (%).</description>

    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>The performance variable will be evaluated using the &quot;fit&quot; 30/15 test, a tool used in athletes to determine the maximum intermittent aerobic speed (VO2max); the results of this test allow later to plan the specific training protocol of the sports team.</description>

    <description>The inspiratory muscle training program will be of the &quot;strength and endurance&quot; type, using the POWERbreathe® device and composed of: daily sessions (3 sets of 15 repetitions -inspiration), 4 days a week for 12 weeks. Participants will begin training breathing with a resistance of 20% of their PImax during the first week. After the first week, the resistance will increase between 5% and 10% in each session until reaching 80% of the PImax, which will be maintained during the first month. Upon completion, the PImax value will be re-evaluated and the player will train 80% of this new value during the second month. At the end of the second month, the PImax is evaluated and the player will train the third month with a resistance of 80% of this new value.</description>
