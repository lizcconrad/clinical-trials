  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research is to provide limb training in children with hemiplegia using a
      bimanual-to-unimanual training approach. Twenty pediatric patients aged 5-17 years with
      acquired brain injury will receive training on the bimanual-to-unimanual device for a period
      of 9 weeks. During the training, children use both arms to operate robotic arms to play a
      video game. We will assess changes in hand impairment after the training.

    <description>Device-based bimanual-to-unimanual training will be provided with the Bimanual Arm Trainer (BAT, Mirrored Motion Works, NC). The device provides bimanual-to-unimanual training of simultaneous shoulder external rotation and elbow extension, and independent training of pronation-supination and grasp and release of each hand. Range of motion and speed are recorded during training and feedback and motivation are provided through age-appropriate gaming modules.</description>
