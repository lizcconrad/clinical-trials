  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the medication adherence, clinical efficacy, and safety of
      EnvarsusXR in stable post liver transplant patient using a Phase III randomized controlled
      study. The primary outcome is change in medication adherence from baseline to the end of the
      study, assessed using a validated instrument (BAASIS- Basel Assessment of Adherence with
      Immunosuppressive medication Scales) and standard deviation of Tacrolimus levels.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this study is to assess the immunosuppressant adherence, efficacy, and safety
      in post liver transplant patients converted from twice daily tacro to once daily EnvarsusXR.
      Tacrolimus trough level, clinical markers of liver disease, HbA1c , eGFR will be assessed at
      baseline, 1 week, 2 week, 4 week, 3 month and 6 months. Graft rejection will be assessed
      using routine standard guidelines to identify the cause. All patients post 1 year liver
      transplant, and within 5 years will be eligible to participate.

      The primary hypothesis is that once daily dosing will improve medication adherence in
      patients randomized to the test arm as compared to the control arm, over a period of 9
      months. The clinical efficacy will be assessed by no difference in standard deviation of
      tacrolimus in the two groups. The secondary hypothesis is that improved medication adherence
      will lead to improved patient reported quality of life (as assessed by PROMIS-29), and better
      health outcomes (as assessed by HbA1c, eGFR).

    <description>Self reported using BAASIS instrument. BAASIS measures taking, skipping and dose reduction of drugs, with a recall period of 4 weeks. It consists of 4 questions with a 6 point response scale (ranging from never to every day). An additional overall adherence is ranked on a scale of 0 to 100 using a visual analog scale.</description>

    <description>Self reported, using PROMIS-29. PROMIS is a result of the NIH support to develop a &quot;psychometrically validated, dynamic system to measure QOL and patient reported outcomes in study participants. PROMIS-29 comprises a set of 29 questions evaluating seven QOL domains: Physical function, anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep disturbance, social function and pain. The scores are reported as a T score (mean 50, SD=10) centered on the sample representative of 2000 US general census considering demographic variables.</description>

    <description>Patients are converted to once daily EnvarsusXR (study drug). The patients continue taking this medication for 9 months of the study. Initial dosage will be 0.8 times the total daily dose of tacro bid, due to higher bioavailability. All subsequent dose adjustments will be based on maintenance of target tacro trough levels within range of 5-12 ng/ml.</description>

    <description>Post Liver Transplant patients take Tacrolimus twice daily as a part of standard of care. Those participating in the study will continue to take tacrolimus twice daily, as apart of their regular care. As a part of the study, they will complete the medication adherence and quality of life instruments.</description>
