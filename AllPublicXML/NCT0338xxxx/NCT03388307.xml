  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lumbar stenosis is one of the common spinal pathologies; it presents with back pain, leg
      pain, and neurogenic claudication . Although different surgical modalities are available, the
      main objective of the operation is decompression of nerve roots and the spinal cord.

      Minimally invasive surgical procedures and microsurgical unilateral laminotomy with bilateral
      spinal canal decompression (ULBD) have been reported to achieve this goal .

      The objective of lumbar decompression is to decompress the neural elements while preserving
      stability and the spinous processes.

      The object of this study is to compare outcomes following minimally invasive unilateral
      laminectomy for bilateral decompression (ULBD) to a standard &quot;open&quot; laminectomy for LSS.
