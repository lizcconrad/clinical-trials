    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effectiveness and safety of directional atherectomy plus local
      drug delivery using balloon catheter system in the treatment of femoropopliteal occlusive
      disease. Patients of femoropopliteal occlusive disease will randomly receive directional
      atherectomy plus local drug delivery using balloon catheter system and dilation using
      drug-coated balloon. Their clinical outcomes (e.g. 12-month late lumen loss rate, 1-year
      patency rate of target vessel) in 1 year after the treatment will be compared.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Femoropopliteal occlusive disease is a common type of peripheral arterial disease.
      Endovascular treatment has been the first-line treatment of femoropopliteal occlusive
      disease. However, the in-stent re-stenosis has been a major limitation of well long-term
      patency rate after stent implantation. The chronic inflammation induced by stenting could be
      a main reason of re-stenosis. Then the concept &quot;leave nothing behind&quot; is proposed, and some
      novel treatment methods and devices, such as paclitaxel-coated balloon dilation, directional
      atherectomy, are developed. Directional atherectomy can effectively remove the
      atherosclerosis plaque but leave the inflammatory reaction along the atherectomy route. Here,
      we propose the hypothesis that using local drug delivery with balloon system can relieve the
      inflammation induced by atherectomy. Therefore, 40 patients of femoropopliteal occlusive
      disease will be randomly allocated into the group &quot;directional atherectomy+local drug
      delivery with balloon system&quot; or &quot;drug-coated balloon only&quot;. The 1-year patency rate,
      incidence of complications, imaging parameters will be compared between groups.
