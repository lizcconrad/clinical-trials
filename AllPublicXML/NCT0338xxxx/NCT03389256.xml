    <textblock>
      This phase 2 study is designed to evaluate the safety and activity of apatinib,a tyrosine
      kinase inhibitor that selectively inhibits the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2,
      in combination with EGFR-TKI in NSCLC with T790M-negative after the failure of EGFR-TKI
      therapy.
