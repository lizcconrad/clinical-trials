  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although Laparoscopic gastrectomy for both early and locally advanced gastric cancer has
      gained popularity, the use of laparoscopic total gastrectomy for proximal advanced gastric
      cancer is still limited to some experienced surgeons, because of its technical difficulties
      in D2 lymph node dissection and anastomoses.

      Some retrospective and cohort studies regarding laparoscopic total gastrectomy with lymph
      node dissection suggested the likelihood of application of laparoscopic surgery for proximal
      gastric cancer. However, there has been no randomized clinical trial comparing results of
      laparoscopic total gastrectomy with D2 lymph node dissection with open conventional surgery.

      Therefore, we aimed to verify the efficacy of laparoscopic total gastrectomy with D2(D2-10)
      lymph node dissection, technical and oncologic safety compared with open surgery via
      multicenter randomized clinical trial.

The &quot;event&quot; of relapse-free survival is defined as &quot;recurrence&quot; after 4 weeks of operation.
The &quot;censoring&quot; is defined as non-traceable patient who cannot be confirmed with recurrence or patient who are alive without recurrence until follow-up.
The &quot;relapse-free survival time&quot; is defined as the time from surgery to &quot;event&quot; or &quot;censoring&quot;.</description>
