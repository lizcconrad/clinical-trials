  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CAR-T cells have been validated effective in treating CD19 positive B cell lymphoma. Other
      lymphomas like Hodgkin's lymphoma and anaplastic large cell lymphoma are CD30 positive. In
      this study, a newly CD30 targeted CART therapy ICAR30 is designed to specifically kill those
      CD30 expressing malignancies including Hodgkin's lymphoma and CD30+ anaplastic large cell
      lymphoma. The subjects will receive several doses of autologous ICAR30 T cells infusion and
      then the safety, treating effects and lasting period of these cells in vivo will be
      evaluated.
