  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare any good or bad effects of using pembrolizumab (an
      experimental drug) and radiation therapy (RT), compared to using cisplatin chemotherapy and
      radiation therapy (RT) in the treatment of patients with head and neck squamous cell
      carcinoma (HNSCC).

      This study is a prospective, multi-institutional, open-label, randomized phase II trial that
      will evaluate the efficacy of concurrent and adjuvant pembrolizumab with radiation therapy
      (RT) versus RT plus cisplatin in intermediate/high-riskp16-positive locoregionally advanced
      head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The primary endpoint is progression-free
      survival (PFS).
