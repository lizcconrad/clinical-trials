  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is the most common biliary tract malignancy and the second most
      common primary hepatic malignancy. The prognosis of CCA is dismal. Surgery is the only
      potentially curative treatment, but the majority of patients present with advanced stage
      disease, and recurrence after resection is common. It is classified into intrahepatic (iCCA),
      perihilar (pCCA), and distal (dCCA) subtypes. Among all, pCCA is the most common subtype.

      This is a prospective, randomized, controlled multicenter trial with two treatment arms,
      three dimension laparoscopic approach versus open approach. The trial hypothesis is that
      three dimension laparoscopic surgery has advantages in postoperative recoveries and be
      equivalent in operation time, oncological results and long-term follow-up compared with open
      counterpart. The duration of the entire trial is two years including prearrangement,
      follow-up and analyses.
