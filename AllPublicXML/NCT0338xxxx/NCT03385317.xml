  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with COPD have a greater risk for symptoms of depression, anxiety, and fear of
      breathlessness. Those emotions are independently associated with lower physical activity,
      poorer quality of life, and higher hospitalization and exacerbations; all independent
      predictors of survival and costs. There is a lack of treatment options to be routinely used
      in primary clinics for patients with COPD. Systematic reviews suggest that interventions that
      promote an accepting mode of response, such as mindfulness, might be more appropriate and
      effective for managing psychological distress in COPD patients, especially breathing-related
      anxiety.

      Hypothesis: A home-based 8-week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) for COPD targeted
      to individuals with symptoms of depression, anxiety, or fear of breathlessness delivered by a
      mindfulness coach using a combination of in-person sessions and remote video call sessions
      will be effective in improving emotional and overall quality of life, and measured physical
      activity.

    <measure>Change in Quality of Life as measured by the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 20 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire is a disease-specific health-related quality of life questionnaire. It was developed to measure the impact of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) on a person's life. It consists of 20 items across four dimensions: dyspnea, fatigue, emotional function, and mastery. Items in each section are scored from 1 (most severe) to 7 (no impairment). Therefore total scores can range from 20 (severe impairment) to 140 (no impairment).</description>
