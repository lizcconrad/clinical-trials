  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of the whole body vibration exercise
      on cortical activity and consciousness Level in brain injury patients with minimally
      conscious state.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Whole body vibration exercise can provide proper somatosensory stimulation and improve muscle
      strength and postural control. However, there has not yet been a report on the cortical
      activity changes induced by whole body vibration exercise in brain injury patients with
      minimally conscious state.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups. One group will go through whole
      body vibration with exercise and the other will only perform exercise. The primary outcome
      measurement of this study was cerebral cortex activity based on changes in oxygenated
      hemoglobin concentration using functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Behavioral assessment
      were performed using the coma recovery scale-revised and modified ashworth scale.

    <intervention_model_description>Eligible patients were randomly assigned to one of the two groups in a 1:1 ratio using an odd or even random numbers table. Whole body vibration group performed five sessions of whole body vibration exercise via a vibrating platform (Galileo® Advanced Plus, Novotec Medical, Pforzheim, Germany) with a magnitude of 20 Hz and an amplitude of 4 mm. The control group performed the same sessions without vibration.</intervention_model_description>

The CRS-R consists of 23 items, grouped into 6 sub-scales:
.Auditory
Visual
Motor
Oromotor
Communication
Arousal The lowest score on each sub-scale represents reflexive activity; the highest represents behaviors mediated by cognitive input.
The total score ranges between 0 (worst) and 23 (best). This measure takes a minimum of 25 minutes to complete.</description>

    <measure>Modified Ashworth scale</measure>
    <time_frame>session 0 (initial visit); session 6 (at approximately 6 days); at 2 weeks (follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>measures resistance during passive soft-tissue stretching and is used as a simple measure of spasticity The Ashworth scale is one of the most widely used methods of measuring spasticity, due in a large part to the simplicity and reproducible method.
0: No increase in muscle tone Grade Description
Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch and release or by minimal resistance at the end of the range of motion when the affected part(s) is moved in flexion or extension 1+: Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch, followed by minimal resistance throughout the remainder (less than half) of the ROM
More marked increase in muscle tone through most of the ROM, but affected part(s) easily moved
Considerable increase in muscle tone, passive movement difficult
Affected part(s) rigid in flexion or extension</description>
