      Introduction: Despite the numerous pharmacological treatment options available for migraine
      attacks and for the prevention of thereof, less than 30% of patients with migraine are highly
      satisfied with their current treatment.

      In recent decades, there has been a radical change in the way we view pain, thanks to
      developments in neuroscience. It is currently considered that pain does not originate in the
      peripheral nociceptors, but rather in a network of brain regions (the pain neuromatrix), the
      synchronous activation of which is necessary and sufficient to generate the perception of
      pain. Migraine may be the expression of this exaggerated perception of threat, a perception
      that, from a cultural learning perspective, it may be possible to modify by adjusting beliefs
      and behaviours that favour the onset of an attack.

      The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a group educational intervention
      about concepts of pain neuroscience, in the management of migraine, compared to routine
      medical interventions, in primary care health centres of Alava.

      The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a group educational intervention
      about concepts of pain neuroscience, in the management of migraine, compared to routine
      medical interventions, in primary care health centres of Alava.

      After recruitment, patients were interviewed by the research team members in charge of the
      assessments. In these interviews, data were collected on the following: demographic
      characteristics, beliefs regarding migraine, coping strategies for migraine attacks, the
      MIDAS questionnaire (16), medication taken, work leave, emergency department attendances and
      limitation of daily activities due to migraine, during the previous 3 months.

      Subsequently, we carried out further assessments over the telephone after 3, 6 and 12 months.
      Very few studies assessing preventive treatments for migraine have performed assessments 12
      months after initiating prophylactic treatment, most having followed-up patients for 6 months
      at most. We believe, however, it is necessary to continue assessments for at least 1 year to
      properly test the efficacy of treatment for chronic illnesses like migraine. The individuals
      carrying out the assessment were blinded to group allocation. The clinical follow-up was the
      same for both groups, the only difference in their management being the educational
      intervention itself.
