  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to determine the effect of food insulin index (FII) on metabolic
      parameters and appetite in obese adolescents with insulin resistance. A randomized,
      single-blind and crossover trial included 15 obese adolescents aged 12-18 years with insulin
      resistance. All participants were submitted two different breakfasts: low glycemic index, low
      insulin index (LGI-LII) and low glycemic index, high insulin index (LGI-HII), with a 1-week
      washout period between meals. At time 0 (just before breakfast), 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 180
      and 240 minutes after the meal, serum glucose, insulin and c-peptide levels were measured and
      appetite was evaluated by visual analog scale. At the end of four hours, participants were
      served ad libitum lunch meal. Then, the foods eaten at lunch were recorded and their energy
      and nutrient analysis was calculated.

    <description>At 240 minutes after the test breakfast, participants were presented with an ad libitum lunch following appetite sensation measurement. Participants selected from a buffet-style meal. During the lunch, participants were left alone in a quiet room with controlled lightning and ambient room temperature, and asked to consume whatever they wanted and to eat until they felt comfortably full. Foods were weighted or measured to the nearest 0.1 g before consumption, and any remaining food was reweighed to determine intake at lunch. Energy intake was calculated using The National Food Composition Database (TurKomp) and manufacturer labelling.</description>
