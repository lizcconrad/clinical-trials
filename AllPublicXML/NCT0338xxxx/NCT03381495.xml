    <textblock>
      Labor analgesia can alleviate intrapartum pain, in the importance of the delivery is very
      obvious.But some researches think labor analgesia may affect the progress of labor, increase
      the cesarean section rate.This research adopts the epidural anesthesia to study labor
      analgesia effects on labor and pregnancy outcomes.

    <measure>1 minute Apgar index</measure>
    <time_frame>1 minute after the infant is born</time_frame>
    <description>The index indicates the infant s' conditions, including heart rate, breathing, muscle tone, reflex response, color. Each characteristic is given an individual score; two points for each of the five categories if all is completely well; then all scores are totaled. The score is from 0 to 10.</description>

    <description>The index indicates the infant s' conditions, including heart rate, breathing, muscle tone, reflex response, color.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analogue Score(VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>5min before analgesia, 30min after analgesia, 1h after analgesia, at the time of full dilatation of cervical, at the time of birth of infant, at the time of delivery of placenta</time_frame>
    <description>VAS is the most common pain scale for quantification. The score is from 0 to 10. The score is higher, the patient will be more painful. That will indicate if the analgesia is effective.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Bromage score</measure>
    <time_frame>5min before analgesia, 30min after analgesia, 1h after analgesia, at the time of full dilatation of cervical, at the time of birth of infant, at the time of delivery of placenta</time_frame>
    <description>The modified Bromage score is the most frequently used measure of motor block. In this scale, the intensity of motor block is assessed by the patient's ability to move their lower extremities. The score is from 1 to 6. The score is higher, the patient's ability to move their lower extremities is better. That will indicate if the analgesia block the patient motor too much.</description>
