        The urban Metropolitan of Beni-Suef City was classified according to the socioeconomic
        level of its quarters to low, middle, and high levels. Out of each level, one quarter was
        selected randomly, by a card withdrawal, where households residing these quarters were
        chosen using a random start. For the rural villages surrounding the urban Metropolitan,
        three villages were selected randomly; one on the road to the North, one on the road to the
        West, and the last one on the road to the South. Each village was clustered roughly into
        two sites; one to the East of the water channel and one to the West of the same water
        channel.

        In both urban and rural areas, a trained team of data collectors visited the selected
        households. Householders were informed briefly of the study and the residing women aged
        between 12 and 25 years were invited to participate and then interviewed.
