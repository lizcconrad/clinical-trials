  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      EpclusaÂ® is a pan-genotypic, once-daily tablet for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus
      (HCV) infection containing the NS5B- polymerase inhibitor sofosbuvir (SOF, nucleotide
      analogue) 400 mg and the NS5A inhibitor velpatasvir (VEL) 100 mg.

      For patients with swallowing difficulties, administration of whole tablets can be
      problematic. In addition, HCV patients that are hospitalized (at intensive care units) due to
      severe illness (co-infections/ liver failure) might not be able to swallow medication.
      Therefore it is useful to know whether it is possible to administer SOF/VEL through a
      different route, like a feeding tube.

      In daily practice, information about the safety and efficacy of crushed tablets is lacking
      which might result in interruption or discontinuation of expensive HCV therapy. However, it
      is not recommended to interrupt treatment because there is no evidence about the efficacy of
      the therapy after discontinuation (and restart).

      Currently, patients and healthcare professionals are crushing SOF/VEL tablets without
      information about efficacy and safety. Depending on the biopharmaceutical characteristics of
      a drug formulation, crushing tablets can lead to altered pharmacokinetics of drugs.

      It is important to know whether pharmacokinetic parameters are influenced by crushing of
      tablets; both a decrease and an increase in exposure may occur. A decrease of the plasma
      concentrations of SOF and/or VEL potentially reduces the therapeutic effect of the drugs.
      Higher doses or switching to other HCV-drugs might be needed. In contrast, in case a higher
      Cmax,ss and/or exposure occurs there might be an increased risk of toxicity.

      As a result, crushing the drug is a contra-indication based on the available data.

      Therefore this study will be conducted to investigate whether a crushed SOF/VEL tablet is
      bioequivalent to SOF/VEL as a whole tablet.
