  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the impact of augmented care at the worksite through
      a lifestyle intervention for diabetes prevention among employees with prediabetes who are
      slower to respond to a standard diabetes prevention intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Employees at The Ohio State University (OSU) with prediabetes will participate in a standard
      lifestyle intervention for diabetes prevention. Participants who do not achieve &gt;2.5% weight
      loss by week 5 of the intervention will transition into augmented care with an enhanced
      training program that addresses values clarification, decision making, planning, and problem
      solving. The impact of the enhanced intervention will be evaluated at 4, 12 and 18 months
      from baseline to determine if implementing early enhanced training helps participants achieve
      and maintain weight loss similar to those who received the standard intervention.

    <intervention_model_description>The proposed translational study applies an innovative experimental approach, an adaptive design, to optimize treatment for weight loss and weight loss maintenance in individuals with prediabetes. All participants will begin a standard lifestyle intervention to promote weight loss. Those who do not achieve &gt;2.5% weight loss during the first month of the intervention will transition to augmented care to enhance weight loss during the intensive intervention phase. Following the intensive phase, participants will be randomly assigned to either the standard intervention or the enhanced intervention for the maintenance study phase. By randomly assigning participants to either the standard maintenance phase of the intervention or the innovative maintenance phase of the intervention following the initial core phase, the impact of extended training in self-regulation for weight loss maintenance will be evaluated.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The intervention includes the following key features: 1) individual case managers or &quot;lifestyle coaches;&quot; 2) frequent contact with participants; 3) a structured, state-of-the-art, 16-session core-curriculum that teaches behavioral self-management strategies for weight loss and physical activity; 4) a more flexible maintenance intervention, combining group and individual approaches and motivational campaigns; 6) individualization through a &quot;toolbox&quot; of adherence strategies; and 7) tailoring of materials and strategies utilizing a network of training, feedback, and support.</description>
