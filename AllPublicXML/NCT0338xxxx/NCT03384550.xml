  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators conduct a micro-randomized trial to test main effects and moderators of
      three different intervention components of Ally, a mHealth intervention to promote physical
      activity that is offered to customers of a large Swiss health insurance. Interventions
      include the use of different incentive strategies, a weekly planning intervention and daily
      message prompts to support self-regulation. The Health Action Process Approach (HAPA) as well
      as principles from behavioral economics were used to guide the development of interventions.
      Further, sensor data is collected in order to enable prediction of latent contextual
      variables. These data can be used to build prediction models for the user's state of
      receptivity, i.e. points in time where the user is able and/or willing to receive, process
      and utilize the support provided. The results of this study enable the evidence-based
      development of a just-in-time adaptive intervention for physical activity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) have recently been proposed as framework for
      health interventions that exploit the potential of mobile health information and sensing
      technologies. By obtaining contextual information for example from smartphone sensors (e.g.
      location, time of day), a JITAI adapts the provision of interventions over time with the goal
      to deliver support when the person needs it most (state of vulnerability) and is most likely
      to be receptive (state of receptivity).

      To facilitate the development of a JITAI for physical activity, the present study has the
      following objectives:

        1. To quantify main effects and interactions of three intervention components of Ally, a
           mHealth intervention for physical activity.

        2. To identify moderators for these intervention components to formulate evidence-based
           decision rules.

        3. To train machine learning models that predict the user's state of receptivity

      A micro-randomized trial design is used to meet the objectives of the study. Customers of a
      large Swiss health insurance company will use Ally over a 10-day baseline and a 6-week study
      period. During the baseline period, participants only have access to the dashboard of the app
      and no interventions are administered. During the intervention period, Ally provides daily
      personalized step goals and different interventions via an interactive chatbot interface
      based on the MobileCoach system (www.mobile-coach.eu). We investigate the following
      intervention components as between-subject or within-subject experimental factors during the
      intervention period: daily self-regulation coaching (two levels, within-subjects), a weekly
      planning intervention (3 levels, within-subjects) and different incentive strategies (3
      levels, between-subjects).

      Primary outcome will be the difference in achievement of the daily personalized step goal
      between intervention and control conditions for all intervention components. We expect all
      intervention components to increase the probability of goal achievement. Sensitivity analyses
      will be conducted for per protocol analysis and adjustment for covariates. Moderators of
      intervention components will be investigated exploratively.

      To reach objective 3, we will collect a wide range of smartphone sensor data as well as usage
      logs of the Ally app throughout the study.

    <measure>Behavioral regulation in physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>seven weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Behavioral regulation in physical activity will be measured using the second version of the Behavioral Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire (BREQ-2). The BREQ-2 consists of five subscales which represent different forms of regulation along the extrinisc-intrinsic continuum of motivation. Because the external regulation subscale in the BREQ-2 exclusively relates to external regulation by other people, it is substituted by the corresponding sub-scale of the Situational Motivation Scale (SIMS). Scores will be reported for each subscale separately. Answers are given on a five-point likert scale with the endpoints 0-not true for me and 4-very true for me.
Scores range from 0 to 16 for the subscales amotivation, external regulation, identified regulation and intrinsic regulation and from 0-12 for the subscale introjected regulation with higher scores representing a stronger manifestation of the respective form of regulation.</description>

    <description>App engagement is measured using the number and length of app launch sessions per day. An app launch session is defined as any interaction of the user with the Ally app, separated by five minutes between events. If a user left the app open and did not take action for 5 minutes or more, then the next interaction with the app counts as a new session.</description>
