  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with serious mental illness such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder experience high
      rates of physical illness and die earlier than people without serious mental illness (WHO,
      2005). Health differences seem to be worse among African Americans (Weber, Cowan, Millikan &amp;
      Niebuhr, 2009). High rates of obesity among this group contribute to health and wellness
      concerns (de Hert et al., 2011), with African American women at higher risk of obesity than
      men. Behavioral weight loss interventions (BWLIs) may promote diet and physical activity that
      lead to weight loss, but healthy food and safe physical activity options are less available
      in low-income neighborhoods. Peer navigators have been found to be effective in addressing
      health differences, and may help people living in low-income communities find healthy food
      and activity resources (Fischer, Sauaia, &amp; Kutner, 2007). In addition, traumatic experiences
      are common among persons with serious mental illness as well as African Americans, and may
      impact weight.

      Through this project, investigators will test two interventions designed to address
      overweight and obesity among African Americans with serious mental illness. The first is a
      BWLI designed for persons with serious mental illness and adapted to meet the needs of
      African Americans. This program has 6-month intervention phase and 2-month maintenance phase,
      which includes group weight management classes, group physical activity, individual visits to
      address barriers to meeting weight goals, and weigh-ins. The second intervention is a peer
      navigator program that assists people with serious mental illness in meeting their health
      needs in the community. Two-hundred and seventy (270) research participants will be recruited
      and randomly assigned to one of three conditions: BWLI program, BWLI program plus peer
      navigator, and treatment as usual (integrated physical and mental health care). Investigators
      will evaluate these interventions over an 18-month period, and will track weight change,
      health behaviors, physical and mental health, recovery, and quality of life. Investigators
      also seek to understand the impact of gender and trauma on outcomes. Investigators
      hypothesize that peer navigators will improve outcomes over the BWLI program alone. Findings
      will advance knowledge and services to reduce racial disparities in obesity and comorbid
      health conditions for African Americans with serious mental illnesses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Persons with serious mental illness experience disproportionate rates of physical health
      morbidity and mortality (WHO, 2005). One reason is a metabolic syndrome marked by significant
      obesity which seems even worse for African Americans. Although research suggests behavioral
      weight loss interventions (BWLIs) may promote healthy lifestyle behaviors (diet and exercise)
      that leads to weight loss, these programs are hindered by several social determinants of
      health found in low-income communities with food and activity deserts that undermine program
      goals. Preliminary evidence finds that peer navigators (service providers in recovery from
      serious mental illness) can help people to better avail existing healthcare programs, thereby
      improving health. Based on this evidence, our community-based participatory research (CBPR)
      project develops and tests two existing interventions to address the weight concerns of
      African Americans with serious mental illness:

        1. A BWLI developed for persons with serious mental illness (Goldberg et al., 2013) that
           will be evaluated for its responsiveness to the needs of African Americans with serious
           mental illness

        2. A peer navigator program (PNP) (Corrigan et al., 2017) that assists people with serious
           mental illness in meeting their health needs in the community; the PNP will be adapted
           so peer navigators can augment the impact of BWLI in food and activity deserts.

      As compared with men, African American women with serious mental illness are at an even
      higher risk for lifetime prevalence of obesity (Baskaran et al., 2014; Galletly et al.,
      2012). Through an administrative supplement, investigators have augmented the approach of our
      study to understand the role of gender on the attainment of weight goals, with a specific
      focus on trauma, an experience of particular importance to women's health.

      Two-hundred and seventy (270) African Americans with serious mental illness who are
      overweight or obese will be randomized to one of three conditions after baseline assessments:
      integrated physical and mental health care, integrated physical and mental health care plus
      BWLI, or integrated physical and mental health care plus BWLI and peer navigator (PN).

      The BWLI has a 6-month intervention phase followed by a 2-month maintenance phase, which
      include group weight management classes, physical activity, individual visits to address
      barriers to meeting goals and to develop skills, and weigh-ins. PNs will partner with
      participants on BWLI assignments, meet with participants and BWLI facilitators, or accompany
      participants to health care appointments and follow-up. In addition, PNs and participants
      will team up to assess community diet and activity resources, and based on this review, will
      develop strategies to address their diet and physical activity needs.

      Investigators seek 70 participants per condition (N=210) to reach statistical power goals.
      Investigators will recruit 270 participants to account for expected loss-to-followup.
      Investigators will enroll participants in discrete cohorts every nine months.

      Investigators will analyze fidelity, process, outcome and impact data, including the effect
      of BWLI and BWLI and PN on weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, health behavior,
      physical and mental health, recovery and quality of life. Measures will be repeated at 4, 8,
      and 12 months. To understand the impact of gender, investigators will stratify the sample on
      gender at recruitment and analyze all program outcome measures by gender. To better
      understand the impact of trauma, investigators will determine if trauma exposure moderates
      the effect of the study intervention. Investigators will also conduct post-hoc analyses to
      determine if gender matching between PNs and participants (e.g., female-female and male-male)
      led to better effects.

      Investigators' main hypothesis is that the BWLI and PN condition will lead to greater weight
      loss and enhanced health behaviors compared with the two other conditions. Findings will
      advance knowledge and services to reduce racial disparities in obesity and comorbid health
      conditions for African Americans with serious mental illnesses.

The initial intervention phase comprises four types of contact: 1) 2-hour, group weight management class led by facilitator (once per week); 2) 45-minute physical activity class led by facilitator (1-2 per week); 3) 20-minute, individual visit with facilitator (once per month); 4) Weigh-in (once each week). Persons are randomly assigned to peer navigators to begin simultaneously with BWLI and run concurrently across the twelve months of the intervention. PNs may work with participants to partner on BWLI homework, meet with participant and BWLI facilitator individually, attend health care appointments, and partner on tasks that arise out of those appointments.</intervention_model_description>
