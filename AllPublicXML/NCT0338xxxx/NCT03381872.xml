      The aim of the study is to compare clinical outcomes between intravascular imaging-guided
      versus angiography-guided percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in complex lesions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After introduction of the 2nd generation drug-eluting stents (DES), the rates of
      device-related failure or target lesion failure such as restenosis and stent thrombosis has
      been markedly decreased, compared with the era of bare metal stents or 1st generation DES.
      Nevertheless, patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for complex
      lesions, for example, chronic total occlusion (CTO), left main disease, true bifurcation
      lesion, long lesion, multi-vessel PCI, multiple overlapping stents, or severely calcified
      lesions have significantly worse clinical outcomes than those with non-complex lesions.

      During the PCI procedure, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and optical coherence tomography
      (OCT) are useful tools for providing information on preintervention lesion characteristics,
      including vulnerable plaques, lesion severity, length, and morphology; on postintervention
      optimal stent implantation for stent expansion, extension, and apposition; and on possible
      complications after stent implantation. Therefore, intravascular imaging guidance may improve
      clinical outcomes after complex PCI. However, although previous randomized controlled trial
      (RCT) and registries showed significantly lower rates of major adverse clinical events
      following IVUS-guided PCI compared with angiography-guided PCI, the RCTs were limited with
      small sample size and dealt with very selected lesion subsets such as CTO or long lesion.
      Moreover, it is uncertain whether OCT-guided PCI improves clinical outcomes compared with
      angiography-guided PCI. Meanwhile, appropriate imaging modality may differ according to
      patient and lesion characteristics.

      One of the ways to maximize the advantage of intravascular imaging is choice of intravascular
      imaging devices by the operator's discretion. Therefore, the current RENOVATE-COMPLEX-PCI
      (Randomized Controlled Trial of Intravascular Imaging Guidance versus Angiography-Guidance on
      Clinical Outcomes After Complex Percutaneous Coronary Intervention) is designed to
      investigate whether PCI under guidance of intravascular imaging devices (IVUS or OCT) chosen
      by operators would improve clinical outcomes compared with angiography-guided PCI in patients
      with complex lesions.

    <description>The choice of intravascular imaging devices such as IVUS or OCT during PCI will be left to the operator's discretion. In case of staged procedure during the same hospitalization, following the initially allocated strategy would be strongly recommended. Use of intravascular imaging devices will be allowed at any step of PCI (pre-PCI, during PCI and post-PCI), but intravascular imaging evaluation after stent implantation will be mandatory.</description>

    <description>The PCI procedure in this group will be performed as standard procedure. After deployment of stent, stent optimization will be done based on angiographic findings. The optimization guided by angiography should meet the criteria of angiographic residual diameter stenosis less than 10% by visual estimation and the absence of flow limiting dissection (≥Type C dissection). When angiographic under-expansion of the stent is suspected, adjunctive balloon dilatation will be strongly recommended. In case of staged procedure during the same hospitalization, following the initially allocated strategy would be strongly recommended.</description>

    <description>Recommendations for selecting reference segment, selecting appropriated size of stent, and stent optimization are as follows.
IVUS Reference site: Largest lumen, Plaque burden &lt;50% Stent sizing: By measuring vessel diameter at proximal and distal reference Stent length: By measuring distance from distal to proximal reference site.
OCT Reference site: Most normal looking segment, No Lipidic plaque Stent sizing: By measuring vessel or lumen diameter at proximal and distal reference Stent length: Same as IVUS
* Stent optimization criteria In-stent minimal lumen area ≥ 90% of the average reference lumen area No major malapposition of the stent over its entire length against the vessel wall No major edge dissection extended to media layer with potential to provoke flow disturbances No residual stenosis within 10 mm from proximal or distal stent edges
-&gt;If 1 of above findings are notified, additional procedure including additional stent implantation will be recommended.</description>
