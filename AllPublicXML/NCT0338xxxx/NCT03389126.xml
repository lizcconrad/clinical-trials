             level &gt; 5 × the upper limit of normal range (ULN), and an ALT level &gt; 5 × ULN.

          7. Inadequate renal function defined by an estimated creatinine clearance &lt; 50 mL/min
             according to the Cockcroft-Gault formula or by measure of creatinine clearance from 24
             hour urine collection

          8. Inadequate hematologic function defined by WBC &lt; 2000/μL, Platelets &lt; 60,000/μL,
             Hemoglobin &lt; 8.5 g/dL.

          9. Active brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases, requiring immunosuppressive
             doses of corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg/day prednisone equivalents).

         10. IMMUNOSUPRESSANTS: &quot;Current use of immunosuppressive medication, EXCEPT for the
             following: a. intranasal, inhaled, topical steroids, or local steroid injection (e.g.,
             intra-articular injection); b. Systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses ≤ 10
             mg/day of prednisone or equivalent; c. Steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity
             reactions (e.g., CT scan premedication).&quot;

         11. AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE: &quot;Active autoimmune disease that might deteriorate when receiving
             an immuno-stimulatory agent. Patients with diabetes type I, vitiligo, psoriasis, or

             investigational product or any component in its formulations, including known severe
             hypersensitivity reactions to monoclonal antibodies (NCI CTCAE v4.03 Grade ≥ 3)&quot;

             (≥ New York Heart Association Classification Class II), or serious cardiac arrhythmia
             requiring medication.&quot;

         18. OTHER PERSISTING TOXICITIES: &quot;Persisting toxicity related to prior therapy (NCI CTCAE
             v. 4.03 Grade &gt; 1); however, alopecia, sensory neuropathy Grade ≤ 2, or other Grade ≤
             2 not constituting a safety risk based on investigator's judgment are acceptable.&quot;

         19. Other severe acute or chronic medical conditions including immune colitis,
             inflammatory bowel disease, immune pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis or psychiatric
             conditions including recent (within the past year) or active suicidal ideation or
             behavior; or laboratory abnormalities that may increase the risk associated with study
             participation or study treatment administration or may interfere with the
             interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make
             the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.

         20. Any history of clinically meaningful variceal bleeding within the last three months
             21, Prior treatment with anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CD137, or anti-CTLA-4
             antibodies (or other agents specifically targeting immune checkpoint pathway)

        22. Prior malignancy active within the previous 3 years except for locally curable cancers
        that have been apparently cured, such as basal or squamous cell skin cancer, superficial
        bladder cancer, or carcinoma in situ of the prostate, cervix, or breast.
