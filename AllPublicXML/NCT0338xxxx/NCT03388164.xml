  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine whether a combination a first-line antidepressant plus &quot;RT2CK17&quot;
      in a capsule relative to a first-line antidepressant plus placebo in a capsule results in
      higher rates of medication adherence in individuals with moderate to severe depression. In
      this double-blind randomized placebo controlled trial, 100 individuals with a Quick Inventory
      of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report (QIDS-SR) scale score ≥ 14 will be enrolled to
      participate in an 8 week treatment study. Participants will be randomized with a 1-1 ratio to
      receive 5 milligrams (mg) &quot;RT2CK17&quot; + 10 mg escitalopram or placebo + 10 mg escitalopram to
      be taken orally once per day. Participants will undergo a 3 hour baseline evaluation visit at
      week 0, two 30-minute office visits (week 2 and 4), one 60-minute office visit (week 8) and
      three 5-minute phone calls (weeks 1, 3, and 6) during which clinical assessments and measures
      will be obtained. The trial is designed with two stages: 20 participants in Stage 1 will be
      used to estimate the adherence effect size; Stage 2 is designed with an interim analysis to
      test our hypotheses.
