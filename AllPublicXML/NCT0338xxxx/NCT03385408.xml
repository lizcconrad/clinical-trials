      This study will determine the efficacy of High Intensity Laser Therapy (HILT) for the
      treatment of shoulder osteoarthritis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder osteoarthritis (SO) is a musculoskeletal joint disease that affects the elderly. SO
      is characterized by degeneration of the articular cartilage in the involved joints and its
      underlying bone within a joint as well as bony overgrowth. It is one of the major causes of
      physical disability that has a social and public health impact due to pain, stiffness, joint
      instability, and muscle weakness.

      The diagnosed patients with SO will be treated with HILT for a total of ten sessions during
      the entire duration of the treatment protocol. Parameters to be evaluated are: range of
      motion, pressure pain (algometer), pain perception (Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Modified
      Laitinen Pain Questionnaire), quality of life (WHOQoL-BREF) These parameters will be recorded
      before the first treatment (baseline), after completion of treatment, three and 6 months
      after completion treatment. A change in above parameters will be evaluated.
