  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is characterized by obstruction to pulmonary airflow
      and dyspnea. These characteristics are a consequence of exposure to harmful gases and
      particles that lead to oxidative stress in the lungs together with an exaggerated
      inflammatory response. In addition to respiratory impairment, chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease has systemic manifestations, nutritional alterations, and exercise limitation.
      Pulmonary rehabilitation is one of the most effective interventions in the treatment of
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, with one goal being to improve patient capacity. Whey
      protein supplementation, concomitant with physical activity for patients with chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease, aims to stimulate protein synthesis and decrease muscle
      catabolism that may be caused by exercise. The investigators aimed to evaluate the effects of
      whey protein supplementation supplementation on the physical capacity, body composition and
      tissue functionality of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in a pulmonary
      rehabilitation program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized clinical study will be carried out with 62 patients (31 patients per group) with
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who came from specialized departments of the
      Pulmonology Service of the Hospital de Clínicas of Porto Alegre and were referred to the
      pulmonary rehabilitation program of this institution. Patients will be evaluated in relation
      to anthropometry, body composition, blood biochemistry, phase angle, dietary intake, physical
      capacity, muscle strength and lung function. The data will be processed in the statistical
      program SPSS version 17.0 and for statistical analysis they will be tested for their
      normality by the Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test and after this definition will be applied specific
      tests for parametric or non-parametric data, being they presented in the form of mean and
      standard deviation or median, minimum and maximum, according to their distribution. The
      differences will be considered significant for values of p &lt;0.05.

    <measure>Muscle strength through manual grip strength of dominant and non-dominant limbs</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of grip strength with dynamometer is performed with the patient sitting comfortably, with the shoulder attached, the elbow flexed at 90º, the forearm in the neutral position and the cuff should be between 0 (zero) and 30º of extension, and should perform the greatest gripping force possible. Six measurements will be performed with a 15-second interval, alternating the hands, starting with the dominant upper limb.</description>

    <measure>Body composition (amount of muscle mass) wiht absorptiometry by dual emission of X-ray</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The measurements will be obtained with the patient in the supine position, positioned in the area of equipment scanning, so that the sagittal line demarcated in this area passes under the center of some anatomical points such as the skull, spine, pelvis and legs, and without metal objects attached to the body.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tissue functionality through phase angle</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The evaluation of the phase angle will be performed by means of the electric bioimpedance apparatus. The measurements will be obtained with the patient in dorsal decubitus, barefoot, with the lower limbs slightly apart and without metal objects attached to the body, with electrodes placed on the right hand and foot. Diuretic medications should be stopped 24 hours before the test, physical activities should be avoided until 8 hours before and a 4 hour fast will be requested.</description>
