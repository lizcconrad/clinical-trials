  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preventable failures in the drug chain are related to Drugs Problems Related Use and are
      associated with medication errors (prescription, dispensing, administration or use by the
      patient or caregiver), including failures In the Medication Supply System (availability and
      quality).

      The controlled drugs are those that contain substances regulated by international conventions
      on drug control. They are important in various fields of medicine, such as pain management,
      obstetric emergencies, mental disorders such as the treatment of substance dependence,
      psychiatry and neurology. It has been defined as abuse of drugs the improper use of these for
      non-medical purposes, and associated with the use without medical prescription, which can
      produce addiction or psychic or physical dependence.

Sometimes: Much more haphazard than &quot;usually&quot; (21-50 %)
Usually: Implies standard practice with occasional lapses (51-84 %)
Consistently: Demonstrates the expected standard of practice with very rare lapses (85-100 %)</description>
