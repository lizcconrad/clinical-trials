      Guideline recommendations on the use of dual antiplatelet therapy have been formulated that
      ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily plus aspirin in preference to clopidogrel 75mg daily plus
      aspirin for ACS patients. Recent study found that ticagrelor 90mg twice a day orally could
      significantly reduce the occurrence of clopidogrel resistance and adverse cardiovascular
      events. The previous studies have reported that half-dose ticagrelor had the similar
      inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation as the standard-dose ticagrelor, which was
      significantly stronger than that in the clopidogrel group. One-quarter standard-dose
      ticagrelor provided greater degree of platelet inhibition than standard dose clopidogrel in
      Chinese patients with stable CAD. But large-scale clinical trials are still needed to confirm
      the effects of low-dose ticagrelor on platelet function in Chinese patients with coronary
      heart disease.

    <textblock>
      Dual Antiplatelet Therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and P2Y12 receptor inhibitor remains a
      cornerstone in the secondary prevention of coronary artery disease (CAD). Clopidogrel is one
      of the most commonly used antithrombotic agent that inhibits the platelet P2Y(12) adenosine
      diphosphate (ADP) receptor.

      Ticagrelor is an oral, reversibly-binding, direct-acting P2Y12 receptor antagonist used
      clinically for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in patients with acute coronary
      syndromes (ACS). Guideline recommendations on the use of dual antiplatelet therapy have been
      formulated that ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily plus aspirin in preference to clopidogrel 75mg
      daily plus aspirin for ACS patients. Recent study found that ticagrelor 90mg twice a day
      orally could significantly reduce the occurrence of clopidogrel resistance and adverse
      cardiovascular events. The previous studies have reported that half-dose ticagrelor had the
      similar inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation as the standard-dose ticagrelor, which was
      significantly stronger than that in the clopidogrel group. One-quarter standard-dose
      ticagrelor provided greater degree of platelet inhibition than standard dose clopidogrel in
      Chinese patients with stable CAD. But large-scale clinical trials are still needed to confirm
      the effects of low-dose ticagrelor on platelet function in Chinese patients with coronary
      heart disease.
