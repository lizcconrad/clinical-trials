    <textblock>
      This is an open label, phase I study to test for maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended
      phase II dose (RP2D) of the combination of nivolumab and bevacizumab. The study will use a
      3+3 phase I study design using a fixed dose of nivolumab (240mg) and escalating doses of
      bevacizumab (1-10mg).

    <description>Bevacizumab will be administered as an IV infusion from 1-10mg/kg in accordance with the appropriate subject cohort being examined as described below:
Dose level 1: 5 mg/kg intravenously once every two weeks Dose level 2: 10 mg/kg intravenously once every two weeks Dose level -1: 1 mg/kg intravenously once every two weeks
Dosing is based on actual body weight. There is no dose adjustment for obese or frail individuals. Dosing is recalculated if patient weight changes by more than 10% as reviewed by the principal investigator.
