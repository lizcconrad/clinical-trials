      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-831. TAK-831 is being tested to treat
      negative symptoms in participants who have schizophrenia.

      The study will enroll approximately 315 participants. Participants will then be randomly
      assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the four treatment groups in the
      double-blind periodâ€”which will remain undisclosed to the participant and study doctor during
      the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):

        -  TAK-831 50 mg once daily

        -  TAK-831 125 mg once daily

        -  TAK-831 500 mg once daily

        -  Placebo once daily

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the North America and Europe. The overall time
      to participate in this study is approximately 18 weeks. Participants will make 11 visits to
      the clinic, and will be followed up for safety assessment 10 to 14 days after the last dose
      of study drug (Day 98).

    <measure>Change from Baseline on the PANSS NSFS at Day 84</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 84</time_frame>
    <description>PANSS assesses the positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and general psychopathology associated with schizophrenia. The scale consists of 30 items. Each item is rated on a scale from 1 (symptom not present) to 7 (symptoms extremely severe). Negative subscale consists of 7 items which assess the negative symptoms with sub scale score ranging from 7 to 49, where higher score indicates greater severity.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline on the Brief Negative Symptom Scale (BNSS) at Day 84</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 84</time_frame>
    <description>The BNSS is a 13-item instrument designed for use in clinical trials and other studies that measures 5 domains of negative symptoms: blunted affect, alogia, asociality, anhedonia, and avolition. All the items in the BNSS are rated on a 7-point (0-6) scale, with anchor points generally ranging from the symptom's being absent (0) to severe (6). A scale total score is calculated by summing the 13 individual items; total score range of 0 to 78, where higher score indicates higher severity of negative symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline on the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) Composite Score at Day 84</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 84</time_frame>
    <description>The BACS is specifically designed to measure treatment-related improvements in cognition and includes alternate forms. BACS is a reliable and sensitive measure of cognitive function in schizophrenia. The BACS is a cognition assessment battery that assesses 6 domains of cognitive function found to be consistently impaired in schizophrenia: verbal memory, working memory, motor speed, attention, executive functions, and verbal fluency. The primary measure from each test of the BACS is standardized by creating z-scores whereby the mean of the test session of a healthy participant is set to 0 and the standard deviation set to 1.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline on the Clinical Global Impression-Schizophrenia-Severity (CGI-SCH-S) Score at Day 84</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 84</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-SCH scale is an adapted version of the CGI scale that is designed to assess global illness status in participant's with schizophrenia. CGI-SCH-S is a 7-point scale that requires the investigator to rate the severity of the participant's illness at the time of assessment. A participant is assessed on severity of mental illness on the following scale: 1. normal, not at all ill; 2. borderline ill; 3. mildly ill; 4. moderately ill; 5. markedly ill; 6. severely ill; or 7. extremely ill.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression Schizophrenia Improvement (CGI-SCH-I) Score at Day 84</measure>
    <time_frame>At Day 84</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-SCH-I assesses the participant's improvement (or worsening). The investigator is required to assess the participant's condition relative to baseline on a 7-point scale where 1. very much improved; 2. much improved; 3. minimally improved; 4. no change; 5. minimally worse; 6. much worse; or 7. very much worse.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline on the Schizophrenia Cognition Rating Scale (SCoRS) at Day 84</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 84</time_frame>
    <description>The SCoRS is an interview-based measure of cognitive functioning that is developed to specifically assess aspects of cognitive functioning in participants with schizophrenia. The items assess the 7 cognitive domains of attention, memory, reasoning and problem solving, working memory, processing speed, language functions, and social cognition. The SCoRS global total scores is the sum of the 20 items and it varies from 20 to 80 with 20 being the best outcome and 80 being the worst.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 84</time_frame>
    <description>The Q-LES-Q-18 is 18-item version of the Q-LES-Q modified for use in participants with schizophrenia. Q-LES-Q is a participant-completed scale that assesses the degree of enjoyment and satisfaction in 5 areas of the participant's daily life: physical health, subjective feelings, leisure time activity, social relationships, and satisfaction with medication. Total scores range from 14-70, with higher levels of satisfaction yielding higher scores.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Has a current diagnosis of schizophrenia as defined by the Mini International
             Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) 7.0.2 for Psychotic Disorders for the Diagnostic and
             Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). The participant's
             initial diagnosis must be greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 1 year from screening.

          2. Is receiving primary background antipsychotic therapy at a total daily dose between 2
             and 6 mg of risperidone equivalents or its equivalent (as outlined in an Antipsychotic
             Dose Equivalency reference supplied to the sites). Concomitant treatment with a
             sub-therapeutic dose of a second antipsychotic may be permitted with sponsor or
             designee approval if used as a hypnotic (maximum of quetiapine 100 mg or its
             equivalent once daily at bedtime [QHS]), but not if it is used for refractory positive
             psychosis symptoms. Under this exception, the total daily dose the second
             antipsychotic will not have to be included in the calculation of the 6 mg/day
             risperidone-equivalent limit.

          3. Is treated with a stable regimen of psychotropic medications with no clinically
             meaningful change (no increase in dose, less than [&lt;] 20 percent [%] decrease in dose
             for tolerability) the 2 months prior to the screening visit.

          4. Has a BNSS total score (12-item, excluding number 4) &gt;=28; stable Single-Blind Placebo
             Run-in and Baseline scores (less than or equal to [&lt;=] 20% change from the screening
             score).

          5. Has no more than moderate-severe (&lt;=5) rating on PANSS positive symptom items P1, P3,
             P4, P5, P6, or unusual thought content (G9), with a maximum of 2 of these items rated
             '5'; no more than moderate (&lt;=4) rating on conceptual disorganization (P2). In
             addition, the participant must demonstrate stable Single-Blind Placebo and Baseline
             scores (&lt;=20% change from the Screening score) in the total of these PANSS items.

          6. There is evidence that the participant has stable symptomatology &gt;=3 months prior to
             the screening visit (example, no hospitalizations for schizophrenia, no emergency room
             admission due to symptoms of schizophrenia, no increase in level of psychiatric care
             due to worsening of symptoms of schizophrenia).

          7. Have an adult informant (example, family member, social worker, caseworker,
             residential facility staff, or nurse who spends &gt;=4 hours/week with the subject)
             considered reliable by the investigator who will be able to provide input for
             completing study rating scales, including the PANSS and SCoRS. The informant must be
             able and willing to provide written informed consent and to participate in at least 1
             in-person interview (during the Screening or Placebo Run-in Visit in the clinic or via
             site staff conducting informed consent and ratings interviews at the informant's
             location), then be able to provide input by attending each clinical assessment visit
             or via participating in a telephone interview for all other study visits that include
             the PANSS or SCoRS endpoints. Informant participation at the Screening Visit is
             preferred, if possible.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Has a lifetime diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder; a lifetime diagnosis of bipolar
             disorder; or a lifetime diagnosis of obsessive compulsive disorder based on the MINI

             historical prior lifetime diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder may be enrolled in the
             study with sponsor or designee approval provided that the principal investigator can
             attest that the participants overall history and current clinical presentation and
             history is most consistent with schizophrenia, not schizoaffective disorder.

          2. Has a recent (within the last 6 months) diagnosis of panic disorder, depressive
             episode, or other comorbid psychiatric conditions requiring clinical attention based

          3. Has a diagnosis of substance use disorder (with the exception of nicotine dependence)
             within the preceding 6 months based on the MINI for DSM-5 and the general psychiatric
             evaluation.

          4. Is participating in a formal structured nonpharmacological psychosocial therapeutic
             treatment program (cognitive remediation, cognitive-behavioral therapy, intensive
             symptom/vocational rehabilitation) for a duration of &lt;3 months prior to randomization.
             In addition, initiation of such nonpharmacological treatment programs is not permitted
             during study participation through the Day 84 visit.

          5. The participant exhibits more than a minimal level of antipsychotic-induced

             number 10, Akathisia) &gt;6.

          6. Has evidence of depression as measured by a Calgary Depression Scale Score (CDSS)
             greater than (&gt;) 9.

          7. Is considered by the investigator to be at imminent risk of suicide or injury to self,
             others, or property, or the participant has attempted suicide within the past year
             prior to screening. Participants who have positive answers on item number 4 or 5 on
             the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) (based on the past year) prior to
             randomization are excluded.

             below the minimum acceptable concentration criteria per the Antipsychotic Drug Level
             Reference Document at the Screening or Placebo Run-in Visits. This criterion is not
             applicable to participants on a primary background antipsychotic for which a clinical
             assay is unavailable (that is, not listed in the Antipsychotic Drug Level Reference
             Document).

         13. Has received clozapine for the treatment of schizophrenia within a 5-year period
             before screening.
