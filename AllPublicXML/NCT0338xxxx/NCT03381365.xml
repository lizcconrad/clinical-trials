  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We aim to assess the efficacy of the Curaseal anal plug in patients with idiopathic
      uncomplicated fistulous tracts. Healing of the fistula tract will be assessed both clinically
      and radiologically with MR imaging.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Perianal fistula is a challenging condition for colorectal surgeons. Achieving a favourable
      balance between healing and incontinence is the key to success. Surgeons have adopted many
      methods to close off this abnormal tract, which include laying opening, use of setons,
      advancement flaps and permanent stoma. A more recent approach has been the use of devices or
      substances to block the tract in the hope that it will seal off. Most of the devices that
      have been used to close the tract have not proved to be as effective in healing as a lay open
      with high rates of fistula persistence. A major failure of the devices has been their early
      expulsion and their inability to seal off the internal opening.

      The new Curaseal plug may be able to overcome these shortcomings. This plug has a disc to
      seal the internal opening, with a suture to be placed at the external opening, which may
      prevent it falling out and ensure internal opening closure.

      We aim to assess the efficacy of the Curaseal anal plug in patients with idiopathic
      uncomplicated fistulous tracts. Healing of the fistula tract will be assessed both clinically
      and radiologically with MR imaging.
