               2. Subjects must be willing and able to comply with the scheduled visits, study drug
                  dosing schedule, procedures, laboratory tests, and other requirements of the

                  weigh between 50 and 100 kg (inclusive).

               2. Subjects must be in good health as determined by past medical history, complete
                  physical examination, vital signs and laboratory tests at screening.

          3. Age and Reproductive Status

               1. Men and women, 18 - 65 years of age.

               2. Female participants of childbearing potential must adhere to using a medically
                  accepted method of birth control up to 28 days prior to screening and agree to
                  continue its use during the study or be surgically sterilized (e.g., hysterectomy
                  or tubal ligation) WOCBP must agree to use effective contraception during the
                  study and for at least 1 month following the last dose of the study drug.

               3. WOCBP must have a negative serum pregnancy test &lt; 14 days prior to first dose of
                  the study drug. Non-childbearing is defined as greater than one year
                  postmenopausal or surgically sterilized.

               4. Male subjects must be willing to use barrier contraception (i.e. condoms and
                  spermicide) from the day of dosing until at least 1 month following the last dose
                  of study drug.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Medical History and Concurrent Diseases

               1. A past medical history of clinically significant 12 lead EKG abnormalities

                  requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (&gt;10 mg daily prednisone
                  equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications within 4 weeks or 5 half-lives
                  of registration are excluded.

               7. Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
                  requirements.

               8. Previous malignancies, unless basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or
