  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autologous cellular immunotherapy is to collect patient's own immune cells and infuse back
      into the patient's body after culture in vitro that can activate the anti-tumor immune
      response and achieve the purpose of cancer treatment. Central memory T (Tcm) cells are
      effective anti-tumor immune cells with long-term in vivo survival and self-renewal capacity.
      Combination of autologous Tcm cells immunotherapy with other therapies, such as surgery and
      chemotherapy, can effectively prolong the patient's life, prevent the recurrence and
      metastasis of cancers, and improve the quality of life of patients.

      This study will recruit patients with pathologically and radiographically confirmed
      metastatic bladder urothelial carcinoma that the efficacy is evaluated as partial response
      (PR) or complete response (CR) after 4 cycles of the standard first-line gemcitabine plus
      cisplatin chemotherapy. Patients must have adequate hematologic and end-organ function,
      performance status and no contraindications to receive autologous Tcm cells immunotherapy.
      All participants will be treated with standard first-line gemcitabine plus cisplatin
      chemotherapy before enrolment.

      This clinical trial was designed with a single-center randomized controlled trial. The study
      will recruit 56 patients that will be divided into treatment group and control group as 1:1
      according to the randomization. Patients of treatment group will be treated with twice
      autologous Tcm cells immunotherapy after chemotherapy. These patients will be infused in
      2-4×10^9 cells/100 ml after chemotherapy for 1 month, then cells will be infused as the same
      dose after another month. All patients will be followed up with hospital visits and telephone
      interviews to second-line treatment for disease progression. The observation period of
      patients is 24 months.

      The objective of the study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of autologous Tcm
      cells immunotherapy in patients with metastatic bladder epithelial carcinoma treated with
      first-line gemcitabine plus cisplatin according to the progression-free survival (PFS) and
      overall survival (OS) of these patients.
