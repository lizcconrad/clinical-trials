  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the different enhancement using a contrast agent dose in computed
      tomography based on total body weight or based on lean body weight. Half of participants will
      receive contrast agent dose based on their total body weight, while the other half will
      receive a dose based on their lean body weight. Our hypothesis is that if contrast agent is
      administered not basing on total body weight but on lean body weight it is possible to obtain
      equal or better quality of enhanced images, a reduction of the variability of contrast
      enhancement, and also a dose reduction in some patients (overweight ones).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will undergo a CT scan of abdomen (multi-phasic) with contrast agent and will be
      measured: total body weight (TBW), height, lean body weight (LBW) and body mass index (BMI)
      through formulas known in literature and with a balance for bioelectrical impedance analysis.
      There is no administration of drugs other than those indicated in the request of the treating
      physician.

      Contrast agent dose:

      IOPAMIRO® (Iopamidol) is an x-ray contrast medium of the new generation of non-ionic
      compounds, which are watersoluble because the molecular structure incorporates hydrophilic
      groups. Recommended dosage (ml) is 0.5-2.0/kg. Single injection volume depends on the
      vascular area to be examined.

      IOMERON® (Iomeprolo) is an x-ray contrast medium of the new generation of non-ionic
      compounds, which are watersoluble because the molecular structure incorporates hydrophilic
      groups. Recommended dosage (ml) is 0.5-2.0/kg. Single injection volume depends on the
      vascular area to be examined.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to undergo one of the two contrast agent protocols.

      Control group (TBW protocol): patients will receive a contrast agent dose based on their TBW
      as a standard clinic protocol with a dose of 0.40 gI/kg of TBW. There are no differences
      compared to clinical practice.

      Experimental group (LBW protocol): patients will receive a contrast agent dose based on their
      calculated LBW to test our hypothesis with a dose of 0.65 gI/kg of LBW, derived from our
      pilot study (LBW_01 approved 10/11/2016, registration number 160/int/2016).

      If radiologists prefer a more enhanced examination, only scanning with contrast agent will be
      repeated with the standard dose as the standard clinical protocol.

    <masking_description>Patients will be assigned to the TBW or LBW group based on a randomization generated by a computer, the progressive sequences containing the randomization code will be perform by an outside operator to the experiment group. Only CT technician and nurse that will record patient's data and results from scale analysis will know and will register in which group the patients will be assigned.</masking_description>
