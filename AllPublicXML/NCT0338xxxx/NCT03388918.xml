  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The idea behind the Future Patient research project is to develop a telerehabilitation
      program and tools for patients with heart failure.

      The hypothesis for this study is that participation in a telerehabilitation program for
      patients with heart failure will increase the patients' quality of life and multi‐parametric
      (subjective and objective) individualized monitoring in a telerehabilitation program for
      patients with heart failure will increase detection of worsening of symptoms and avoid future
      hospitalization of the HF-patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim is to test, implement and evaluate a telerehabilitation program for patients
      with heart failure from clinical, psychosocial, health literacy and e-health literacy,
      inter-organizational, health economic and technical perspectives.

      Furthermore, this study has sub aims:

        -  To increase the quality of life for patients with Heart Failure (HF)

        -  To optimize the medical treatment of patients with HF

        -  To perform multi-parametric (subjective and objective) individualized monitoring in
           order to detect worsening of symptoms and avoid hospitalizations

        -  To increase physical activities for patients with heart failure in everyday life in a
           telerehabilitation program

        -  To facilitate patient-initiated self-care management actions upon the following early
           detection of changes in source data (steps taken, weight, blood pressure, pulse, sleep,
           illness perception, motivation, anxiety and depression)

        -  To evaluate patients health literacy and e-health literacy participating in a
           telerehabilitation program and rehabilitation program

        -  To test and evaluate the Heart Portal - a digital toolbox for improved self-management
           for patients with heart failure and their relatives

        -  To explore the experiences and perspectives of the patients and their relatives when
           being part of a telerehabilitation program

        -  To test and evaluate a cross sector communication platform from a patient and healthcare
           professional perspective

        -  To perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of total costs of healthcare and rehabilitation
           services
