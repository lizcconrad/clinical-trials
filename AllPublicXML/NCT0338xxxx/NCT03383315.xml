    <textblock>
      Tramadol is widely used as analgesic in trauma patients. However, it causes side effects,

    <masking_description>The study drugs were prepared under sterile conditions by a pharmacist independent to the study and kept in packs.The patients recruited were randomized to receive one of the study packs. The study pack were numbered by the pharmacist, who used a computer-generated random number sequence to assign treatment allocations. The allocation list was kept by the pharmacist. Treatment allocations were revealed only after study completion, when all outcome measurements had been performed and recorded by the investigator in the study database.</masking_description>
