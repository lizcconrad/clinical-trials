  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A study in healthy male subjects to investigate whether repeated administrations of
      cimetidine (a medication which decreases the amount of acid in the stomach) can affect the
      fate in the body (amount and time of presence in the blood) of lucerastat. Safety of the
      concomitant administration of the two treatments will also be assessed.
