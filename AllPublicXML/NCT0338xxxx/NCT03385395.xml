  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized trial is being conducted to show non-inferiority of OctaAlpha1 compared to
      Glassia® in terms of the serum trough levels at steady state. This will be conducted in
      individuals with alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency and clinical evidence of emphysema.
