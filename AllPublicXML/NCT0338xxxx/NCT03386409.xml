  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to describe the baseline rate of safe firearm storage device use in the homes
      of pediatric patients with mental health complaints treated in the Emergency Department (ED)
      and/or inpatient psychiatric unit of an urban tertiary pediatric hospital.

      Follow-up data will be collected to ascertain any change(s) in the rate of safe firearm
      storage device use after patients have been treated for a mental health complaint, which
      includes standardized recommendations for safe firearm storage practices. This study also
      involves an intervention to distribute safe firearm storage devices to families of pediatric
      mental health patients during their hospital visit, and assesses whether safe storage device
      distribution impacts reported future rate of firearm safety device use.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Firearm injuries are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality for children and teens.
      Access to firearms has been associated with suicide completion in the pediatric mental health
      population. Current practice in our pediatric Emergency Department (ED) and inpatient
      psychiatric unit is to screen all mental health patients for firearm access, and to recommend
      safe firearm storage practices. However, there is no data on the baseline rate of safe
      firearm storage device use in the homes of these patients, or on the effectiveness of
      providing these recommendations during hospitalization.

      This study has two phases, a baseline and an intervention. During the baseline phase, the
      research team will study whether there is an improvement in safe firearm storage device use
      in the homes of participants 7 or 30 days after safe storage practices are recommended during
      an ED or inpatient psychiatric visit. During the intervention phase, in addition to the
      standard recommendation of safe storage practices during the visit, the research team will
      distribute firearm safety storage devices such as a lock box, trigger lock, and and/or cable
      lock to families at the time of study enrollment. The investigators will study whether there
      is an improvement in safe firearm storage device use in the homes of intervention
      participants after 7 or 30 days compared to the usual care group.
