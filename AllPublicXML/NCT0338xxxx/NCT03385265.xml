  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to develop DIPPer Academy, a family-focused, mobile health
      (mHealth) behavioral intervention to promote glycemic control and type 1 diabetes (T1D)
      adherence in young children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Because many young children with T1D have glucose levels that exceed targets, investigators
      need to develop efficacious, accessible, and readily disseminable interventions to help them
      to improve their glycemic control. To do this, the investigators need efficacious
      interventions that specifically address the challenges that parents of young children face in
      daily T1D management, as well as learning activities that are targeted to the ever evolving
      abilities of young children. Providers need mHealth interventions that minimize barriers that
      families experience when trying to access face-to-face or in clinic interventions. Finally,
      interventions are needed that are packaged to be easily deployable by other diabetes centers.
      The investigator's proposed intervention, DIPPer Academy, will include all of these
      recommended advancements.

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Post-treatment (Week 33)</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using the Behavioral Pediatrics Feeding Assessment Scale. This is a 35 item scale. It contains four subscales: Child Frequency (25-125), Child Problems (0-25), Parent Frequency (10-50), Parent Problem (0-10). All subscales are scored so that higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Post-treatment (Week 33)</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using the Hypoglycemia Fear Survey (HFS-PYC). This is a 26 item measure. It contains two subscales: Behavior (10-50) and Worry (15-75). All subscales are scored so that higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>
