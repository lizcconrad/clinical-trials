      In this single-arm trial we will investigate the safety of short-term preoperative therapy
      with ipilimumab and nivolumab in patients with high-risk resectable urothelial cancer. We
      will determine the number of patients that have surgical resection at &lt;12 weeks, as this is
      an endpoint that is clinically meaningful for this population. 24 patients will be included.
      All patients will be receiving a sequenced scheme of Nivolumab and Ipilimumab.

      This is a Phase Ib single-arm trial to evaluate the safety of short-term preoperative therapy
      with ipilimumab and nivolumab in patients with high-risk resectable urothelial cancer (upper
      urinary tract allowed), defined as:

        -  T3-4aN0 OR

        -  T1, cN+ OR

        -  T1, any N, resectable retroperitoneal lymph node metastasis

      The primary endpoint of this trial is safety. We will determine the number of patients that
      have surgical resection at &lt; 12 weeks, as this is an endpoint that is clinically meaningful
      for this population. patients. Patients will be receiving:

        -  Day 1: Ipilimumab 3 mg/kg (wk1)

        -  Days 22: Ipilimumab 3 mg/kg + Nivolumab 1 mg/kg (wk4)

        -  Day 43: Nivolumab 3 mg/kg (wk 7)

        -  Day 57-71: Radical cystectomy or nefro/ureterectomy with appropriate lymph node
           dissection (wk9-11) In the initial phase, 12 patients will be enrolled and followed
           until resection. If toxicity is manageable, enrolment will continue to a total of 24. CT
           scans will be required at baseline and week 7 to evaluate response to immunotherapy.

      Post-cystectomy, a post-cystectomy study visit including laboratory tests will be performed
      on day 7 to evaluate toxicity. Patients attend their final study visit for physical
      examination and laboratory testing 28 days post-surgery. After this final visit, patients
      will be followed according to standard clinical guidelines. Tumor biopsies/material
      preservation is required at baseline and during surgery.

      An important secondary endpoint is translational. The main testable hypothesis is that a
      significant percentage of nonresponse can be explained by immune-inhibitory processes.
      Absence of immune infiltrates, presence of significant numbers of regulatory T-cells and
      presence of significant numbers of myeloid-derived suppressor cells will be compared between
      responders and nonresponders. The efficacy will be defined as the percentage of pathological
      complete response (pCR) at cystectomy (secondary endpoint).
