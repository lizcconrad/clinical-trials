  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of oxymetazoline HCl cream 1.0% when
      used as an adjunctive treatment to energy-based therapy for participants with moderate to
      severe persistent facial erythema associated with rosacea.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) to Day 56</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administered a medicinal product that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not it is related to the medicinal (investigational) product. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence or effect that, at any dose: Results in death, Is life-threatening, Requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization, Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants with at Least a 1-Grade Worsening from Baseline in the Investigator's Dermal Tolerability Assessment at any Time-point</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) to Day 56</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator will assess dryness and scaling in the treatment area using 4-point scales. Dryness: 0=none (no dryness) to 3=severe (marked roughness). Scaling: 0=none (no peeling) to 3=severe (heavy scale production). The percentage of participants with at least a 1-point worsening (increase) in the score compared to Baseline at any time-point will be reported.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants with at Least a 1-Grade Worsening from Baseline in the Participant's Dermal Tolerability Assessment at any Time-point</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) to Day 56</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator will ask the participant if he or she is experiencing stinging/burning and pruritis/itching using 4-point scales. Stinging/burning: 0=none (no stinging/burning) to 3=severe (Hot, tingling/stinging sensation that has caused definite discomfort). Itching: 0=none (Normal, no itching in the application area) to 3=severe (Definite, continuous discomfort interfering with normal daily activities). The percentage of participants with at least a 1-point worsening (increase) in the score compared to Baseline at any time-point will be reported.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants with at Least a 1-Grade Worsening from Baseline in the Clinician's Telangiectasia Assessment (CTA) at any Time-point</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) to Day 56</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator will assess the overall severity of telangiectasia (spider veins) on the participant's facing using a 5-point scale where 0=Clear skin with no signs of telangiectasia to 4=Severe, with the presence of many visible telangiectasia. The percentage of participants with at least a 1-point worsening (increase) in the score compared to Baseline at any time-point will be reported.</description>
