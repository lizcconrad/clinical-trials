  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on the investigators' preclinical data, the combination of pevonedistat and ruxolitinib
      may provide greater clinical responses in patients with myelofibrosis compared to ruxolitinib
      monotherapy via inhibition of NFκB in addition to JAK-STAT signaling.
