  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Osher Center for Integrative Medicine (OCIM) at Vanderbilt is a multidisciplinary
      outpatient clinic treating patients with chronic pain and complex health issues via
      integrative services, with goals of improving overall health and wellbeing of those served.
      At OCIM, clinical hypnosis has been historically provided on an individual basis by the
      investigator. Due to its impact and increased patient demand for this service, the
      investigator will be conducting group hypnosis services in addition to individual services
      order to expand the reach of this program to participants. As such, the investigators see
      this as a tremendous opportunity to contribute to clinical research to contribute to the
      evidence based for this form of service by examining participant-reported outcomes associated
      with completing the treatment. For this project, the investigators seek to assess the impact
      of a manualized group treatment protocol utilizing clinical hypnosis as a treatment for
      chronic pain. The investigators will be evaluating participant-reported outcomes to assess
      the 1) feasibility of conducting hypnosis in this setting 2) impact of group hypnosis on pain
      and 3) how participants' responsiveness to hypnosis impacts treatment outcome.

    <description>Brief Pain Inventory (severity scale only) is a 4-item subscale of the Brief Pain Inventory assessing the severity of pain over the past week. Questions inquire into an individual's worst, least, average, and current levels of pain on an 11-point likert scale, with 0 being no pain. It has been validated and is considered the gold standard to utilize in patient-reported outcomes studies. It takes &lt;1 minute to complete.</description>
