  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate individuals who are currently experiencing symptoms of
      hypoglycemia, in order to discern correlations between microbiome composition and patterns of
      postprandial glycemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies have shown that analysis of the gastrointestinal microbiome can be used to
      predict glycemic response to dietary intake. Specifically, integrative analysis of dietary
      consumption, anthropometrics, physical activity and gut microbiota composition can be used to
      predict postprandial glycemic excursions. The investigators hypothesize that individualized
      assessment of glycemic responses to food, together with analysis of the gut microbiome, will
      allow the design of a personalized dietary approach to minimize glycemic excursions for
      patients with post-bariatric and other forms of largely postprandial hypoglycemia.
      Identification of factors predictive of glycemic excursions and subsequent hypoglycemia may
      ultimately allow individuals to tailor their diet towards foods which would not induce
      hypersecretion of insulin and subsequent hypoglycemia.

    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of hypoglycemia will be assessed by: (1) the number of minutes per day with hypoglycemia, defined as sensor glucose &lt;70 mg/dl, and (2) the number of minutes per day of severe hypoglycemia, defined as sensor glucose &lt;55 mg/dl. Data will be captured for the entire 24 hour period as well as day and night subsets.</description>

    <measure>Analysis of frequency of glycemic excursions</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Hypoglycemia frequency will be assessed by: (1) number of episodes of hypoglycemia, both moderate (55-70 mg/dl) and severe (&lt;55 mg/dl), (2) number of episodes requiring assistance, and (4) number of episodes of hyperglycemia (&gt;180 mg/dl). All data will be averaged and reported as episodes per day.</description>
