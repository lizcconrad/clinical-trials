  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial is designed to provide proof of concept evidence that combination
      therapy can have a beneficial effect on DME and possibly prevent increases in retinal volume
      or progression of non-central DME into the central subfield of the macula. If a beneficial
      effect is apparent in this phase I/II study involving a relatively small sample size and
      short follow-up period, its results could be used to in plan future phase III trials. We
      believe this study will be the first to show that a systems pharmacology approach can
      successfully address diabetic macular edema, and thus revolutionize the treatment of complex
      retinal diseases for which there are a paucity of effective treatment options.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt;18 years

          -  Type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus

          -  Best corrected visual acuity using the early treatment diabetic retinopathy study
             (ETDRS) visual acuity test letter score ≥ 74 (i.e., 20/32 or better) within 30 days of
             enrollment.

          -  On clinical exam, definite retinal thickening due to DME within 3,000 μm of the center
             of the macula but not involving the 500 μm central subfield.

          -  Thickened non-central macular subfields on the spectral domain OCT macular map

          -  Central subfield thickness within threshold definition for normal central subfield
             thickness

          -  No focal/grid laser within the last 6 months or other treatment for DME within the
