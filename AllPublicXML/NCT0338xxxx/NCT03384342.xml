  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although vitiligo is difficult to cure, recurrences are frequent after treatment, and many
      patients suffer from concerns about recurrence as well as disease. Psoriasis, another
      indication for ultraviolet radiation treatment, has been established that it can safely and
      effectively reduce the recurrence of psoriasis through monthly maintenance therapy.

      The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of Narrow-band UV-B therapy for the
      prevention of relapse in vitiligo.

  <detailed_description>

      For a total period of 12 months, perform Narrow-band UV-B treatment once a month. Check for
      signs of enlarged vitiligo lesions at 3-month intervals for a total period of 12 months.

      An independent evaluator will obtain the score of vitiligo area (Vitiligo Extent Score) from
      comparing clinical photographs of before registration and after the clinical trial, and judge
      whether vitiligo is recurred. This study is a randomized controlled trial, and the
      investigators plan to compare the recurrence rates of the experimental and control groups
      using the Chi-squared test.
