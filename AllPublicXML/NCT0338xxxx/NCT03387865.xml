  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, single-center, interventional study is conducted in order to achieve a
      biological bank accompanied by clinical data. Blood samples, optional tumor tissue and fecal
      samples are collected, processed and banked for all the included subjects. Those samples are
      collected before the start of treatment, at the time of first tumor assessment, at the time
      of first and second disease progression. The subjects are treated according to standard of
      care.

      Clinical data are collected at each sampling time. The primary objective of the study is to
      identify biological, clinical and tumoral factors associated with tumor response according
      SOC treatment.

        The subjects have a lung cancer diagnosis (all stages are eligible) or a suspicion of lung
        cancer ; they are included before any treatment initiation.
