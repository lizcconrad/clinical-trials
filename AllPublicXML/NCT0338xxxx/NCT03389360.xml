      , the study aimed at assessing the frequency of rising procalcitonin associated with
      infectious complications in immunosuppressed LDLTRx.

      All patients transferred from operative theatre to ICU will be sedated, intubated &amp;
      ventilated. They will receive empiric antimicrobial prophylaxis upon admission &amp; early
      immunosuppression according to the clinical practice guidelines in our center, (Appendix 1).

      Preoperative patients' demographic data will be obtained. Model for end-stage liver disease
      (MELD) prior transplant, the primary cause of liver transplant.

      Operative &amp; anesthetic details; operation time, units of blood, blood products transfusion,
      ischemic time, type of preservatives used, back table procedures, extra-hepatic procedure &amp;
      graft to recipient weight ratio will be recorded.

      Postoperative patient evaluation will include; Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) on
      admission &amp; /48h. Hemodynamic monitoring will include hourly measurement of heart rate, mean
      arterial pressure (MAP), temperature, central venous pressure (CVP), arterial oxygen
      saturation (SaO2), daily total volume of fluid infused, urine output, fluid balance daily,
      blood gases / 6h &amp; daily mean values will be recorded till hospital discharge.

      Routine laboratory workup includes biochemical markers of liver, kidney function and
      hematological parameters (complete blood count &amp; coagulation profile).

      Patient evaluation for infection will be done through scheduled measurements of PCT every
      other day during ICU stay &amp; upon needed during the hospital stay. Other markers of infections
      will be measured till hospital discharge as C-reactive protein (CRP) every other day, daily
      total leukocyte count (TLC) &amp; band cells %.

      Microbiological evidence of infection will be confirmed by cultures that will be regularly
      sampled every other day during ICU stay &amp; upon any clinical or laboratory biomarker
      suggestive of infection.

      Management of suspected infection; when PCT value rising with clinical, radiological &amp;/or
      laboratory evidence of infection (TLC, CRP, band%), culture from suspected site of infection
      will be withdrawn. If the source of infection is not evident, cultures from; blood, urine,
      sputum, surgical wound, drain &amp; nasal swab will be withdrawn &amp; empiric antimicrobial against
      gram +ve bacteria will be initiated. While the management of proven infection will be culture
      based antimicrobial initiation.
