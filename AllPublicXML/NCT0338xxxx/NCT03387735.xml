  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple chronic conditions are common and expensive among patients aged ≥65 and are
      associated with lower quality of life, poorer response to treatment, worse medical and
      psychiatric outcomes, higher mortality, and higher costs of care.

      The primary purpose of this study is to conduct a randomized clinical trial (RCT) to examine
      the effects of C-CHESS--a web-based intervention--on health outcomes and healthcare use among
      older adults with several chronic health conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure,
      high cholesterol, COPD, BMI over 30, congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease,
      arrhythmia/atrial fibrillation, chronic pain, arthritis.

      The investigator's hypothesis is that patients assigned to TAU+C-CHESS will have better
      quality of life and fewer primary care visits than those assigned to TAU+Internet.

    <description>The investigator's hypothesis is that participants assigned to TAU+C-CHESS will have better quality of life than those assigned to TAU+Internet. The investigators will be measuring the quality of life using PROMIS Global Health (10) SF to see if there are any changes to the quality of life reported in the baseline survey, 6, 12, 18 month follow-up surveys.</description>

    <description>The investigator's hypothesis is that participants assigned to TAU+C-CHESS will have less primary care use (fewer visits) than those assigned to TAU+Internet. The investigators will be measuring the use of health services to see if there are any changes to their visits to primary care clinic, emergency room, urgent care clinic and specialty care visits as reported in the baseline survey, 6, 12, 18 month follow-up surveys.</description>

    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator's hypothesis is that participants assigned to TAU+C-CHESS will have improved individual condition outcomes such as hypertension than participants assigned to TAU+Internet. The investigators will look at the hypertension level using a data pull from the participants' medical records to see if there are any changes in their millimeters of mercury (mm Hg).</description>

    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator's hypothesis is that participants assigned to TAU+C-CHESS will have improved individual condition outcomes such as hyperlipidemia (LDL) than participants assigned to TAU+Internet. The investigators will be looking at the LDL level using a data pull from the participants' medical records to see if there are any changes in their LDL (bad cholesterol) in their blood.</description>

The investigators will be looking at the HbA1c level using a data pull from the participants' medical records to see if there are any changes in their HbA1c level.</description>

The investigators will be looking at the pain score using a data pull from the participants' medical records to see if there are any changes in their pain level.</description>

    <description>For the patient, C-CHESS provides tools, motivation, and social support to help them manage their specific set of chronic conditions and communicate with peers and their primary care physician.
For the clinic, C-CHESS has a Clinician Report (CR), a visual dashboard of health-tracking data that can be customized based on the needs of the clinic. The CR provides alerts to the clinician when a patient passes a certain threshold. The dashboard is intended to help clinicians prepare for patient office visits.</description>
