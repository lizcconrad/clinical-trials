    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies whether using high throughput drug sensitivity and genomics
      data is feasible in developing individualized treatment in patients with multiple myeloma or
      plasma cell leukemia that has come back or does not respond to treatment. High throughput
      screen tests many different drugs that kill multiple myeloma cells in individual chambers at
      the same time. Matching a drug or drug combination to a patient using high throughput screen
      and genetic information may improve the ability to help patients by choosing drugs that work
      well for their disease.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the frequency of obtaining an actionable result from the assay and to estimate
      feasibility as defined as a frequency of at least 50%.

      II. To test patient cells in a high-throughput assay against individual drugs and drug
      combinations within 21 days, to enable optimal choice of drug combinations for therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the response rate among patients treated after physicians are presented with the
      testing results.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo collection of bone marrow aspirate and blood for high-throughput drug
      sensitivity assay and mutational analysis using next generation sequencing. Patients and
      their treating physicians receive the results of the tests. Treatment decisions are then made
      by the patients and their treating physicians.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.
