      This is a prospective, observational, non-interventional study. The purpose of this study is
      to evaluate the stool consistency and variability in fecal microbiota composition, diversity,
      and abundance of defined taxa in 75 healthy, term, exclusively breastfed infants. All
      enrolled infants will participate in the trial for approximately 169 days.
