  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of this study are: 18F-THK5351 PET(Positron Emission Tomography) can defect the tau
      burden in PSP(Progressive Supranuclear Palsy) and CBS (Corticobasal syndrome)correlating with
      the known NFT(neurofibrillary tangles) topology of those diseases, 18F-THK5351 PET will
      differentiate subjects with suspected tauopathy due to PSP and CBS from subjects with
      suspected synucleinopathy due to idiopathic PD(Parkinson's disease). The distribution of
      PHF(paired helical filament) tau burden will correlate with specific motor and cognitive
      features of PSP and CBS; and regional PHF tau burden will be associated with cortical
      thinning. Together, these efforts will establish the potential for developing 18F-THK5351 PET
      imaging as a biomarker and diagnostic tool for the parkinsonian tauopathies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. 20 subjects with a diagnosis of PD whom must:

               -  Age ranges from 20-80 years

               -  Patients should be fulfilled &quot;UK(United Kingdom ) Parkinson's Disease Society
                  Brain Bank Criteria for the diagnosis of PD&quot;, 2.11.1 Appendix I, (27)

               -  Patients who provide a written informed consent prior to study entry. If the
                  patient is incapable of informed consent, the caregiver may consent on behalf of
                  the patient (the patient must still confirm assent).

          2. 20 subjects with a diagnosis of PSP whom must:

               -  Age ranges from 20-80 years

               -  Patients fulfill the criteria of NINDS-SPSP(National Institute of Neurological
                  Disorders and Stroke / Society for PSP) clinical criteria for the diagnosis of
                  PSP &quot;as possible&quot; or &quot;probably&quot; PSP, 2.11.2 Appendix II, (28)

               -  Patients who provide a written informed consent prior to study entry. If the
                  patient is incapable of informed consent, the caregiver may consent on behalf of
                  the patient (the patient must still confirm assent).

          3. 20 subjects with a diagnosis of CBS whom must:

               -  Age ranges from 20-80 years

               -  Patients should be fulfilled the &quot;Mayo Clinic proposed criteria for the diagnosis
                  for corticobasal syndrome&quot; , 2.11.3 Appendix III, (29)

               -  Patients who provide a written informed consent prior to study entry. If the
                  patient is incapable of informed consent, the caregiver may consent on behalf of
                  the patient (the patient must still confirm assent).

        Exclusion Criteria:

             devices.

             hepatic failure, prominent strokes, acute myocardial infarction, poorly controlled
             diabetes, previous head injury, intracranial operation, hypoxia, sepsis or severe

             aminotransferase)] and alanine aminotransferase [ALT(Alanine aminotransferase)] â‰§ 3X(3
