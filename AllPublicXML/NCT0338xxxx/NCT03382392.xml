    <textblock>
      Introduction: About 50-60% of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by
      hypermetabolism, defined as 10% or more excess resting energy expenditure (REE) compared to
      theoretical values. Harris and Benedict's (HB) formula is the equation mainly used to predict
      REE, but others are also applied in current practice. The present study aimed to assess REE
      in ALS patients compared to control populations and to compare six formulas commonly used to
      predict REE.

      Nutritional assessments were performed in ALS patients and in two control populations without
      hypermetabolism: healthy elderly people (control 1) and patients with non-restrictive-eating
      disorders (control 2). Weight, height and body composition (by bioimpedance analysis) were
      assessed.

      EE was measured (mREE) by indirect calorimetry and calculated (cREE) using HB 1919 and 1984,
      World Schofield, De Lorenzo, Johnstone and Mifflin formulas. Mann-Whitney and Chi2 tests were
      used to compare the equations.
