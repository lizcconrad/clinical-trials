  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the feasibility of using patient-centered, commercial off-the-shelf
      (COTS) health information technology (IT) solutions to collect patient generated health data
      (PGHD) and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) from diverse, low-income disadvantaged
      populations. These data will then be mapped and reported in a way that will allow them to be
      made actionable and used to improve health care quality and delivery. The data mapping will
      be designed for data collection through technology such as mobile apps and wearables, and
      will be intended to support integration into interoperable electronic health records (EHRs),
      clinical information systems, and big data infrastructures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patient engagement is particularly critical to achieving good chronic disease
      self-management. This is especially important for disadvantaged patients, who are
      disproportionately affected by chronic disease. A key component of chronic disease
      self-management is the ability for patients to record and monitor their ongoing performance
      on indicator measures. While health IT solutions have been shown to improve chronic disease
      self-management, adoption and use of costly, specialized technologies among disadvantaged
      patients is lower than among higher-income populations. In contrast, COTS technologies such
      as mobile phones are more accessible to and widely adopted by disadvantaged patients, thus
      bridging the gap of the digital divide.

      The central research hypothesis posits that 1) low-income, disadvantaged patients both can
      and will provide high quality PGHD and PROs through COTS-based health IT solutions, and 2)
      these data can be integrated into clinical systems and used to improve health care quality
      and delivery. PGHD can be collected through patient interaction with COTS health IT solutions
      such as mobile health apps and fitness trackers. PROs can be collected via patient response
      to questionnaire-based PROs measures, or PROMs. These data can be transmitted to clinical
      information systems, integrated into clinical workflows and used by providers to improve
      health care quality and delivery. Using a sequential integrated mixed-methods approach, we
      propose to test the central hypothesis through three specific aims, as follows:

      Aim 1: To assess the needs and preferences of disadvantaged patients and safety net health
      care providers regarding the use of health IT for communicating PGHD and PROs.

      Aim 1 Research Questions: What specific features in COTS solutions meet the needs and
      preferences of disadvantaged patients for communicating PGHD and PROs to their providers?
      What PGHD and PROs are deemed most important by providers and patients for improving health
      care and health outcomes?

      Answering these questions will inform health IT solution selection, design, usability, and
      utility; assist with prioritizing PGHD and PROs collection by data element and measure type;
      and identify potential discrepancies between patients' and providers' perceptions of PGHD and
      PROs importance.

      Aim 2: To demonstrate the feasibility of PGHD and PROs collection through COTS health IT
      solutions in a patient-centered pilot intervention for weight management among disadvantaged
      patients.

      Aim 2 Hypothesis: Providing PGHD and PROs through COTS solutions will improve engagement
      among disadvantaged patients. Secondary outcomes include improving key health indicators
      (e.g., weight, physical activity) and PROMs (e.g., quality of life, mental health symptoms).

      Weight management is important in delaying, averting, and reducing the effects of multiple
      chronic diseases, including diabetes, hypertension, and obesity. A weight management-related
      intervention also serves as an effective test of PGHD and PROMs collection, due to the
      existence of numerous COTS solutions which use different methods for tracking common data
      elements related to weight, physical activity, and fitness.

      Aim 3: To create an ontology mapping and set of interoperability resources which can be used
      to support integration of PGHD and PRO into clinical information systems.

      Aim 3 Hypothesis: PGHD and PROs can be characterized by distinct types, elements, and
      structures which, once described, may be modeled and mapped to existing vocabularies for
      health data management.

      In order to make PGHD and PROs actionable, these data must be integrated into clinical
      information systems such as electronic health records (EHRs) where it can be used by
      clinicians in their practice. Creating a &quot;translation&quot; by matching PGHD and PROs data
      elements to comparable ones in existing clinical vocabularies will provide a tool to support
      future data integration into the EHR. Creating a resource set which can be used with multiple
      EHRs will improve the generalizability and broad usability of the ontology mapping tool.

    <intervention_model_description>Recruited participants will be randomized to one of two arms, intervention or control. Both intervention and control groups will engage in a 16-week program where they will receive regular health promotion messaging about (a) food, nutrition, and diet; and (b) exercise and physical activity. Intervention patients will be asked to track patient generated health data elements related to weight management through a mobile health app loaded on their phones and/or through using a fitness tracker, depending on patient preference, and to share that information with the research team. Intervention patients will also be asked to provide answers to patient-reported outcomes measures on a weekly basis. If intervention patients do not have a fitness tracker, a low-cost option will be provided for them. Both iOS and Android phone options will be supported. The app will be selected from a limited set of well-established options such as LoseIt!, MyFitnessPal, Apple Health, or Google Fit.</intervention_model_description>

    <ipd_description>An enhanced entity-relationship (EER) model will be created for the PGHD elements and PROMs used in the study. Knowledge representation techniques will be utilized to describe the model in ontological terms. Concepts from the UMLS Metathesaurus will be used to create a mapping to the SNOMED-CT clinical vocabulary. Modeled information will be structured using Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (FHIR) standards and packaged as a set of FHIR resources. Each FHIR resource includes: 1) common definitions and representations; 2) a common metadata set; and 3) a human-readable part to aid user interpretation. Products will include a detailed EER schema, an interface and requirements assessment, an ontology, and a list of UMLS concepts and SNOMED-CT terms used in ontology mapping.</ipd_description>
