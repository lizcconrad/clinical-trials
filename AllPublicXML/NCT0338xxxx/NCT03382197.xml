  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by a poorly reversible airway
      obstruction and consequent systemic manifestations. Its high prevalence and high number of
      diagnosed patients has become a challenge for health services due to the costs of diagnosis
      and treatment of these patients. Positive pressure and aerosol therapy are preferred
      therapies for the management of COPD symptoms, but their effects when associated are poorly
      studied. The objective of this study is to compare the effects of different positive pressure
      strategies associated with aerosol therapy through Pulmonary Scintigraphy and Electrical
      Impedance Tomography (EIT) in patients with COPD in the intercrise period. This is a
      randomized, crossover, blinded and allocated crossover type clinical trial in which patients
      with moderate to severe COPD will be allocated to three intervention groups with different
      strategies for positive pressure associated with aerosol therapy: control group 1
      nebulization), group 2 nebulization with EPAP valve and group 3 nebulization with NIV
      bi-level pressure mode. The radioaerosol deposition pattern will be evaluated through
      Pulmonary Scintigraphy and regional pulmonary ventilation through EIT.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients will be randomized regarding the order of intervention they will receive:
Group 1 - control intervention, will only perform nebulization; Group 2 - intervention, will perform nebulization associated with positive expiratory pressure valve in the airways (EPAP); Group 3 - intervention, will perform nebulization associated with non-invasive ventilation Bi-level mode;
All patients will be evaluated BEFORE, DURING and AFTER each intervention through Electrical Impedance Tomography, Pulmonary Scintigraphy and Spirometry.</intervention_model_description>
