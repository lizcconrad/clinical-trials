  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there are no cures or disease modifying therapies for Parkinson's disease (PD).
      This is partially due to the inability to detect the disease before it has progressed to a
      stage where there are clinical manifestations. The identification and validation of high
      throughput biomarkers to measure disease progression (as well as identify pre-clinical
      disease onset) is critical to the development of disease-modifying or even preventative
      therapies. In this study, we are testing a blood biomarker for PD. Several detection
      parameters will be assessed through enrollment of healthy volunteers over 50 years of age to
      learn more about the analytical process and biological variability.
