      The purpose of this study is verify the efficacy and safety of Human Umbilical Cord
      Mesenchymal Stem Cells (UC-MSC) therapy for patients with Osteoarthritis, and in addition,
      provide basis for exploring the treatment regimen of UC-MSC therapy in different degree of
      cartilage defect disease

      This is a random, open label, and parallel controled experiment. All patients are selected
      and sign consent forms, then divided into 3 groups. Doctors collect the basic information of
      patient. All patients receive laboratory and image examination as baseline. Then, they will
      give cell treatment based on the clinical protocol. Doctors have follow-up visit on 2 weeks,
      1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment, and do safety and efficacy evaluation.

      Safety evaluation. Researcher collect all examination data of patients and compare with each
      groups. The safety tests including blood routine, urine routine, hepatorenal function, C
      reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and tumor marker, etc.

      Efficacy evaluation. Based on Lysholm, the international knee documentation committee (IKDC)
      knee evaluation form, and Visual Analogue Scale/Score (VAS) to examine the change/improvement
      of knee joint function. By Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) examination, grade patients with
      Kellgren-Lawrence Grading Scale, Assessment of Preoperative Cartilage Defect Severity
      (AMADEUS), and observe the change/improvement of patient.

    <description>Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) examination, and based on the images of bilateral knee joint, grade by Kellgren-Lawrence Grading Scale. Kellgren-Lawrence Grading Scale is a method of classifying the severity of knee osteoarthritis (OA).
Grade 0: No radiographic features of osteoarthritis; Grade 1: Possible joint space narrowing (normal joint space is at least 2 mm at the superior acetabulum) and osteophyte formation; Grade 2: Definite osteophyte formation with possible joint space narrowing; Grade 3: Multiple osteophytes, definite joint space narrowing, sclerosis and possible bony deformity; Grade 4: Large osteophytes, marked joint space narrowing, severe sclerosis and definite bony deformity.</description>
