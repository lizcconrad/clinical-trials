  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to test the feasibility and acceptability of a six-month
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) program (group based and phone-based) compared with usual
      care, and to determine if the intervention can improve cognitive performance and reduce
      chronic stress in a randomized trial including 60 African American patients with Mild
      Cognitive Impairment (MCI). The CBT program among African Americans with MCI will provide
      preliminary evidence about the efficacy and the optimal intensity of the intervention needed
      for patients at risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) can involve problems with memory, language, thinking and
      judgment that are greater than normal age-related changes and it maybe a precursor for
      Alzheimer's disease. African Americans have a higher risk of developing MCI compared with
      Whites. Unfortunately, prevention and management of MCI has been understudied among
      African-Americans. Chronic stress (such as perceived discrimination, daily environmental
      stress) in African Americans can affect cognition and also plays a role in worsening of
      unhealthy behaviors such as smoking, improper diet and physical inactivity.
      Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a collaborative psychological approach that addresses
      the interaction between people's thoughts, feelings and behavior. Existing evidence suggests
      that CBT can be an effective strategy for dementia patients with co-morbid anxiety. However,
      none of these studies have specifically evaluated African Americans with MCI. The aim of the
      study is to test the feasibility and acceptability of a six-month CBT program (group based
      and phone-based) compared with usual care, and to determine if the intervention can improve
      cognitive performance and reduce chronic stress in a randomized trial including 60 African
      American patients with MCI. The CBT program among African Americans with MCI will provide
      preliminary evidence about the efficacy and the optimal intensity of the intervention needed
      for patients at risk of Alzheimer's disease.

    <measure>Change in attitudes of patients regarding a CBT intervention for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 and 6 months follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Semi-structured interviews will be used to assess attitudes of patients. The questions in each will be designed to examine attitudes towards the diagnosis of MCI, CBT approach for prevention, effectiveness of the intervention. Trained staff will conduct the focus group interviews, audiotaped (with the permission of participants) and transcribed verbatim. The ATLAS.ti software will be used to retrieve all quotations in a code category for comparison and refinement.</description>

    <measure>Change in C-reactive protein level</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 and 6 months follow up</time_frame>
    <description>C-reactive protein (CRP) is a blood test marker for inflammation in the body. CRP is produced in the liver and its level is measured by testing blood.</description>

    <measure>Change in the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CESD-R) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 and 6 months follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The CESD-R is a screening test for depression and depressive disorder. The CESD-R measures symptoms defined by the American Psychiatric Association' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-V) for a major depressive episode. Response options range from 0 to 3 for each item (0 = Rarely or None of the Time, 1 = Some or Little of the Time, 2 = Moderately or Much of the time, 3 = Most or Almost All the Time). Scores range from 0 to 60, with high scores indicating greater depressive symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 and 6 months follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The questions in the PSS ask about feelings and thoughts during the last month. In each case, respondents are asked how often they felt a certain way. PSS scores are obtained by reversing responses (e.g., 0 = 4, 1 = 3, 2 = 2, 3 = 1 &amp; 4 = 0) to the four positively stated items (items 4, 5, 7, &amp; 8) and then summing across all 10 scale items.</description>

    <measure>Change in the quality of life scale (36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36)) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 and 6 months follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability.</description>

    <measure>Change in Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 and 6 months follow up</time_frame>
    <description>PROMIS has self-reported health measures in the domains of physical health, mental health and social health. Under each main domain (physical health, mental health, social health) are sub-domains associated with symptoms, function, affect, behavior, cognition, relationships or function.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in activities of daily living (ADL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 and 6 months follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Activities of daily living include: walking, bathing, dressing, toileting, brushing teeth, and eating. Participants are scored yes/no for independence in each of the six functions. A score of 6 indicates full function, 4 indicates moderate impairment, and 2 or less indicates severe functional impairment.</description>

    <measure>Change in Instrumental activities of daily living (IADL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 and 6 months follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Instrumental activities of daily living are the activities that support an independent life style. They include: cooking, driving, using the telephone or computer, housekeeping, laundry, shopping, keeping track of finances, managing medication. IADLs are scored based on what an individual can do rather than what he/she is doing.</description>
