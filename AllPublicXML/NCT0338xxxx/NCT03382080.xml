  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drop out from upper secondary school represents a risk for the future health and wellbeing of
      young people. Strengthening of psychosocial aspects of the learning environment may be an
      effective strategy to promote completion of upper secondary school. The COMPLETE study is a
      school based cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating two school-based
      interventions, namely the Dream School Program (DSP) and the Mental Health Support Team
      (MHST) among 1st grade upper secondary school students in four counties in Norway. The
      interventions aim to improve psychosocial learning environments and subsequently school
      achievements and decrease drop-out and absence.

      Specifically, the COMPLETE study will

        1. Evaluate whether the DSP alone

             1. increases completion

             2. increases presence

             3. improves school achievements

             4. improves mental health and wellbeing

        2. Evaluate whether the DSP and the MHST combined

             1. increase completion

             2. increase presence

             3. improve school achievements

             4. improve mental health and wellbeing

           The COMPLETE study will also evaluate the effect of the DSP and MHST combined and the
           DSP alone against secondary outcomes of school satisfaction and loneliness.

        3. Evaluate through a process evaluation whether the interventions were implemented in line
           with guidelines for each of the interventions, and whether the degree of program
           fidelity has influenced the effect of the interventions on the primary and secondary
           outcomes.
