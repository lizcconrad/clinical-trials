  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since exogenous surfactant replacement therapy was first used to prevent neonatal respiratory
      distress syndrome (NRDS)，it has become the main method of treatment of NRDS. However, in some
      infants, death is inevitable despite intensive care and surfactant replacement therapy,
      especially in near-term and term infants. The first goal of our study is to compare the
      therapeutic effect of pulmonary surfactant of infants at different gestational ages and to
      investigate whether exogenous surfactant replacement therapy is effective for all newborns
      with RDS. The second goal of our study is to further analyze the risk factors and causes of
      RDS in early preterm infants and near term/term infants.
