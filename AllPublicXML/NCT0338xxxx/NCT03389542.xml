  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Degenerative mitral regurgitation (MR) due to leaflet prolapse is frequent and can be
      surgically repaired in the vast majority of patients. Despite the efficacy of mitral valve
      repair, an ongoing international controversy exists regarding the need to perform early
      surgery in asymptomatic patients with severe MR and no sign of LV dysfunction in whom the
      probability of successful and durable repair is very high. In this group of patients,
      differing views of the risks of uncorrected severe MR exist: considered as benign by those
      supporting medical &quot;watchful waiting&quot; or associated with significant excess
      mortality/morbidity by those advocating early surgery. This controversy can only be resolved
      by a randomized controlled trial which is still lacking.

      The main objective is to demonstrate the superiority of early mitral valve repair in patients
      with asymptomatic severe MR due to leaflet prolapse compared to an initial conservative
      management in terms of all-cause death and cardiovascular morbidity during five years
      follow-up.

      Experimental group: In patients randomized to early mitral valve repair, surgery will be
      performed within 3 months after randomization. Clinical interview will be performed at
      discharge, at 6 months and afterwards yearly until the end of follow-up. Echocardiography
      will be performed at discharge, at 6 months and at the end of follow-up.

      Control group: Patients randomized to initial conservative management will be followed up by
      clinical interview and echocardiography every 6 months. Patients will be instructed to report
      any change in functional status in a prompt manner. Surgery will be indicated at the onset of
      symptoms or if one or more of the following occur during follow-up: LV end-systolic diameter
      &gt;40mm, LV ejection fraction &lt;60%, recurrent atrial fibrillation, or resting systolic
      pulmonary artery pressure &gt;50mmHg.
