  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to evaluate the effects of vitamin A supplementation program on the vitamin A
      status of preschool children. All children aged 3-5 years who do not have severe illness and
      are not planning to move from the study area are eligible. Children whose caregivers agree to
      sign the consent form will be enrolled in their community and submitted to a longitudinal
      evaluation of vitamin A status before and after vitamin A supplementation campaign.

      Vitamin A status will be assessed by measuring serum retinol, retinol binding protein and
      vitamin A total body pool size using stable isotope dilution methodology.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Five months after the last supplementation (day 0), an oral dose (2 mg retinol equivalents)
      of label vitamin A ([2H8]-retinyl acetate) in oil will be administered to 80 eligible
      children together with a low vitamin A high-fat snack. Fasting venous blood samples (about 7
      ml) will be collected into evacuated foil-wrapped blood collection tubes specifically
      designed for the collection of serum (containing no anticoagulant and metal free) on the
      mornings of days 0 before the administration of the dose and on day 14 for quantitative
      estimation of initial vitamin A pool size and determination of potential confounding
      parameters (CRP, AGP, iron, zinc, malaria, carotenoids and retinoids). About six months after
      the last supplementation (day 30), each child will received the vitamin A supplement. After
      30 days and 90 days, two groups of 40 children (Grp1, Grp2) will respectively received a
      second dose of labeled vitamin A ([2H4]-retinyl acetate); fasting venous blood samples will
      be obtained before the administration of the dose and 14 days after dosing for quantitative
      estimation of final vitamin A pool size and determination of potential confounding
      parameters.
