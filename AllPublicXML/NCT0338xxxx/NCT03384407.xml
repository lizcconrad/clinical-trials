      The pilot study has two objectives: 1) to assess the post-infusion viability of INTERCEPT RBC
      by measuring the 24 hour post-infusion recovery (&quot;PTR24&quot;) and lifespan of autologous RBCs
      prepared with the INTERCEPT System for RBC after storage for 35 days under standard blood
      banking conditions using two different RBC labels; 51-chromium and biotin. The control will
      be conventional untreated RBCs stored for 35 days; and 2) comparison and contrast of PTR24
      and lifespan results of the 51-chromium and biotin labeling methods of RBC stored for 35 days
      under standard blood banking conditions. The purpose of gathering these data is to obtain
      more meaningful survival data for stored conventional and INTERCEPT RBCs over the entire 120
      d RBC lifespan (51-Cr labeled RBC permits a maximum 28 d assessment as a result of 51-Cr's
      variable, progressive elution from RBC and radioactive half-life).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each subject will receive one infusion of autologous, radiolabeled and BioRBC labeled
      INTERCEPT RBCs (Test RBCs) and one infusion of autologous BioRBC labeled untreated RBCs
      (Control RBCs) concomitantly. Each infusion will be approximately 20 mL, i.e., 10 mL of
      51-chromium labeled RBC, and 10 mL of either BioRBC-6 or BioRBC-18 which will be stratified
      as indicated above based on the Test or Control designation.

      Treatment Compliance Healthy subjects who understand the study commitments and sign the
      informed consent will be enrolled in the study. Treatment compliance and follow-up testing
      will be tracked by the Investigator, recorded on the case report form (CRF), and monitored by
      the Sponsor.

      ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY

      Efficacy Parameters

      Efficacy endpoints include the following:

      Primary Efficacy Endpoint(24)

      - 24 hour post-infusion recovery of autologous RBC stored in AS-5 for 35 days and then
      labeled with either 51Cr or biotin.

      Secondary Efficacy Endpoints(25)

        -  Mean lifespan of autologous RBC stored for 35 days and then labeled with either 51Cr or
           biotin

        -  Median lifespan (T50) of autologous RBC stored for 35 days and then labeled with either
           51Cr or biotin

        -  Area under the curve (AUC) determined using data points collected forRBC lifespan of
           autologous, radiolabeled or BioRBCs

           e) Dose determination and duration

      Methods and Timing of Efficacy Parameters This study consists of a single treatment period
      where Control biotinylated (using a RBC surface density of 6 or 18 mcg of sulfo-NHS-biotin
      per mL RBC) are administered, i.e., co-infused at a single point in time with Test
      INTERCEPT-treated biotinylated RBC (using a concentration of 18 or 6 mcg of sulfo-NHS-biotin
      per mL RBC) and INTERCEPT-treated, radiolabeled (51Cr) RBC. All 6 subjects will receive both
      control and S-303-treated (test) RBCs concomitantly and the only difference between the two
      sets of 3 subjects will be the level of biotinylation of the control or test RBC.

      The study is stratified and control or test RBC will be labeled alternatively with either 6
      or 18 mcg of sulfo-NHS-biotin per mL RBC. RBC from three individuals (subjects 1, 3 and 5)
      will be labeled with 6 and 18 mcg of sulfo-NHS-biotin per mL RBC for control and test RBC,
      respectively. Other three individuals (subjects 2, 4 and 6) will be labeled with 6 and 18 mcg
      of sulfo-NHS-biotin per mL RBC for Control and Test RBC, respectively. The objective of this
      stratification is to ensure that no bias is introduced by the biotin label density into one
      of the arms of the study.

      f) Description of observations and measurements

      On Day 0 of each treatment period the subject will donate two units of packed RBC (double RBC
      automatized donation, Trima - Terumo BCT apheresis system); the units will be leukocyte
      reduced by in-line filtration and the RBC concentrates will be prepared in additive solution
      (AS-5).

      One of the two units will be stored immediately at 1-6ÂºC for 35 days (Control unit). This
      conventional RBC component represents the Control RBCs in this study.

      The Test RBC unit will be prepared by processing using the INTERCEPT Blood System for Red
      Blood Cells. In vitro biochemical and morphological parameters of the study RBC components
      (Table 1) will be measured on Day 0 after preparation of RBC concentrates in AS-5 (prior to
      study treatment), post processing and prior to storage (Test only), and again on Day 35
      (prior to infusion back in to study subjects) to evaluate the RBC quality of the
      processed/stored RBC units. The data collected for the in vitro characteristics will be
      summarized using descriptive statistics.

      Table 1. Biochemical parameters analyzed on day 0 and day 35 of storage of control- and
      treated RBC units.

      (extracellular) Bicarbonate (extracellular) Sodium (extracellular) Potassium (extracellular)

      On Day 35 of RBC storage each treatment period, an aliquot of Control RBCs will be
      biotinylated (6 or 18 mcg/mL). From the Test unit, two aliquots will be drawn; the first
      aliquot will be radiolabeled with 51Cr and the second aliquot will be biotinylated at 6 or 18
      mcg/mL. Re-infusion of the two biotinylated autologous RBC (Control and Test) specimens along
      with the 51Cr labeled autologous RBC (Test) will measure recovery and survival (approximately
      total: 20 mcCi). Also on Day 35, a 20 mL sample of fresh blood will be drawn from the subject
      and the RBCs labeled with 99mTc and Bio-54. Re-infusion of the fresh 99mTc RBC and fresh
      Bio-54 will allow determination of subject blood volume or number of circulating RBC.

      Five types of RBC will be mixed and infused: a) fresh RBC labeled with 99mTc and BioRBC-54;
      b) fresh Bio-54 labeled RBC; c) Stored, Control or Test RBC biotinylated at density 6 mcg/mL;
      d) Stored, Test or Control RBC biotinylated at density 18 mcg/mL; and, e) Stored, Test, RBC
      labeled with 51Cr. All aliquots will be labeled separately and mixed for a volume of ~50 mL.
      The 50 mL of autologous RBCs will be infused through a peripheral vein using an 18-19 gauge
      butterfly needle (at an approximate rate of 5 mL/min).

      Blood samples, from the subject's contralateral arm, will be collected immediately
      pre-infusion and at 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, 15, 20, 30 minutes and 24 hours after completion of the
      infusion to permit extrapolation to T=0 for 51Cr determination of blood volume as previously
      published by our group (16, 17, 26-30).

      Additional blood samples will be collected at 48 and 72 hours and 7 days post-infusion, and
      then weekly through 28 days (days 37, 38, 42, 49, 56 and 63 post-infusion) and bi-weekly from
      then on (days 77, 91, 105, 119, 133, 147). After collection of the final blood sample in
      Treatment Period 2, subjects will be discharged from the study.

      Upon completion of the study, each of the 6 subjects will have provided 2 units of whole
      blood and receive 1 infusion of autologous radiolabeled Test or Control RBCs and 1 infusion
      of autologous radiolabeled Control or Test RBCs.

      The study assessments used to evaluate both efficacy and safety are presented below (Section

           ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY The timing of study safety assessments is presented in the Table.

           Safety Parameters

           Safety endpoints include the following:

           Primary Safety Endpoint

             -  Incidence of antibody specific to INTERCEPT treated RBCs

             -  Incidence of antibody specific to biotinylated RBCs Secondary Safety Endpoint

             -  Incidence of adverse and severe adverse events as described below in the section
                titled, &quot;Recording and Reporting Adverse Events.&quot; The INTERCEPT Treatment System
                medical device will be monitored for device deficiencies, including malfunctions
                and adverse device effects.

           Methods and Timing of Safety Parameters In this study, the Sponsor/Investigator, J.A.
           Cancelas, will collect and record adverse events (AEs) for 24 hours following collection
           of each whole blood unit and for 24 hours following each infusion of study RBCs. Serious
           adverse events (SAE) will be collected and recorded from the time the first unit of
           whole blood is collected until the completion of the study (Table).

           Subjects will be actively monitored for AEs during blood collection and during the study
           RBC infusions, and until they are discharged. After discharge, all AEs reported to the
           qualified study staff will be recorded. AE and SAE data may be collected by phone or in
           person by study staff. Vital signs are collected prior to and following each study
           infusion. In the event that a subject develops within 24 hours after a study RBC
           transfusion post-infusion fever, defined as a temperature &gt;39Â°C or a temperature &gt;38Â°C
           with shaking chills (rigors) or signs and symptoms consistent with bacterial sepsis, the
           subject's blood will be cultured and the Blood Center will be notified to culture the
           RBCs remaining in a segment or the residual Test or Control RBC components.

           Our group will test subject serum or plasma for antibody specific to INTERCEPT RBCs and
           BioRBC; these samples will be obtained from each subject pre-infusion, 14 days after
           infusion, and 28 days after infusion and monthly thereafter to study day 147 (see
           Table). If an antibody specific to INTERCEPT treated RBCs is identified, samples will be
           sent to an independent laboratory for confirmation (the UCLA/American Red Cross,
           Pomona). Blood samples for hematology and chemistry panels will be obtained from each
           subject Study Days: pre-infusion (day 35), 24 hours after the infusion (day 36), 56 days
           after infusion (day 91) and 112 days after infusion (day 147, at the end of the study).
           Clinically significant laboratory findings will be recorded as adverse events. The
           laboratory assessments are identified in the Table 1.

           Transfusion Reactions Although transfusion reactions are unlikely due to the small
           infusion volume, clinically significant transfusion reactions will be recorded as
           adverse events.

           Suspected Transfusion Related Sepsis Subjects will be monitored for infusion-related
           adverse events including infusion-related sepsis following the study infusion. To
           provide an unaltered sample of the blood infusate aliquot transfused into a subject, the
           remainder of this aliquot will be sent for bacterial culture.

           In the event that a subject develops post-infusion fever, defined as a temperature &gt;39Â°C
           or a temperature &gt;38Â°C with shaking chills (rigors) or signs and symptoms consistent
           with bacterial sepsis within 24 hours after a study RBC infusion, the subject's blood
           will be cultured and the remaining stored component will be cultured.

           Cultures will be performed by investigators at the Hoxworth Blood Center according to
           standard operating procedures at the Hoxworth Blood Center. If bacteria are recovered
           from both the patient's blood and the RBC component, samples of the isolates will be
           sent to the University of Cincinnati Hospital laboratory to determine if the recovered
           organisms are identical. Infusion-induced sepsis will not be established unless the same
           organism(s) is recovered from both the RBC component and from the study subject.

           Detection and Confirmation of Antibody Specific to INTERCEPT RBCs Although not
           anticipated to occur in this study due to the limited exposure to Test RBC, all subjects
           will be tested for the presence of antibody specific to INTERCEPT treated RBC at study
           entry (naturally occurring antibody) and at specified times during the study (Table 1).

           The presence of antibody will be evaluated using a formally validated gel card IAT that
           is routinely used in many blood centers for transfusion compatibility testing in
           conjunction with a panel of frozen reagent INTERCEPT RBCs. The frozen RBC screening
           panel is composed of reagent RBCs from 3 specifically phenotyped blood group O donors,
           and is analogous to routine antibody screening panels used in regular blood banking
           practice. Each cell in the panel of 3 consists of untreated RBCs, cells carrying a
           &quot;high&quot; level of acridine adducts and cells carrying a &quot;low&quot; level of acridine adducts.
           The screening panel was designed as a sensitive screening test for the presence of
           INTERCEPT RBC antibodies in the presence of most common alloantibodies. Gel card
           agglutination will be scored 1+ to 4+ based on manufacturer's recommendation.

           For result interpretation, if the RBC screening panel score is positive with 3/3 of the
           INTERCEPT RBCs carrying either 'high&quot; and/or &quot;low&quot; levels of acridine adducts AND with
           0/3 with the corresponding Control untreated RBCs the sample is classified as &quot;reactive
           for INTERCEPT RBC antibodies.

           Antibody confirmation and characterization will be performed at the ARC Immunohematology
           Reference Laboratory, Pomona and will include acridine specificity by agglutination
           inhibition (neutralization) using a soluble acridine analog of amustaline, antibody
           titer, antibody isotype and thermal amplitude.

           If the presence of antibody specific to INTERCEPT RBC is established, this does not
           determine whether that antibody is physiologically active or clinically significant,
           this can only be determined by any one of the following criteria indicative of
           accelerated RBC clearance in the absence of active bleeding, organ-mediated RBC
           sequestration, severe erythroid hypoplasia or other concurrent medical cause for acute
           anemia not associated with transfusion.

           Detection and Confirmation of Antibody Specific to BioRBC As with INTERCEPT RBCs,
           subjects will be screened prior to transfusion for the presence of naturally occurring
           or pre-existing antibody to BioRBC (18). This will be done using the same gel card
           agglutination as for the INTERCEPT RBCs but using BioRBCs incubated with subject serum
           or plasma. Briefly, 50 ÂµL of 0.8% hematocrit target BioRBC-N or unlabeled RBC will be
           prepared from a blood GpO donor and added to the gel column. Subject plasma (25 ÂµL) is
           added to the target RBCs and incubated at 37ËC for 30 min. Gel cards are subsequently
           centrifuged for 10 min. The presence of BioRBC agglutination is quantified using the
           manufacturer's gradation-specific definitions of reactivity. Reactivity scores will be
           based on manufacturers recommendation 0-4+ but, in addition, a score of 1+ (i.e.,
           agglutination in lower half of matrix) will be further sub-classified into three
           increasingly reactive 1+ designations: 1) Â± indicates a slanted pellet with a few
           agglutinated RBC; 2) 1w indicates a slanted pellet with more agglutinated RBC; and 3) 1+
           indicates a disrupted RBC pellet with more agglutinated cells. As with the detection of
           INTERCEPT-specific antibodies, the detection of specific antibodies to BioRBC does not
           determine whether that these antibodies are physiologically active or clinically
           significant.

           Confirmatory testing of the induction of BioRBC-induced antibodies will be performed by
           agglutination inhibition (neutralization) with biotin compounds, e.g., biocytin,
           biotinylated gelatin or biotinylated albumin is able, are able to neutralize anti-BioRBC
           antibodies. So far, all identified preexisting, naturally occurring anti-BioRBC
           antibodies are neutralized by biotin compounds, while the induced anti-BioRBC antibodies
           are expected to be inhibited by BioRBC and not by free biotin as previously published by
           our group (5).

           Recording and Reporting Adverse Events Adverse Event Definition An AE is defined as any
           untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered
           a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with
           this treatment. An adverse event can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including
           an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the
           medicinal product (in this study BioRBC and INTERCEPT RBC) whether or not related to the
           medicinal product (International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements
           for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH-E2A, section 2.1)

           Serious Adverse Event Definition

           Some AEs are considered &quot;serious&quot; when the outcome of the event poses a threat to a
           patient's life or functional status. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE that results
           in the following outcomes:

             -  Results in death

             -  Life-threatening

             -  Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization

             -  Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity

             -  Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect

             -  Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or
                require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate
                medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and/or may require intervention
                to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition (ICH E2A section II/B).

           Adverse Device Effect Definition An Adverse Device Effect (ADE) is defined as an adverse
           event related to the use of an investigation medical device.

           Unanticipated Adverse Effect Definition An unanticipated adverse effect (UAE) is defined
           as any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem or
           death caused by, or associated with, the process, if that effect, problem, or death was
           not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the
           investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or
           any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the
           rights, safety, or welfare of subjects (21 CFR 812.3).

           Reporting Adverse Events AEs will be documented on the appropriate case report form
           (CRF), regardless of whether or not they are classified as associated with the study
           product.

           If an AE meets the criteria of a serious adverse event (SAE) or unanticipated adverse
           device effect (UAE) as described above, the Sponsor/PI will halt the study and notify
           the FDA within 7 days.

           The Investigators will comply with the applicable regulatory requirement(s) related to
           the reporting of serious adverse events to the IRB. An Investigator shall submit to the
           Sponsor and to the reviewing IRB a report of any unanticipated adverse device effect
           occurring during an investigation as soon as possible, but in no event later than 10
           working days after the Investigator first learns of the effect.

           The Sponsor will report suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions and/or
           unanticipated adverse device effects to comply with the applicable regulatory
           requirement(s).

           Assessing Seriousness and Severity of an Adverse Event The Investigator is required to
           assess if the adverse event is non-serious or serious, the latter is defined as an event
           that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death, a life-threatening event (results
           in an immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred), inpatient
           hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant
           disability/incapacity, a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or another important medical
           event.

           The term &quot;severe&quot; is used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as
           in mild, moderate, or severe); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor
           medical significance (such as severe headache). Severity is not the same as &quot;serious&quot;,
           which is based on patient/event outcome or treatment criteria associated with events
           that pose a threat to a patient's life or functional status.

           Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting
           obligations. The National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
           Events (CTCAE, version 4.03) is used to assess and classify the intensity/severity of an
           event.

           Assessing Causal Relationship of an Adverse Events The Investigator will assess whether
           there is a reasonable possibility that the study blood collection or RBC infusion caused
           or contributed to an adverse event.

           Determination of whether there is a reasonable possibility that the study RBC component
           caused or contributed to an adverse event includes assessing temporal relationships,
           biologic plausibility, dechallenge/rechallenge information (if available), association
           (or lack of association) with underlying disease, and presence (or absence) of a more
           likely cause.

           The scale for assessing the causal relationship of an adverse event to the study RBC
           component (imputability levels) follows:

           Causality Assessment Scale Imputability Level Explanation Excluded When there is
           conclusive evidence beyond reasonable doubt for attributing the adverse event to
           alternative causes. Unlikely When the evidence is clearly in favor of attributing the
           adverse event to causes other than the study RBC component.

             1. Possible: When the evidence is indeterminate for attributing adverse event either
                to the RBC component or to alternative causes.

             2. Likely: Probable When the evidence is clearly in favor of attributing the adverse
                event to the RBC component.

             3. Certain: When there is conclusive evidence beyond reasonable doubt for attributing
                the adverse event to the RBC component.

           Assessing Intensity of an Adverse Events The Investigator is required to assess the
           intensity (severity) of each adverse event using the National Cancer Institute Common
           Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)

           Adverse Event Follow up All SAEs will be followed until resolution, or the Investigator
           judges the event to be chronic or stable.

           Stopping Rules

           The following SR will be applied to all study subjects throughout the trial whenever
           this study's sponsor/PI (JosÃ© Cancelas, M.D., Ph.D.,) and/or Clinical Monitor (Patricia
           Carey MD, Professor of Pathology, Medical Director, Hoxworth Blood Center)) agree that
           any of the following have occurred:

             1. An SAE that is determined to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to the
                infusion of autologous BioRBC;

             2. An AE related to the infusion of autologous BioRBC jeopardizes the subject's health
                or safety;

             3. An AE requiring medical or surgical intervention related to the infusion of
                autologous BioRBC is required to prevent occurrence of an SAE;

             4. A post-infusion of hemolysis event as assessed by anti-BioRBC antibody detection
                using the IgG gel card assay developed by our group.

           If any of the above conditions occur, the study will be paused and reported to FDA and
           IRB as required by current regulations to assess continuation of the study. Infused
           subjects will remain being followed as long as needed to identify the consequences of
           the AEs identified. Since there are no additional experimental BioRBC transfusions
           administered as part of this study, &quot;continuation of the study&quot; is understood to mean a
           continuation of the monitoring of biologic samples as already outlined in this study,
           but possibly including other testing as deemed appropriate by the study's sponsor/PI,
           Clinical Monitor, FDA and/or IRB.
