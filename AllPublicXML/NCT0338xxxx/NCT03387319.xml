  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine whether experiencing stress from discrimination may
      increase chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression in African Americans. Study participation
      occurs over the course of 2 days, and participant time burden is expected to be about 4.5
      hours, plus a 24-hour period of wearing a blood pressure monitor.

      On Day 1, the project coordinator will explain the study to participants and answer any
      questions he/she may have. Those who agree to participate in the study will provide consent
      at the clinic and will also be asked to complete a questionnaire on an iPad in a small,
      private room at the clinic. The participant will complete the questionnaire alone, however,
      the project coordinator will read questions aloud if the participant chooses. Before leaving
      on Day 1, participants will fitted with a blood pressure monitor to be worn for the next 24
      hours.

      The clinical intervention portion of the study occurs during the morning of Day 2 (between
      9:00 AM and 11:00 AM). Participants will be instructed to bring the blood pressure monitor
      and a list of current medications (or the actual medications) with them. First, participants
      will provide a urine sample and undergo blood pressure testing. A research nurse will insert
      a catheter (a small thin tube) into the participant's vein, and allow a 30-minute resting
      period so that the participant gets used to the catheter, and then take a baseline blood
      draw. Participants will judge how distressed they feel in that moment using a standard scale
      and tell the project coordinator his/her rating. Next, participants will be asked to recall
      two stressful experiences - one related to race and the other not related to race.
      Participants will be randomized to the order that they tell these stories. An audience of two
      observers of same race will wear white coats and watch as the participants recall the
      stressful events. The research nurse will draw blood and take blood pressure measurements at
      multiple time points during both recall experiences. Immediately before and after each recall
      task, the participant will again judge how distressed he/she is feeling in that moment using
      the same scale as before. The project coordinator will explain the purpose of the story
      recall and common ways that individuals may respond to the task (such as feeling anxious
      after the task). A total of 100 people will take part in this study.

    <measure>Subjective Units of Distress Scale (SUDS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Minute 30 through Minute 130</time_frame>
    <description>Level of distress will be measured with the Subjective Units of Distress Scale (SUDS). Participants rate their distress on a linear scale from 0 to 100, where 0 = No distress; totally relaxed, 50 = Moderate anxiety/distress; uncomfortable, but can continue to function, 100 = Highest anxiety/distress ever felt. The SUDS will be administered 5 times in a single day: 30 minutes after the intravenous (IV) catheter is inserted, after the first stress task (35 minutes after the IV catheter is inserted), after a 45 minute recovery period (80 minutes after the IV catheter is inserted), after the second stress test (85 minutes after the IV catheter is inserted), and after another 45 minute recovery period (130 minutes after the IV catheter is inserted).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 (MCP-1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Minute 30 through Minute 130</time_frame>
    <description>Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 (MCP-1) is an inflammatory marker that is sensitive to acute stress induction and is associated with CKD. Blood will be drawn three times, at 30 minutes after the IV catheter is inserted and after each 45 recovery period following the stress tests, in order to compare MCP-1 levels at each of these time points.
Increased MCP-1 indicates an increased inflammatory response. MCP-1 levels will be quantitated by the MesoScale system (MSD Rockville, Maryland) according to the protocols supplied by the manufacturer, which uses electrochemiluminescence for high sensitivity with a dynamic range of 0.09-375 pg/mL.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Interleukin-6 (IL-6)</measure>
    <time_frame>Minute 30 through Minute 130</time_frame>
    <description>Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is an inflammatory marker that is sensitive to acute stress induction and is associated with CKD. Blood will be drawn three times, at 30 minutes after the IV catheter is inserted and after each 45 recovery period following the stress tests, in order to compare IL-6 levels at each of these time points.
IL-6 is influenced by a variety of factors and increases in IL-6 indicate an increased inflammatory response. IL-6 levels will be quantitated by the MesoScale system (MSD Rockville, Maryland) according to the protocols supplied by the manufacturer, which uses electrochemiluminescence for high sensitivity with a dynamic range of 0.06-488 pg/mL.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Minute 30 through Minute 130</time_frame>
    <description>Soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) is an inflammatory marker that is sensitive to acute stress induction and is associated with CKD. Blood will be drawn three times at 30 minutes after the IV catheter is inserted and after each 45 recovery period following the stress tests, in order to compare suPAR levels at each of these time points.
Increases in suPAR indicate an increased inflammatory response. suPAR will be measured with the Virogates (CEDARLANE Laboratories, Burlington, NC) suPARnosticÂ® ELISA, according to the protocols supplied by the manufacturer. This assay has a high sensitivity (0.1 ng/mL) giving consistently quantitative results in plasma samples.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in systolic blood pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through Minute 130</time_frame>
    <description>Blood pressure readings will be taken at baseline and every 5 minutes during the experimental manipulation, except during the recall task when blood pressure will be measured every 1 minute. Mean systolic blood pressure scores for rest, recall task, and recovery will be calculated by averaging the readings taken during each period. Blood pressure reactivity will be a change score, calculated as the mean of the scores during the recall task minus the mean of the scores during rest, designed to represent the change in systolic blood pressure induced by the recall task.</description>

    <measure>Change in diastolic blood pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through Minute 130</time_frame>
    <description>Blood pressure readings will be taken at baseline and every 5 minutes during the experimental manipulation, except during the recall task when blood pressure will be measured every 1 minute. Mean diastolic blood pressure scores for rest, recall task, and recovery will be calculated by averaging the readings taken during each period.

    <description>Participants will undergo a moderate psychological stress adapted from the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) where they will be asked to recall a stressful, real-life, race-related event.
After instructions are provided, participants will be given two minutes to prepare their statement, and three minutes to deliver their statement. There will be an 'audience' present at each participant's speaking task which will include two observers who are of same race as the participant (African American), to heighten stress responses.
Participants will undergo a 45-minute recovery period after the recall task.</description>
