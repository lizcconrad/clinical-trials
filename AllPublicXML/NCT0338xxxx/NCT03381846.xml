  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this proposed study is to assess effectiveness of MOHS micrographic surgery as
      a form of treatment for dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans in patients who are 10 years of age
      or younger through review of the patients at Mayo Clinic treated from 1988-2017, and to
      explore the challenges that providers face which may prevent them performing this potentially
      superior treatment. This study will provide a comparison of outcomes and recurrence rates in
      pediatric patients treated by MOHS versus traditional excision.

    <measure>Mortality related to dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans</measure>
