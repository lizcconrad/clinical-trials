  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will develop and refine a computer-delivered integrated Personalized Feedback
      Intervention (PFI) that directly addresses smoking and anxiety sensitivity (AS). The PFI will
      focus on feedback about smoking behavior, AS, and adaptive coping strategies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of the research study is to investigate the efficacy of a brief,
      personalized computer-delivered transdiagnostic intervention (PFI) that addresses smoking and
      anxiety sensitivity (AS) to reduce smoking, increase quit attempts, reduce perceived barriers
      to cessation, reduce AS and negative affective symptoms, and increase adaptive coping skills
      compared to a smoking information only control. To address this aim, we will implement a
      randomized controlled trial that will employ a longitudinal experimental design and involve
      three stages: (a) phone-screener (pre-screener); (b) baseline appointment consisting of a
      pre-intervention assessment (eligibility), random assignment to a one-session
      computer-delivered intervention (PFI versus smoking information control with no personalized
      feedback), and a post-intervention assessment; (c) 1-month follow-up. Assessments will
      include a multi-method approach, including biological, behavioral, and self-report methods.
