  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, open label Phase II Clinical Trial. 30 advanced poorly
      differentiated thyroid carcinoma patients who were histopathologically confirmed inoperable
      were enrolled in this study.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will receive the treatment regimen as follow:

      intravenous infusion of liposomal doxorubicin 35 mg/m2, d1; cisplatin 75 mg/m2, drip, total
      dose should be carried out on d1-3; once every 21days, for 6 cycles. Stop the treatment if
      the patients have progressed or intolerated to the toxicity. The primary endpoint is disease
      control rate(DCR), the secondary endpoint is overall survival (OS), progression-free survival
      (PFS), safety and quality of life assessment(QoL).
