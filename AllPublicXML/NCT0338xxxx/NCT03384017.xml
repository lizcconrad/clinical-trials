  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim 1: Determine the neurophysiologic impact of Transcutaneous Spinal Cord Stimulation (TSCS)
      within a single session. The investigators hypothesize that subjects will demonstrate
      increased volitional muscle activity and strength with TSCS. This will be assessed by surface
      EMG and hand-held dynamometry of the dominant-side quadriceps muscle during maximum
      volitional contraction (MVC) and measurement of gait speed. Subjects will be tested in both
      TSCS and sham conditions.

      Aim 2: Determine the impact of TSCS and gait training on walking function. The investigators
      hypothesize that concurrent TSCS and gait training will augment walking function in subjects
      with iSCI, as compared to gait training alone. Subjects will participate in an eight-week
      program of gait training with TSCS and be assessed with clinically relevant outcome measures,
      to include the Timed Up and Go, 10-Meter Walk Test, Walking Index for Spinal Cord Injury II,
      and 6-Minute Walk Test.

    <description>TSCS will be applied using a midline electrode placed on the skin between spinous process T11 -T12 and two electrodes placed symmetrically on the skin over the lower abdomen as anodes. A symmetrical biphasic rectangular waveform, at 50 Hz and 1 millisecond, is used to provide 30 continuous minutes of stimulation.
Subjects will participate in 24 two-hour sessions of physical therapy over eight weeks. In each session, subjects will receive TSCS continuously for 30 minutes, using the parameters outlined above. During stimulation, subjects will participate in strengthening, segmental task practice, and gait-based interventions. Participation in gait training will continue following the stimulation period for the duration of the session.</description>
