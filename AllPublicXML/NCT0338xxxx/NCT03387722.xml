    <textblock>
      SevEos is a cross-sectional, multi-center, non-interventional study aimed to describe the
      treatment patterns in 250 severe asthma patients across the Gulf region. In addition, the
      study will determine the current level of asthma control and quality of life in these
      patients; describe the exacerbation patterns; and determine the current levels of blood
      eosinophils for the enrolled patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to describe the treatments patterns of severe
      asthmatic patients across four Gulf countries during the past year.

      Secondary Objectives

        1. To determine the current level of asthma control in these patients. In addition, a
           comparison of uncontrolled asthma between those with a eosinophilic count ≥ 300 cell/μl
           and those with an elevated eosinophilic count less than that.

        2. To determine the current and past year levels of blood eosinophils, and the percentage
           of patients with elevated eosinophilic level ≥ 150 cells/μL and ≥ 300 cells/μL

        3. To describe the frequency of exacerbations during the past year.

        4. To assess the current quality of life (QoL) of these patients.

        5. To determine the past year levels of serum IgE.

        6. Exploratory objective: To determine the past year levels of other inflammatory
           biomarkers like periostin and fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO).

    <description>Asthma control will be assed using &quot;The Asthma Control Questionnaire&quot;. The questionnaire was developed by Elizabeth Juniper( MCSP, MSc Professor, 20 Marcuse Fields) Bosham, West Sussex PO18 8NA, England), to measure both the adequacy of asthma control and change in asthma control, which occurs either spontaneously or as a result of treatment.
Patients are asked to respond to questions on a 7-point scale (0=no impairment, 6= maximum impairment). The questions are equally weighted and the ACQ score is the mean of the 7 questions and therefore between 0 (totally controlled) and 6 (severely uncontrolled). A change or difference in score of 0.5 is the smallest that can be considered clinically important.</description>

There are 32 questions in the questoinnaire and they are in 4 domains (symptoms, activity limitation, emotional function and environmental stimuli). Patients are asked during the previous two weeks and to respond to 32 questions on a 7-point scale (7 = not impaired at all - 1 = severely impaired). Scores range 1-7, higher scores indicating better quality of life. The better outcome is of higher score value, 0 (totally controlled), 6 (severely uncontrolled).</description>
