  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antimicrobial resistance is one of the greatest threats to human health, and is driven by
      inappropriate antimicrobial use. Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) improve the use of
      antimicrobials in hospitals. The purpose of this study is to identify the need for and
      barriers to implementation of ASPs in three hospitals in Sri Lanka, Kenya, and Tanzania.
