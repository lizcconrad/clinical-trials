  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a progressive neurological disorder of the brain and spinal cord.
      It affects approximately 120,000 people in the United Kingdom and 2.5 million people
      globally. Most people with MS experience two stages of the disease:

      Early MS - Relapsing-Remitting MS (RRMS), which is partially reversible, and Late MS -
      Secondary Progressive MS (SPMS), which affects the majority of patients, usually after 10 to
      15 years after diagnosis.

      SPMS results from progressive neuronal degeneration that causes accumulating and irreversible
      disability affecting walking, balance, manual function, vision, cognition, pain control,
      bladder and bowel function. The pathological process driving the accrual of disability in
      SPMS is not known at present.

      Immunomodulatory anti-inflammatory disease modifying therapies (DMTs) are increasingly
      effective in reducing relapse frequency in RRMS, however, they have been unsuccessful in
      slowing disease progression in SPMS. This is the overwhelming conclusion from an analysis of
      18 phase 3 trials (n=8500), of which 70% of the population had SPMS, all performed in the
      last 25 years. There is no current disease modifying treatment (DMT) for SPMS.

      In an earlier study (Multiple Sclerosis-Simvastatin 1; MS-STAT1), 140 people with SPMS were
      randomly assigned to receive either placebo or simvastatin for a period of two years. The
      investigators found that the rate of brain atrophy (loss of neurons - 'brain shrinkage'), as
      measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), was reduced in patients receiving simvastatin
      compared to those taking placebo.

      Several other long term studies have also reported that there might be a relationship between
      the rate of brain atrophy and the degree of impairment. The study is designed to test the
      effectiveness of repurposed simvastatin (80mg) in a phase 3 double blind, randomised, placebo
      controlled trial (1:1) in patients with secondary progressive MS (SPMS), to determine if the
      rate of disability progression can be slowed over a 3 year period.

      The results generated from this trial may help to improve the treatment options of people
      with MS. In addition, taking part in this trial will mean regular review by an experienced
      neurologist regardless of the drug that patients are randomly allocated to receive.
