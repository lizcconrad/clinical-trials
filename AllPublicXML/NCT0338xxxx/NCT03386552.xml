    <textblock>
      The present investigation is evaluating a method for improving pregnancy outcome of couples
      with unexplained infertility. The method utilizes an adjuvant pre-treatment prior to
      insemination, that is pertubation, i.e. flushing the uterus and fallopian tubes before
      insemination with a specially developed solution with the aim to increase fertility. The
      clinical trial is a phase II double blind, randomized, controlled and multi-center trial .

      Couples interested in participating in the clinical study must have undergone a complete
      investigation for their infertility and have at least one year of unsuccessful attempts to
      achieve pregnancy. Following inclusion in the study, patients will be monitored with vaginal
      ultrasound to ensure a leading follicle of at least 18 mm.The subjects with one or two
      follicles ≥18 mm will be given Ovitrelle® (Merck), dose 250 ug (6500 IU) of Human Chorionic
      Gonadotropin (HCG), subcutaneously for ovulation induction. 12-24 h after the HCG injection,
      patients will be randomized and pertubated with either test or control solution.

      12 -24 hours after the pertubation insemination (IUI) will be given to all patients. A blood
      sample is taken 14-17 days after IUI, for analysis of serum HCG level and possible pregnancy.
      In case of positive answer a second confirmatory sample will be obtained 48-72 hours later.
      In case of confirmed elevated HCG, the clinical pregnancy (CP) will be assessed with vaginal
      ultrasound examination 6-7 week after IUI. Baby take home rate data will be collected for
      couples with clinical pregnancy.
