  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is assessing if a reduced dosing schedule (1+1) of the 13-valent pneumococcal
      conjugate vaccine (PCV13) is non-inferior to the currently used schedule used in most of
      Canada.The vaccine is currently usually given as 3 doses at 2, 4 and 12 months of age. This
      study aims to find out if it is possible to achieve the same protection using just 2 doses,
      at 2 and 12 months.
