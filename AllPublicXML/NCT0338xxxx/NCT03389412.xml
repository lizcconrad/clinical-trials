  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the importance of clinical characterization of
      children with monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (MNE) in order to improve treatment
      efficacy.

      The hypothesis is that clinical characterization by measurement of nocturnal urine production
      and maximal voided volumes in children with MNE and subsequent treatment tailoring improves
      the response to first-line treatment approach.

      This is a randomized, controlled study.

      This study will be performed at Aarhus University Hospital (Denmark), Ghent University
      Hospital (Belgium) and Hospital of Zhengzhou University (China) following the same protocol.

      According to the initial randomization, children will be allocated to treatment without
      (group A) or with (group B) prior clinical characterization based on home recordings.

      Group A: The children will be randomized to either an enuresis alarm or desmopressin without
      evaluating the home recordings.

      Group B: The home recordings will be evaluated and treatment will be based on the recordings.
      Desmopressin will be administered to the children with nocturnal polyuria and the conditional
      alarm to the children with reduced bladder capacity. Children with nocturnal polyuria and
      reduced bladder capacity will be treated with both desmopressin and conditional alarm.
      Children with neither nocturnal polyuria nor reduced bladder capacity will again be
      randomized to either desmopressin or alarm treatment.
