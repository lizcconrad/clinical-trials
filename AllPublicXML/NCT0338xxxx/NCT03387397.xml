  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to utilize quantitative and qualitative methodology to better
      understand the impact of multiple drug use (polypharmacy) on medication adherence as well as
      the driving forces behind differential adherence in people living with HIV (PLWH) with
      comorbidities. Since the clinical relevance of differential adherence to antiretroviral
      therapy (ART) medication has already been demonstrated and associated with virologic failure
      and a more rapid progression to AIDS and death, it is imperative to understand the driving
      forces behind differential adherence (selective drug taking) and its impact on treatment
      outcomes in PLWH with comorbidities. Moreover, the use of technology to improve medication
      adherence is receiving much attention, and there are several smartphone applications that
      send medication reminders and generate personalized text messages to further motivate users.
      This type of technology could be particularly beneficial to patients who are managing
      multiple medications for multiple conditions. To this end, the investigators propose to use
      the medication adherence smartphone-based application, 'Technology for Engagement And
      Management of Health (TEAMH) to track both medication adherence and medication side effects
      in real-time among PLWH with comorbidities. TEAMH is an interactive health care information
      technology system that is not only patient-centered in that it encourages patient engagement
      in health care self-management, but also offers significant cost savings by directly
      connecting patients with their health care providers allowing providers to quickly address
      any health issue that may arise, thus potentially avoiding costly hospitalizations later on.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TEAMH technology provides: 1) calendar-based medication reminders; 2) specific medication
      information tailored to each patient's medication regimen; 3) health education material; 4)
      direct contact with a health care provider through text messaging to discuss patients'
      symptoms and side effects and; 5) reminders for medical appointments as well as medication
      refills and laboratory testing. TEAMH provides a constant dialog between provider and patient
      through ongoing text messaging, allowing providers to regularly monitor patients' adherence
      to their medication regimen (data is transmitted directly to the providers) and to their
      medical appointments. Any number of medications can be included, making it ideal for HIV
      patients with comorbidities. In addition, TEAMH has the potential to interface with the
      Northwell Health (NH) electronic medical record (EMR) system allowing for the collection of
      comprehensive health information on each patient (e.g., lab results, medical appointments,
      hospitalizations) participating in the study.

    <measure>Self-reported adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>To measure medication adherence to ART we will use the validated AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) Adherence Questionnaire. This assessment is considered one of the &quot;gold-standard&quot; ART self-reported adherence questionnaires. The questionnaire assesses the number of doses missed per medication per day over a recall period of the previous four days. Mean number of doses missed is calculated for all ART medications over the four days. A higher mean, indicates more doses missed.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-reported adherence to non-antiretroviral therapy (ART)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will use the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale-8 (MMAS-8) to measure medication adherence to each non-ART medications. This scale consist of eight items with a scoring scheme of yes and no for the first seven items and a 5-point Likert scale for last question. A higher score indicates greater adherence to medication.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life (QoL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline QoL at six months</time_frame>
    <description>We will use the World Health Organization HIV QoL Brief Scale (WHOQOL-HIV BREF) which is a widely used, validated scale to assess QoL indicators that are most relevant to PLWH. The WHOQOL-BREF instrument comprises 26 items, which measure the following broad domains: physical health, psychological health, social relationships, and environment. A higher score indicates greater quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Patients' illness-specific symptoms and medication-specific side effects</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from patients' baseline illness-specific symptoms and medication-specific side effects at six months</time_frame>
    <description>We will assess illness-specific symptoms and medication-specific side effects (MSSE using the HIV Symptom Index Questionnaire (HIV-SIQ). HIV-SIQ is a validated instrument that assesses a total of 20 symptoms on a 5-point Likert scale which also assesses symptom severity. A greater score indicates greater burden of symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patients' beliefs about medication's</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from patients' baseline beliefs about medication's at six months</time_frame>
    <description>We will use the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ) to assess patients' reasoning behind adherence or non-adherence. The BMQ comprises two sections: the BMQ-Specific (SpecificNecessity and Specific-Concerns; 10 items), that assesses beliefs about the medication prescribed for personal use, and the BMQ-General (General-Harm and General-Overuse; eight items), which assesses beliefs about medication in general. All items have a five-point Likert answer option, which varies from strongly agree to strongly disagree. Higher scores indicate stronger beliefs about the corresponding concepts in each sub-scale (ie, more negative beliefs about medicines).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patients' illness perception's</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from patients' baseline illness perception's at six months</time_frame>
    <description>We will use the revised version of the Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ) to assess patients' own personal beliefs about their illnesses and their treatments, and their emotional responses towards the treatments. The IPQ was originally developed for cancer patients, but it has been revised to accommodate PLWH and other chronic conditions. Patients will complete the questionnaire in response to each of their chronic conditions (including HIV). The IPQ is a 5-point Likert scale questionnaire ranging from 1 (strongly agree) to 5 (strongly disagree). A higher schore indicates a more negative perception of a patient's illness.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patients' pill burden perceptions</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>We will query patients regarding their perceptions of pill burden using the Pill Burden Questionnaire (PBQ). The PBQ, developed by Zhou et al.,19 consists of five questions with answers ranging from: 1) strongly agree; 2) disagree; 3) neither agree nor disagree. A high score indicates a higher perceived burden.</description>

    <description>The study includes one intervention arm and no control arm. All enrolled patients will be given the TEAMH smartphone application intervention for a period of 6 months. Enrolled patients will be grouped into two mutually exclusive cohorts according to the number of daily prescribed chronic medications (both ART and non-ART). Patients will be assigned to the Lower Medications (LM) cohort group (N=85) if they received a drug regimen of less than five different medications/day during the study period. Whereas, patients will be assigned to the Higher Medications (HM) cohort group (N=85) if they received a drug regimen of more than 5 different chronic medications/day during the study period.</description>
