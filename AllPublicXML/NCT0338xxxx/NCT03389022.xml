  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate an effect of pre - incisional single injection of
      low-dose ketamine on postoperative pain after remifentanil infusion in patients undergoing
      laparoscopic gastric bypass and gastric plication surgery. Ketamine is an old general
      anaesthetic. Low doses of it might be used as a adjunct in postoperative analgesia.The
      investigators expect that the low-dose ketamine reduces postoperative pain after bariatric
      surgeries.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Effective postoperative pain management enhances early postoperative rehabilitation and may
      improve outcomes of surgical treatment. New analgetic medications and combinations of these
      are sought for optimal analgesia with lowest possible incidence of side effects. One of the
      method of multimodal analgesia is a combination of opioids and adjuvant agents, such as
      ketamine. To our knowledge, the role of ketamine in the treatment of postoperative pain after
      bariatric surgeries is poorly researched. The investigators hypothesize that ketamine, acting
      through the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA) and opioid receptors, provides favourable
      conditions for adequate post-operative pain management.

    <description>Comparison of pain intensity will be recorded in both groups every 15 min in Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) for 2.5 hours. Postoperative pain was treated with boluses of i.v. morphine (3 mg) at 3 min. intervals on request, if pain intensity exceeded the score of 5 according to the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) (0-10). After the transfer of patient's to a regular unit, pain intensity was recorded every 6 hours.</description>
