    <textblock>
      Dual Antiplatelet Therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and P2Y12 receptor inhibitor remains a
      cornerstone in the secondary prevention of coronary artery disease (CAD). Clopidogrel is one
      of the most commonly used antithrombotic agent that inhibits the platelet P2Y(12) adenosine
      diphosphate (ADP) receptor.

      Ticagrelor is an oral, reversibly-binding, direct-acting P2Y12 receptor antagonist used
      clinically for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in patients with acute coronary
      syndromes (ACS). Guideline recommendations on the use of dual antiplatelet therapy have been
      formulated that ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily plus aspirin in preference to clopidogrel 75mg
      daily plus aspirin for ACS patients. The previous studies have reported that half-dose
      ticagrelor had the similar inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation as the standard-dose
      ticagrelor, which was significantly stronger than that in the clopidogrel group. One-quarter
      standard-dose ticagrelor provided greater degree of platelet inhibition than standard dose
      clopidogrel in Chinese patients with stable CAD. But the effectiveness and safety of low-dose
      ticagrelor remain yet not very clearly in Chinese patients with acute coronary syndrome
      undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.
