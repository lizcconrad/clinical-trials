  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, double blind study of adding dexmedetomidine to
      ropivacaine for Brachial plexus block and assessing the analgesia with VAS pain scales(0-10),
      Satisfaction scale by VAS scale(0-10) and time to first analgesic consumption. This study
      mainly aims to investigate whether addition of dexmedetomidine helps in increasing the
      duration of analgesia.

    <textblock>
      In our institute ropivacaine is used for all the peripheral nerve blocks. This a prospective,
      randomized, double blind clinical trial study comparing the addition of dexmedetomidine vs
      ropivacaine alone in brachial plexus nerve block. After screening the patient with the
      inclusion criteria, an informed consent is obtained from the patient by one of the
      co-investigator.

      Adjuvants to local anesthetics are commonly added to prolong the duration of the peripheral
      nerve block. Sometimes patients have other added comorbidities along with high BMI with
      history of chronic pain where prolonging the duration of the peripheral nerve block would
      help with decreased narcotic consumption in the perioperative period with minimal side
      effects related to the local anesthetics(LA) as well as the adjuncts.

      Dexmedetomidine is proven to be better than Clonidine in a recent study. Also perineural
      dexmedetomidine is proven to be more efficacious compared to intravenous dosing. The
      investigators are evaluating whether adding dexmedetomidine to standard dose of Ropivacaine
      helps in prolonging the duration of the peripheral nerve block with minimal side effects.
