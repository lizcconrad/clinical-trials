  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is well known that the hormone insulin lowers blood glucose in part by acting directly on
      the liver and reducing hepatic glucose production. Animal studies have shown that the hormone
      insulin can act on the brain to indirectly lower glucose production by the liver. It has
      previously been shown that a nasal spray can deliver insulin directly to the brain without
      affecting circulating insulin concentration in humans. Intranasal spray of insulin suppressed
      hepatic glucose production in lean subjects. It is unknown whether this effects is blunted in
      subjects with insulin resistance.

      Each study participant will be admitted to hospital the evening prior to the study. Following
      admission each study participant will be provided with a standardized dinner. At 7am (t=0)
      the next day we will begin a primed, constant intravenous infusion d2 glucose (a stable
      isotope of glucose, the enrichment of which can be measured by gas chromatography mass
      spectrometry, allowing us to calculate endogenous glucose production rates) and continue this
      for 8 hours. At the same time (7am) a pancreatic clamp will be started as described above for
      8 hours. Blood samples will be analysed with a glucometer for instant blood glucose readings
      At 9 am (+120 minutes) intranasal placebo or insulin will be administered. The insulin
      (Humalog Lispro 100 IU/ml, Eli Lily, Canada) and placebo (diluent) will be transferred to a
      metered nasal device (Pharmasystems, Ontario #063636 802721, Item 10271) immediately prior to
      use. This device dispenses 0.1ml (10 IU) per puff. 4 x 0.1 ml puffs/vials (2 per nostril)
      will be administered at rate of 2 (one in each nostril) every 60 seconds. Blood will be drawn
      at t=0, 30, 60, 120 and every 10 minutes thereafter for 6 hours. In order to match peripheral
      lispro concentrations between study visits, a small dose of Humalog (lispro) insulin will be
      administered intravenously at 9am, during the placebo arm of the study. Based on the
      pharmacokinetics of Humalog lispro (personal communication from Eli Lilly), we propose to
      administer 0.005 IU/kg over 30 minutes. 20% dextrose will be administered to maintain
      euglycemia as necessary. Insulin, glucagon, and glucose isotopic enrichment will be measured.
      The enrichment data and glucose infusion will be used to calculate steady state glucose
      production.
