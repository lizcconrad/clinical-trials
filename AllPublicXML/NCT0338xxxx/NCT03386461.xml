  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to investigate in elderly women, the effect of combined aerobic
      and resistive training and concomitant supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids on
      adipogenesis, metabolic functions and pro-inflammatory status of adipose tissue and on
      systemic metabolic profile.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aging is associated with development of disturbances of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism and
      with systemic pro-inflammatory state similarly to the alterations observed in obese
      individuals. Metabolic and immune dysfunction of adipose tissue has been suggested as an
      important contributing trigger to this condition. EXODYA project is a clinical study in
      elderly individuals that aims to establish benefits of lifestyle intervention and nutritional
      supplementation -either alone or in combination- for the amelioration of systemic and adipose
      tissue metabolic and immune disturbances. Effects of 4 monthsÂ´ intervention with combined
      aerobic plus resistive exercise training and supplementation with omega-3 polyunsaturated
      fatty acids on systemic metabolic profile and molecular characteristics of adipose tissue
      will be investigated in elderly women. Thus, a proof-of-concept will be provided for novel
      recommendations and guidelines for lifestyle interventions in elderly population

    <description>Subjects will be enrolled in physical activity program that consists of combined aerobic and resistive training 3 times a week for 4 months. Training will be supervised by physiotherapists experienced in exercise training of elderly (Senior Fitness, and Faculty of Physical Education and Sport).

    <description>Combined aerobic and resistive training 3 times a week for 4 months. The strength training will be performed at moderate intensity (i.e., 50-60% of RM), and moderate volume (i.e., 2 to 3 sets per exercise). Endurance training will be performed at moderate- to high-intensity (i.e., 60-85% of VO2max) in the form of continuous and interval training (for high intensities), respectively. The training intensity will be prescribed individually on the basis of the initial exercise testing. Subjects will be thoroughly instructed on effective home-based exercise and advised to exercise in total 5 days a week.</description>
