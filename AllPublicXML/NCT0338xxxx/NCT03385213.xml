    <textblock>
      Colonic microbiome has been found to contribute to the development of colorectal cancer. We
      speculate that gut microbiota related to colorectal cancer relapse after curative treatment.
      This study aim to discover if any difference of gut microbiota exist in patients who suffer
      from cancer relapse compared with patients who do not. Finally develop patient-centred
      programmes of surveillance protocols base on microbiota analysis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatments for colorectal cancer of all stages have evolved considerably over the past two
      decades, resulting in improved long-term outcomes. After curative treatment, however, 30% of
      patients with stage I-III and up to 65% of patients with stage IV colorectal cancer develop
      recurrent disease.

      The human colon plays host to a diverse and metabolically complex community of
      microorganisms. While the colonic microbiome has been found to contribute to the development
      of colorectal cancer. Investigators speculate that gut microbiota related to colorectal
      cancer relapse after curative treatment.

      Patients are routinely offered surveillance in order to detect disease recurrence at an
      early, asymptomatic stage, with the intention of improving survival. Nevertheless,
      controversy continues to surround the optimal surveillance protocols. Investigators aim to
      discover if any difference of gut microbiota is exist in patients who suffer from relapse
      compared with patients who do not.

      Future surveillance after colorectal cancer treatment should focus on risk-stratification and
      should incorporate current knowledge on risk of recurrence in relation to the biology of the
      tumour as well as gut microbiota feature. Finally investigators will develop patient-centred
      programmes of surveillance protocols base on microbiota analysis.

        Colorectal cancer is a major cause of cancerrelated deaths and the third most commonly
        diagnosed cancer worldwide. After curative treatment, however, 30% of patients with stage
        I-III and up to 65% of patients with stage IV CRC develop recurrent disease.
