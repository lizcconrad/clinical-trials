      The investigators' study aims is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of percutaneous
      transluminal angioplasty (PTA) with paclitaxel-coated balloon (PCB) at venous anastomotic
      stenosis of arteriovenous graft (AVG) in patients with hemodialysis

    <description>Arteriovenous graft (AVG) dysfunction or acute thrombosis is mainly caused by neointimal hyperplasia. Although endovascular intervention, such as percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), catheter-based directed thrombolysis with urokinase, mechanical thrombectomy with percutaneous thrombolytic device or even if graft stenting, can salvage the hemodialysis access, the long-term primary and secondary patent rate don't improve due to repeated restenosis from neointimal hyperplasia. Drug eluting balloon is used in reducing neointimal hypoplasia in patients with coronary in-stent restenosis and it's also effective in restenosis of peripheral arterial diseases. It's reasonable to hypothesize that PTA with PCB at venous anastomotic stenosis of AVG could prolong the patency and reduce the acute thrombosis rate.</description>
