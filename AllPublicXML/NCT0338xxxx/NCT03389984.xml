      The objective is to compare the initial skin inflammatory transcriptomic profile of psoriatic
      patient responder to Adalimumab therapy (defined as the achievement of a Psoriasis Area and
      Severity Index 75 response at 16 weeks) with the transcriptomic profile of patient
      non-responder to Adalimumab therapy (defined as the non-achievement of a Psoriasis Area and
      Severity Index 50 response at 16 weeks) to identify differentially expressed genes in order
      to define predictive markers of response to the treatment.
