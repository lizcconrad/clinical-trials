  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Renal artery stenosis is one the leading cause of secondary hypertension. Previous randomized
      controlled trials in humans have failed to demonstrate an improvement of renal function after
      stenosis dilation, probably because of a selection bias with more severe patients being
      excluded from randomization. Renal ischemia-reperfusion injuries have also not been taken
      into account. Indeed, reperfusion leads to a rapid renal blood flow recovery associated with
      renal ischemia-reperfusion injuries.

      Mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) is a key player in the occurrence of
      ischemia reperfusion injuries because its opening leads to mitochondria leakage and cell
      death. However, preconditioning whether pharmacological or ischemic can prevent mPTP opening
      and protect cells. Ciclosporin A can prolong mPTP closing during reperfusion and reduce renal
      and cardiac tissular lesions. Another mPTP blocker (Bendavia) has been associated with an
      improvement of renal blood flow (RBF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) after renal artery
      stenosis dilation at 6 weeks in pigs. Based on a recent study, dilation overall benefit could
      be secondary to an improvement of the contralateral kidney GFR and tissue oxygen content,
      requiring a single kidney evaluation of those renal functional parameters. The investigators
      previously demonstrated that dose and timing of ciclosporin A preconditioning is key to
      protect kidneys from ischemia-reperfusion injuries. Previous controlled trials that failed to
      demonstrate a benefit of ciclosporin A conditioning have used post conditioning on necrotic
      cells. Considering kidney ischemia-reperfusion injuries, preconditioning have led to more
      encouraging results compared to ciclosporin A post conditioning in animals. Therefore the
      investigators aim to conduct the first clinical study of ciclosporin A preconditioning for
      prevention of kidney ischemia-reperfusion injuries after renal artery stenosis dilation.

      Using renal functional imaging and the new PET-MRI (Positron Emission Tomography-Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging) combined device, the investigators will evaluate kidney perfusion,
      oxidative metabolism, glomerular filtration rate and oxygen content before and 3 months after
      renal artery stenosis dilation with or without a ciclosporin A preconditioning.
