  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This case-control study aims to compare the pelvic microbiomes of benign ovarian diseases and
      ovarian malignancies by 16s RNA techniques and culture. Discharges/flushing fluid from
      vagina, faces and fimbria end of fallopian tube are collected from age and menopausal status
      matched patient before and during procedures of laparoscopies. The discharges/flushing fluid
      would be sent for 16s RNA analysis and microculture respectively, and the results would get
      self-contrasted comparison and case-control comparison.
