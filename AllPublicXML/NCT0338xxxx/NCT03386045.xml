  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the toxicity, rate of local control, biochemical failure rate and quality of life
      of three different radiotherapy techniques (moderate hypofractionation, stereotactic body
      radiotherapy (SBRT) and standard radiotherapy plus 2 fractions of SBRT (BOOSTER)
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>

      Participants must have histologically proven prostate adenocarcinoma, good performance status
      and suitable for high dose radiotherapy. There are two groups of participants:

      Group 1: eligible participants will be randomised to have either moderate hypofractionation
      or standard radiotherapy plus SBRT (BOOSTER). Participants in this group must be able to have
      MRI, prostate fiducial markers (gold markers)and hydrogel insertion. Fiducial markers will be
      used to locate the prostate accurately during radiation treatment. Hydrogel is a temporary
      gel being injected into the space between the prostate and rectum to reduce the dose of
      radiation received by the rectum to minimise side effects from the treatment.

      Group 2: eligible participants will be randomised to have either moderate hypofractionation
      or SBRT.

      Participants will be reviewed for side effects. A Safety Committee will be formed containing
      multi-disciplinary team members. All serious adverse will be reported to the principal
      investigator and Human Research Ethics Committee within 24 hours.
