  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized phase II non comparative study. Patients with metastatic Neuroendocrine
      Carcinomas (NEC) Grade 3, will be enrolled in the study and will be randomly assigned to
      receive FOLFIRI or CAPTEM as second line treatment. Disease control rate (DCR) and safety are
      primary objectives, secondary objectives are Disease control rate (OS), Progression Free
      Survival (PFS) and quality of life.

      This is a multicenter randomized phase II non comparative study. Patients with metastatic NEC
      G3, will be enrolled in the study and will be randomly assigned to receive FOLFIRI or CAPTEM
      as second line treatment The primary objective is to assess DCR and the safety as co-primary
      objective. The secondary objectives are: OS, PFS and quality of life. The secondary
      exploratory objectives are the assessment of the impact of PET with gallium on PFS and the
      evaluation of biomarkers

           followed by

        -  Calcio levofolinate 200 mg/m2, given as a 2h i.v. infusion on days 1 every 2 weeks
           followed by

             conditions that could affect their participation in the study such as:

               -  unstable angina pectoris, symptomatic congestive heart failure, myocardial
                  infarction within 6 months of start of study drug, serious uncontrolled cardiac
                  arrhythmia or any other clinically significant cardiac disease.

               -  severely impaired lung function (spirometry and the diffusing capacity of the
                  lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) that is 50% of the normal predicted value and/or
                  Oxygen saturation that is 88% or less at rest, in room air).

               -  uncontrolled diabetes as defined by fasting serum glucose &gt;1.5 x ULN.

               -  any active (acute or chronic) or uncontrolled infections/disorders

             composition.

         10. Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

         11. Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.

         12. Other malignancy with a disease-free interval of less than 5 years (except non
             melanoma skin cancer or low grade superficial bladder cancer)
