  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Controversies persist for the best treatment of burst fractures of the thoracolumbar spine.
      Posterior fixation alone may be adequate to achieve and maintain burst fractured reduction.
      Adding screws in fractured segment has been proved in many literature that can improve
      construct stiffness; however, no previous reports exist describing the different efficacy
      between diverse order of adding screw placement in fractured vertebrae.

      This is the first randomised study investigate the efficacy of different order of fractured
      pedicle screw placement and will provide recommendations for treating patients with
      thoracolumbar burst fractures. A blinded randomised controlled trial (blinding for the
      patient and statistician, rather than for the clinician and researcher) will be conducted. A
      total of seventy-one adult patients with single thoracolumbar AO type A3 or A4 fractures who
      are candidates for application of short-segment pedicle screw associated with pedicle screw
      placement of fractured vertebrae will be randomly allocated to either the DS group
      (distraction-fractured level screws) or the SD group (fractured level screws-distraction) at
      a ratio of 1: 1. The primary clinical outcome measures are compression ratio of anterior
      border of vertebral body height, depth of nail into injured vertebrae and kyphosis (Cobb)
      angle. Secondary clinical outcome measures are complications, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) of
      back and leg pain, neurological function, operating time, intraoperative blood loss, Japanese
      Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scores and Oswestry Disability Index. These parameters will be
      evaluated preoperatively, at postoperation immediately, day 3, and then at 1, 3, 6, 12and 24
      months postoperatively.
