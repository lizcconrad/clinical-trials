      This project is designed to test the hypothesis that acyclovir is clinically useful for
      patients with refractory viral uveitis.

      Approval of the study was obtained from the hospital's ethical committee. The study design
      and methodology followed the tenets of Declaration of Helsinki. All patients were provided
      with written informed consent and received a thorough explanation of the study design, aims,
      benefits and potential risks. This is a prospective non-comparative interventional study.

      Aqueous humor samples were collected from participants to virus detection. Participants will
      take oral acyclovir 100 mg three times a day and data will be collected prospectively with
      regard to ophthalmologic outcomes. Study participants will be followed for up to 12 months to
      determine efficacy, and an additional 30 days for safety reports. Descriptive statistics will
      be gathered on participant demographics, uveitis characteristics, change in immunosuppressive
      medications, number of responders, ophthalmologic measures and change in corticosteroid dose
      during the study period.
