  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled open-label trial in patients with high risk prostate cancer. Eligible
      and consenting patients will be randomly allocated to receive stereotactic body radiotherapy
      (SBRT) boost to prostate or conventional radiotherapy boost to prostate in 1:1 ratio.
      Prostate radiotherapy boost will be administered after standard pelvic radiotherapy. Subjects
      will be followed for 24 months post radiation treatment for Quality of Life assessment and
      toxicity.

    <textblock>
      In this study we investigate stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) as a boost radiotherapy
      treatment, following pelvic radiotherapy, in patients with high risk prostate cancer (PrCa)
      treated with Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT). One hundred patients with localized high
      risk PrCa will receive ADT for a total of 3 years. Three months after initiation of ADT all
      patients will receive pelvic (lymph node and prostate) treatment of 45Gy in 25 fractions (5
      days per week). Then patients will be randomized to receive either The conventional
      radiotherapy (CRT) of 33 - 35 Gy in 16 fractions (5 days per week - over 22 days) (comparator
      arm) or SBRT boost treatment of 19.5 - 21 Gy in three fractions (1 treatment per week - over
      22days) (experimental arm). SBRT boost treatment will be delivered with either cyberknife or
      VMAT technique.

QoL, defined as bowel and bladder function and bother after PrCa treatment, will be measured prior to and at regular intervals after completion of radiotherapy using the established Prostate QoL (The Expanded Prostate cancer Index Composite (EPIC-26 instrument)).
