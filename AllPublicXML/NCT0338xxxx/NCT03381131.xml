      Up to now, there is no Chinese version of fibromyalgia diagnosis criteria and severity
      assessment scales. The aim of this study is to translate, adapt, and validate the Chinese
      version of the 2011 modification of the 2010 ACR preliminary criteria for the diagnosis of
      fibromyalgia (2011ModCr) and 2016 ACR revisions to the 2010/2011 fibromyalgia diagnostic
      criteria, as well as the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ-C).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia is a chronic debilitating musculoskeletal pain syndrome that causes substantial
      physical and psychological impairments. The provisional criteria of the ACR 2010 and the 2011
      self-report modification for survey and clinical research are widely used for fibromyalgia
      diagnosis. However, there is no Chinese version of fibromyalgia diagnosis criteria and
      severity assessment scales until now. The aim of this study is to investigate the reliability
      and the validity of the Chinese version of the 2011ModCr and 2016 ACR revisions to the
      2011ModCr, as well as its quantification scale, the Chinese version of Fibromyalgia Impact
      Questionnaire (FIQ-C) and Revised FIQ (FIQR-C). In this study, we'll divide patients with
      chronic pain without psychiatric disorders other than depression into two groups according to
      the 1990 ACR diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia, a fibromyalgia group and a
      non-fibromyalgia group. Patients in both groups will be assessed using the 2011ModCr and 2016
      ACR revisions to the 2011ModCr. Furthermore, those in the fibromyalgia group will also
      complete FIQ-C, FIQR-C and several other validated questionnaires including the Medical
      Outcome Survey Short Form-36 (SF-36), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), ect.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>the Chinese Version of Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ-C)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 week</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire was designed to assess the current health status of patients with fibromyalgia. The FIQ has 11 individual questions and measures physical functioning, work status (missed days of work and job difficulty), depression, anxiety, morning tiredness, pain, stiffness, fatigue, and well-being over the past week ranging from 0-100 with higher score indicating more severity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Widespread pain index (WPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 week</time_frame>
    <description>WPI is the sum of number of areas (including both jaws, shoulder girdles, upper arms, lower arms, hips (buttocks, trochanters), upper legs and lower legs, as well as neck, shoulder girdle, upper back, lower back, chest and abdomen) in which the patient has had pain over the last week. Its score is between 0 and 19 with higher score indicating more severity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Symptom severity scale (SSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 week</time_frame>
    <description>The SSS score is the sum of the severity scores of the 3 symptoms (fatigue, waking unrefreshed, and cognitive symptoms) (0-9) plus the sum (0-3) of the number of the 3 symptoms (headaches, pain or cramps in lower abdomen and depression) the patient has been bothered by that occurred during the previous 6 months. Its range is from 0-12 with higher score indicating more severity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>the polysymptomatic distress (PSD) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 week</time_frame>
    <description>The PSD scale fibromyalgia severity (FS) scale also known as the fibromyalgia severity (FS) scale. It is the sum of the WPI and SSS, and ranges is from 0-31 with higher score indicating more severity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>the Chinese Version of the Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQR-C)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 week</time_frame>
    <description>The FIQR has 21 individual questions and is divided into three linked sets of domains as the FIQ (that is, function, overall impact and symptoms). It differs from the FIQ in having modified function questions and the inclusion of questions on memory, tenderness, balance and environmental sensitivity. The total FIQR is the sum of the three modified domain scores which ranges is also from 0-100 with higher score indicating more sever symptoms.</description>

        The fibromyalgia patients who meet the ACR 1990 criteria for diagnosis without psychiatric
        disorders other than depression will be recruited. During the study period, other patients
        with diseases associated with chronic pain, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA),
        osteoarthritis (OA), and gout, who have not been diagnosed previously with fibromyalgia
        will be recruited as control patients. An experienced rheumatologist familiar with
        fibromyalgia assessed these patients.
