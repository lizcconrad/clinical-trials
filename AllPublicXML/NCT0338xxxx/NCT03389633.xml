  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many risk factors contribute to the onset of atrial fibrillation. This study is specifically
      concerned with the effect of addressing these risk factors by cardiac rehabilitation on the
      risk of recurrence of atrial fibrillation following catheter ablation. A non-randomized,
      retrospective study was performed on patients treated with a catheter ablation for atrial
      fibrillation. The intervention group consisted of patients who chose to participate in the
      cardiac rehabilitation program. The control group only received standard care. The primary
      objective was to examine whether cardiac rehabilitation following the first ablation for
      atrial fibrillation resulted in a reduction of the time to or the risk of recurrence of
      atrial fibrillation or the need for a second ablation within 1 year after the first ablation.
      A Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to examine the primary objective. The secondary objectives
      of this study were to examine whether cardiac rehabilitation following the first ablation for
      atrial fibrillation had an effect on the evolution of the patients' BMI (a Mann-Whitney U
      test), the number of recurrences of atrial fibrillation (a Poisson regression) and the
      proportion of patients who need to continue treatment with antiarrhythmics 3 months following
      the first ablation (a chi-square test).

      The intervention group follows a 3 months rehab program consisting of training, education,
      coaching and medical follow-up. The control group are patients that chose not to follow this
      program. This is a retrospective non randomized trial
