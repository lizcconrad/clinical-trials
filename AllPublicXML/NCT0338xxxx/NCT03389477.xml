    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the results of treating patients with HPV-unrelated
      head and neck squamous cell carcinoma with neoadjuvant single-agent palbociclib, followed by
      chemoradiation (either cisplatin + IMRT or cetuximab + IMRT depending on patient
      characteristics), followed by adjuvant single-agent palbociclib.

    <time_frame>2 cycles (56 days)</time_frame>
    <description>tumor response rate is defined as the proportion of subjects who achieve a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on RECIST criteria
CR: Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (&lt;10 mm short axis).
PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</description>

               -  Drugs that are known to prolong the QT interval

               -  Drugs that are proton pump inhibitors

             biologic composition to palbociclib, cisplatin (for Cohort 1), or cetuximab (for
             Cohort 2).

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or uncontrolled electrolyte disorders that can compound the effects of a
             QTc-prolonging drug (e.g. hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia).

          -  History of cirrhosis.

          -  History of renal or liver transplant.

          -  Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative
             serum pregnancy test within 28 days of study entry. Female patients must be surgically
             sterile or be postmenopausal, or must agree to use effective contraception during the
             period of the trial and for at least 90 days after completion of treatment.

          -  Known HIV-positivity and on combination antiretroviral therapy because of the
             potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with palbociclib. In addition, these
             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy.
