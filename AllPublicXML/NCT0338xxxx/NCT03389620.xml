  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare two methods of giving epidural steroid injections for
      nerve pain in the arm that comes from the neck. An epidural steroid injection can be given in
      two different ways, either in the back of the spine within the neck or in the neck next to
      the nerve root going to the arm. Both are standard medical treatments. The investigators
      would like to see how effective these treatments are, and if there are any differences in
      effectiveness or safety between these two routes.
