  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nowadays, the morbidity of Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) show ascending trend year
      by year, which has become an important public health problem in China. As NAFLD can progress
      to Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis and Hepatocarcinoma, the identification
      and quantitative evaluation of liver steatosis and its dynamic changes are crucial. While
      liver biopsy is still the gold standard in the diagnosis of NAFLD, its application is limited
      because of the invasive procedure.The Transient Elastography(TE) combined with the Controlled
      Attenuation Parameter(CAP) is a new non-invasive diagnostic method for fatty liver and liver
      fibrosis.

      In order to evaluate the diagnostic value of non-invasive assessment for the degree of liver
      steatosis and staging liver fibrosis, this non-invasive method will be assessed by the golden
      standard of liver biopsy among 400 NAFLD patients.The treatment protocols will be decided by
      doctor and patient both (treatment protocols and medicine are not required). Blood routine,
      blood biochemistry, abdominal ultrasound and Transient Elastography(TE) combined with the
      Controlled Attenuation Parameter(CAP) are detected during the follow-up.
