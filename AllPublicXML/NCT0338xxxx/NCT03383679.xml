  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter uncontrolled, open-label, prospective, non-comparative randomized,
      phase II study. Patients will be randomized between darolutamide in Arm n°1 (two-stage
      Simon's design) and capecitabine in Arm n°2 with two patients randomized in Arm n°1 for one
      patient randomized in Arm n°2.

      The trial population is composed of women over 18 years old with triple-negative and androgen
      receptor positive, locally recurrent (unresectable) or metastatic breast cancer.
