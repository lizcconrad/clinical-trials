    <textblock>
      This study tests whether galantamine (GAL) reduces HIV-related inflammation and cognitive
      deficits. In this double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study, HIV-infected individuals
      (N=120; 60 smokers and 60 non-smokers) will be randomized to 12 weeks of GAL or placebo,
      followed by a 4-week washout, then 12 weeks of GAL or placebo (arms switched). Outcomes are
      monocyte/macrophage and T cell activation and neurocognitive performance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although anti-retroviral therapy (ART) enhances life expectancy and overall quality of life
      (QoL), HIV-infected individuals are increasingly vulnerable to non-AIDS-related diseases
      including HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Inflammation is a primary mechanism
      in the pathogenesis of HAND and tobacco use may further exacerbate inflammation. Conversely,
      nicotine alone has anti-inflammatory effects suggesting that stimulating the cholinergic
      pathway via pharmacological treatment [e.g., galantamine (GAL)] may suppress inflammation and
      reverse or prevent neurocognitive deficits in HIV-1 infection. In this double-blind,
      placebo-controlled crossover study, HIV-infected individuals (N=120; 60 smokers, 60
      nonsmokers) will be randomized to 12 weeks of GAL or placebo, followed by a 4-week washout,
      then 12 weeks of GAL or placebo (arms switched). All subjects will be stable on ART and the
      GAL dose will follow FDA guidelines. At the beginning and end of each treatment phase,
      inflammatory biomarkers and viral load will be assessed. Monocyte transcriptomics will also
      be assessed on a subset of the sample (n=60; 30/group). Neurocognition and clinical outcomes
      (e.g., QoL) will be measured at baseline and at 4-week intervals during each treatment phase.
      The primary outcomes are monocyte/macrophage and T-cell activation (CD16, CD163, and CC
      chemokine receptor type 2 or CCR2 expression; plasma CC chemokine ligand type 2 or CCL2
      [MCP-1 or monocyte chemoattractant protein-1], sCD14; CD38/HLA-DR [cluster of differentiation
      38/Human Leukocyte Antigen- antigen D Related] on CD8 [cluster of differentiation 8] cells)
      and neurocognitive performance (processing speed, verbal learning/memory, executive
      function). Exploratory outcomes include monocyte gene expression patterns and broad plasma
      cytokine analysis. This study will provide insight into the interactions among nAChR
      activation, HIV immune activation and pathogenesis, and tobacco use and has translational and
      therapeutic implications that could improve health outcomes among HIV-infected individuals.

    <description>Cognitive function will be assessed 8 times throughout study participation at Lab Visits and Mid-treatment Visits. Participants will complete measures of executive function, verbal learning and memory and response inhibition. The primary outcome is the change from baseline cognitive function after 12 weeks of treatment. Because this is a within-subject crossover study, change in cognition will be measured during each treatment arm.</description>

    <description>This study follows the FDA-recommended dosing regimen for galantamine extended release (GAL ER): 4 weeks at 8 mg (once a day), 4 weeks at 16 mg (once a day), and 4 weeks at 24 mg (once a day).
The University of Pennsylvania Investigational Drug Service (IDS) will oversee the randomization of all study medication, purchase study medication, manufacture matched placebo, encapsulate and package them in blister packs to maintain double-blind procedures.</description>

Placebo ingredients will be purchased, encapsulated, and packaged into blister packs by the IDS at the University of Pennsylvania. Both active medication and placebo will look identical.
The study medication assignments for each participant in this project is randomized and counterbalanced. This means that approximately 50% of participants will take galantamine during the first medication period, followed by the placebo in the second medication period. Alternatively, approximately 50% of participants will take the placebo during the first medication period, followed by galantamine during the second medication period.</description>
