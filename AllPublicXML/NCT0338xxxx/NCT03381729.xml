  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of intrathecal
      administration of AVXS-101 in patients with Spinal Muscular Atrophy with 3 copies of SMN2
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, single-dose administration study of infants and children with a genetic
      diagnosis consistent with SMA, bi-allelic deletion of SMN1 and 3 copies of SMN2 without the
      genetic modifier who are able to sit but cannot stand or walk at the time of study entry.
      Patients will receive AVXS-101 in a dose comparison safety study of two potential therapeutic
      doses (3 patients at each dose). Patients will be stratified in two groups, those &lt; 24 months
      of age at time of dosing and those ≥ 24 months and &lt; 60 months of age at time of dosing.
      Fifteen (15) patients &lt; 24 months will be enrolled and twelve (12) patients ≥ 24 &lt; 60 months
      will be enrolled.

      The first cohort will enroll three (3) patients (Cohort 1) &lt; 24 months of age who will
      receive administration of 6.0e13 vg of AVXS-101 (Dose A). There will be at least a four (4)
      week interval between the dosing of each patient within the cohort. The investigators will
      confer with the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) on all Grade III or higher AEs within 48
      hours of awareness that are possibly, probably, or definitely related to the study agent
      before continuing enrollment. Safety data will be reviewed by the DSMB during quarterly
      meetings; following enrollment of the three patients and based upon the available safety data
      a decision will be made whether to: a) stop due to toxicity, or b) proceed to Cohort 2 using
      Dose B.

      Should the determination be made to advance to Dose B, three (3) patients &lt; 60 months of age
      will be enrolled (Cohort 2) and will receive administration of 1.2e14 vg of AVXS-101 (Dose
      B). Again, there will be at least a four-week interval between dosing of the three patients
      within the cohort. Based on the available safety data from the three Cohort 2 patients and
      all of the Cohort 1 patients, the DSMB may decide and document during quarterly meetings that
      further four-week intervals between patients dosing is unnecessary. AveXis, Inc. will take
      this recommendation into consideration and will make the final determination whether to
      persist with four-week intervals between patients dosing going forward; the decision will be
      communicated to sites and Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) in a formal sponsor letter. The
      investigators will confer with the DSMB on all Grade III or higher AEs within 48 hours of
      awareness that are possibly, probably, or definitely related to the study agent before
      continuing enrollment. Safety data will be reviewed by the DSMB during quarterly meetings;
      following enrollment of the first six (6) patients and based upon available safety data, a
      decision will be made whether to: a) stop due to toxicity, or b) continue to enroll an
      additional 21 patients until there are a total of twelve (12) patients &lt; 24 months and twelve
      (12) patients ≥ 24 and &lt; 60 months that have received Dose B.

      All patients in the study will be followed for a total of 12 months. The primary analyses for
      efficacy will be assessed when all patients reach 12 months post-dose.

          -  Patients up to 60 months (1800 days) of age at time of dosing following diagnostic
             confirmation during screening period by genotype who demonstrate the ability to sit
             unassisted for 10 or more seconds but cannot stand or walk

          -  Contraindications for spinal tap procedure or administration of intrathecal therapy
             (e.g., spina bifida, meningitis, impairment, or clotting abnormalities, or obstructive
             spinal hardware preventing effective access to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) space) or
             presence of an implanted shunt for the drainage of CSF or an implanted central venous
             (CNS) catheter

          -  Severe contractures as determined by designated Physical Therapist(s) at screening
             that interfere with either the ability to attain/demonstrate functional measures
             (e.g., standing, walking) or interferes with ability to receive intrathecal (IT)
             dosing

          -  Severe scoliosis (defined as ≥ 50° curvature of spine) evident on X-ray examination

          -  Previous, planned or expected scoliosis repair surgery/procedure within 1 year of dose
             administration

          -  Use of invasive ventilatory support (tracheotomy with positive pressure) or pulse
             oximetry &lt; 95% saturation at screening while the patient is awake

          -  Use or requirement of non-invasive ventilatory support for 12 or more hours daily over
             the two (2) weeks prior to dosing

          -  Medical necessity for a gastric feeding tube, where the majority of feedings are given
             by non-oral methods (i.e., nasogastric tube or nasojejunal tube) or patients whose
             weight-for-age falls below the 3rd percentile based on WHO Child Growth Standards
             (Onis 2006). Placement of a permanent gastrostomy prior to screening is not an
             exclusion
