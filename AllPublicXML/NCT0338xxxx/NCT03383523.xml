      This study evaluates 2 new immediate release (IR)-tablet formulations of emodepside and they
      will be compared to the oral liquid service formulation (LSF) used in the FIH Single
      Ascending Dose study (DNDi-EMO-001 study) (CT.gov identifier: NCT02661178)

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is an urgent need for a macrofilaricidal drug, killing or sterilizing permanently O.
      volvulus adult worms, which could be used in individual case management and, after
      appropriate testing, as an alternative drug to ivermectin in MDA programs. Emodepside is a
      promising candidate to kill the adult and sexually mature O. volvulus. Emodepside was shown
      to be macrofilaricidal against a variety of filarial nematodes and is a registered drug for
      animal health, commercialized by Bayer AG under the name of Profender速 (in combination with
      praziquantel) or Procox速 (in combination with toltrazuril).

      A first-in-human (FIH) double-blind, placebo-controlled study of single ascending doses of
      emodepside in healthy Caucasian men has been conducted and the preliminary results are
      favourable, and support continuing the Phase I development program. For this reason, new
      tablet formulations have been developped and the present study will evaluate bioavailability,
      PK safety and tolerability, and as well food effect of single doses of 2 new immediate
      release (IR)-tablet formulations of emodepside compared to the oral liquid service
      formulation (LSF) used in the FIH study.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a single-centre, open-label, randomized, parallel-group relative bioavailability study in healthy men. The study will be done in 2 parts, as follows:
Part 1 - single oral doses of 5 mg emodepside will be tested:
Part 1a - the LSF (reference formulation) and 2 new IR-tablet formulations (test formulations) will be administered in the fasted state.
Part 1b - the 2 new IR-tablet formulations will be administered in the fed state (high-fat, high-calorie meal).
Part 2 - single oral doses of 10 mg emodepside will be tested: depending on the results from Part 1, one or both IR-tablet formulations will be administered in the fasted state.</intervention_model_description>
