  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of the optimal and late initiation of
      dialysis on the mortality and quality of life in advanced chronic kidney disease patients by
      the Dialysis Initiation based on Fuzzy mathematics Equation (DIFE), which is a novel equation
      for the assessment of timing of dialysis initiation established by Fuzzy mathematics.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The optimal time of dialysis initiation is still controversial. Estimated glomerular
      filtration rate (eGFR) which is now widely used as the assessment of timing of dialysis is
      lack of specificity. Some clinical factors such as heart failure, volume overload,
      malnutrition also determine the dialysis time. But these subjective judgements do not have a
      standard. So there is no quantitative assessment of timing of dialysis initiation. The
      research team developed a novel equation named DIFE (Dialysis Initiation based on Fuzzy
      mathematics Equation) with data from a retrospective multicenter cohort by fuzzy mathematical
      methods to combine these clinical factors and lab indexes. The DIFE was confirmed to be more
      accurate and convenient to use in clinical practice than eGFR only at the assessment of
      dialysis initiation time in the internal validation. For further validation of the DIFE, the
      team will conduct a multicenter randomized controlled trial. Patients who need hemodialysis
      will be randomized to optimal start group or late start group by the assessment of the DIFE.
      Based on the comparison of the two groups, this trial will provide evidence for the optimal
      timing of dialysis initiation in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease by the DIFE.
