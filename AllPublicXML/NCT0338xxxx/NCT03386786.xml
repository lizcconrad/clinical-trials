  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-center, randomized, comparative, controlled study. Princeton
      HealthCare System will enroll a total of 296 subjects (18 years or older) who are electing to
      have total knee or hip replacement surgery. Subjects will be randomized to either the
      treatment group (Health Partner alongside standard care) or the control group (standard care
      alone). Health Partner is a combination of an iPhone or iPod Touch Operating System mobile
      application and a health care provider portal. The primary objective is to compare care plan
      adherence (pre- and post-surgery) for Health Partner vs. control subjects. Secondary
      objectives include evaluating all-cause medical resource utilization, communication with
      health care provider, well-being, fear of surgery, confidence in recovery from surgery,
      sleep, and patient satisfaction for 90 days post-surgery. The total planned study duration is
      approximately 1 year and 7 months.
