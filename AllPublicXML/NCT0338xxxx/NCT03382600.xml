      The purpose of this study is to estimate overall response rates (ORRs) of pembrolizumab +
      oxaliplatin + TS-1 and pembrolizumab + cisplatin + TS-1, as first-line treatment for gastric
      cancer in programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor
      2 (HER2/neu)-negative participants with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ)
      adenocarcinoma.

      Approximately 45 participants will be assigned first to pembrolizumab + oxaliplatin + TS-1
      combination therapy (Cohort 1), and then 45 participants will be assigned to pembrolizumab +
      cisplatin + TS-1 combination therapy (Cohort 2).

    <time_frame>Up to ~2 years</time_frame>
    <description>For the primary efficacy analysis, ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who have a best response of Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or Partial Response (PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters [SOD] of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters) per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR.</description>

    <description>For the secondary efficacy analysis, ORR is defined as the percentage of participants whose best response based on imaging is CR (disappearance of all lesions) or PR (≥30% decrease in the SOD of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters) according to iRECIST as assessed by BICR. iRECIST is a modification to RECIST that takes into account unique patterns of atypical response in immunotherapy and enables treatment beyond initial radiographic progression. At initial Progressive Disease (PD) by RECIST 1.1, if participant is clinically stable the investigator may continue to treat and scan again 4-8 weeks later to see if PD confirmed by iRECIST criteria.</description>

    <description>For participants who demonstrate CR or PR according to RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR, DOR is defined as the time from the earliest date of qualifying response (CR or PR) until earliest date of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever comes first. DOR will be censored at the last tumor assessment date if a responder does not have PD or death.</description>
