      This project will investigate the safety and effectiveness of human amniotic epithelial cells
      for treatment of severe refractory Asherman's syndrome.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asherman's syndrome is an gynecological disorder caused by the destruction of the endometrium
      due to repeated or aggressive curettages and/or endometritis. As a result, there is a loss of
      functional endometrium in multiple areas and the uterine cavity is obliterated by
      intrauterine adhesions, which results in amenorrhea, hypomenorrhea, infertility and recurrent
      pregnancy loss. Transcervical resection of adhesion (TCRA) is the main treatment for
      Asherman's syndrome; so far the effect is usually poor in moderate to severe refractory
      cases.

      Human amniotic epithelial cells (hAECs) are derived from human amniotic epithelium. hAECs
      retain the characteristics approximating to embryonic stem cells. Animal experiments have
      shown that the endometrial thickness and fertility of mice was significantly improved after
      intrauterine therapy with amniotic epithelial cells. To further explore the role of hAECs in
      Asherman's syndrome patients, this project will evaluate the safety of hAECs and find an
      effective treatment protocols.
