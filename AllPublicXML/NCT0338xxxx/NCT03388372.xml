    <description>Temozolomide, 75 mg/m2/d was administered orally from the first to the last day of RT. After 4-week break, individualized adjuvant TMZ was given based on MGMT status. The standard 5-day schedule every 4 weeks for six cycles was given for patients with negative MGMT expression. Dose was 150mg/m2 for the first cycle and 200 mg/m2 from the second cycle. The 7-day on/7-day off schedule every 2 weeks for 12 cycles was given for patients with positive MGMT expression. The dose was 100 mg/m2 for the first two cycles and 150 mg/m2 starting from the third cycle.</description>
