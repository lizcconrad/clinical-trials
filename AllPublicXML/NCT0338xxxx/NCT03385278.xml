    <textblock>
      Transcranial magnetic stimulation involves the use of alternating magnetic fields to
      stimulate neurons in the brain.To date, several studies have focused on the use of TMS in
      patients with impaired consciousness.However,its therapeutic effects have been variously
      documented.So,in this study ,investigators explore the effects of rTMS with cross-over
      design.

      Background:Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) was supposed as an
      experimental approach to disorders of consciousness treatment. Its therapeutic effects have
      been variously documented.

      Objective: The study aimed to investigate the reactivity of electroencephalography (EEG) and
      the clinical response of patients with disorders of consciousness and explore the
      neuromodulatory effects of high-frequency rTMS in DOC.

      Method:In this randomised,sham-controlled study,real or sham 20 Hz rTMS were applied to the
      left primary motor cortex (M1) of participants with disorders of consciousness for 5
      consecutive days . Evaluations were blindly performed at baseline, immediately after the end
      of the 5-days treatment and 1 week later with the JFK Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R)
      scale and EEG.

      Hypothesis:Real rTMS can be an effective awakening method.

    <description>The CRS-R is a tool used to characterise the level of consciousness.The CRS-R is a tool used to characterize the level of consciousness and to monitor neurobehavioural recovery in DOC. The scale consists of 23 hierarchically arranged items that comprise six subscales addressing the auditory, visual, motor, oromotor/verbal, communication and arousal processes. The lowest item on each subscale represents reflexive activity whereas the highest item represents cognitively mediated behaviors.</description>

    <description>delta (1-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (12-30 Hz).an increase of delta and theta activity usually reflects encephalopathy and/or structural lesions, interpreted as poor outcome predictor of DOC .The power of α and β is related to the chance of recovery.</description>
