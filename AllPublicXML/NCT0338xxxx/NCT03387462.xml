  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The researchers are working with a technology company, AiCure, to develop a smartphone app,
      DOT Diary, which combines two drug adherence strategies. DOT Diary reminds people when it is
      time to take their medication, and uses motion-sensing technology to visually and
      automatically confirm the pill was swallowed. The goal of this study is to understand
      people's experiences using this new app while taking HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for
      the prevention of HIV.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the DOT Diary research project, the AiCure aDOT smartphone app has been adapted for use in
      monitoring and supporting HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use among young men who have
      sex with men (YMSM). The aDOT app uses automated directly observed therapy (DOT) that use the
      smartphone camera and artificial intelligence software to confirm that the right person is
      taking the right medication at the right time. A sexual diary has been integrated into the
      aDOT app to assist YMSM in understanding whether they are receiving protection from PrEP for
      individual sexual episodes, and when it is particularly important to take PrEP (e.g. after a
      sexual episode).

      In the next stage of app development, the researchers are conducting this study to identify
      areas of the app that require refinement to maximize the acceptability and ease of use of the
      DOT adherence monitoring app. The researchers will assess overall acceptability and ease of
      use of the integrated DOT Diary (D2) app over an 8 week period.The goal of this pilot study
      will be to refine and optimize the app for further testing in a larger and longer pilot study
      among YMSM at risk for HIV acquisition. The researchers will conduct this pilot protocol
      among YMSM in Atlanta and San Francisco Bay Area, two metropolitan regions heavily impacted
      by HIV, yet differing in sociodemographics, as well as in the availability and uptake of HIV
      prevention services, including PrEP. These diverse research locations will allow collection
      of data to inform app development among a broad group of YMSM.
