  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While reducing arsenic (As) exposure in Bangladesh and the U.S. must continue to be a top
      priority, this has proven difficult. After decades of mitigation efforts, 42 million people
      in Bangladesh remain exposed to As above 10 μg/L, the World Health Organization guideline for
      arsenic in drinking water. The risk for arsenic-induced health outcomes persists decades
      after exposure has been reduced. Innovative strategies that lower arsenic exposure and
      contribute to mitigating the health effects of arsenic are needed. The main goals of this
      study are to evaluate whether supplementation with folate and vitamin B12 to 8 to 10 year old
      children, in conjunction with reduction in arsenic exposure, can increase arsenic methylation
      and lower blood arsenic and blood monomethyl arsenic (as previously observed in adults). The
      investigators will also explore whether folate and B12 can mitigate arsenic-related
      decrements in cognitive abilities.

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in WASI-II cognitive function test score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An improvement in scores on a test of cognitive function after receiving dietary supplements represent potential partial mitigation of arsenic- and nutrition-related cognitive decrements. Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI-II) is a screen of verbal, non-verbal, and general cognitive ability. Higher score indicates higher cognitive function. Scores on the WASI-II can range from below 70 (demonstrating cognitive deficiency) to above 200 (demonstrating incredible genius) - typical &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;average&quot; scores are between 90-100. Higher values indicate a better score in terms of cognitive outcome while lower values indicate a poorer score. An improvement on WASI-II test scores for these participants would be demonstrated in a higher score on this test after receiving the intervention.</description>
