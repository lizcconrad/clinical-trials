  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the first most common cause of death in China and one of the major causes of
      functional disability in the adult population.The burden of stoke is significantly increased
      in China in recent years.

      In order to investigate the prognosis of stroke, with diagnostic and treatment information of
      traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), and assess the effectiveness and safety of TCM for stroke
      in southern China, the investigators will conduct this multicenter prospective registry study
      in southern China. This study will recruit 10,000 consecutive eligible patients with acute
      stroke from more than 50 hospitals. 24 months follow-up will be carried out on-site in
      hospitals and by telephone to track endpoint (including all-cause mortality, composite
      cerebrovascular and cardiovascular events at one and two year follow up, and neurological and
      functional assessments).
