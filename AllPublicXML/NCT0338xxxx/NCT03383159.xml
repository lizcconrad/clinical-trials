      Patients with colorectal cancer are known to be at high risk of developing metachronous
      adenoma, however, participation in colonoscopy are low. Colonoscopy, the primary modality
      used all over the word, is costly and invasive, and its efficacy depends on the endoscopist's
      skill and the patient's bowel preparation. As life expectancy of patients with history of
      colon cancer is increasing, colonoscopy would increase the overall cost for patients and for
      the health care system. This study aim to construct a predictive model of postoperative
      colorectal neoplasm development using microbiota analysis.

      Colorectal cancer(CRC) is one of the most common malignancies in China and in Western
      countries. Furthermore, those with a history of CRC are at a higher risk for developing
      metachronous adenomas or CRC recurrence during the followup period. It has been reported that
      0.7% of patients develop metachronous CRC during the 3 years after surgical resection for the
      initial CRC.

      Surveillance colonoscopy is highly recommended by major international scientific societies
      with the intent of either detecting anastomotic recurrence at an early, curable stage or
      identifying metachronous premalignant(ie, adenomas) and malignant lesions. As life expectancy
      of patients with history of colon cancer is increasing, the costly and invasive postoperative
      examination increased the overall cost and suffering for patients.

      The human colon plays host to a diverse and metabolically complex community of
      microorganisms. While colonic microbiome development along the colorectal adenoma-carcinoma
      sequence. Investigators speculate that gut microbiota related to metachronous adenoma or CRC,
      after curative treatment.

      This study aim to discover if any difference of gut microbiota exist in patients who suffer
      from metachronous adenomas compared with patients who do not. Further try to seek the
      divergence microbiota of metachronous adenomas between Proximal and Distal Colorectum.
      construct a predictive model of postoperative colorectal neoplasm development using
      microbiota analysis. Finally, using microbita construct a predictive model of postoperative
      colorectal neoplasm development.

        All the patients underwent an exhaustive colorectal cancer surgical resection in the First
        Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University from December 1, 2012 to April 28, 2017.
        Each participant provided a fresh stool sample in hospital before bowel preparation or 1
        month after colonoscopy. All patients did not use antibiotics and probiotics 3 mouth before
        samples collection.
