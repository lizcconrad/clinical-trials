  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric tonsillectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures annually in the United
      States; risks include postoperative hemorrhage and poor pain control. Controversy exists
      regarding optimal pharmacologic pain management following surgery, as each drug's efficacy is
      balanced by its specific side effects. Ibuprofen is effective in controlling postoperative
      pain following tonsillectomy, but its mechanism of action results in decreased platelet
      function, which may increase postoperative bleeding events. This is a multicenter, randomized
      control non-inferiority trial designed to assess the relationship between short-course
      ibuprofen use and post-tonsillectomy bleeding when compared to acetaminophen.

    <textblock>
      Pediatric tonsillectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures in the United States,
      with over 500,000 procedures performed annually.1,2 The most common indications for
      tonsillectomy with and without adenoidectomy are sleep-disordered breathing and recurrent
      tonsillitis, though significant demographic and regional variation exist.2 In recent years,
      particular attention has been paid to the deleterious sequelae of pediatric obstructive sleep
      apnea on children's behavior, cognition, and growth as well as its negative effects on
      long-term pulmonary and cardiovascular health.3-5 Tonsillectomy is generally considered a
      safe procedure, though potential exists for significant procedural morbidity. Potential risks
      associated with tonsillectomy include postoperative hemorrhage, airway risk, aspiration, burn
      injury, post-operative nausea and vomiting, and poor pain control.6,7 Postoperative
      hemorrhage is the most serious post-tonsillectomy complication and can be divided according
      to timing (primary occurring &lt;24 hours from surgery, or secondary occurring &gt;24 hours after
      surgery) and severity (level 1: any history of bleeding, level 2: bleeding requiring
      inpatient admission, level 3: bleeding requiring operative intervention). Following
      discharge, inadequate analgesia can result in secondary complications such as dehydration,
      nausea, bleeding, hospital readmission, and increased healthcare expenditures.8,9

      Significant controversy exists as to the optimal pain management protocol following pediatric
      tonsillectomy.8,9 Many studies have examined both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic
      modalities to improve pain control in this population. The most common medications prescribed
      after tonsillectomy include acetaminophen (paracetamol), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
      drugs (NSAIDs) (e.g. ibuprofen), and narcotic pain medications, each with a unique mode of
      action and risk profile.8,10-12 Acetaminophen, which has both peripheral and central
      anti-nociceptive properties, is generally well-tolerated with low incidence of serious side
      effects, but may not provide adequate pain control when used at recommended pediatric
      dosages.13 Narcotic (opioid) pain medications act on the mu opioid receptor and effectively
      decrease sensory and affective components of pain.14 Unfortunately, opioid pain medications
      also result in dose-dependent respiratory depression; a significant contraindication in
      patients with sleep-disordered breathing.15,16 The FDA has released a warning cautioning
      against the use of codeine, an opioid, for postoperative analgesia following tonsillectomy.7
      Furthermore, emerging data suggests that adolescent patients receiving prescription for
      narcotic pain medication may be at risk for long-term opioid dependence and addiction.17
      NSAIDs provide analgesia through reversible COX-1 and COX-2 pathway inhibition which results
      in decreased prostaglandin-induced inflammation and edema.18 This mechanism of action also
      interferes with platelet aggregation, potentially impacting bleeding in the postoperative
      period. Ibuprofen, a derivative of propionic acid, is one of the most commonly prescribed
      NSAID medications, with a half-life of less than 12 hours.19,20 Pain control in patients
      receiving NSAIDs is equivalent, or superior to, those receiving acetaminophen alone or in
      combination with narcotic medication.21-23 In 2011, the American Academy of Pediatrics
      released its Clinical Practice Guidelines, which stated that ibuprofen can safely be used for
      postoperative analgesia following tonsillectomy24, a recommendation based on a 2005 Cochrane
      Review of NSAIDs and post-tonsillectomy bleeding. The most recent Cochrane review on this
      topic, published in 2012 and based on 15 randomized control trials (RCTs), concludes that
      there is insufficient evidence available to exclude an increased risk of bleeding with NSAID
      use following pediatric tonsillectomy.25 This is supported by data from a prospective,
      randomized control non-inferiority trial conducted at our own institution, in which
      participants received either ibuprofen or acetaminophen for 9 days following surgery. In this
      study, an increased rate of post-tonsillectomy bleeding requiring operative intervention
      could not be excluded because the non-inferiority threshold was crossed. The duration of safe
      NSAID use, if any, after tonsillectomy is unknown. A study definitively documenting safety
      and efficacy of short-course NSAID administration following tonsillectomy in children would
      affect our own standard of care as well as overall clinical practice guidelines.

      This study serves as a follow-up clinical trial to a double-blind randomized control
      non-inferiority trial titled &quot;Postoperative Ibuprofen and the Risk of Bleeding After
      Tonsillectomy with or without Adenoidectomy&quot; conducted from 2012 to 2016 at Massachusetts Eye
      and Ear and collaborating institutions. In this study, participants were randomized to
      receive either ibuprofen (10 mg/kg every 6 hours) or acetaminophen (15 mg/kg every 6 hours)
      for 9 days following surgery. The non-inferiority margin was set at 3%. Increased type 3
      bleeding (bleeding requiring operative intervention) could not be excluded because the
      non-inferiority threshold was crossed.

      In this study, type 3 bleeding occurred in the ibuprofen group on an average postoperative
      day of 5.95. Additional analyses were conducted on study subjects who discontinued the study
      drugs prior to postoperative day 9 (the scheduled end point). A total of 50 patients
      discontinued study medication on or before postoperative day 3. Of these, 21 were randomized
      to the ibuprofen arm and 0/21 experienced postoperative bleeding events.

      A recent systematic review by Tan et al examined commonly used medications following
      tonsillectomy and efficacy and risks associated with each drug.8 Acetaminophen is commonly
      used following tonsillectomy given its low side effect profile; however, analgesia is often
      inadequate at recommended dosages.26 Despite a 2013 FDA warning cautioning against opioid use
      following pediatric tonsillectomy due to increased risk of respiratory depression, these
      medications continue to be prescribed following surgery. The majority of tonsillectomies are
      now performed for sleep apnea and sleep disordered breathing; therefore, a large proportion
      of patients have increased risk of respiratory compromise and desaturations following surgery
      when opioid medications are administered.22 Furthermore, emerging data suggests that a
      significant fraction of adolescent patients receiving opioid pain medications postoperatively
      may subsequently develop addiction to these medications.17 NSAIDs are effective for
      post-tonsillectomy analgesia, but concerns remain regarding increased risk of postoperative
      hemorrhage with use of these medications despite current American Academy of Pediatrics
      recommendations advocate that ibuprofen may be safely utilized following tonsillectomy in
      children. Studies to date demonstrate conflicting or equivocal results with regard to
      increased bleeding risk following NSAID administration. Given previous data from this
      institution which cannot exclude increased incidence of type 3 bleeding following 9 days of
      ibuprofen exposure, MEE standard of practice is to recommend against extended duration of
      ibuprofen use in the postoplerative period. However, given concerns of inadequate analgesia
      with acetaminophen and respiratory depression and addictive potential with opioid medication,
      we feel that it is important to assess for postoperative time interval where NSAID
      medications may be safely administered without increasing incidence of postoperative bleeding
      events.

      We propose a study comparing impact of maximally-dosed ibuprofen (10 mg/kg every 6 hours)
      versus maximally-dosed acetaminophen (15 mg/kg every 6 hours) on postoperative pain and
      bleeding when administered for four days (short-course) to children age 2-18 undergoing
      tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy. We believe that a four-day course of medication
      is appropriate given that the majority of post-tonsillectomy bleeding events occurred on day
      6 and the half-life of ibuprofen is such that platelet function returns to baseline within 24
      hours of drug discontinuation20. We hypothesize that children aged 2-18 receiving
      short-course ibuprofen following tonsillectomy will not have increased incidence of bleeding
      when compared to patients receiving acetaminophen postoperatively. A study definitively
      documenting safety and efficacy of short-course NSAID administration following tonsillectomy
      in children would affect our own standard of care as well as overall clinical practice
      guidelines surrounding this procedure.
