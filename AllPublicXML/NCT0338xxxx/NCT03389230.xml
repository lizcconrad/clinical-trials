      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of memory-enriched T cells in
      treating patients with grade II-IV glioma that has come back or does not respond to
      treatment. Memory enriched T cells such as HER2(EQ)BBζ/CD19t+-expressing Tcm may enter and
      express its genes in immune cells. Immune cells can be engineered to kill glioma cells in the
      laboratory by inserting a piece of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) into the immune cells that
      allows them to recognize glioma cells. A vector called lentivirus is used to carry the piece
      of DNA into the immune cell. It is not known whether these immune cells will kill glioma
      tumor cells when given to patients.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the feasibility and safety of intracavitary/intratumoral (arm 1),
      intraventricular (arm 2), or dual delivery (arm 3: both intracavitary /intratumoral and
      intraventricular) cellular immunotherapy utilizing autologous HER2(EQ)BBζ/CD19t+-expressing
      cells for adult research participants with recurrent/refractory malignant glioma.

      II. To determine maximum tolerated dose schedule (MTD) and a recommended Phase II dosing plan
      (RP2D) for treatment arms 1 (intracavitary/intratumoral) and 3 (dual delivery). An MTD for
      arm 2 will only be sought if arm 3 is found to be too toxic.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe persistence and expansion of CAR T cells in peripheral blood and cerebral
      spinal fluid (CSF).

      II. To describe cytokine levels (tumor cyst fluid, peripheral blood, and CSF) over the study
      period.

      III. To estimate the six month progression free survival (PFS) rate in research participants
      who receive the full schedule of 3 CAR T cell doses.

      IV. To estimate disease response rates in research participants who receive the full schedule
      of 3 CAR T cell doses.

      V. To estimate median overall survival (OS)in research participants who receive the full
      schedule of 3 CAR T cell doses .

      VI. To evaluate CAR T cell persistence in the tumor tissue and the location of the CAR T
      cells with respect to the injection in research participants who undergo an additional
      resection or autopsy.

      VII. To evaluate HER2 antigen expression levels on tumor tissue pre and post CAR T cell
      therapy in research participants who undergo an additional resection or autopsy.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of HER2(EQBBζ/CD19t+-expressing Tcm.

      Patients undergo leukapheresis over 2-4 hours. Beginning approximately 21 days later,
      patients receive HER2(EQ)BBζ/CD19t+-expressing Tcm via catheter over 5 minutes on days 0, 7,
      and 14. Patients may receive additional doses of HER2(EQ)BBζ/CD19t+-expressing Tcm up to the
      highest cell dose that is deemed safe.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks, 3, 6, 8, 10 and 12
      months, then annually for at least 15 years.
