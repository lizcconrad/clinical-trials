  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The software embedded in recent continuous positive pressure devices enables the analysis of
      the level of leakage that occurs during treatment around the mask or from the mouth. However,
      there is no clear threshold defining when it would be appropriate to implement means for
      correcting these leaks. In addition, the calculation methods used to detect/measure leaks and
      the terminology used vary according to the manufacturers of continuous pressure devices,
      which also complicates the clinical interpretation of the leakage reports provided by the
      various devices.

      In daily practice, when a patient complains of unintentional leakage, technicians adjust the
      mask, replace the nasal-mask by an oro-nasal mask or install a chinstrap. Nevertheless, those
      strategies are not always effective in reducing leakage or patient's complaints. A better
      understanding of the mechanisms beyond leak appearance for a given patient could lead to
      individualised leak-treatment solutions. Pressure level, mandibular behaviour, respiratory
      effort, sleep position or sleep stages may contribute to leak emergence.

      A recent exploratory study has proposed a genuine analysis method of determining factors of
      unintentional-leaks using polysomnographic recordings in OSA patients treated with automatic
      Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (auto-CPAP). Based on the same methodology, the NOMICS
      company (Liège, Belgium) has developed a polygraphic device (Brizzy®) recording unintentional
      leakage during auto-CPAP treatment and providing an etiological analysis of
      unintentional-leaks via a software named APIOS.

      Due to the innovative nature of the analysis, it appears necessary to validate it onto a
      population of OSA patients treated with auto-CPAP. Also, to our knowledge, there is no
      descriptive data of the distribution of the determinants of unintentional leaks in such a
      population. From this perspective, the investigators aim to retrospectively analyse some
      polygraphic recordings that have been performed with the Brizzy® on OSA patients treated with
      auto-CPAP.

      The primary objective of this study is to identify and describe the determinants of
      unintentional leaks for a population of patients with OSA and treated with an auto-CPAP
      device

      The secondary objectives are:

        1. to evaluate the concordance of the determinants of leaks according to different leak
           thresholds (0 l/min ; 5l/min ; 10l/min : 20l/min).

        2. to describe any technical problems that arise in relation to the analysis of leaks in
           the study population.
