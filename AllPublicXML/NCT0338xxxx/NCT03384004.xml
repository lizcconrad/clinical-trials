    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to assess with PA x-rays and CBCT scans the volumetric
      changes in periapical radiolucencies in endodontically treated teeth 1 year after endodontic
      treatment and evaluate how well the lateral canals are filled after irrigation with the new
      generation of negative irrigation pressure unit with and without the ultrasonic irrigation.

    <textblock>
      This is a single center, prospective clinical study conducted in patients who present for
      routine endodontic therapy. The study has been reviewed and approved by the Institutional
      Review Board (Ethics Committee) Aspire IRB located at Santee, CA. The clinical investigator
      will treat patients who present with radiographic evidence of periapical pathology and will
      randomize the subjects to either negative pressure irrigation system treatment (EndoVac Pure)
      with ultrasonic irrigation or negative pressure irrigation system treatment (Endovac Pure)
      without ultrasonic irrigation. All other aspects of the treatment (access, instrumentation
      and obturation will be according to clinicians conventional clinical judgment. Subjects will
      have a pre-treatment PA x-ray and CBCT scan before treatment, a PA x-ray at six months and a
      CBCT scan at one year post-treatment.

    <description>Compare the outcome of periapical radiographic healing 6 months and 1 year after endodontic treatment
The Periapical Radiographs will be analyzed and the size of the lesion will be measured in two dimensions: mesio-distal and coronal-apical. The lesion will be evaluated based on the findings below:
Evaluation of Radiographic Findings:
Normal periapical structures
Small changes in bone structures (PAI ≤2)
Changes in bone structures (PAI ≥3)
Periodontitis with well- defined radiolucent area
Severe periodontitis</description>

    <description>Irrigation of root canals for this group will be performed using EndoVac Pure, an Apical Negative Pressure Endodontic Irrigation System intended for the delivery and evacuation of endodontic irrigation solutions during root canal procedures. The Endovac Pure is a negative pressure system that utilizes negative pressure irrigation so irrigants are suctioned apically from the pulp chamber to the apical terminus and then through the dental office High Volume Evacuation (HVE) valve (Hi-VAC) system. Endovac Pure is designed to be used with Sodium Hypochlorite (NaOCl or bleach) and EDTA (Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid). This will be followed by Ultrasonic activation of the sodium hypochlorite solution using Minendo II ultrasonic unit.</description>
