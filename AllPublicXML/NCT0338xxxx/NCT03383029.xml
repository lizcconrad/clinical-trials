  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about the eating behaviors of children with
      chronic food refusal. Specifically, investigator's aim to see how the integrated Eating
      Aversion Treatment (iEAT) may affect a child's food consumption. The manual is a structured
      multidisciplinary treatment, including a psychologist and dietitian with consultation from a
      speech-language pathologist. The treatment is designed to increase the volume of foods a
      child eats and decrease their reliance on a feeding tube or formula. The manual includes
      informational handouts, data collection forms, and instructions to guide the increase in
      feeding demands while reducing reliance on formula to meet a child's nutritional needs.

      Children with chronic food refusal will participate in this study at the Marcus Autism
      Center. All children who enroll will receive the iEAT treatment. This involves 10 bi-weekly
      sessions that last approximately one hour, over the course of 5 months and a 1 month
      follow-up visit. Therefore, the study will last a total of 6 months.

    <textblock>
      This study seeks to further the development of iEAT by including participants that
      demonstrated improvements in a previously conducted pilot study, and finalize the treatment
      manual to include the standardized decision rules to increase feeding demands, further
      integrate the multidisciplinary team (nutrition and speech pathology), and include
      supplementary sessions to better address individual treatment needs.

      Investigators propose to enroll participants with chronic food refusal and formula or feeding
      tube dependence. Treatment will involve 10 biweekly outpatient appointments and 1 follow-up
      appointment of about 1 hour in length. Assessment and treatment will involve a
      multidisciplinary team including behavioral psychology, speech pathology and nutrition.
      Target behaviors including grams consumed, percent dependence on formula/feeding tube, and
      the clinical global impression scale, which will be assessed during a meal observation, 3-day
      food record, and evaluation with the dietitian and independent evaluator. Participants will
      be assessed pre-treatment, mid-treatment, and post-treatment and complete a one month
      follow-up to assess long term effects.

    <measure>Clinical Global Impression Scale - Improvement (CGI-I) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-Intervention (Week 20)</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-I is a seven-point scale measure of overall change from baseline. Scores will be ranked from 1 (Very Much Improved) through 4 (Unchanged) to 7 (Very Much Worse). Scores of &quot;Much Improved&quot; or &quot;Very Much Improved&quot; will be used to define positive responses; all other scores will indicate negative responses. Total scores range from 1 to 7; where 1 indicates the most improvement and 7 indicates greatest worsening.</description>

    <measure>Change in Parenting Stress Index (PSI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post-Intervention (Week 20)</time_frame>
    <description>The PSI is a 36-item measure completed by a parent or caregiver designed to screen for stress in the parent-child relationship, identifying dysfunctional parenting and child adjustment problems. Raw scores are converted into percentile scores. A score which falls between the 15th and 80th percentile is considered typical. High scores are those at or above the 85th percentile.</description>

The iEAT manual will guide behavioral intervention targeting severe feeding disorders and will involve some combination of escape extinction, reinforcement, and antecedent manipulation of food presentation to lessen the aversive quality of the meal.</description>
