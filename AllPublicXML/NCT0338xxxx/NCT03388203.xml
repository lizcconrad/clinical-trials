  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study assessed serum 25(OH)D in a cohort of 74235 outpatients by
      liquid-chromatography-tandem-mass-spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).

      The investigators studied the distribution of serum 25(OH)D concentrations in males and
      females of different age groups, the prevalence of measurable amounts of 25(OH)D2 and
      seasonal variability.

    <textblock>
      Measurements were performed under routine circumstances. Samples were collected in serum
      tubes with clot-activator. As per routine procedure, samples were centrifuged upon arrival in
      the lab and stored at 4Â° C until measurement. 25(OH)D3 and 25(OH)D2 were quantitated
      separately. Results from subjects &lt;18 years were excluded from the analysis. The study was
      approved by the local Ethics Committee.

        The investigators analyzed retrospectively all serum 25(OH)D results from outpatients ( &gt;18
        years ) that were generated between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2016 at the Central
        Laboratory of Clinical Pathology at the Bolzano Hospital (Italy). Out of 74,235 samples
        3,801 cases were identified where PTH was requested at the same occasion.
