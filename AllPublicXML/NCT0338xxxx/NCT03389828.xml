      Background:

      Sleep that does not last long and is low-quality is tied to a range of serious health issues.
      These range from obesity to early death. Research has shown that black people who are
      professionals or managers are more likely to have this kind of sleep than their white
      counterparts. Black people are also at higher risk than whites for health problems caused by
      insufficient sleep. Researchers want to learn more about why these differences exist.

      Objective:

      To study reasons for racial differences in the work-sleep relationship.

      Eligibility:

      Adults at least 25 years old who:

        -  Are non-Hispanic black or non-Hispanic white

        -  Are employed and work 38 or more hours a week

        -  Live around Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill, NC, or Washington, DC

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with questions. They will give sociodemographic data like job
      title, annual income level, and gender. They will give their contact information.

      Participants will have 1 study visit. They will be in a closed, private conference room. They
      will join a focus group. The focus groups will be organized by to race, gender, and
      occupational class.

      Participants will give informed consent before the focus group begins.

      During the focus group, participants will be asked about their perceptions of health in
      general, and their typical work day. They will be asked about sleep.

      Participants will also fill out a short questionnaire about their job and sleep habits.

      Focus groups will be audio recorded. The entire session will last 90 to 120 minutes.

      OBJECTIVE:

      Prior research has documented racial differences in sleep health by occupational class. While
      increasing professional responsibility has been associated with shorter sleep duration among
      non-Hispanic Blacks, increasing professional responsibility appears to be associated with a
      lower prevalence of short sleep duration among non-Hispanic Whites. The objective of the
      present study is to investigate reasons for these racial differences in the work-sleep
      relationship.

      STUDY POPULATION:

      The study population will consist of approximately 340 focus groups participants. All
      non-Hispanic black and white adults 25 years of age or older who are currently working at
      least 38 hours a week will be eligible for inclusion in the study. To mitigate the influence
      of known cultural differences in sleep behaviors, participation will be limited to English
      speakers born in the continental United Sates.

      DESIGN:

      We will conduct 34 demographically homogenous focus groups consisting of 7-12 participants
      each. Focus groups will be stratified based race, gender, and occupational class, and will be
      conducted in both North Carolina and the metropolitan DC area. Focus groups will take place
      in-person and be conducted by a trained facilitator according to a scripted, semi-structured
      focus group guide. Audio recordings of the focus groups will be transcribed verbatim by a
      professional transcription service. De-identified transcripts will be reviewed by the study
      team to identify qualitative themes in the data, which will be coded in an appropriate
      software program using a double-coding process. Qualitative data analysis will be conducted
      to identify potential reasons for racial differences in sleep health by occupational class.
      We will additionally assess variation by other sociodemographic determinants, including
      gender, education, income, and geographic region.

      OUTCOMES MEASURES:

      Outcome measures include the themes/patterns regarding potential system-level influences,
      beliefs, and behaviors that may explain racial differences in the association between
      occupational class and sleep health.
