  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Poor glycemic control in patients with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) is due to multiple factors and
      suboptimal dietary pattern is one of them .Assessing eating/dietary patterns (combinations of
      different foods or food groups) among individuals with diabetes may be beneficial in
      understanding the focus areas of dietary modification among the Emirati community and further
      developing dietary interventions for management of T2D. Only a few observational studies are
      reported in this region exploring the eating practices, although none to the investigators
      knowledge described the frequency of consumption of food groups in the T2D patients in the
      United Arab Emirates(UAE). Hence, in this study the investigators aim to describe the trends
      in frequency of consumption of food groups and analyze the association of frequency of food
      item consumption and glycemic control among the T2D UAE patients.

      This retrospective cross sectional study will include the data from Hospital information
      system of 800+ T2D patients to describe the trends in frequency of consumption of food groups
      and analyze the possible association of frequency of food group/item consumption and glycemic
      control.

      Type 2 diabetes (T2D) burden is not only increasing globally but also in the middle east
      region. Dietary intake plays a crucial role in ameliorating glycemia and other risk factors
      ,The aim of this study is to describe the trends in frequency of consumption of food groups
      and possible association with glycemic control among theT2D UAE patients.

      This retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted among 800+ T2D diabetic aged ≥ 18
      years, attending Rashid Centre for Diabetes and Research(RCDR) Centre located in UAE during
      January 2011 until January 2015. The dietary data will be collected from hospital records
      generated by dietitians after an interview based consultation using a structured pre-tested
      questionnaire. Multiple regression techniques will be used for model building, to determine
      the separate contribution of known confounders and food items with high carbohydrate and
      glycemic control.
