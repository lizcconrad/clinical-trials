      In this Phase 1 study, the investigators will conduct a dose-escalation study of the
      combination of BMX-001 with standard radiation therapy (RT) and concurrent 5-fluorouracil
      (5FU)/mitomycin in newly diagnosed Anal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (ASCC) patients. The primary
      objective is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BMX-001 in ASCC patients
      receiving RT and concurrent 5FU/mitomycin chemotherapy.

      In this Phase 1 study, the investigators will conduct a dose-escalation study of the
      combination of BMX-001 with standard radiation therapy (RT) and concurrent 5-fluorouracil
      (5FU)/mitomycin in newly diagnosed Anal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (ASCC) patients. The dose
      escalation will be a Rolling-6 design, which is an efficient phase I trial design, to
      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BMX-001 in combination with concurrent
      5FU/mitomycin and RT. Subjects will be administered BMX-001 subcutaneously first as a loading
      dose at least 2 hours before the initiation of chemoradiation and then at a maintenance dose
      (50% of the loading dose) twice a week for up to seven weeks.

      Based on Rolling-6 design (1), cohorts of 2-6 patients are concurrently enrolled onto a dose
      level, beginning with 0.1 mg/kg, until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined. The
      average number of subjects required for this Phase 1 is estimated to be 20, and the maximum
      estimated to be 24. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is the highest dose level at which ≤ 1
      out of 6 subjects experienced DLT. If no DLT has been identified at the highest dose proposed
      (loading dose of 0.6 mg/kg followed by 0.3 mg/kg twice per week) this will be accepted as the
      MTD.

      In order to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of BMX-001 in combination with current
      chemoradiation, blood samples will be drawn for analysis. Blood will be drawn for PK on the
      following days: Day 1 (before and after loading dose), Day 8, Day 22 and Day 36. Measures
      will be obtained at approximately the following times: -1 to 0 hour (before loading dose), 30
      minutes after the drug is given, 4 hours post-dose, and 24 hours post-dose.

      Rectal, GI, and GU symptoms will be measured on the day of screening, weekly during RT, 1
      months, 4 months and 10 months after the completion of RT. Perianal skin will be assessed
      weekly during RT, 1 month, 4 months, and 10 months after completion of RT. Further follow up
      will be per standard of care.
