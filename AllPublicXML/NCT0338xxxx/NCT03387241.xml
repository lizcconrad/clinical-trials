    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to show non-inferiority in the efficacy of FLUTIFORM ® pMDI (2 puffs
      bid) versus Seretide® pMDI (2 puffs bid) based on the change from the pre-dose forced
      expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) at baseline to 2 hours post-dose FEV1 at Week
      12.

          3. Demonstrated a pre-dose FEV1 of ≥ 40% to ≤ 80% for predicted normal values during the
             Screening Visit (Visit 1) following appropriate withholding of asthma medications (if
