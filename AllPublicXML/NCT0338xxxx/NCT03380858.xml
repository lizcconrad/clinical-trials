  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In colorectal surgery about 30% of postoperative mortality is attributed to anastomotic leak,
      whit an incidence range between 1.8% and 15.9%. Preventing the anastomotic leak can therefore
      bring benefits to the patient and the health system. To date we have technologically advanced
      suturizers and the correct realization (well-vascularized margins, not in tension, etc.)
      remains crucial to prevent anastomotic dehiscence. Experimental results demonstrate that
      modified cyanacrylate is a suitable potential &quot;reinforcement&quot; on intestinal anastomoses
      (manual or linear intra-corporeal). Applied after mechanical anastomosis, it polymerizes in a
      short time, closing the spaces of the suture line between one point and the other, expressing
      an adhesive, hemostatic and sealing action on the tissues, also creating an effective
      antiseptic barrier towards of the most common infectious or pathogenic agents.
