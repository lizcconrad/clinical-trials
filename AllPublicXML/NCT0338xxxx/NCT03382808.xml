  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Impaired recognition of affective facial expressions has been conclusively linked to
      antisocial and psychopathy. However, little is known about the modifiability of this deficit.
      This study aims to investigate whether and under which circumstances the proposed perceptual
      insensitivity can be addressed with a brief implicit training approach.

    <description>Morphed images are presented, beginning with the neutral face that progresses into one of the six affective expressions. This procedure creates the impression of an animated clip depicting the development of facial emotive expressions. Participants are instructed to press a button as soon as they are able to identify the emerging expression.</description>

    <description>Participants are first presented with a fixation cross which indicates the beginning of a trial and is immediately followed by a bilateral presentation of a neutral and a fearful image (face) of the same model identity. The fearful expression is always replaced by an arrow pointing to the left or the right which remaines active until the participant indicates via button-press which direction the arrow is pointing to. The model identity, the position of the fearful cue and the arrow probe direction are pseudo-randomized across trials with no more than three identical sequential occurrences on each parameter. Each session consists of 360 trials in total, with 120 distinct trial types and three repetitions. Participants are trained with neutral and 75% fearful expressions only in the first session; the intensity of the fearful cue is successively decreased by 15% at every subsequent session.</description>

    <description>Participants are first presented with a fixation cross, which indicates the beginning of a trial and is immediately followed by a bilateral presentation of a direct gaze-image (neutral face) and an image of a neutral face (same model identity) displaying deviated gaze. The averted gaze-face is always replaced by an arrow pointing to the left or the right which remaines active until the participant indicates via button-press which direction the arrow is pointing to. The model identity, the position of the fearful cue and the arrow probe direction are pseudo-randomized across trials with no more than three identical sequential occurrences on each parameter. Each session consists of 360 trials in total, with 120 distinct trial types and three repetitions. Participants are trained with direct and 100% averted gaze images only in the first session; the intensity of the deviated gaze cue is successively decreased by 20% at every subsequent session.</description>
