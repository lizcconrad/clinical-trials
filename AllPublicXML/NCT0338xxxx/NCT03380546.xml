  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Caring for women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is very time-consuming. Therapeutic
      strategy includes dietary and lifestyle measures and additional insulin therapy for 15 to 40%
      of the women with GDM if the glycemic targets are not achieved after a period of 1 to 2 weeks
      of diet. Insulin therapy is imperfect for the following main reasons: need for education
      (i.e. subcutaneous administration, dose titration), hypoglycemia and weight gain, limited
      acceptance and high cost. Psychosocial deprivation is associated with more cases of GDM and
      health accessibility may be unequal.

      Glucosidase inhibitors (acarbose) reduce intestinal absorption of starch and reduce the rate
      of complex carbohydrate digestion. It mainly lowers postprandial glucose values and is used
      in type 2 diabetes for a long time. Less than 2% of a dose is absorbed as active drug in
      adults, with 34% of the metabolites found in the systemic circulation. Doses of up to 9 and
      32 times the human dose were not teratogenic in pregnant rats or rabbits. Limited but
      reassuring data during pregnancy are available. Acarbose was well tolerated (little
      gestational weight gain, no hypoglycemia) with digestive discomfort in some women, balanced
      by treatment satisfaction as compared with insulin injections. Our hypothesis is that
      treatment aiming to control postprandial glucose values with acarbose as compared with
      prandial insulin injection will be as efficient and safe, but more convenient and less
      expensive.

      Phase III study. Prospective, multicenter, non-inferiority, randomized, open-labelled and
      controlled study with two arms.

        1. In the 29 participating centers: selection of women with GDM who have unmet post
           prandial glycemic targets between 12 and 34 weeks of amenorrhea after at least 7 days of
           dietary and lifestyle measures. They may be treated with basal insulin to control pre
           prandial glucose values.

        2. Explanation of protocol, with signature of consent in case of acceptation.

        3. Randomization

           . Experimental group: The women will receive acarbose with a progressive increase of
           dose according to post prandial glucose values and digestive tolerance, with a maximal
           dose of 3 x 100 mg / day. The progressive titration of acarbose reduces
           gastro-intestinal side effects.

           Patients who have not reached the glycemic targets at this highest tolerated dose for at
           least one meal will receive instead prandial insulin therapy for each meal, whereas
           acarbose will be stopped. Failure to reach post-prandial target will be defined as 3 or
           more post-prandial glycaemic values ≥ 1.20 g/L for a given meal in a week (3 values out
           of 7) after the two weeks of dose adjustment.

           · Control group: The women will receive prandial insulin according to usual practice
           (routine care according to French recommendations): before each meal, with dose
           titration according to post prandial values.

           Basal insulin may be necessary in both arms to control pre-prandial glucose values.

           At delivery:

           - Maternal blood samples : 14 ml of blood will be collected at the same time as the
           sample routinely collected just before delivery for irregular agglutinin test
           measurement, when the women are perfused.

           - Cord fluid : 7 ml will be collected at the same as cord fluid pH is routinely measured
           just after delivery. There will be 5 aliquots to prepare.

           The aliquots previously labelled and stowed in the specific boxes for the study will be
           stored locally and will be transported to the &quot;Centre de Ressources Biologiques&quot;(CRB) of
           the Jean Verdier Hospital.

        4. Routine monitoring of the women with GDM in both arms, up to delivery. No use of other
           oral hypoglycemic agents during pregnancy.

        5. Last consultation three months after delivery.
