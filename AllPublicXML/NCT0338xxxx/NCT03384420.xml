  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mitochondrial diseases are a genetically heterogeneous group of disorders caused by mutations
      or deletions in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) displaying a wide range of severity and phenotypes.
      These diseases may be inherited from the mother (mitochondrial inheritance) or non-inherited.
      The latter are ultra-rare pediatric diseases caused by a mutation or deletion of mtDNA, which
      develop into a systemic multi organ disease and eventually death. MNV-BM-BLD is a therapeutic
      process for enrichment of patient's peripheral hematopoietic stem cells with normal and
      healthy mitochondria derived from donor blood cells. The process, called mitochondria
      augmentation therapy, aims to reduce the symptoms of mitochondrial diseases.
