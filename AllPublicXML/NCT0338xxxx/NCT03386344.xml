      Primary Objective:

      To demonstrate the superiority of sotagliflozin dose 1 versus placebo with respect to
      hemoglobin A1c (Hb1Ac) reduction in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) who have inadequate
      glycemic control on diet and exercise only or with a stable antidiabetes regimen.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To compare the effects of sotagliflozin dose 1 and dose 2 versus placebo with respect to
           the percent change in bone mineral density (BMD) at lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral
           neck, measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA).

        -  To demonstrate the superiority of sotagliflozin dose 1 versus placebo on change in body
           weight (BW), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), systolic blood pressure (SBP) for all
           patients; and to evaluate the proportion of patients with a HbA1C &lt;7%.

        -  To demonstrate the superiority of sotagliflozin dose 2 versus placebo with respect to
           HbA1c reduction; change in BW, FPG, and SBP for all patients; and to evaluate the
           proportion of patients with HbA1c &lt;7.0%.

        -  To evaluate the safety of sotagliflozin dose 1 and dose 2 compared with placebo.

      Study duration per participant is approximately 110 weeks (Screening period of up to 2 weeks,
      2 week single-blind run-in period), a 26-week double-blind core treatment period, a 78-week
      double-blind extension period, and a 2- week post treatment follow up period.

      DXA scans will be performed to assess Bone Mineral Density and Fat vs. Lean body mass at
      baseline and Weeks 26, 52, and 104.
