    <textblock>
      Using the Blink Reflexometer, athletes are scanned if they are potentially thought to have a
      concussion during a game or practice.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a blinded trial, any patient who during a game or practice situation had head contact,
      thus possible Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) aka Concussion, in addition to the current
      approved protocols, patients are scanned with the Blink Reflexometer. Results are not
      available until the end of the season, thus eliminating the potential of someone relying on
      the results. The Blink Reflexometer uses 5 puffs of air on the side of the eye over 20
      seconds. The air causes a blink reflex which is being correlated to a concussion. The results
      of the blink post concussion are compared to a baseline scan taken at the beginning of the
      season.

    <time_frame>Data unblinded May 1, 2018 or at completion of season, which ever comes first.</time_frame>
    <description>There are a number of factors that could possible change the blink reflex such as Caffeine and Tobacco. We are capturing this data to confirm that the device can be accurate despite a patient ingesting these items.</description>

    <description>The goal is to eliminate the need for requiring a baseline scan on a patient in order to decide if they have a concussion or not. By scanning a large number of normal volunteers at various ages, sex, race, etc, we expect to see trends based on these factors.</description>
