  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      APG-1387 is a potent, bivalent small-molecule IAP antagonist. APG-1387 has shown strong dose-
      and schedule-dependent antitumor activities in multiple human cancer xenograft models,
      APG-1387 also demonstrates its synergistic effect in combination with immune checkpoint
      inhibitor anti-PD-1 antibody, and such a combinatory effect was further enhanced by
      chemotherapeutic agent. A total of 35 patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphomas have
      been treated with APG-1387 in two Phase I dose-escalation studies in Australia and in China
      Ten dose levels have been tested ranging from 0.3 mg to 45 mg in these 2 studies. Based on
      the preliminary results, APG-1387 is well-tolerated at the dose levels evaluated to date.
      APG-1387 is intended for the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors and hematologic
      malignancies. After establishing the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicities
      (DLTs), and/or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), several Ib /II studies will be implemented
      accordingly to further access the antitumor effects of APG-1387 in combination with either
      pembrolizumab or the chemotherapeutic agents.
