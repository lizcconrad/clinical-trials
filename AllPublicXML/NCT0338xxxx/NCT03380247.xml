  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of pain in the emergency department is estimated between 60% and 78%. However,
      many studies reported oligo analgesia in about half of patient admitted to the emergency
      department. The delay before effective analgesia is one of the main causes of oligoanalgesia.
      The use of nurse-directed protocol allows the administration of analgesic upon admission to
      the emergency department. Nevertheless the need of intravenous access may delay analgesia.
      The use of oral form analgesics even with immediate release does not allow effective
      analgesia before 20 min. Pain management protocol in the emergency reception desk of CHU
      Grenoble Alpes (CHUGA) includes paracetamol that can be combined with oxycodone tablets
      depending on the pain intensity. For any mono traumatized it is possible to associate
      self-administer methoxyflurane inhaler. The pain management protocol is already used in the
      emergency reception desk of CHU Grenoble Alpes.The different analgesics( paracetamol,oral
      oxycodone, methoxyflurane) are already administered as part of routine care.The use of these
      different analgesics means would allow a rapid and adapted effectiveness to the pain
      intensity. However, there are no data on the efficacy and acceptability of such an early
      multimodal analgesia protocol in the emergency department.

      200 Patients will be included from 8:00 am to 8:00 pm and will receive a multimodal analgesia
      under the nurse-directed pain management protocol (paracetamol +/- oral oxycodone +/-
      methoxyflurane) as part of routine medical care.

      The pain will be evaluated (Numerical rating scale) prior to the administration and
      reassessed by a nurse every 5 minutes for 30 minutes and then at 45min and 1 hour after
      administration of the pain protocol. Satisfaction of patients and caregivers will also be
      assessed at the end of care.
