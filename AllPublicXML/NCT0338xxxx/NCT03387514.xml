  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this research is to evaluate response to anti-angiogenesis therapy
      via 18F-DCFPyL prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-based positron emission
      tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma
      (RCC) and to compare qualitatively with conventional imaging response criteria - Response
      Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) and histopathological endpoints of PSMA and
      neovascularization.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Response of anti-angiogenesis therapy will be quantified using PSMA-based PET imaging using a
      novel agent,18F-DCFPyL, as a non-invasive imaging biomarker of tumor neovasculature to
      functionally monitor renal cell cancer neovasculature in patients undergoing systemic
      anti-angiogenesis therapy. PSMA PET will be compared with response to anti-angiogenesis
      therapy using conventional imaging computed tomography(CT)-based RECIST1.1 criteria as well
      as histopathological endpoints (tumor vascular density, immunohistochemical staining for PSMA
      and neovascularization (cluster of differentiation(CD)105, CD31). Whole body PSMA PET/CT
      scans will be obtained at baseline, following adjuvant anti- angiogenic therapy and when the
      patient becomes refractory to treatment.

      The rationale and time points for obtaining PET scans is planned with respect to the typical
      natural history of metastatic RCC. This project will obtain information from tumors that are
      responding to anti-angiogenesis therapy and those resistant to treatment.

    <description>Patient-derived uVESSEL models (from primary &amp; metastatic sites) will be tested for response to anti-angiogenic therapies including pazopanib, sunitinib, cabozantinib, and axitinib. Response will be quantified via multiple endpoints, e.g. vessel sprouting, PSMA expression, cell death.</description>

    <description>Using the clinical, pathological and imaging endpoints, predictive models will e developed using responses to uVESSEL model above. More specifically the objective response (dichotomous endpoint of yes or no) measured using PSMA-based PET/CT will be used as a dependent variable in a logistic regression model with response to uVESSEL model from above as an independent predictor to segregate uVESSEL responses into two groups corresponding to responders and non-responders to anti-angiogenic therapies.</description>
