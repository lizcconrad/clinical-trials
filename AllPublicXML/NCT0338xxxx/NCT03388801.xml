    <textblock>
      The aim of the study was to evaluate the short- and long-term effects of spa therapy on
      quality of life and pain in patients aged 65 years and older with osteoarthritis.

      70 patients with osteoarthritis referred to spa treatment in south-eastern Poland were
      enrolled in the study. Spa treatment lasted 3 weeks.

      All the patients benefited from spa therapy.

      VAS pain scale, the Laitinen scale and WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire were used to assess the
      condition of the patients. The examinations were performed three times: at the beginning of
      the spa treatment, after three months and one year after the first examinations.

    <textblock>
      In an interventional study design, there have been examined patients aged over 65 years with
      the diagnosis of osteoarthritis who were prescribed a first spa therapy course in spa resorts
      in south-eastern Poland, between April 2016 and July 2016.

      Patients were assessed by an experienced physicians on the first day of the spa therapy
      (study 1), after three months (study 2) and one year (study 3) after the completion of the
      spa therapy.

      All patients who had been enrolled to the study, were asked to fill out the appropriate
      questionnaires (on the first day of the spa therapy). The investigators ensured that
      questionnaires were properly completed, under the supervision of researcher previously
      trained for their application. Second (study 2) and third (study 3) stages of the study were
      performed after three months, and one year after the first study, respectively (participants
      were interviewed by telephone survey).

      Interventions Spa treatment was applied during a session lasting 120 to 150 minutes a day.
      Spa treatment lasted 3 weeks, including treatments from Monday to Friday (15 days of
      treatment). As a part of comprehensive spa treatment, all the patients benefited from
      kinesiotherapy, physical agent modalities (electrotherapy, phototherapy), massage and
      balneotherapy (peloid therapy, hydrotherapy with mineral waters, crenotherapy).
