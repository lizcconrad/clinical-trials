  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of PROGRO is to determine which combinations of milk and plant proteins are
      optimal to promote growth factors in children
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to assess how different protein blends affect growth factors in
      children. There is evidence to support that milk protein increases growth in children in both
      high and low-income countries. Therefore milk protein is often used in food aid for
      undernourished children in low-income countries. The study investigates if plant protein can
      partially replace milk protein without affecting growth promotion negatively. Plant protein
      could potentially reduce food aid costs and at the same time be a more sustainable protein
      source.

      The PROGRO study is a 3-arm randomized, controlled trial. The effect of consuming 35 g pure
      milk protein/day is compared to intake of 35 g milk and rapeseed protein/day (ratio 30:70 and
      54:46, respectively) in 7-8 year old healthy Danish children. The intervention period is 4
      weeks and measurements and blood sampling are performed at baseline, week 1 and week 4. A
      3-day weighed dietary intake is recorded before each visit. The primary outcome is
      Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1).

          -  The child is willing to consume protein powder twice a day for 4 weeks

          -  The child is not a picky eater and so does not mind trying new foods and flavours

          -  The child speaks Danish in order to understand the study procedures

          -  The parents read and speak Danish in order to be properly informed about the study
             procedures

          -  Written informed consent has been obtained

                  having any illness or taking medication at the time of admission. If the
                  conditions are considered to potentially affect protein metabolism or growth, the
                  children will not be included. If a child is acutely ill at the scheduled time of
                  study start, the child cannot be included. But the child may be included later
                  when the acute illness has resolved

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The child drinks more than 350 ml of milk per day

             rapeseed or mustard

          -  Any acute illness*

          -  Chronic illness or disease that may affect protein metabolism or growth*

          -  Chronic intake of medicine that may affect protein metabolism or growth*

          -  Concomitant participation in other studies involving dietary supplements or blood
             sampling

          -  Living in a household with another participating child

               -  The principal investigator, who is blinded to study treatment, will perform a
                  case-by-case medical evaluation of children with any signs of being unhealthy or
