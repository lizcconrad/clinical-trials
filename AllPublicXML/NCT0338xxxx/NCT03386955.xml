  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer has the highest incidence rate in China and is also a very common cancer in the
      world. BPI-7711 is a potential new drug developed for advanced or recurrent non-small cell
      lung cancer.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, efficacy and how the drug is used by the
      body. The first part of the study will recruit 3~6 patients for different dose levels to
      evaluate safety. The dose will increase from the lowest level. In the first part, the study
      will also collect data on how the drug is used by the body to better decide how the drug
      should be taken. The second part of the study is the expansion part. Once efficacy is
      observed in the dose increasing process, additional 20~30 patients will be enrolled to
      further evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy of each dose level. Estimate 50~80 patients will be
      enrolled for both part. A recommended dose will be selected for Phase II study.

    <textblock>
      This is an open label, single arm Phase I study, including a &quot;dose escalation&quot; part and a
      &quot;dose extension&quot; part. Dose extension will be initiated during the process of dose
      escalation: once a dose is found to be safe and effective (evaluated according to objective
      response rate [ORR]) during escalation, then that dose will be extended to enroll more
      patients; at the same time, dose escalation will further continue in order to find out a
      better dose.

      Dose escalation: on the basis of the traditional &quot;3+3&quot; dose escalation plan; single dose PK
      test is added. The subjects of each dose group will first be given a single dose, and blood
      samples be collected for PK analysis. 7 days (wash-out period) after single dose delivery, an
      additional 21 days of continuous multiple dose delivery will be given as a treatment cycle to
      evaluate the dose limiting toxicity (DLT). The initial dose will be 30 mg once a day. In the
      initial dose group, the second subject will be enrolled and administered with the study drug
      7 days after the first dosing (single dose) to the first subject. If there is no occurrence
      of serious or unexplainable safety event, the subsequent following-up subjects will be
      enrolled and receive the dose. If suspected safety event occurs, the investigator will
      discuss with the sponsor whether to delay dose delivery to the following-up subjects of the
      said group.

      Every dose escalation group will enroll 3 to 6 subjects. Dose adjustment will be based on the
      following scheme:

        -  If there is 0 case of DLT in 3 subjects of the initial dose group in the first treatment
           cycle, then the treatment dose of the subsequent 3 patients will be increased to level
           2.

        -  If there is 1 case of DLT in 3 subjects of the initial dose group in the first treatment
           cycle, then additional 3 patients will be enrolled in the group and accept the level 1
           dose treatment.

             -  If there is 0 case of DLT in the 3 new subjects, the dose will be increased to
                level 2.

             -  If there is ≥1 case of DLT in the 3 new subjects, the principal investigator and
                the sponsor will discuss to determine the next step dose scheme.

        -  If there are ≥2 cases of DLT in 3 subjects of the initial dose group, the principal
           investigator and the sponsor will meet to discuss the alternative dose delivery scheme.

      The same dose escalation rules shall be applicable to the following dose groups. Based on
      available tolerance, safety, and PK data, recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) will be selected.

      Dose extension group: If, in the dose escalation group, it is found that certain dose is safe
      and effective, then dose expansion will be initiated and about 20-30 additional subjects will
      be enrolled into this dose level and treated with 21 days as a cycle. The said dose extension
      group will be ended in advance (less than 30 subjects) if efficacy found to be unsatisfying
      after discussed by the investigator and the sponsor. There will be no DLT evaluation for
      subjects of the dose extension study.

          -  Subjects signs and dates the informed consent form before receiving any treatment or
             test sample collection related to the study.

          -  Male or female, ≥18 and ≤75 years of age when signing the informed consent.

             therapy.

          -  ECOG scoring (PS) of physical conditions 0-1, and there is no deterioration 2 weeks
             before enrolled to the study. The expected survival is not less than 12 weeks.

          -  Disease progressed after EGFR-TKI treatment as proved by radiological evidence. For
             dose level which does not provide satisfying efficacy in the escalation group,
             patients must receive chemo therapy before enrolled into that dose, unless not
             suitable for chemotherapy judged by investigator. Patients must have documented
             radiological progression before enrolled into the study.

          -  At least 1 measurable lesion based on the RECIST1.1 criteria. If the subject has only
             1 measurable lesion, the baseline CT must be performed at 14 days after biopsy. The
             lesion received radiotherapy does not count as measurable lesion or a biopsy lesion
             unless it shows obvious progression after radiotherapy.

          -  Central lab tissue tests confirm T790M positive for the biopsy samples collected after
             imaging examination with clear disease progression post last treatment. Subject should
             provide formalin fixed and paraffin embedded tumor tissue block or 5 pieces of 4-5µm
             thick undyed slices, or should agree to do tumor tissue biopsy.

                  with heparin anticoagulant therapy, if these indicators have no abnormality, and
                  then they can be enrolled. For subjects who are receiving warfarin anticoagulant
                  therapy, within 28 days before enrolled into the study, relating to INR, use
                  stable dose warfarin.
