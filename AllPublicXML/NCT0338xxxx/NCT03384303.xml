  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is an increasing world wide problem. Moreover, the increase in patients who are
      considered morbidly obese is even higher (Sturm et al, Healt Aff 2004). Conservative
      approaches such as diets or medication are unsuccessful in the majority of the patients.
      Additionally, (morbid) obesity leads often to cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension,
      dyslipidemia and type 2 diabetes (T2DM). When patients need insulin to regulate their glucose
      levels, their weight is even more difficult to control. Therefore, bariatric procedures are
      increasingly performed, with over 8.000 procedures in the Netherlands in 2013. The two most
      performed types of bariatric surgery in the Netherlands are the Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y
      Gastric Bypass (LRYGB) and the Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy (LSG). Within the LRYGB there
      are different variants available. In a recently initiated randomized controlled trial (RCT)
      from our centre, a comparison between two variants of RYGB was performed. In this RCT our
      standard RYGB (s-RYGB:alimentary limb (AL) of 150cm; biliopancreatic limb (BPL) of 75cm) was
      compared with a RYGB with an long BPL (LBPLRYGB:AL of 75cm and a BPL of 150cm). A LBPLRYGB
      might improve weight loss and reduction after surgery. The exact mechanism of action is still
      not fully understood. Stomach volume is decreased and satiety levels often increase, probably
      due to changes in incretin levels. Passage of foods through the gastrointestinal tract are
      altered after RYGB. A possible explanation might be found in different levels of incretins
      (such as GLP-1, PYY and ghrelin) and bile acids (FGF-19 and FGF-21) after bariatric surgery.
