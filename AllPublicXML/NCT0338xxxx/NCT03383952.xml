  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immunotherapy offers an extremely precise approach with the potential to eliminate cancer
      cells specifically. The newly designed CD19 targeted ICAR19 T cells can specifically kill
      CD19+ tumor cells. ICAR19 CART used the second generation of CART designation. In this study,
      the participants will receive several doses of autologous ICAR19 T cells and the
      investigators will determine the safety and therapeutic effects of these cells.

    <description>T cells were isolated from peripheral blood from patients enrolled. T cells were transduced with lentivirus bearing anti-CD19 antibody scFV and the activation signals of second generation CART designation. The CART cells were infused into the patients by IV with an escalating dosage.</description>
