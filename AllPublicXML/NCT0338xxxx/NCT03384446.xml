  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dental implants have revolutionized the field of dentistry, providing improvements in
      function and esthetics. They are not, however, without risks. Bone loss around implants (i.e.
      periimplantitis) is an emerging public health concern. Untreated, peri-implantitis leads to
      implant loss and jawbone defects. Nonetheless, existing therapies have failed to show
      long-term efficacy. The pathogenesis of peri-implantitis is believed to be of bacterial
      etiology similar to periodontal disease. Therefore, existing treatments duplicate strategies
      for the treatment of natural teeth. However, the titanium (Ti) surface of implants is quite
      dissimilar to teeth. Recent work from our lab has demonstrated that peri-implantitis is
      associated with increased release of Ti particles around implants. These findings suggest
      that treatments targeting periimplantitis must be designed around Ti material properties. A
      gap in knowledge exists regarding the potential triggers of increased Ti dissolution from the
      implant surface and the mechanisms by which Ti dissolution products amplify peri-implant
      inflammation. The aim of this study is to determine if the use of tooth-driven treatment
      approaches increase Ti in the submucosal plaque.
