  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Very low birth weight infants who are at risk for chronic lung diseases may also be at risk
      for brain anomalies such as increased echogenicity, leukomalacia and intracranial hemorrhage.
      Infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia have been reported to have worse neurodevelopmental
      outcomes than healthy infants. It has also been pointed out that babies with prolonged and
      recurrent apneas during sleep may have weak General Movements (GMs) repertoire.

      It has been mentioned that motor development retardation may also occur in neurodevelopmental
      diseases, genetic diseases and chronic lung diseases, as well as in cystic fibrosis. In
      infants with cystic fibrosis, motor development may be affected by increased incidence of
      hospitalization, previous infections, malnutrition, respiratory and digestive system
      disorders. There is no research done with GMs assessment to determine motor dysfunction in
      infants with cystic fibrosis and this topic is open to research.

      Having more information about the motor development of babies by determining the motor
      characteristics and motor performance of infants with cystic fibrosis, it may be possible to
      start the disease-specific physiotherapy and rehabilitation programs as early as possible.
      For this reasons, in the study the investigators aimed to investigate the characteristics of
      GMs in the &quot;Fidgety&quot; period of 3-5 month term infants diagnosed with cystic fibrosis, to
      determine the motor performances and to investigate the relation between the GMs
      characteristics and the features of the disease.

      The hypotheses the investigators have set for this study are listed below;

      Ho: Spontaneous movements of the &quot;Fidgety&quot; period of infants diagnosed with 3-5 months of
      cystic fibrosis are not different from normal infants.

      H1: Spontaneous movements of &quot;Fidgety&quot; period of infants diagnosed with cystic fibrosis
      between 3-5 months are different from normal infants.

    <description>The MOS has a max. value of 28 (for the best possible performance) and a min. value of 5. The score sheet comprises the following five sub-categories: fidgety movements, age-adequacy of motor repertoire, quality of movement patterns other than fidgety movements, posture, and overall quality of the motor repertoire.
Fidgety Movements; normal fidgety: 12 points, abnormal fidgety: 4 points and sporadic fidgety: 1 points
Age-adequacy of motor repertoire; normal motor repertoire: 4 points, decreased motor repertoire: 2 points, non age-adequacy of motor repertoire: 1 points
Quality of movement patterns other than fidgety movements; normal movement patterns: 4 points, equal normal and abnormal movement patterns: 2 points, abnormal movement patterns: 1 points
Posture; normal posture: 4 points, equal normal and abnormal posture: 2 points, abnormal posture: 1 points
Overall quality of the motor repertoire; normal: 4 points, abnormal: 2 points, cramped-synchronized: 1 points</description>

    <description>GMs assessment has been increasingly used to predict motor dysfunction, especially the Cerebral Palsy (SP), since its introduction 25 years ago. The GMs assessment is based on the visual holistic perception of normal and abnormal movements of the body. This approach focuses on spontaneous movements of the baby rather than reflexes, tonus, and reactions</description>

        Postterm 3-5 months of cystic fibrosis diagnosed and postterm 3-5 months healthy infants
        will be included to the study. The number of individuals to be included in the cystic
        fibrosis group was determined as 19 according to the power analysis at α = 0.05 and β =
        0.20 (for 80% power). Within the scope of our study, the control group, which will be
        formed from postpartum 3-5 month healthy infants, will be composed of our patients who have
        been taken to the rehabilitation sessions of our clinic on the given days as well as our
        patients who have been in control for a certain period of time at Hacettepe University
        Department of Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation, Developmental and Early Physiotherapy Unit,
        relatives.
