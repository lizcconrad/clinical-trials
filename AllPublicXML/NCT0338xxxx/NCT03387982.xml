  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Barrett's esophagus is a condition in which the normal lining of the lower esophagus is
      replaced with cells that predispose an individual to development of esophageal cancer.
      Treatment of Barrett's esophagus reduces the risk of progression to cancer. Treatment is
      provided endoscopically, via a variety of approved techniques including endoscopic mucosal
      resection, argon plasma coagulation, radiofrequency ablation (RFA), spray cryotherapy
      ablation and balloon cryotherapy ablation. A common side effect of ablation treatment is
      pain, thus making pain an important factor when discussing treatment options. It is
      speculated that balloon cryotherapy causes less pain than RFA but no head-to-head comparison
      trials exist to date. This multi-center, prospective cohort study aims to compare pre- and
      post-procedural pain for balloon cryotherapy versus RFA. Providing both patients and
      clinicians with data from a well-designed prospective study may help guide future
      physician/patient treatment discussions.

    <measure>Difference in pain quality immediately pre-procedure (Baseline) for subjects receiving Balloon Cryotherapy or Radiofrequency Ablation via the Pain Quality Assessment Scale (PQAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>immediately before procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Differences in PQAS scores between groups will be determined by using the t test or Wilcoxon test for continuous variables and the Fisher exact test for categorical variables. The Pain Quality Assessment Scale (PQAS) assesses distinct pain qualities associated with all types and categories of pain problems. The PQAS is a 20-item measure used to assess pain qualities associated with non-neuropathic pain. The PQAS asks respondents to rate the severity of each of 20 pain (quality and spatial) descriptor domains by using 0 to 10 numeric rating scales, in which 0 = &quot;no pain&quot; or &quot;not [ descriptor/item]&quot; and 10 = &quot;the most [descriptor] pain sensation imaginable.&quot;</description>
