  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of multiple doses of the UGT
      inhibitor valproic acid on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of BIIB074. The secondary
      objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BIIB074 when
      administered alone and when coadministered with the UGT inhibitor valproic acid and to
      evaluate the effect of the UGT inhibitor valproic acid on the PK of the M13, M14, and M16
      metabolites of BIIB074.
