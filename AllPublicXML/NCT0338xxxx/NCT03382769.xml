    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, 1:1 randomized controlled trial of immediate versus delayed cochlear
      implantation (CI) on hearing handicap, communicative function, loneliness, mental wellbeing,
      and cognitive functioning. Participants are randomized 1:1 to an immediate cochlear implant
      intervention group versus a hearing aid control intervention.
