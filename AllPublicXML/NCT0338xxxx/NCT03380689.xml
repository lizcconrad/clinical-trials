      Phase I Study of biweekly combination therapy with S-1, Irinotecan, and Bevacizumab as 1-line
      Chemotherapy in Patients With Advanced Colorectal Cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In several clinical studies from Japan and South Korea, the combination regimen of S-1 and
      irinotecan has shown efficacy in the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer, and a Phase III
      study（TRICOLORE） showed that the combination therapy with S-1/irinotecan/bevacizumab (a
      3-week regimen [SIRB] or 4-week regimen [IRIS/bevacizumab]) is not inferior to the
      oxaliplatin-based standard treatment (mFOLFOX6/bevacizumab or CapeOX/bevacizumab) in patients
      with metastatic colorectal cancer who had not previously received chemotherapy. Here, we
      design this phase I study to explore the Chinese population's tolerability and efficacy of
      Biweekly SIRB Regimen(S-1/irinotecan/bevacizumab) and to explore the recommended dose of
      irinotecan in this regimen.
