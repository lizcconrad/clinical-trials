  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SAFIR PI3K is an open-label multicenter phase II randomized trial, comparing alpelisib plus
      fulvestrant to maintenance chemotherapy in patient PIK3CA mutated with HR+/Her2- metastatic
      breast cancer who do not present progressive disease after 6-8 cycles of 1st or second line
      chemotherapy.

      The primary objective is to determine whether treatment with alpelisib plus fulvestrant
      prolongs progression-free survival (PFS) compared to maintenance chemotherapy in patients
      PIK3CA mutated with hormone receptor positive (HR+), HER2-negative advanced breast cancer,
      who do not present a progressive disease after 6-8 cycles of chemotherapy.

    <intervention_model_description>In the randomized treatment phase, patients will be randomized 2:1 to receive:
• Experimental arm (Arm A3): fulvestrant (500 mg intramuscular [as two 5 mL injections] every 28 days ± 3 days, with an additional injection on 15 after the first administration + Alpelisib (300 mg by mouth once daily, in a 21-day cycle). Premenopausal women will receive LH-RH analogs in addition every 28 days± 3 days.
OR
• Control arm (Arm B3): maintenance chemotherapy, meaning the same chemotherapy regimen used during the first 6-8 cycles (investigator's choice) or no antineoplastic treatment in case of toxicity after 4 full cycles.
A total of approximately 90 patients will be enrolled</intervention_model_description>
