  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A retrospective one-time evaluation of total knee patients one year or more postoperative, to
      compare antero-posterior (AP) stability with the TELOS Stress device/stress x-rays and
      clinical outcomes. Multiple implant brand/models will be included in the study.

    <measure>Measurement of antero-posterior stability of the knee with stress x-rays.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year post-operative</time_frame>
    <description>Antero-posterior stability of the knee will be measured with stress x-rays using the TELOS Stress device in 45째 and 90째 flexion. Stress x-rays will be obtained during a single visit for subjects 1 year or greater post-operatively.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Knee Society Score (KSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year post-operative</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical outcomes will be evaluated via the Knee Society Score (KSS) obtained during a single visit for subjects 1 year or greater post-operatively. The KSS is subdivided into a Knee Assessment score which rates only the knee joint itself, and a Functional Assessment score which rates the subject's ability to walk and climb stairs. Both scores range from 0-100, with a higher score indicating a better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lower Extremity Activity Scale (LEAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year post-operative</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical outcomes will be evaluated via the Lower Extremity Activity Scale (LEAS) obtained during a single visit for subjects 1 year or greater post-operatively. The LEAS scale range is 1-18, with a higher value indicating a higher level of activity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Forgotten Joint Score (FJS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year post-operative</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical outcomes will be evaluated via the Forgotten Joint Score (FJS) obtained during a single visit for subjects 1 year or greater post-operatively. The FJS total score range is 0-100, with higher scores indicating a higher degree of &quot;forgetting&quot; the artificial joint, that is, a lower degree of awareness.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients willing to sign the informed consent.

          -  Patients able to comply with study requirements including stress x-rays and
             self-evaluations.

          -  Male and non-pregnant females ages 21 - 80 years of age at the time of surgery.

          -  Patients who have undergone a primary total knee replacement, are one year or greater
             postoperative, and are not having any evidence of failure of their implants.

          -  Patients with a diagnosis of osteoarthritis (OA), traumatic arthritis (TA), or
             avascular necrosis (AVN).

          -  Patients with intact collateral ligaments.

          -  Range of motion within five degrees of full extension and a minimum of 120 degrees of
             flexion.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with inflammatory arthritis.

          -  Patients that are morbidly obese, body mass index (BMI) &gt; 40.

          -  Patients that have had a high tibial osteotomy or femoral osteotomy.

          -  Patients with neuromuscular or neurosensory deficiency, which would limit the ability

             adequate support and/or fixation to the prosthesis.

          -  Patients with knee fusion to the affected joint.

          -  Patients with an active or suspected latent infection in or about the knee joint.
