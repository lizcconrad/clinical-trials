  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational study lies in the analysis of a treat-and-extend injection
      scheme with intravitreal aflibercept (i.e. injection into the eye), as applied in routine
      practice in previously untreated patients diagnosed with wet age-related macular
      degeneration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Data will be collected from the medical files retro- and prospectively. If patients are still
      under treatment at study initiation and have not yet completed 24 months of treatment with
      intravitreal aflibercept in a treat-and-extend regimen, data of the remaining observation
      period will be collected prospectively.

          -  No prior therapy for wet age-related macular degeneration.

          -  Patients for whom the decision to initiate treatment with IVT-AFL in a T&amp;E regimen was
             made as per routine clinical practice.

          -  Patient age &gt;55 years of age

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participation in an investigational program with therapeutical interventions outside
             of clinical routine practice.

          -  Patients with eye diseases e.g. advanced glaucoma or visually significant cataracts,
             likely to require surgery during the observation period in the study eye.

          -  Concomitant ocular or systemic administration of drugs up to 3 months before
             commencement of IVT-AFL treatment that could interfere with or potentiate the
             mechanism of action of aflibercept, including anti-VEGF agents. This includes patients
             receiving a different anti-VEGF agent for the fellow eye
