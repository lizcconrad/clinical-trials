  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been conceptualized as a chronic health condition,
      warranting self-advocacy for health management services across the lifespan. Successful
      self-advocacy requires a combination of cognitive and communication skills (problem solving,
      organization, negotiation, etc), which may be impaired following TBI. This project focuses on
      developing and testing the efficacy of an intervention to enhance self-advocacy skills in
      individuals who have sustained TBI. This two-arm, randomized controlled trial will include
      approximately 74 participants, recruited in 4 waves of approximately 18-20 per wave, with
      each wave recruited from a different geographic area of the state. The primary hypothesis
      states that participants receiving the treatment intervention will demonstrate significantly
      greater improvements in self-advocacy beliefs (SAS) from baseline to post-intervention as
      compared to participants in the control group. Treatment will consist of interactive
      4-session workshops along with 2 booster phone calls. Control participants will receive a
      copy of a self-advocacy workbook after all assessments are completed. Baseline,
      post-treatment and two follow-up assessments will take place.

    <description>The Self-Advocacy Scale (SAS) is an eight-item 1-4 Likert rating scale (1 = not confident to 4 = very confident), conceptualized as a domain specific self-efficacy scale. The SAS is designed to measure an individual's current beliefs about his or her ability to produce desired self-advocacy outcomes. Scores range from 8 to 32 with higher scores indicative of better self-advocacy skills.</description>
