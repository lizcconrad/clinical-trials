  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Taken together the results from DAPT and PEGASUS-TIMI54, it appears that physicians may
      consider extending beyond 1 year or reinitiating treatment with a thienopyridine or
      ticagrelor 60mg bid in patients with a prior MI and features of high ischemic and low
      bleeding risk. Comparative clinical or pharmacodynamic studies, however, between prasugrel 5
      mg od and ticagrelor 60 mg bid in the chronic phase of stable post MI patients have not been
      performed.

      In light of this, we believe that a dedicated pharmacodynamic study of ticagrelor 60 bid mg
      vs prasugrel 5 mg od in a PEGASUS-like population would be informative for the practicing
      clinician, thus setting the rationale for conducting this specifically designed
      investigation.

      This is a prospective, randomized, single blind, single center, crossover study. Eligible
      patients undergoing P2Y12 receptor antagonist therapy before screening will undergo a 14-day
      minimum washout period before randomization. Following screening/washout period (visit 1),
      patients will be randomized (visit 2, time 0) in 1:1 fashion to either prasugrel 5 mg od or
      ticagrelor 60 mg bid. Following 14Â±2 days (visit 3) patients will receive alternate treatment
      for additional 14 days (visit 4). Platelet reactivity assessment will be performed with the
      VerifyNow P2Y12 reaction assay at time 0, prior to first study drug dose. At visit 3 platelet
      function will be assessed at 2-4 hours post dose and prior to crossover. At visit 4 also
      platelet function will be assessed at 2-4 hours post study drug post dose. All patients will
      receive concomitant aspirin (100 mg/d) and standard secondary prevention medication.

      The primary endpoint is the platelet reactivity measured in P2Y12 reaction units (PRU) at the
      end of the 2 study periods (pre-crossover and post-crossover).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Provision of informed consent prior to any study specific procedures

          2. Post-menopausal female (defined as absence of any vaginal bleeding for a year) or male
             aged &gt;50 years

          3. A spontaneous MI (ST or Non ST segment elevation) 1 to 3 years before enrolment. In
             addition, at least one of the following high-risk features: age of 65 years or older,
             diabetes mellitus requiring medication, a second prior spontaneous MI, multivessel
             coronary artery disease, or non-end stage renal disease (estimated creatinine
             clearance of &lt;60 ml per minute).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Planned use of a P2Y12 receptor antagonist, dipyridamole, cilostazol, or anticoagulant
             therapy during the study period;

             clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir,
             ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin and voriconazole, grapefruit juice over 1 litre

             rifapentine).

          6. Increased risk of bradycardic events (e.g. known sick sinus syndrome or third degree
             AV block or previous documented syncope suspected to be due to bradycardia unless
             treated with a pacemaker).

          7. Inability to adhere to the follow-up requirements or any other reason or condition
             that the investigator feels would place the patient at increased risk if the
             investigational therapy is initiated.
