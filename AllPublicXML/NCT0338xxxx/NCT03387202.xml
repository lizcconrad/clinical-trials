  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aimed to share our clinical experience in an uterine-preserving laparoscopic
      lateral suspension of apical prolapses with mesh operation after minor modifications in
      technique. Transperineal ultrasonography and several questionnaires are used for objective
      and subjective outcomes.

    <textblock>
      Vaginal length, bladder neck mobility and pelvic floor biometry with anteroposterior hiatal
      diameter and pelvic organ descent measurements are measured by transperineal ultrasonography
      to assess anatomic success in the preoperative and at postoperative 18th months if available.

      Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), Michigan Incontinence Severity Index (M-ISI), Prolapse
      Quality of Life questionnaire (PQoL), Pelvic Organ Prolapse Symptom Score (POP-SS) and Visual
      Analog Score (VAS) are used to assess subjective success in the preoperative and at
      postoperative 18th months if available.

    <measure>Subjective Success - Change from baseline Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) to measure sexual dysfunction at 18th month.</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Validated into Turkish language form will be used to compare preoperative and postoperative period. The FSFI is a multiple-trait scoring, self-report document used to assess female SF during the previous 4 weeks. It consists of 19 items that encompass six separate domains: desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain. The maximum score is 36 points and the minimum score is 2 points. After completion of the questionnaire, the total SF score was calculated as follows: no sexual dysfunction (SD) (≥ 30 points) , mild SD (between &lt;29 and &gt; 23 points), and severe SD (≤ 22 points).</description>

    <measure>Subjective Success - Change from baseline Michigan Incontinence Severity Index (M-ISI) to measure urinary incontinence at 18th month.</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Validated into Turkish language form will be used to compare preoperative and postoperative period. It has ten items, consisting of a total M-ISI domain (the sum of items 1-8) and a distinct Bother domain (the sum of items 9 and 10). The total M-ISI score consists of three subdomains (items 1-3 for stress urinary incontinence [SUI], items 4-6 for UUI, and items 7 and 8 for PU). The responses for each item range from 0 to 4 on a Likert-type scale, with higher values representing greater symptoms and greater bother. The total M-ISI domain ranges from 0 to 32, the Bother domain ranges from 0 to 8, the SUI and UUI subdomains range from 0 to 12, and the PU subdomain ranges from 0 to 8. Total domain and subdomain scores are obtained by simply adding the respective answers. The minimally important difference has been determined for the following domains/subdomains: total M-ISI (4 points), SUI (2 points), UUI (2 points), and PU (1 point).</description>

    <measure>Subjective Success - Change from baseline Prolapse Quality of Life questionnaire (PQoL) to measure quality of life according to pelvic organ prolapse at 18th month.</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Validated into Turkish language form will be used to compare preoperative and postoperative period. he questionnaire included 20 questions grouped in sections (domains) related to a particular aspect of quality of life. A total of nine domains covering general health, prolapse impact, role limitations, physical and social limitations, personal relationships, emotional problems, sleep/energy disturbance as well as severity symptoms measurements were defined. Questions regarding bladder, bowel and sexual function were also separately included and validated for reproducibility and internal consistency. Responses ranged from 'none/not at all', through 'slightly/a little' and 'moderately' to 'a lot' to produce a four-point scoring system for each item. Scores in each domain ranged between 0 and 100 with a high total score indicating a greater impairment of quality of life.</description>

    <description>Participants received &quot;Laparoscopic lateral suspension with mesh&quot; as part of routine medical care in apical prolapse, thus, the investigator does not assign a intervention but studies the effects.Vaginal length, bladder neck mobility and pelvic floor biometry with AP hiatal diameter and pelvic organ descent measurements are measured by Transperineal ultrasound to assess anatomic success in the preoperative and at postoperative 18th months. POP-Q assessment and translabial usg for objective success; Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), Michigan Incontinence Severity Index (M-ISI), Prolapse Quality of Life questionnaire (PQoL), Pelvic Organ Prolapse Symptom Score (POP-SS) and Visual Analog Score (VAS) are used to assess subjective success.</description>

    <description>V-shaped ccm wide and 25cm length mesh strip is prepared from a 30x30cm Prolene mesh (Ethicon J&amp;J).Deep dissection of the uterovesical space is performed.Cutaneous incisions are bilaterally made 3cmsuperoposterior to the anteriosuperior iliac spine.A grasper is introduced retroperitoneally through the subperitoneum holding the beginning part of mesh until reaching the vesicovaginal space in an oblique route rather than transverse.Broad ligament is lifted upward and tunnel is practiced in its lower third.Assistant grasper catches the distal mesh and pulls out through the opposite subperitoneal tunnel.Corner of mesh is fixed to the pubocervical fascia,uterine cervix and isthmus with Absorba Tack™(Covidien, Mansfield,USA).Tension-free lateral mesh suspension is achieved at the desired level</description>
