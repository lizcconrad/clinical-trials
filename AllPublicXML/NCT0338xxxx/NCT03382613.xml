  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of a hospital quality improvement (QI)
      program on the use of guideline-recommended oral anticoagulants (OAC) in hospitalized
      patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) at risk for ischemic stroke. Specifically, the study
      will determine whether the intervention, compared to Usual Care, will result in a greater
      increase in the proportion of patients with AF at risk for ischemic stroke who are
      appropriately treated with OAC.

    <description>The impact of a hospital quality improvement (QI) program on the use of guideline-recommended oral anticoagulants (OAC) in hospitalized patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) at risk for ischemic stroke will be evaluated by measuring change in the percentage of patients treated with OAC, from baseline to Final Collection Periods.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 20 months</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of patients readmitted to the same hospital for all-cause readmissions, stroke-related readmissions, cardiovascular (CV)-related readmissions, and bleeding- related readmissions will be evaluated.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Quality Improvement (QI) Program</arm_group_label>
    <description>Hospitals assigned to the QI program arm will begin the 4-month Preparatory Phase which is designed to introduce the institutional baseline reporting tools and materials related to performance improvement, and gain insight into their gaps in treatment, followed by 15 month Implementation Phase, which will consist of education, process, and engagement activities that are targeted at the hospital and healthcare provider level and then the Measurement Period at which time hospitals will complete a final survey to document specific interventions that were successfully implemented and perform a final retrospective chart review on selected patients.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Usual Care</arm_group_label>
    <description>Hospitals assigned to the Usual Care arm will not participate in the structured QI program but will continue with their standard hospital practice in treating patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) at risk for ischemic stroke. Hospitals will also complete a final survey and final retrospective chart reviews during the Measurement Period.</description>
