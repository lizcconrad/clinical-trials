  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will explore nurses' pediatric postoperative pain management knowledge and
      clinical practices. The aim is to evaluate if a tailored educational intervention will
      improve nurses' knowledge and attitudes of pain management and pain management practices. The
      intervention offered is education and skills training. The study has a pre-post design and a
      comparison group. Data is collected before the intervention is started (baseline T1) and
      again one month (T2) and six months (T3) after the intervention. Nurses working in six
      postoperative units are participating. The units are the largest pediatric postoperative
      units of each of the six university hospitals covering all health regions in Norway. Three
      different approaches will be used to collect data (survey with questionnaire, observations of
      clinical practice, and interviews with children).

      The study will explore the nurses' pediatric postoperative pain management knowledge and
      clinical practice, and evaluate if a tailored educational intervention will improve
      postoperative pain management practice. This will be achieved by first exploring the
      pediatric postoperative pain management practice using different approaches (study 1). Then,
      an intervention will be developed based on the results from the first study and available
      research in the area (study 2). Finally, the investigators will investigate if the tailored
      interventions with nurses at postoperative units improve the nurses' knowledge of pediatric
      pain management (study 3).

      Studies Activity:

      Study 1: Explore nurses' pediatric postoperative pain practices.

      Data collection (baseline T1):

        -  Knowledge and attitudes (questionnaire PNKAS-N)

        -  Observational study of nurses clinical practice

        -  Interview with children about pain and pain management after surgery

      Study 2: Develop a tailored educational intervention

        -  Literature review

        -  Results from baseline

        -  Feedback from the head of the relevant units

        -  Staff views about the facilitators and barriers to optimized pediatric pain management

      Study 3: Implementation and evaluation of the intervention

      The intervention:

        -  Lectures and workshops for the included nurses

        -  Clinical supervision of the nurses

      Data collection (one months after the intervention (T2), and six months after the
      intervention (T3))

        -  Questionnaire PNKAS-N (T2 and T3)

        -  Observational study of clinical practice (T2 and T3)

        -  Interview with children (T2)

    <description>The intervention will be a one-day seminar for nurses working at the units, with lectures and workshops with main focus on the subjects showing the lowest pediatric pain management competence. In addition, there will be clinical supervision in pediatric postoperative pain management (two or three days per unit). The intervention will be conducted by two experts (nurse and physician) in pediatric postoperative pain management. After the intervention there will be different reminders every week for the first month, and then every month (in different forms) about pediatric pain management during six months of time.</description>
