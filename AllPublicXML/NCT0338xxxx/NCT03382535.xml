  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two voice therapy methods are compared. Activity noise levels and vocal load of teachers
      during teaching in primary school classrooms are evaluated. Acoustic and Workshop
      Interventions are implemented in order to reduce noise level during lesson.

    <textblock>
      Due to the voice disorders, teachers are a major customer group for voice therapy. The main
      part of the study is comparison of two voice therapy methods.

      There are several factors in the classroom that increase teacher's risk of voice disorders.
      One of the most significant is high noise level during lessons. This study explores the noise
      conditions the teachers are working in and how these conditions are related to the voice
      parameters and symptoms.

      Finally, the study aims to determine whether classroom noise level can be lowered by
      improving classroom acoustics and by noise reducing workshops for teachers and pupils.

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>A voice therapy as described above and an enhanced carryover program. By carryover we mean the process of extending new vocal skills outside the clinic. It includes supplementary tasks and reminders that will be tailored individually out of those direct and indirect methods that the subjects have adopted during therapy sessions. Additionally, the teachers will be doing vocal warm-up and relaxation exercises together with their pupils int the beginning and in the middle of a school day. The intervention will take eight weeks.</description>
