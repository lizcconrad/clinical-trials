  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Real-world evidence of the clinical course of patient symptoms following initiation of
      sacubitril/valsartan via PROs with a patient-centered study design will provide important
      evidence of potentially beneficial outcomes associated with the use of this therapy.

      This is a prospective cohort study of 1500 chronic HF patients that will also examine and
      describe retrospective electronic health record data. We will use the PCORnet (Patient
      Centered Outcomes Research Network, see &quot;data sources&quot; below) infrastructure to (1) identify
      a cohort of chronic systolic HF patients initiated on sacubitril/valsartan (N=750) as well as
      a comparator group of similar HF patients not initiated on sacubitril/valsartan (N=750) but
      with background ACE/ARB therapy and (2) evaluate baseline and follow-up PROs via an
      electronic patient reported outcomes (ePRO) form in the eCOS database for 12 weeks.

        1500 adult patients with chronic systolic HF in PCORnet. We will focus on chronic systolic
        HF patients initiated on sacubitril/valsartan and a comparator group not initiated on
        sacubitril/valsartan sacubitril (but with background ACE/ARB therapy and recent titration
        of these medications).
