  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of transfusion of TBX-3400 in patients with stage III and IV melanoma
      resistant or refractory to Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors.

      The patient's own blood cells are exposed to a protein that has been shown in the laboratory
      to result in anti-tumor activity.

      The study hypothesis is that TBX-3400 cells will enhance anti-tumor activity and improve the
      body's immune response.

    <intervention_model_description>The study will consist of a Dose Escalation Phase and a Dose Expansion Phase. TBX-3400 will be administered on Day 1 of each treatment cycle and can be repeated.
In the Dose Escalation Phase, a &quot;3+3&quot; design will be employed. Each dose cohort will initially enroll 3 patients. Enrollment and treatment of the first 3 patients in the first cohort will be staggered to allow for evaluation of safety. After each cohort has been enrolled and all patients in the cohort have completed Cycle 1, a Data Safety Monitoring Committee will review cumulative safety data to determine whether to proceed with further dose escalation.
Each cohort may be expanded in groups of 3 patients to a maximum of 12 patients. Up to six TBX 3400 dose levels will be evaluated during the Dose Escalation Phase of the study.</intervention_model_description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for participation

          1. Histopathologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced, unresectable or metastatic
             malignant melanoma

          2. Male or female patients age 18 or older

          3. Previously treated with checkpoint inhibitor therapy either alone or in combination:

               1. must have either stable disease or progressive disease per RECIST version 1.1 on
                  previous therapy (there is no minimum treatment duration for patients who have
                  progressive disease while on checkpoint inhibitor therapy); or
