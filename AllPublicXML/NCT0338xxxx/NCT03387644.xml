  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Conscious sedation is usually required during flexible bronchoscopy. Sedation should be done
      without causing respiratory depression or loss of consciousness. The present study was
      designed to evaluate the advantage of pregabalin pre-medication on reducing sedatives and
      respiratory depression for patients undergoing flexible bronchoscopy with dexmedetomidine and
      midazolam.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Seventy patients undergoing elective flexible bronchoscopy were randomly divided into two
      equal groups, 35 patients each. All patients received premedication one hour before the
      procedure. PG group received 150 mg pregabalin and C group received placebo. All patients
      sedated to achieve optimum working conditions. Intra-operative respiratory rate and post
      procedure patients' and pulmonologists' satisfaction were compared in both groups.
