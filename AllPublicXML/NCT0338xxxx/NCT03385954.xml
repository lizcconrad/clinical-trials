  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Repetitive Strain Injuries (RSI) or Work-Related Ostomuscular Disorders (WRMD) are
      musculoskeletal disorders. Nursing is one of the categories of workers most affected, due to
      the inherent functions they perform in their daily activities. The objective of this study is
      to evaluate the effects of a distance education program of prevention in RIS/WRMD on the
      quality of life of a nursing group.

      Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) or Work-Related Musculoskeletaldisorders (WRMD) are the names
      given to skeletal muscle disorders that mainly affect the upper limbs, the scapular region
      and the neck. One of the most affected categories is nursing workers who present health
      problems inherent to the function they perform in their daily activities. Due to this
      peculiarity, several studies are focused on the occupational risks of nursing workers in the
      hospital environment. However, It was not found in the literature studies that suggests
      strategies to prevent and improve the worker's quality of life. Distance education comes as a
      differential. It has power in interactive media and collaborative learning beyond
      self-learning and mass media. This research project proposes to carry out a randomized
      clinical trial where the intervention group will receive a Prevention Course in RSI/WRMD in
      the distance education modality and the control group will receive Educational Lectures on
      Prevention in RSI /WRMD, both groups will be composed by a nursing team from the Clinical
      Hospital of Porto Alegre.
