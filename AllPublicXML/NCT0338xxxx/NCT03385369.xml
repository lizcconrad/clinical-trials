        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects must meet all of the following criteria:

          1. Healthy subjects age 18 to 65 years inclusive at the time of consent.

          2. Written informed consent and any locally required authorization (eg, Health Insurance
             Portability and Accountability Act in the USA), obtained from the subject prior to
             performing any protocol-related procedures, including screening evaluations.

          3. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine
             pregnancy test at screening and randomization, and must not be lactating.

          4. Females of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a nonsterilized male
             partner must use at least one highly effective method of contraception from screening
             and must agree to continue using such precautions through to the end of the study. It
             is strongly recommended for the male partner of a female subject to also use male
             condom plus spermicide throughout this period. Cessation of contraception after this
             point should be discussed with a responsible physician. Periodic abstinence, the
             rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of contraception.
