  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HER2-positive cancer is a cancer that tests positive for a protein called human epidermal
      growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). HER2 promotes the growth of certain cancer cells. This study
      will test an experimental drug called DS-8201a that has not been approved by the health
      authorities yet.

      DS-8201a will be tested for safety in patients with advanced solid malignant tumors that test
      positive for HER2. It also will test how DS-8201a moves within the body (pharmacokinetics).

    <textblock>
      The expected time from the first subject's enrollment until the last subject's enrollment is
      approximately 8.5 months. The screening period is 28 days and each cycle of treatment is 21
      days.

      The data for the primary analysis will cutoff after all subjects have either discontinued the
      study or completed at least 3 cycles, whichever comes first. After the primary analysis, the
      main study will be closed and transition to the extension period.

      Depending on the preliminary results of Cohort 1, Sponsor may decide whether Cohort 2 will be
      opened or not.

      The number of treatment cycles is not fixed in this study. Subjects who continue to derive
      clinical benefit from the study drug in the absence of withdrawal of consent, progressive
      disease (PD), or unacceptable toxicity may continue the study drug.
