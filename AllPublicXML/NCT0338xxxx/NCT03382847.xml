  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study subjects active on the waiting list for a heart transplant at the NYU Langone
      Transplant Institute who are hepatitis C (HCV) negative will receive a heart transplant from
      a donor who tests positive for HCV. The study will entail surveillance for the development of
      HCV viremia post-transplant. Patients who develop HCV viremia post-transplant will be treated
      with an FDA-approved, pan-genotypic direct acting antiviral drug, Mavyret. Patients who are
      treated with Mavyret will be monitored for clearance of viremia and for sustained virologic
      response.
