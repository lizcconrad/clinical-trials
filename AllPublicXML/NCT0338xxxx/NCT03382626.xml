  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a serious public health problem due to its high mortality and
      morbidity rates, mainly affecting young adult males. Aggression to the prefrontal cortex,
      caused by an external physical force, responsible for anatomical injury and/or functional
      impairment, causes cognitive deficits with important consequences for the individual affected
      by the trauma and their caregivers. Therefore, rehabilitation is of utmost importance. The
      increase in pre-frontal cortical activation through training, activity-dependent stimulation
      and neuroplasticity, especially in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is related to
      better performance in functional memory. In this context, Transcranial Direct Current
      Stimulation (tDCS), intended to drive neuroplastic changes in the brain, has been widely used
      to bring benefits to the cognitive function of individuals affected by various neurological
      conditions, including TBI by promoting neuroplasticity for critically involved cortical areas
      in the performance of tasks, culminating in cognitive benefits. In addition, studies have
      shown greater benefits when the technique is combined with cognitive training. Therefore, the
      objective of this parallel, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial is to
      investigate the effect of tDCS applied on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and virtual
      reality cognitive training alone or in association with tDCS on cognitive function of
      individuals with severe chronic TBI.

    <measure>Change from baseline working memory at 12 days (scale assessment)</measure>
    <time_frame>We will apply these instruments at T0 (baseline time), T1 (one day after the first session), T2 (at end of all sessions, ie 11 days after the first session) and T3 (i.e after 1 month of follow-up time).</time_frame>
    <description>This assessment will occur through the following instruments: Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale IV (Digit span and Letter-Number Sequencing). Both Digit span and Letter-Number sequencing subtests evaluates the working memory and attention. The Digit span involves a forward and a backward recitation condition. The maximum score is 30 points, where the higher the score the better the performance of the evaluated. Similarly, Letter-Number sequencing involves a combination of numbers and letters that must be recited.The maximum scores is 21 points, where the higher the score the better the performance of the evaluated. The score of each subtest will be considered separately for characterization of the working memory.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline executive function at 12 days (scale assessment)</measure>
    <time_frame>We will apply these instruments at T0 (baseline time), T1 (one day after the first session), T2 (at end of all sessions, ie 11 days after the first session) and T3 (i.e after 1 month of follow-up time).</time_frame>
    <description>This assessment will occur through the Trail Making Test, which provides information on visual search, scanning, speed of processing, mental flexibility, and executive functions. It requires the subject to connect encircled numbers randomly arranged on a page (Part A) and encircled numbers and letters in alternating order (Part B). Scoring is expressed in time in seconds required for completion of each of the two parts of the test. Scoring is expressed in terms of the time in seconds required for completion of each of the two parts of the test, on which the shorter the time to complete the task the better the performance (i.e part A &lt; 180 s and part B &lt; 300 s).</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline attention and executive function at 12 days (scale assessment)</measure>
    <time_frame>We will apply these instruments at T0 (baseline time), T1 (one day after the first session), T2 (at end of all sessions, ie 11 days after the first session) and T3 (i.e after 1 month of follow-up time).</time_frame>
    <description>This assessment will occur through the Stroop Color and Word Test, which assesses the ease with which a person can maintain a goal in mind and suppress the habitual response in favor of a less familiar one (i.e selective attention and cognitive flexibility). Both the time to complete and the number of errors. In addition, the interference effect is determined by calculating the extra time required to name colors in the interference task in comparison to the time required to name colors in the control task.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline reasoning and planning at 12 days</measure>
    <time_frame>We will apply these instruments at T0 (baseline time), T1 (one day after the first session), T2 (at end of all sessions, ie 11 days after the first session) and T3 (i.e after 1 month of follow-up time).</time_frame>

    <time_frame>We will apply the QOLIBRI at T0 (baseline time) and T2 (at end of all sessions, ie 11 days after the first session).</time_frame>
    <description>This assessment will occur through Quality of Life After Brain Injury (QOLIBRI) scale, which is a comprehensive questionnaire with 37 items covering six dimensions (cognition, self, daily life and autonomy, social relationships, emotion and physical problems). The scale means are converted to the 0-100 scale by subtracting 1 from the mean and then multiplying by 25. This produces scale scores which have a lowest possible value of 0 (worst possible quality of life) and a maximum value of 100 (best possible quality of life).</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline depression at 12 days.</measure>
    <time_frame>We will apply the BDI at T0 (baseline time) and T2 (at end of all sessions, ie 11 days after the first session).</time_frame>
    <description>This assessment will occur through Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), which is a 21-item, self-report rating inventory that measures characteristic attitudes and symptoms of depression. Total score of 0-13 is considered minimal range, 14-19 is mild, 20-28 is moderate, and 29-63 is severe.</description>
