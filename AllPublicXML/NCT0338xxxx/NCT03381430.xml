      To explore the survival benefit of the gefitinib combined with radiotherapy as adjuvant
      therapy for completely resected patients with Pathological stage IIIA-N2 NSCLC harbouring
      sensitive mutations of EGFR.

      Cisplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy is standard of care for patients with stage II-IIIA
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Activating somatic mutations of the tyrosine kinase
      domain of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have been characterized in a subset of
      patients with advanced NSCLC. The recently study of gefitinib (G) versus
      vinorelbine+cisplatin (VP) as adjuvant treatment in stage II-IIIA (N1-N2) NSCLC with
      EGFR-activating mutation (ADJUVANT)shows that G had significantly longer median DFS (28.7
      months) than VP (18.0months). 3-year DFS was significantly better with G (34.0% vs 27.0%; p=
      0.013) and subgroup analysis of patients treated with G, lymph node status (pN1/N2)
      demonstrated significant correlation with DFS.

      At present, postoperative radiotherapy has been widely used in the treatment of all kinds of
      cancer, and the guidelines also recommend postoperative radiotherapy for stage IIIA-pN2
      NSCLC. The retrospective study of Lee et. al. reported on the use of postoperative
      radiotherapy (PORT) as first strategy after resection of stage IIIA-pN2 NSCLC. The result
      showed that the five-year overall OS was significantly higher in patients treated with PORT
      and postoperative chemotherapy (POCT) than in patients treated with PORT alone. This
      open-label phase II trial is studying gefitinib combined with radiotherapy to see how well it
      works in treating patients who have undergone surgery for Pathological stage IIIA-N2 NSCLC
      with EGFR activating mutation.
