  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate which anti-inflammatory treatment is best at
      preventing postoperative inflammation following cataract surgery. We want to compare topical
      prophylaxis with NSAID eye drops to topical prophylaxis with a combination of NSAID and
      prednisolone. We also want to compare topical prophylaxis with eye drops to drop-less surgery
      where the anti-inflammatory drug is administered to the subtenonal space at the conclusion of
      the surgical procedure. In addition, we want to investigate if topical anti-inflammatory
      prophylaxis should be initiated preoperatively or postoperatively. The primary outcome is
      change in central macular thickness, measured by optical coherence tomography, 3 months after
      surgery.

          -  Significant complications to surgery such as posterior capsule rupture/vitreous loss,
             choroidal hemorrhage, and dislocated lens material

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Fertile women, i.e. women who are not menopausal.
