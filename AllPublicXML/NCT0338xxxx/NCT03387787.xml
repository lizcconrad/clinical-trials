  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The GlucoTab® system is a computerized decision support system built of an android based
      front-end user interface and a backend server including the REACTION algorithm. GlucoTab® is
      able to process blood glucose data and physiological confounders of glycaemia. Subsequently,
      GlucoTab® provides patient-specific basal, bolus, and correction insulin doses together with
      visualization and documentation of relevant data. The GlucoTab® system was found capable to
      keep hospitalized diabetic patients in the recommended target range without increasing the
      risk for hypoglycaemic events. Insulin pharmacokinetic is a critical confounder of glycaemic
      variability and the main determinant of an algorithm-based decision support-system. GlucoTab®
      is intended for being used with a basal/bolus insulin regimen. Up to date, feasibility data
      are limited to the use of insulin glargine.

      Insulin degludec, an ultra-long acting basal insulin is characterized by a stable
      pharmacokinetic profile a half-life of ~25 hours. It was found equally effective to insulin
      glargine with respect to glycaemic control, while the incidence of (nocturnal) hypoglycaemia
      was smaller in patients treated with insulin degludec. Within the present study, insulin
      glargine will be replaced by insulin degludec, which is not yet approved for dose titration
      with GlucoTab®.

      In the present study, 15 non-critically ill T2DM patients, who were hospitalized at the
      University Clinic of Neurosurgery for various reasons and require insulin treatment will be
      recruited. Patients will be treated with insulin Tresiba and insulin Novorapid. For a maximum
      duration of 21 days, GlucoTab® will calculate the required insulin doses for each patient,
      depending on fasting plasma glucose and postprandial glucose measurements during the day.
      After the calculated Insulin dose has been approved by the physician, the nursing staff will
      give the dose to the respective patient.

      The present study will analyse the efficacy of GlucoTab® for glycaemic management in T2DM
      patients using insulin degludec.
