  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The publications on prevalence and risk factors of urinary and anal incontinence in women
      were performed mainly in Europe and America. Consequently, result extrapolation to Tunisian
      population may not be a good practice which justifies this study and demonstrates its
      importance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A cross-sectional study will be conducted among female doctors and nurses randomly selected
      from 3 large hospitals in the center of Tunisia. The prevalence of urinary incontinence and
      anal incontinence will be measured using validated questionnaires.

    <description>The participant will be asked to fill out the urinary symptom profile questionnaire (USP). This questionnaire contains 13 items to assess stress urinary incontinence, urge urinary incontinence and dysuria. Each question is scored from 0 to 3 providing a maximal score of 9, 21 and 9 for stress urinary incontinence, urge urinary incontinence and dysuria respectively. Women diagnosed with both stress and urge urinary incontinence by the USP were classified as having mixed urinary incontinence.</description>
