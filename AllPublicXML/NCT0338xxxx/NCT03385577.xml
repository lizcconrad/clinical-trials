  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the feasibility and acceptability of a yoga program for women with
      gynecologic malignancies such as ovarian, endometrial, or cervical cancer. This study will
      pilot an integrative yoga intervention that combines Western psychotherapeutic approaches
      with classic yogic philosophy to reduce emotional distress among women undergoing treatment
      for gynecologic cancer and provide a comprehensive approach to stress management across the
      cancer care continuum.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gynecologic cancers are malignancies of the female reproductive tract that affect over 70,000
      women per year. Treatments for gynecologic cancer often result in numerous physical and
      emotional side effects that affect long-term adjustment, such as anxiety, depression, low
      self-esteem, sexual dysfunction, difficulties with fertility, and surgically-induced
      menopause. Even when initial treatments are successful, gynecologic cancers have a high
      recurrence rate that can reach nearly 80% among those with ovarian cancer. Fear of Cancer
      Recurrence (FCR) is described as one of the largest unmet psychological needs among
      gynecologic cancer patients and is associated with psychological distress, increased health
      care utilization, and functional impairment. Few studies have examined interventions designed
      to manage symptoms of FCR, which leaves a significant gap in the literature regarding
      treatment of this prominent psychosocial problem. Cancer patients report growing use of
      integrative medicine therapies (e.g., yoga, acupuncture, massage) to manage unmet physical
      and emotional needs related to their disease and treatment. The current study will take
      advantage of this trend in supportive oncology to investigate the feasibility and
      acceptability of a novel intervention program created specially to address FCR among women
      with gynecologic cancer. Patients will be recruited from the UF Health/Shands Hospital
      Gynecology Oncology Clinic and Medical Oncology clinic and invited to participate in a
      10-week, manualized, small group yoga course. Psychoeducation modules, meditation training,
      and gentle yoga poses will be integrated into a comprehensive program focused on managing the
      psychosocial concerns of newly diagnosed gynecologic cancer patients. Findings from this
      research will contribute to the existing literature on FCR and knowledge regarding the use of
      integrative medicine techniques for addressing unmet psychological needs among gynecologic
      cancer patients. If the intervention is deemed feasible and acceptable, future research may
      explore ways in which this manualized yoga program compares to other psychosocial treatments
      for managing FCR and other forms of emotional distress in women with cancer.

    <description>The intervention, &quot;Stilling the Waters of Uncertainty: A yoga program for women with gynecologic cancer,&quot; is a 10-week, manualized, group yoga program. Sessions are 60 minutes in duration, once a week, across the course of 10 weeks. The 10-week program is comprised of five modules, each of which will take two sessions to complete: (1) Getting Started, (2) Cultivating a Mindful Attitude, (3) Self-Care and Compassion, (4) Finding Peace and Acceptance, and (5) The Power of the Present Moment.</description>

    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Stilling the Waters of Uncertainty: A yoga program for women with gynecologic cancer</intervention_name>
    <description>The notion of 'stilling the waters' as a prominent theme for this program is drawn from the core principle in yogic philosophy regarding the use of breath techniques and physical postures to cultivate inner peace and an ability to live in the present moment. The emphasis on stilling the fluctuations of uncertainty is a direct allusion to the intrusive, future-oriented, and inherently unknown future which characterizes the core experience of Fear of Cancer Recurrence (FCR), especially among gynecologic cancer patients for whom the likelihood of recurrence is quite high. An additional motif throughout the program is the lotus flower. The lotus has symbolic importance in yogic culture due to its requirement for thick muddy waters as an ideal context for growth. The metaphor of cancer as the muddy waters will be used to cultivate benefit-finding and acceptance regarding the mental and physical challenges participants endured during their initial diagnosis and treatment.</description>
