      Patients with low-risk MDS verifying the eligibility criteria may be included in the study.

  <detailed_description>

      Patients will receive the number of DFX tablets (Exjade, cp film-coated, 90mg or 360mg), in
      relation to their body weight to be closer to 3.5mg / kg / d for 12 months.

      At one month and six months of treatment, the residual plasma levels of DFX will be measured
      in patients (sent to the Bordeaux laboratory of Biochemistry, Pr Molimard) to allow the
      dosage to be adjusted (plasma objective of 3 μM).

      At inclusion (J1) and at 6 months of treatment, a dosage of NTBI and hepcidine will be
      performed.

      If patients become transfusion-dependent (≥) 2 packed red cells (RBP) per 2-month period
      evaluated over 6 months, they will stop low-dose DFX and go out of protocol to receive DFX at
      20mg / kg (according to EMEA authorization) for iron chelation.

             dysplasia, RA (refractory anemia), refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS)
             including CMML-1 (chronic myelomonocytic leukemia) type 1 with &lt;10% blasts)

          2. low risk (IPSS-R very low, low and intermediate)

          3. in primary or secondary failure after erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs),

             for at least 12 weeks, as defined by the IWG criteria 2006 (no erythroid response at
             12 weeks, or more than 15g / l decrease in Hb after response to ESAs) PS: Patients
             with low transfusion of less than (&lt;) 4RBP assessed over 4 months (RBP administered
             for patients with Hb ≤ 9g / dl) will be accepted)

          4. age ≥ 18 years

          2. Patients with high-risk MDS (based on IPSS-R) and patients with other hematologic and
             non-haematological malignancies who should not benefit from chelation therapy due to
             rapid progression of their disease
