  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine if infants with neonatal encephalopathy will achieve
      full oral feeds faster after therapeutic hypothermia has completed if they are treated with
      osteopathic manipulative treatment. The treated infants will be compared to matched
      historical controls.

    <textblock>
      Infants affected by neonatal encephalopathy (NE) have been shown to have better survival
      rates and improved long term neurodevelopment following treatment with therapeutic
      hypothermia. However, a barrier to hospital discharge for these infants is a successful
      transition from gavage to either breast or bottle feeding.

      Often, the factor delaying hospital discharge is slow transition to full oral feeds.
      Osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) helps to effectively stabilize and regulate the
      autonomic nervous system as well as the cranial nerves important in the sucking and latching
      reflexes, which may in turn help to ease the transition to full oral feeding. We hypothesize
      that infants who receive OMT will accelerate the transition to full oral feeds, thus
      decreasing their overall length of hospitalization compared to historical matched controls.

    <description>Each neonate will have a structural exam completed assessing each body region (head, cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral, pelvic, rib cage, and abdominal regions) for underlying somatic dysfunctions prior to each treatment. The specific OMT techniques used will be left to the discretion of the treating physician and will not be based on a predetermined protocol. Treatment techniques will consist of myofascial release, balanced ligamentous tension, balanced membranous tension, and osteopathy in the cranial field. Total treatment time will be 15 minutes. The features of the osteopathic structural exam which will be recorded on paper by the treating physician at the time of the evaluation. The paper will be marked only with the research identifier.</description>
