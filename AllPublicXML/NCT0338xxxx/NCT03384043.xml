  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease is a debilitating condition for patients and their caregivers marked by
      hallmark cognitive symptoms (e.g., memory loss) as well as an impact on quality of life.
      Researchers and clinicians are learning that a specific type of memory, called prospective
      memory, may be particularly affected in mild Alzheimer's disease. Prospective memory is
      memory for future intentions, goals, and chores, and the loss of the neurocognitive processes
      supporting prospective memory may reduce independent functioning (e.g., medication
      adherence). The current study investigates a technology-based intervention to assist
      participants with their daily prospective memory tasks. Participants with mild cognitive
      impairment and mild Alzheimer's disease will be trained to use a smartphone for four weeks.
      Smartphone acceptability, usability, and overall user experience will be measured.
      Furthermore, participants will be tested on completion of daily prospective memory tasks. In
      one group, participants will train to use the smartphone personal assistant reminder system,
      which reminds participants of their goals, tasks, and chores at the appropriate time or
      location. In a comparison group, participants will also carry a smartphone but will train to
      use a memory strategy in which they verbalize external cues to remind them to perform their
      goals, tasks, and chores. The goal of this research is to inform whether smartphone
      technology or a memory strategy can be used to reduce memory burden and improve daily,
      independent functioning in participants with mild Alzheimer's disease.

    <description>Participants will use the personal assistant feature of the smartphone (&quot;Cortana&quot;) to provide reminders to perform prospective memory tasks at the appropriate time and location. In the current study, participants will press a button and verbally state &quot;Cortana, I need to remember to...&quot; for time based time--based tasks (&quot;...take my medicine at 7pm&quot;), person--based tasks (&quot;tell [my daughter] I got a new phone&quot;), and event--based tasks (&quot;pick-up milk at the grocery store).</description>

    <description>The implementation intention is a memory strategy, in which individuals verbally state when/where they will perform a prospective memory intention. In the current study, participants will verbally specify an external cue in a &quot;When…then&quot; format and record doing so using the smartphone's voice recorder app. They will use the implementation intention strategy for time--based tasks (&quot;When it is 7pm, then I will remember to take my medicine&quot;), person--based tasks (&quot;When I talk to [my daughter], then I will tell her I got a new phone&quot;), and event--based tasks (&quot;When I am at the grocery store, then I will remember to pick--up milk).</description>

    <intervention_name>Smartphone Personal Assistant</intervention_name>
    <description>Electronic memory aids (e.g., pagers) are known to support memory for goals and intentions (prospective memory) in individuals with cognitive impairment. Smartphone technology has the potential to enhance the benefits of previous electronic memory aids because they can provide reminders not only at the correct time, but also at the correct location. The smartphone personal assistant system provides reminders at the correct time, contact person, and location.</description>
