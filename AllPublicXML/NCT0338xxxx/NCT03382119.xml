  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine if ultrasound tools can be used to detect liver
      stiffness. Acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) elastography and backscatter will be used
      to see if they can detect liver stiffness in different populations of patients with liver
      disease.

      The study is measuring liver stiffness in pediatric patients aged 2-5 years. Patients either
      have had a Fontan cardiac surgery or have liver disease.

      Ultrasound scanning takes images of the liver and has much lower risks for patients. ARFI
      elastography and other tools can be used to measure liver stiffness.

      If patients have liver congestion, reversing it could prevent liver fibrosis, which cannot be
      treated. Liver fibrosis has serious health risks and is associated with a higher chance of
      developing liver cancer later in life.

      Subjects from two patient populations will be enrolled in order to test ultrasound
      technologies. A total of 30 subjects between 2-5 years of age will be enrolled.

        1. 15 children with increased liver stiffness due to the Fontan operation

        2. 15 children with increased liver stiffness caused by Biliary Atresia.
