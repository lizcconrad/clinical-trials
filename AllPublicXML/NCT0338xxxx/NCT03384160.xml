  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The extraction of third molars, a frequent treatment in clinical dental practice, can lead
      patients to painful symptoms during and after surgery. The dental surgeon must correctly
      indicate the need for extraction and also provide patients who need this treatment greater
      comfort and control of pain in the trans and postoperative period. Thus, it is necessary to
      use an effective local anesthetic favoring the factors inherent to the postoperative and
      achieving good treatment results.

      This study will compare the use of Articaine at 4% to that of Mepivacaine at 2% for lower
      third molar surgeries semi-included and / or included. I will select 16 patients who require
      surgical treatment for extraction of third molars, aged between 16 and 40 years at the São
      Paulo State University. These will participate simultaneously in the two groups: Group 1
      mepivacaine (MEP) and Group 2 articaine (ART), and the division will be performed by
      randomization, so that each patient will have each side (right or left) allocated in
      different groups. The primary evaluation variable will be to compare the pain index in the
      immediate postoperative period, using Visual Analog Scale (VAS), and will also analyze
      Hemodynamic Parameters, such as Patient and Operator satisfaction. The results will be
      submitted to qualitative and quantitative statistical analysis. The descriptive data will be
      compared using the statistical analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey test with a
      significance level of 5%.

    <intervention_model_description>The sample will consist of 32 lower third molars, semi-inclusively or included. This study will be a randomized, double blind, controlled, split-mouth clinical trial, divided into two groups simultaneously, namely:
Group 1 (16 teeth) - using anesthetic mepivacaine in third molar extraction. Group 2 (16 teeth) - using anesthetic articaine in third molar extraction</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Surgical procedures were always performed by the same surgeon and assistant, who was unaware of the group that belonged to the patient, as well as the patient himself.
