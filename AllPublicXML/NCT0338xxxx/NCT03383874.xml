  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of adjunctive
      probiotic therapy in 66 persons hospitalized with a manic or mixed episode. The active study
      compound will consist of capsules containing approximately 10^9 colony forming units of the
      probiotic organisms, Lactobacillus GG and Bifidobacteria lactis strain Bb12. The dose has
      been selected because it has been used safely in other probiotic trials, was well-tolerated
      by the participants in two previous trials of individuals with schizophrenia or mania, and
      was utilized in the original trial on which this replication is based. This dose is higher
      than that available in most commercially-sold health food supplements. Following hospital
      discharge, participants will be randomized to receive adjunctive probiotic or placebo for a
      24 week period. It is anticipated that of the 66 participants randomized, ~50 (75%) will
      complete the full 24 weeks of the study. The primary outcome is relapse, defined as
      re-hospitalization (e.g., admission to an inpatient unit) for psychiatric symptoms following
      a previous hospital discharge by at least 2 weeks. The occurrence of new mood episodes, the
      severity of psychiatric symptoms, and any changes in cognitive test scores over the course of
      the study will also be evaluated. Changes in the levels of inflammatory markers as well as
      changes in gut microbiota will be evaluated at three time intervals over the course of the
      study.

      Primary Aim 1. To determine if adjunctive probiotic administration can reduce relapse for
      participants first hospitalized for mania. Hypothesis: Participants receiving adjunctive
      probiotic microorganisms vs. adjunctive placebo will have a lower rate of relapse as defined
      by a re-hospitalization (e.g., admission to an inpatient unit) during the 24 week study
      period.

      Secondary Outcomes. The number of new mood episodes, the severity of psychiatric symptoms,
      and changes in cognitive scores over the 24 week study period will be evaluated.

      Exploratory Aim 1. To study the effect of probiotic therapy in lowering the levels of
      inflammatory markers following an acute episode of mania. Hypothesis: Participants receiving
      adjunctive probiotic microorganisms vs. adjunctive placebo will have reduced levels of
      antibodies to casein, gliadin, and the NMDA receptor, and reduced levels of C-Reactive
      protein and the cytokine TNF alpha following 24 weeks of probiotic therapy.

      Exploratory Aim 2. To evaluate changes in the gut microbiota following probiotic
      administration. Hypothesis: Probiotic administration will enrich the gut microbiota of
      participants with the given microorganisms and these changes may correlate to changes in the
      peripheral inflammatory markers being measured.

    <description>The product under investigation is a probiotic containing two microorganisms (Lactobacillus rhamnosus, LGG® and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, BB-12®, referred to as LGG® and BB-12®, respectively) and is offered commercially as &quot;Probio-Tec BG-VCap-6.5&quot;. This composition is formulated to contain a minimum of 1 billion (1.0 x 10^9) CFU (Colony Forming Units) per dose (capsule), including equal numbers of the two strains; i.e. 0.5 x 10^9 CFU of each of LGG® and BB-12® at the time of manufacture. The product will be administered orally.</description>

             tumor, or other neurological disorder). Note that Hepatitis-C is not an exclusion
             criterion unless the participant has an acute infection.

          -  Diagnosis of Intellectual Disability or history of severe learning disorder.

          -  Diagnosis of alcohol or substance use disorder (moderate/severe) according to DSM-5

             elevated levels of gliadin or casein antibodies as we intend to look at these levels
             as a predictor of response.
