  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research was to investigate 5 different formulations of whole grain
      barley and refined white rice against a control of white bread on post-prandial glycemic
      response, as well as self-reported hunger/satiety in a randomized cross-over trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Beta-glucan-rich barley has been shown to improve glycemic response, reduce hunger and
      increase satiety. Nutrient-dense grain mixtures that include a new cultivar of barley
      (Sustagrain, Ardent Mills, LLC) with exceptionally high dietary fiber content may help
      individuals meet their dietary fiber needs while minimizing the rapid increase in blood
      glucose following the consumption of a refined grain product. The primary objective of this
      study was to compare the effects of five different test meals containing varying amounts of
      whole-grain barley and refined white rice to white bread on post-prandial blood glucose
      concentrations. A secondary aim was to evaluate changes in self-reported hunger and satiety
      following the consumption of each treatment. This study was a single-site, blinded,
      randomized crossover trial among 24 healthy adults. Each participant consumed the following
      treatments: 100% Sustagrain barley flakes, 100% Sustagrain steel cut barley , an 80/20
      rice-steel cut Sustagrain barley mix, a 50/50 rice-steel cut Sustagrain barley mix, 100%
      rice, and white bread.

    <description>Incremental area under the curve(iAUC) for plasma glucose concentrations were measured at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 min using the trapezoidal method to evaluate the glycemic response to each grain treatment.</description>

    <description>Visual analog scales were used to evaluate self-reported feelings of hunger using the question &quot;How hungry do you feel?&quot; The scale consisted of a 100-millimeter line with anchors &quot;I am not hungry at all&quot; and &quot;I have never been more hungry&quot; at 0 and 100 millimeters, respectively. Lower numbers represent low feelings of hunger while larger values are characteristic of greater hunger. Hunger was assessed at 0, 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes to evaluate changes across time for each grain treatment.</description>

    <description>Visual analog scales were used to evaluate self-reported feelings of satiety using the question &quot;How satisfied do you feel?&quot; The scale consisted of a 100-millimeter line with anchors &quot;I am completely empty&quot; and &quot;I cannot eat another bite&quot; at 0 and 100 millimeters, respectively. Lower numbers represent low feelings of satiety while larger values are characteristic of greater satiety. Satiety was assessed at 0, 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes to evaluate changes across time for each grain treatment.</description>

Lower numbers represent low feelings of fullness while larger values are characteristic of greater fullness. Fullness was assessed at 0, 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes to evaluate changes across time for each grain treatment.</description>

    <description>Visual analog scales were used to evaluate self-reported feelings toward prospective food consumption using the question &quot;How much do you think you can eat?&quot; The scale consisted of a 100-millimeter line with anchors &quot;Nothing at all&quot; and &quot;A lot&quot; at 0 and 100 millimeters, respectively. Lower numbers represent low ability to eat while larger values are characteristic of greater ability to eat. Prospective food consumption was assessed at 0, 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes to evaluate changes across time for each grain treatment.</description>
