  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, observer-blinded, multicenter, dose-escalation Phase 1 clinical study
      investigating three dose levels of VLA1553 after a single immunization.

      120 study participants will be enrolled into the study to receive three different doses (30
      subjects in the low and medium and 60 subjects in the high dose group). Vaccination will be
      given intramuscularly on Day 0. As safety precaution, the study will begin with enrolment of
      20 sentinel subjects in an open-label fashion. Thereafter, subjects will be enrolled in a
      blinded, randomized manner in the three study arms.

      A re-vaccination will be given at Month 6 or Month 12 to confirm that a single vaccination
      will be sufficient to induce high titer neutralizing antibodies and protect subjects from
      CHIKV viremia.

      Study participants will be followed up until 13 months after initial vaccination.

             Investigator;

          -  Any condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may compromise the subjects

          -  Participation in another clinical study involving an investigational medicinal product
             within 30 days prior to study enrollment or during the course of this study;

          -  Member of the team conducting the study or in a dependent relationship with one of the
