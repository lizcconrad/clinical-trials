  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the sequential
      addition of immune-modulating therapy to standard-of-care therapy of microsatellite-stable
      (MSS) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypothesis: Most patients with mCRC harbor tumor that can be transformed into an immunogenic
      disease by oxaliplatin, and may thereby benefit from the addition of immune-modulating
      therapy to improve outcome of the current oxaliplatin-based standard-of-care.

      Primary objective: To determine progression-free survival (PFS), in terms of failure of
      treatment strategy, of sequential treatment with the Nordic FLOX regimen and nivolumab
      compared with the standard-of-care Nordic FLOX regimen in previously untreated MSS mCRC.

      Secondary objectives: To determine safety and tolerability of sequential treatment with the
      Nordic FLOX regimen and nivolumab compared with the standard-of-care Nordic FLOX regimen. To
      monitor and compare quality-of-life (QoL) alterations during therapy courses.
