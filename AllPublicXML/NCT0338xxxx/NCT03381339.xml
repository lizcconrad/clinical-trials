      In this three month, interventional clinical trial for the treatment of gingivitis we will
      assess the use of an oscillating-rotating powered toothbrush in comparison to the use of a
      manual toothbrush over 12 weeks in the absence of interproximal hygiene.

      In this single-masked, parallel-armed, interventional clinical trial for treatment of
      gingivitis we will assess the use of an oscillating-rotating powered toothbrush in comparison
      to the use of a manual toothbrush over 12 weeks in the absence of interproximal hygiene. The
      primary outcome variable is the change from baseline in the Modified Gingival Index at 2, 4
      and 12 weeks from Baseline. Secondary outcome variables include change from baseline in
      bleeding on probing as well as change from baseline in the Turesky Modification of the
      Quigley-Hein Plaque index measuring overnight plaque formation. There will also be an
      assessment of single use efficacy in reduction of overnight plaque levels at the baseline
      visit.

    <description>Subjects will be provided an oscillating rotating powered toothbrush as the experimental intervention, and given written instructions on its proper use. Efficacy of overnight plaque reduction will be assessed at baseline and both gingivitis and plaque reduction will be assessed as change from baseline at 2, 4 and 12 weeks. Subjects will be given a standard fluoride toothpaste and asked to refrain from daily interproximal plaque control for the duration of the study.</description>
