    <textblock>
      Previous publications suggest gender difference in outcome parameters after pacemaker
      implantation. Aim of this study is to investigate gender differences in patients with
      pacemaker. Implanted devices, indication for implantation and pacemaker follow up data of
      patients will be included. Survival data including cause of death will be documented.
      Prevalent comorbidities and relevant laboratory data will be recorded.

        Women and men with implanted cardiac Pacemaker and at least one follow up in our Pacemaker
        Office of the Department of Cardiology at the Medical University Vienna. Patients were
        enrolled regardless of time and place of pacemaker implantations.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients registered in the pacemaker database of the Department of Cardiology at
             the Medical University Vienna. Patients get registered when clinical follow up of an
             implanted Pacemaker is done.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  For survival analysis: No valid match of first name AND surname AND date of birth with
             patients' insurance data.

          -  For analysis of comorbidities: Not a single documented diagnose was found in our
             electronic clinic-wide patients' information system.
