    <textblock>
      Intestinal failure associated liver disease is a cholestatic liver disease associated with
      prolonged need for parenteral nutrition that can lead to such significant complications as
      liver failure. In the neonatal population, infants with history of intestinal resection and
      short bowel syndrome are at increased risk for this disease. The investigators plan to
      compare two possible lipid dosing preventative strategies including a composite, fish oil
      lipid and soy-based lipid reduction.

      Intestinal failure associated liver disease (IFALD) is a cholestatic liver disease associated
      with prolonged need for parenteral nutrition. This disease can lead to such serious
      complications as liver failure and need for transplantation. In the neonatal population,
      short bowel syndrome, due to intestinal resection, is the most common cause of intestinal
      failure. While the exact cause is yet to be determined, it is felt the lipid component of
      parenteral nutrition is a large contributor to the development of this disease. Currently,
      there is no standard preventative strategy to attempt to decrease the risk of IFALD in the
      high risk, post-surgical neonatal population. The investigators aim to complete a randomized
      trial comparing two possible preventative strategies. One group will receive a composite
      lipid containing fish oil (Smoflipid) and the other group will receive soy-based lipid at
      reduced dosing.
