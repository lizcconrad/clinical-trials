    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look in humans at the relationship between moderate or little
      exercise and their potential effects on the retina in patients with Retinitis Pigmentosa
      (RP).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Human studies have shown that regular exercise may have positive effects on common
      degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Exercise has also shown to improve
      conditions the eye such as macular degenerations, glaucoma, and cataracts. Mice with retinal
      degeneration which were exposed to exercise showed that it helped to slow the rate of
      degeneration. The purpose of this study is to look in humans at the relationship between
      moderate or little exercise and their potential effects on the retina in patients with
      Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP).

    <measure>Change in Goldmann Visual Field (GVF) scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 and 6 months follow up.</time_frame>
    <description>The final result of a GVF is a diagram &quot;island of vision.&quot; The visual field is an island with a central peak and the altitude correlates with the visual sensitivity in a given location.</description>

    <measure>Change in the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire-25 (NEI VFQ-25) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 and 6 months follow up.</time_frame>
    <description>NEI VFQ-25 measures the range of vision-related functioning experienced by persons. The 12 subscales in the NEI VFQ-25 are general vision, near vision, distance vision, driving, peripheral vision, color vision, ocular pain, general health, and vision-specific role difficulties, dependency, social function, and mental health. The subscale scores are calculated by summing the relevant items and transforming the raw scores into a 0 to 100 scale where higher scores indicate better functioning or well-being.</description>

    <description>Each exercise class will consist of 20 minutes of progressive, interval based Spin exercise 2 times a week for 6 months on stationary exercise cycles and will be led by a qualified instructor. The Duration of each session is lengthened based on the progression of the participant and the recommendation of the instructor by 1-2 minutes as needed to a maximum time of 60 minutes per session. Exercise intensity will begin at low levels (50% of maximal heart rate reserve (HRR) and increase by 5% every week (if deemed necessary by the instructor) to a maximum of 75% maximal HRR.</description>
