  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to determine if extended release Envarsus at an optimal level is just
      as effective as more invasive standard therapies for subclinical (mild) AMR (antibody
      mediated rejection) in kidney transplant patients. Subjects will be randomized to either
      conversion to Envarsus XR (extended release); or, to a standard of care regimen of plasma
      exchange/IVIG (intravenous immunoglobulin)/rituximab treatments.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is currently minimal data to guide treatment of mild graft damage in kidney transplant
      patients. Some of the current therapies used often come with dangerous complications
      (infections, malignancies, etc.). This is a pilot study to determine if extended release
      Envarsus at an optimal level is just as effective as more invasive standard therapies for
      subclinical (mild) AMR (antibody mediated rejection) in kidney transplant patients. The
      subjects will be randomized to either conversion from their current tacrolimus regimen to
      Envarsus XR (a once a day, extended release version of tacrolimus); or, to a regimen of 5
      plasma exchanges/IVIG (intravenous immunoglobulin) treatments and one treatment with
      rituximab. Subjects who are within their first year of transplant will visit their doctor
      monthly for regular tests and checks and then will have a kidney biopsy at 6 months. Subjects
      who had their transplant over a year prior will see the doctor for tests and checks at 1, 3
      and 5 months and then will have a biopsy of the kidney at month 6.
