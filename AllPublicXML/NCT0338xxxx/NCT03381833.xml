    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase 2 multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group study. The
      primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of LJPC-401 (synthetic human
      hepcidin) on iron levels in adult patients with transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia with
      myocardial iron overload.
