  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to measure the mesh shrinkage and the visualization of the mesh with
      MRI scan at 1 month and 13 months after robot assisted retromuscular incisional hernia repair
      with ipsilateral access and the use of the visible CICAT mesh (Dynamesh®) for defect repair.
      The investigators also want to measure the volume of the rectus muscles and the change
      between 1 and 13 months.

      The aim of this study is to measure the mesh shrinkage and the visualization of the mesh with
      MRI scan at 1 month and 13 months after robot assisted retromuscular incisional hernia repair
      with ipsilateral access and the use of the visible CICAT mesh (Dynamesh®) for defect repair.
      The investigators also want to measure the volume of the rectus muscles and the change
      between 1 and 13 months. Possibly the ipsilateral retromuscular access could induce some
      atrophy of the rectus muscles.

      The study will be conducted in the department of surgery in het AZ Maria Middelares, Ghent,
      Belgium. Dr. Filip Muysoms will personally select and operate all patients eligible for this
      study. Dr.Muysoms will inform all patients about the surgery and the follow-up with MRI scan
      thereafter. Dr. Beckers and Dr. Heindryckx will perform all MRI examinations of the patients
      at 1 month and 13 months post-operatively and will be available for questions from the
      patient.

      The investigators want to show that with this type of mesh it is possible to visualize the
      mesh after retromusculare placement in vivo in a safe manner. Furthermore, the positioning of
      the mesh, mesh shrinkage or mesh shifting will be monitored with this technique. This
      provides long-term benefit and provides early treatment possibilities in case of
      post-operative complications related to the mesh position.
