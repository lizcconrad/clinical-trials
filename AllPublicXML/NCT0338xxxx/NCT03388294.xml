      This study entails a &quot;proof of concept&quot; evaluation of a novel intervention, Parents and
      Infants Engaged (PIE), for prodromal infants at-risk for neurodevelopmental disorders (NDs).
      The objectives of the current study are to examine whether the PIE intervention (a)
      transforms parent-infant transactions over time as intended, thereby facilitating increases
      in the time infants spend in joint engagement with their parents, and (b) is associated with
      improved social-communication functioning and positive changes in indices of autonomic
      self-regulation in infants at-risk for NDs.

      Rationale:

      Providing intervention during infancy, before the full emergence of the symptoms that would
      lead to a diagnosis of ND based on a behavioral phenotype (e.g., ASD, language disorder, or
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) is supported by 4 premises: (1) The first two years
      of life are an especially active period of neural development. Due to rapid synaptic
      proliferation and experientially-influenced shaping of functional connectivity, interventions
      initiated in infancy may be powerful in promoting more typical neural connectivity (2)
      Biologically-based differences in infants at-risk for NDs lead to observable differences in
      sensory reactivity and communication behaviors in most infants by 9-15 months, prior to the
      full emergence of diagnostic symptoms. (3) Differences in infant behaviors influence the
      quantity and quality of parent responses. (4) Parent-child transactional processes begin
      early in infancy and impact long-term child outcomes. Based on these premises, the
      investigators propose a &quot;proof of concept&quot; evaluation of a novel intervention, Parents and
      Infants Engaged (PIE), for prodromal infants at-risk for NDs. PIE is designed to directly
      impact parent responses to behaviors commonly observed in infants at-risk for NDs. Without
      intervention, these behaviors may fail to elicit parent responses that efficiently scaffold
      child communication development. Extensive research shows positive associations between
      caregiver responsiveness and child communication outcomes. Responsiveness is defined by
      multiple dimensions (i.e., sensitivity, contingency, encouragement, matching
      interests/activity level, physical affection, quality of language input [e.g., verbal
      scaffolding], reciprocity, and shared control), which vary within and across caregivers.
      Children play an active role in eliciting responses from caregivers, emphasizing the
      co-regulatory or transactional nature of these interactions. This includes biobehavioral
      co-regulation of arousal levels. Whereas much research comes from studies of typical
      development, similar transactions occur with young children with NDs. Parent responses vary
      depending on the preceding behaviors of the child. For example, parents are more likely to
      respond, and to give a verbal response, to their one-year-olds' gestures than nongestural
      communicative bids (vocalizations, gaze, actions); also, adults are more likely to respond to
      infants' speech-like than nonspeech-like vocalizations. Parent responsiveness, in turn,
      predicts communication outcomes of children with varied NDs.

      Aims:

      Specific Aim 1: Evaluate the differential changes in attuned parent responsiveness following
      coaching on two PIE domains - responses to variable infant (a) sensory reactivity (SR) or (b)
      prelinguistic communication (PC) - as well as cumulative changes in attuned parent responses
      following coaching on both PIE domains.

      Specific Aim 2: Estimate the separate and combined effects of PIE intervention domains on
      parent-infant engagement and infant-initiated communication with parents.

      Specific Aim 3: Determine the extent to which autonomic indices of infant self-regulation
      change over the course of the PIE intervention.

      Recruitment:

      To identify infants at-risk for neurodevelopmental disorders, the investigators will use a
      population-screening method based on birth records in North Carolina, supplemented with
      distribution of postcards/flyers through physician's offices and public health clinics and
      email and listserv announcements. Completed FYIs will be scored and screened for risk status.
      Infants who score at-risk will be flagged, and those families will receive a phone call
      informing them of the results of the screening (by a qualified/trained project coordinator),
      and they will be invited for a more comprehensive developmental assessment.

      The intervention phases of the study will use a randomized comparative trial design, with two
      phases. For Intervention Study Phase 1, dyads will participate in the Pretest assessment
      battery; then the project methodologist will randomize families of eligible infants,
      stratifying randomization by age (&lt;13 months, 30 days or ≥ 14 months). Families will be
      randomized to one of two treatment arms: Arm 1 families will participate in initial coaching
      on the SR domain of PIE, and Arm 2 families will participate in initial coaching on the PC
      domain of PIE. Families will participate in 6 coaching sessions in their respective treatment
      arms, and then return for Posttest-1 (to test the separate impacts of the PIE content domains
      on parent responses and infant outcomes). For Intervention Study Phase 2, dyads in Arm 1,
      will receive 6 coaching sessions on the PC domain, and dyads in Arm 2 will receive 6 coaching
      sessions on the SR domain; coaching for each group will also review their respective content
      domain coached in Intervention Study Phase 1. Then families will return for Posttest-2 (to
      evaluate the effects of the full PIE intervention).

      Data Analyses:

      All data will be cleaned and inspected for outliers, missing data and distributional
      irregularities. Where error distributions potentially deviate from normality, or
      heteroscedasticity is suspected, the tests of the contrasts will be conducted using exact
      (resampling-based) nonparametric methods. Proportional outcomes will be arc sin transformed
      before entering them into the models. For the frequency count outcome, if counts are not
      sufficiently large (e.g., ≥ 8) that a normal approximation to a Poisson error distribution is
      appropriate, Poisson or negative binomial regression methods or nonparametric approaches may
      be employed.

      All primary analyses will be conducted to explore a priori contrasts of interest within a
      repeated measures framework. Of primary interest will be the contrast of Pretest to
      Posttest-1 scores and the contrast of Pretest to Posttest-2 scores (time effect). In
      addition, the models will include terms for treatment arm effects and treatment arm-by-time
      interactions.

      At Posttest-1, the investigators anticipate statistically significant time, treatment arm,
      and arm-by-time interactions, with parents showing differentially greater attuned responses
      to infant SR or PC, consistent with their respective treatment arm. By Posttest-2, however,
      the investigators predict group equivalence in responsiveness, with no differential time
      effects. A follow-up test of the contrast between Posttest-1 and Posttest-2 will verify that
      parents in Arm 1 maintained their attuned SR responsiveness gains, while parents in Arm 2
      &quot;caught up&quot; on attuned SR responsiveness, and vice versa for PC attunement. For H2a, the
      investigators expect increases in joint engagement from Pretest to Posttest-1, with
      additional increases at Posttest-2 (time effects), and no differential treatment arm effects
      or interactions at either Posttest. For H2b, the investigators anticipate minimal increases
      in infant intentional communication at Posttest-1 in either treatment arm, with comparable
      improvements (time effects) in each group at Posttest-2. Similarly, on the physiological
      measures addressing H3a (measured only at Pretest and Posttest-2) the investigators
      anticipate comparable improvements in RSA and SCL (time effect) in both arms.

      Although the investigators are performing multiple statistical tests across outcomes and
      hypotheses in addressing the specific aims, in this project it is more important to avoid
      overlooking statistical signals of effectiveness of the innovative PIE intervention approach
      (Type II errors), than avoiding false assertions of effectiveness (Type I errors). The
      investigators believe it is premature, therefore, to employ conservative adjustments to the
      Type I error rates in statistical tests, which would compromise the power of statistical
      tests to detect such signals. Assuming recruitment of 44 infant-parent dyads and allowing for
      a 9% (n=4) dropout rate, which is consistent with high retention rates (&gt; 95%) in our prior
      intervention studies, 40 dyads (20 per treatment arm) will have complete data for analyses.
      Assuming a conventional Type I error rate of .05, and intercorrelations among the repeated
      measures from .3 to .7, the magnitude of treatment group effects detectable with a .80
      statistical power will range from f=.37 to .42, respectively, which are large standardized
      effects. The magnitude of time effects and time-by-treatment arm interaction effects
      detectable with a .80 power will range from .27 to .18, also respectively, which are
      medium-sized standardized effects. Thus, the study is underpowered to detect any but large
      differences between the treatment arms and medium-sized or larger effects on time and time-by
      treatment arm interactions. More importantly than the statistical comparisons, though, the
      analyses will yield key descriptive characterizations of the treatment-arm effects at the two
      posttest points (i.e.,means, medians, proportions, and variances) on key outcomes, as well as
      effect size estimates that can be used in planning a larger scaled efficacy trial of the PIE
      intervention.

    <measure>Change in Parent Child Engagement Coding from pretest to posttest 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, posttest 1 (6-8 weeks after pretest)</time_frame>
    <description>This system entails continuous coding of infants' attention engagement into one of 6 mutually exclusive states: unengaged, onlooking, object engaged, person-engaged, supported joint engagement, and coordinated joint engagement. Due to the importance of the construct of engagement to our PIE theory of change, the total percent of time in joint engagement (supported + coordinated) will serve as the most proximal intervention outcome (i.e., changes expected at Posttest-1). Recent studies with children with NDs have shown that the coding system is sensitive to change in joint engagement after relatively short interventions.</description>

    <description>The MSEL is a standardized developmental assessment for children birth to 58 months, frequently used in studies of children with NDs, and comprised of 4 scales: Fine Motor, Visual Reception, Receptive Language, and Expressive Language. The investigators will administer only the Receptive and Expressive Language subscales of the MSEL at the second posttest and the first follow up assessment. To be eligible for the intervention portion of the study, children have to score at least 1 s.d. below the mean on either the Receptive or Expressive Language subscale of the MSEL. The investigators will report t scores (Mean = 50, SD = 10)and the standardized total Early Learning Composite (Mean = 100, SD = 15). Higher scores indicate greater developmental skills.</description>

    <description>A play-based assessment used to measure children's approach-avoidance to novel sensory toys (i.e., hyper-reactivity) and orienting responses (i.e., hypo-reactivity) across three sensory modalities (auditory, visual, tactile). The investigators will report a mean score for Hypo (range = 1-5), Hyper (range = 1-5) sensory subscales. Higher scores indicate greater sensory differences in that domain (e.g. a high hypo domain score would indicate more hyposensitive reactions to sensory stimuli seen in the child).</description>

    <description>A treatment response measure of social communication behaviors and other behaviors associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Administration of the BOSCC involves a 12-minute video recorded interaction between an examiner and a young child using two standard sets of toys and play with bubbles. Behaviors are coded from video. Total score range is 16-80. Higher scores indicate more typical social communication skills, lower scores indicate poorer skills.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

             Inventory (Calculated based on data collected in another study where risk status on
             the FYI was confirmed with follow up at 3 years. We empirically determined
             combinations of the two FYI domain scores that would sort respondents into &quot;at-risk&quot;
             and &quot;not-at-risk.&quot; The resulting cut-points enabled us to sort children such that we
             capture about 1/3 of those who would go on to be confirmed as at-risk while
             misclassifying less than 5% of the TD sample as a-risk) AND must score at least one
             s.d. below the mean on either the Receptive or Expressive subscale t scores AND meet
             the following SPA inclusion criteria on HYPO or HYPER:

               -  &quot;HYPO&quot;: Cut-point (equal or greater than) of 1.69 for Mean of the raw orienting
                  score across 7 items, each with the range of 1 to 4 possible points)

               -  &quot;HYPER&quot;: Cut-point (equal or greater than) of .333 for Mean of the raw
                  approach/avoid novel toys score across 9 items, each with the range of 0 to 2
                  possible points) OR Any clear &quot;defensive&quot; response on orienting items or &quot;Yes&quot; to
                  covering ears to sound (in stereotypies checklist)

          -  Inclusion criteria for the low risk control group will be scoring below the 95th
             percentile on the FYI between 11 and 16 months. Inclusion criteria for the high risk
             but ineligible for intervention control group will be scoring at or above the at-risk
             score on the FYI but not meeting criteria on the SPA and/or MSEL during their
             behavioral assessment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  families who speak English &lt; 50% of the time at home

          -  infants with previously identified genetic disorders (e.g., Down syndrome)

          -  infants with identified vision/hearing/physical impairments.
