    <textblock>
      To investigate the long-term efficacy and safety of the medical device, ChondroMimetic, in
      subjects who were treated in the interventional study 0MCM0107 for osteochondral defects of
      the knee.

      This is an open-label, single center, extension study to the previous interventional study
      0MCM0107 designed to investigate the long-term efficacy and safety of the medical device,
      ChondroMimetic, in the treatment of osteochondral defects of the knee. Follow-up to 6-months
      was completed as part of study 0MCM0107. All 17 subjects who received ChondroMimetic in study
      0MCM0107 are eligible for enrolment into this extension study regardless of their current
      follow-up period.
