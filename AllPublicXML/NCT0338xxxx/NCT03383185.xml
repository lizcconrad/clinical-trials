      Were eligible for the study 489 Women, followed in Federal University of São Paulo Family
      Planning Service, who used the same contraceptive method during five year of follow-up,
      According to the service protocol, the patients, after had participated of a orientation
      group about contraceptives methods, elected one of them. After that, if the choice had been
      according to the eligibility criteria of World Health Organization, it was approved by a
      gynecologist.

      The contraceptive methods available were the intrauterine device (IUD) oral contraceptives,
      including combined pills and progestin-only formulations, and depot medroxyprogestereone
      acetate.

      The study consisted in the evaluation of their medical records of weight, BMI, Blood
      pressure, glycemia, seric levels of cholesterol and triglycerides, during the five years, and
      in the comparison of the differences of these data between the contraceptive methods.
