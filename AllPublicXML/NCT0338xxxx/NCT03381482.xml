  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Alzheimer's disease (AD), neurofibrillary degeneration (NFD) is characterized by the
      intraneuronal aggregation of Tau proteins. The pathology progresses through a hierarchical
      pathway that may be associated with the intercellular transmission of pathology as
      demonstrated in our rat models. This transmission implies that Tau is actively secreted and
      may participate to the first steps of Tau pathology spreading. It is demonstrated in cell
      lines and animal models (rodents and non-human primates) that Tau is secreted not only in
      free forms but also in extracellular vesicles. If Tau is found in biological fluids before
      neuronal death it may represent an early marker of the NFD and will also define
      therapeutically targets. In this context, the aim is now to transfer this knowledge in humans
      and to decipher the nature of Tau secreted in plasma and cerebrospinal fluids collected from
      healthy controls to AD patients, and to decipher if the presence of tau inside vesicles is
      influenced by the pathology.

        Subjects intended to participate in group 1 have to undergo a lumbar puncture for other
        reasons than a cognitive complaint. They will be identified in the anaesthesiology
        department among patients who are waiting for scheduled orthopaedic surgery needing spinal
        anaesthesia. They will have the sample collection done with its specific procedures in the
        same time.

        Patients intended to participate in groups 2 to 5 will be identified at the MRRC during
        their scheduled visit with the investigators specialized in neurology/geriatric medicine.
