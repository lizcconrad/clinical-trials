  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multispectral imaging represents an exciting new field of investigation in endoscopic
      research. Multispectral imaging uses a specialised camera to detect multiple colours,
      allowing us to build a rough spectrum from each point in our image. It is widely reported
      that these spectra are different for different tissue types, but this is difficult to study
      ex vivo since de-oxygenation of the blood and decay of the tissue change these spectra
      considerably.

      The investigators have therefore designed this study to asses the different multispectral
      imaging spectra of Barrett's Oesophagus, which we believe might be utilised as a method to
      detect dysplasia in the future.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have developed a custom multispectral endoscopes based around a CE marked
      device, the PolyScope disposable endoscope (PolyDiagnost). This is a combined sterile
      catheter and fibre optic device designed to optimize light delivery to the anatomy and to
      acquire and transmit endoscopic images back to a camera. This CE marked system can be used to
      endoscope luminal organs such as the oesophagus, but also biliary tract, the bladder and the
      oro-pharynx.

      The PolyScope can be inserted thought the accessory channel of commercial endoscopes. The
      design of the fibre optic device is durable and re-useable; it is inserted within the
      disposable sterile catheter channel, which is able to flex and bend to orient the device to
      the region of interest for imaging. The fibre optic device never comes into contact with the
      patient. The sterile catheter, which shields the fibre optic device, is disposed following a
      procedure.

      The use of the PolyScope provides the advantage of building on a known system. The commercial
      PolyScope probe is coupled outside of the patient to a custom multispectral detection and
      illumination system. No modified part of the device comes into contact with the patient.

      The patients recruited to this study will have a clinical indication to an endoscopic
      examination for Barrett's oesophagus or early oesophageal adenocarcinoma. There will not be
      extra procedures involved. The experimental part of the procedure, using Polyscope
      multispectral endoscope will prolong the procedure in most cases by approximately 5-10
      minutes
