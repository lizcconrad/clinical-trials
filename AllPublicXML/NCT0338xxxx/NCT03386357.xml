      Randomized phase II study of immune stimulation with Pembrolizumab and radiotherapy in second
      line therapy of metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, prospective, multicenter phase II clinical trial of
      pembrolizumab with or without local radiotherapy in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic
      HNSCC after progression to platinum-based therapy.

      All patients will receive pembrolizumab 200mg absolute dose administered every third week.
      Patients in treatment arm A will receive radiotherapy of one, two or three metastases with a
      total tumor volume of at least 10cm³ intended to induce tumor cell death acting as an in situ
      vaccination. Radiotherapy will be performed conventionally fractioned with single doses of
      3Gy to a total dose of 36Gy. There will be a strict time schedule. Radiotherapy will always
      start on Wednesday. After application of the third radiation dose (Friday) the patients will
      receive pembrolizumab. After an interruption of radiotherapy for two days (Saturday, Sunday),
      radiotherapy will be continued. Pembrolizumab will be continued on an every three week
      schedule until confirmed disease progression according to iRECIST criteria, unacceptable
      toxicity, patient's wish to stop therapy or a maximal treatment time of 12 months.

      Tumor assessment will be performed every 9 weeks and will be evaluated according to iRECIST
      and RECIST. For each patient the same assessment method will be used throughout the study.
      Toxicity will be assessed according to CTCAE 4.0.

             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial
             treatment.

          3. Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis)

          4. Hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab or any of its excipients.

             day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events
             due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          6. Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy
             within 2 weeks prior to study day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ grade 1 or at
             baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent.

               -  Note: Subjects with ≤ grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this criterion and
                  may qualify for the study.

               -  Note: If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from
                  the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting

         12. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

         13. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

         14. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.

         15. Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent.

         16. Has a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).

         17. Has known active hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA
             [qualitative] is detected).

         18. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note:
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and
             are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live
             attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.
