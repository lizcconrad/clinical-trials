  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lichen planus is a chronic inflammatory mucocutaneous disease, which often results in oral
      manifestations, receiving the name of oral lichen planus (OLP). Its frequency varies from 0,1
      to 4% of the general population, with a higher incidence in women, around the 4th and 5th
      decades of life. Although the pathogenesis of OLP is related to a immune-cellular response,
      mainly mediated by T lymphocytes, its cause remains unknown. Considering its chronic nature,
      control of OLP aims to reduce symptoms and improve function, and agents with
      anti-inflammatory action, especially topical corticosteroids result in some degree of success
      in most patients, depending on the clinical presentation. However, some cases are resistant
      to the use of corticosteroids, thus justifying the search for new therapeutic options. The
      immunomodulation proved to be one of the main functions of probiotic bacteria, and recent
      studies have shown effect of probiotics on decreasing the expression of inflammatory markers,
      which enables the study of this therapy as an alternative to the control of OLP. Thus, this
      project aims to evaluate the effects of therapy with Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis
      HN019 comparing with clobetasol propionate 0.05% in symptomatic patients with OLP referred
      for diagnosis and treatment of School of Dentistry of Ribeirão Preto - University of São
      Paulo (USP). The impact of the topical therapy (probiotic or corticosteroid) on the clinical,
      histopathological and immunopathological features will be evaluated. This project was
      previously submitted and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the School of
      Dentistry of Ribeirão Preto/USP, and all patients must give informed consent to participate
      in this study.

      This is a randomized double-blind clinical trial with symptomatic patients presenting OLP,
      which will be randomly assigned to either topical Bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis HN019
      or clobetasol propionate 0.05%. The selected patients will receive capsules to be diluted in
      15 ml of water containing 6 x 109 CFUs of Bifidobacterium subsp. lactis HN019 (experimental
      group) or 0.05% clobetasol propionate (control group) for mouth washing, twice a day for 4
      weeks. Patients will be instructed to maintain normal brushing and not to use or consume
      another corticosteroid and /or probiotic during the study. Outcomes measures will be symptoms
      (VAS and Likert-like scale), quality of life (SF-36 form), and clinical changes (erythema,
      reticulation, erosion/ulcer based on clinical photographs), which will be performed at
      baseline, 15 days (only VAS, Likert-like scale and photographs) and and at one month of
      treatment. All patients will undergo biopsies for the diagnosis of OLP, and those who consent
      will be submitted to an optional biopsy at the end of the topical treatment for
      histopathological and immunopathological characterization.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical inclusion

               -  Adults ≥ 18 years old, both genres, who consent to participate of the study;

               -  Presence of symptomatic reticular lesion and/or white-gray papules. In
                  afro-descendent individuals, reticular lesions may be associated with
                  hyperpigmented lesions;

               -  Additional clinical features such as ulcerative, erythematous, plaque and bullous
                  lesions will be accepted in the presence of bilateral and symmetrical reticular
                  lesions.

          -  Histopathological inclusion criteria

               -  Presence of subepithelial infiltrate predominantly lymphocytic, in band and
                  confined to the subepithelial area.

               -  Liquefaction degeneration of the basal cells layer.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical exclusion criteria

               -  Exclusion of contact lichenoid lesions: the pattern of reticular lesion and / or
                  papules should not be present only in areas of physical contact with restorative
                  materials;

               -  Exclusion of lichenoid reaction to the drug: difficult to differentiate from OLP,
                  however it is necessary to report all drugs in use by the patient; the comparison
                  between patients on medication, and those who do not use medication is important
                  to establish subgroups of OLP;

               -  Exclusion of chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD): differentiation between
                  OLP and GVHD is established in most cases by medical history;

               -  Exclusion of immunocompromised patients or patients with systemic diseases of
                  high complexity.

               -  Exclusion of patients who have previously used probiotic bacteria in the last 4
                  weeks prior to the study.

          -  Histopathological criteria for exclusion • Presence of epithelial dysplasia, absence
             of the lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrate band and liquefaction degeneration.
