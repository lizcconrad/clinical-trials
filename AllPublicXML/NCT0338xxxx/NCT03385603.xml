  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is the evaluate the extent to which an intervention aimed at
      reducing pain-related fear affects sexual function and pain sensitivity compared to usual
      care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this work is to identify the mechanisms underpinning sexual pain in
      women. Women with sexual pain exhibit higher vaginal pain sensitivity and lower levels of
      sexual desire and arousal compared to pain-free women. As a result of pain, sexual
      intercourse is avoided. Previous work in this area has examined a wide variety of
      interventions for sexual pain but has not examined how vaginal pain sensitivity and resulting
      sexual dysfunction may be mediated by pain-related fear. The study team proposes that a
      standardized exposure intervention that directly targets pain-related fear will in turn
      reduce vaginal pain sensitivity and translate to clinically meaningful changes in sexual
      function. The study team will assign women with sexual pain to receive a home-based,
      patient-controlled exposure intervention or standardized home-based home program. The
      specific aims of this proposal are: 1) To evaluate the extent to which pain-related fear
      mediates vaginal pain sensitivity in women with sexual pain; 2) To evaluate the extent to
      which graded exposure translates to changes in sexual function and partner dynamics. The
      completion of this work will provide us with a better understanding of the mechanisms
      underpinning sexual pain and specifically, how pain-related fear influences vaginal pain
      sensitivity and sexual function.
