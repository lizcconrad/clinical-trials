    <textblock>
      The main scope of the present pilot study is to evaluate the possible association between the
      status of sarcopenia and the risk of fall in osteoporotic postmenopausal women. Forty
      osteoporotic postmenopausal women, previously (pre-recruitment) classified by DXA in 20
      sarcopenic and 20 non-sarcopenic subjects, will be recruited. The investigators will collect
      data on: 1) bone (vitamin D) and muscle (myokines) metabolisms through blood sampling; 2)
      Risk of fall by the OAK device produced by Khymeia; 3) thigh muscle quality through MR.

      A grave change associated with human ageing is progressive decline in skeletal muscle mass, a
      downward spiral that may lead to decreased strength and functionality. The term 'sarcopenia'
      (Greek 'sarx' or flesh + 'penia' or loss) has been proposed to describe this age-related
      decrease of muscle mass. Sarcopenia represents an impaired state of health with increased
      risk of falls and fractures, impaired ability to perform activities of daily living, and loss
      of independence. The imaging technologies used to detect loss of skeletal muscle mass in
      sarcopenia include: dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), magnetic resonance imaging (MR),
      computed tomography, peripheral quantitative computed tomography, and ultrasound.

      The main scope of the present pilot study is to evaluate the possible association between the
      status of sarcopenia and the risk of fall in osteoporotic postmenopausal women. Forty
      osteoporotic postmenopausal women, previously (pre-recruitment) classified by DXA in 20
      sarcopenic and 20 non-sarcopenic subjects, will be recruited. Data will be collected on: 1)
      bone (vitamin D) and muscle (myokines) metabolisms through blood sampling; 2) Risk of fall by
      the OAK device produced by Khymeia; 3) thigh muscle quality through MR.

      A secondary outcome is to evaluate the differences in bone and muscle metabolism, risk of
      fall, and muscle quality between sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic subjects.

    <measure>Association between sarcopenia, meant as the percentage of fat fraction of the thigh muscle evaluated by RM, and risk of fall evaluated through the OAK device.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 days.</time_frame>
    <description>The fat fraction of the thigh muscle is obtained by RM and expressed in percentage (%) of fat on muscle.
The risk of fall will be derived by the final score of the OAK device system. The score range is 0-24. Higher scores represent lower risk of falls.</description>

    <measure>Association between sarcopenia, meant as the Appensicular Skeletal Muscle Mass Index (ASMMI) obtained by DXA, and risk of fall evaluated through the OAK device.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 days.</time_frame>
    <description>ASMMI is obtained by DXA and calculated with the following formula: (total grams of lean muscle mass of left and right lower and upper limbs)/height*height, expressed in meters.
The risk of fall will be derived by the final score of the OAK device system. The score range is 0-24. Higher scores represent lower risk of falls.</description>

    <measure>Comparison of risk of fall, evaluated with the use of the OAK device, between sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic subjects.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 days.</time_frame>
    <description>The OAK device is an innovative technologic system, based on virtual reality, for the assessment and prevention of risk of fall in the elderly. The OAK device comprises (i) two stabilometric platforms that register the Center of Pressure (CoP) of each limb, (ii) four antennas, responsible for the low intensity magnetic field generation into which the patient will move, (iii) three bars able to detect the body weight loaded by the patient during the exercise accomplishment and (iv) a monitor, through which the patient is able to hear and see the exercises proposed. The subject will be set up with a belt, two gloves and two wrappers, containing passive magnetic sensors which can register subject's motions in real time thanks to the magnetic field generated by the antennas.
The fall risk assessment will last about 10 minutes and it will be performed before and after the exercise training. A score regarding the fall risk (low, medium or high risk) of the subject will be collected.</description>
