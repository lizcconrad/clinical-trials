      the subject will be followed within 2 business days after the study procedure to monitor for
      adverse events.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      DDS signals and VFSS will be recorded simultaneously (for the same bolus) using barium
      contrast agent stimuli prepared in three consistencies: thin, mildly-thick and
      moderately-thick. Subjects will undergo VFSS with simultaneous DDS using up to 5 boluses of
      thin barium stimulus (&quot;THIN-Ba&quot;), and up to 4 boluses of barium thickened to mildly
      (&quot;MILD-Ba&quot;) thick and up to 4 boluses of moderately (&quot;MODERATE-Ba&quot;) thick barium
      consistencies using Resource Thicken Up Clear Nestlé Health Science (TUC). 4, 3 and 3 boluses
      for THIN-Ba, MILD-Ba and MOD-Ba will be analyzed using the classifier algorithms for
      sensitivity/specificity results. According to the exploratory trial, VFSS data for safety or
      efficiency can be missing for up to 14% boluses due to quality of VFSS recording. To
      compensate for potential losses of boluses due to missing gold standard (VFSS) data, 5, 4 and
      4 boluses will be collected for the three consistencies respectively . The DDS signals will
      be sent to a dedicated application software installed at the CRO, which interprets the
      acceleration data and displays the examination result. The VFSS recording will be sent to CRO
      and provided for blinded assessment by the independent central VFSS laboratory.The study
      procedure of simultaneous VFSS and DDS measurement will be completed in one day and the
      subject will be followed within 2 business days after the study procedure to monitor for
      adverse events.

    <intervention_model_description>The clinical trial will initially start as a 3-look group sequential design (GSD). Alpha-spending will be calculated using Lan-DeMets spending function (with O'Brien-Fleming parameter). At the first interim analysis (IA-1) the threshold on the ROC curve may be re-computed using the ROC curve generated using the IA-1 data, in which case, the validation trial would start afresh following IA-1 using a 2-look GSD. Data included in the IA-1 would no longer be used for the validation phase.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The Nestle Health Sciences (NHSc) Dysphagia Detection System (DDS) is a portable, non-invasive device designed for use at the bedside. The investigational DDS has 3 basic components: Sensor Unit (suspended on a necklace), Sensor Fixation and a personal computer (PC) for collecting data. The Sensor Unit consists of a dual-axis accelerometer in a plastic housing that is attached to the front of a patient's neck just below the thyroid cartilage by the single-use, disposable fixation unit. The Sensor Unit is connected via a cable to an A/D converter which then connects via cable to the PC. The PC collects the examination data, which is then sent to dedicated application software (installed at the CRO), which interprets the acceleration data and displays the examination result.</description>
