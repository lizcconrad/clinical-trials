  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical research is to compare new methods of identifying the locations
      of tumours to standard CT imaging. Analysis of the tissue removed during surgery (pathology)
      will be used to determine which method is more accurate. Accurately identifying the locations
      of tumours is especially important for radiation therapy, where the radiation needs to cover
      the entire tumour while minimizing the amount normal tissue that is exposed to radiation. The
      new method uses optical imaging (endoscopy) that can be mapped to the CT imaging using device
      tracking technologies. CT imaging is used to create the radiation treatment plans and so
      tumour locations are normally provided by CT images. The advantage of the new technology that
      is being tested is that it may be able to locate regions of a tumour that are at the surface
      of the tissue. These tumours are difficult to see using CT imaging but easy to see using
      optical imaging. Currently, there is no accurate way of mapping the optical imaging to the CT
      images used in radiation therapy.

      This study will enable the investigators to test the new optical imaging by comparing the
      tumour that the investigators identify using CT imaging alone against using CT imaging plus
      the optical imaging technology. The results from this imaging will be compared to pathology
      findings.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      a CT image that includes a contrast agent that helps to identify the location of the tumour.
      Small markers will be placed on the participants head prior to the scan so that the
      investigators can align this CT image with the tracking technology used during the surgery.

      The participant will be moved to the surgical table, where the surgery will proceed as it
      would for standard of care procedures. The tracking technology and optical imaging will be
      used to identify where the tumour is located at the tissue surface

        -  Tumour tissue and extra tissue surrounding the tumour will be removed, as would occur
           normally in surgery. Some markers may be placed on the tissue where it is cut. These
           will be helpful in matching the tissue that is removed with its location in the images.

        -  A second CT image will be taken immediately following the tissue removal. This will be
           made using an imaging device called a cone beam CT.

        -  In collaboration with the pathology department, whole mount tissue samples will be
           assessed to determine the location of tumour tissue. Using the markings on the tissue
           and images taken of the tissue sample after it has been removed, the location of the
           tumour in the tissue sample will be compared to the location of the tumour in the CT
           image and the location of the surface tumour determined by the optical imaging
           technology.

        -  The CT images may be analyzed by radiation oncologists, surgeons and physicists.
