        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject with wide neck intracranial aneurysm located at a bifurcation

          2. The subject is between 18 and 80 years of age the time of consent

          3. Informed consent is obtained and the subject signs the IRB approved consent prior to
             beginning any study procedures

          4. In the opinion of the treating physician, placement of the PulseRider® device is
             technically feasible and clinically indicated

        Exclusion Criteria:
