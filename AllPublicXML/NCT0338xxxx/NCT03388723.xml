  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      India is one of the diabetes capitals in the world. Indians are susceptible to develop
      diabetes at a younger age and at a lower BMI compared to Europeans. Current prevention
      strategies focus on reducing risk in those with the established disease or risk factors. The
      Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) hypothesis suggests that chronic
      non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are programmed by disturbances in maternal and fetal
      undernutrition. This offers an alternative primordial prevention strategy to reduce NCDs in
      future generations by improving health and nutrition of young women. Previous work in the
      Diabetes Unit, KEM Hospital, Pune has described the role of maternal micronutrients affecting
      1-Carbon metabolism in the fetal programming of diabesity. In this application, the
      investigators offer to study other pathways of fetal programming i.e. maternal hyperglycemia
      and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) using an 'OMICs' approach. It is believed that
      epigenetic changes may be the main driver of programming. The investigators hypothesize that
      offspring of diabetic mothers will have different epigenetic signatures in cord blood and
      placenta compared to offspring of non-diabetic mothers. The investigators propose to study
      the effect of gestational hyperglycemia on newborn epigenetic signatures using the most
      appropriate technologies available and associate them with the underlying genotype. This will
      be performed on cord blood of 150 offspring of women with GDM and compared with a similar
      number of offspring of non-diabetic mothers recruited at Pune. The differentially methylated
      regions (DMRs) identified will then be validated by pyrosequencing in ~300 stored GDM cord
      blood samples in Pune. The investigators from Pune will also validate these markers in 200
      newly recruited offspring of GDM and 200 controls from a different cohort in Punjab which has
      a different diet and lifestyle. The DMRs will also be validated in placental samples from
      both Pune and Punjab. The investigators will further test the stability of these markers and
      their associations with phenotype in a follow-up study of offspring of GDM mothers in upto
      500 individuals. The investigators will compare the findings with the DNBC-GDM cohort in
      Denmark, allowing for differences in age, genetic make up, nutritional status and lifestyle.
      This study will help understand contribution of maternal diabetes to the current epidemic of
      diabesity and its molecular basis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The DOHaD paradigm proposes that early life nutrition and growth influence health and disease
      risk across the life-course. Intrauterine period is the most crucial period in these events,
      and contributes to fetal programming. Fetal undernutrition as well as over-nutrition
      (maternal obesity and diabetes) increase risk of diabetes in the offspring. Current thinking
      is that fetal programming is an 'epigenetic' phenomenon and the most prominent mechanism may
      be methylation of DNA and histones that regulate gene expression in key pathways. The
      investigators have previously highlighted a role for maternal micronutrients in fetal
      programming of adiposity, insulin resistance, and prediabetes (nutrient mediated
      teratogenesis). Now, the investigators propose to study the impact of maternal hyperglycemia
      during pregnancy on the future risk of diabesity in the offspring (fuel mediated
      teratogenesis). This programme, first of its kind in India, will undertake 'OMICs'
      measurements (DNA methylation and targeted metabolomics) on cord blood samples of children
      born to women with gestation diabetes mellitus (GDM), in studies in Pune, Western India
      (Arm-1) and Punjab, North India (Arm-2). Markers identified in the discovery phase will be
      investigated for validity and stability in blood, cord blood and placenta samples from
      children born to GDM mothers in the older cohorts in Pune and Punjab. Danish investigators
      will perform complimentary measurements in the Danish National Birth Cohort which will allow
      comparison of epigenetic markers in these two populations with widely different prevalence of
      GDM, and ethnic and nutritional factors. Special attention will be given to role of
      nutritional and lifestyle factors of mothers which influence the programming of fetal
      epigenome during pregnancy. The biobank of maternal, cord and offspring samples will be
      available in future to test newer hypotheses. This study will benefit from technology
      transfer across two countries. The findings will add substantially to the evidence base of
      intergenerational transmission of diabetes in a diabetic pregnancy, and will inform
      policy-makers to help curb the escalating epidemic of diabetes in India.

      Hypotheses

        1. The molecular mechanisms underlying the associations between gestational diabetes in the
           mother and diabesity in the offspring may involve permanent changes of DNA methylations
           in various tissues including blood cells obtained at birth and/or during childhood
           defining different trajectories.

        2. Epigenetic fingerprints linking GDM with risk of T2D among the offspring may or may not
           be influenced by tissue of origin, diet, life-style and ethnicity of population.

        3. Epigenetic changes in blood cells obtained at birth and/or during childhood associated
           with GDM in pregnancy may be used as bio-markers to predict later development of T2D in
           the offspring

        4. The risk of developing diabetes among offspring of GDM women may be influenced by
           maternal factors operating during pregnancy including degree of hyperglycemia, obesity,
           dietary factors including composition of macro- and micronutrients, and/or by the level
           of physical activity of the mother.
