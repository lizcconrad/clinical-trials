  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is well known that sleep is essential for brain development and learning. Infants require
      extensive sleep for development of the hippocampus, pons, brainstem, and midbrain and for
      optimizing physical growth. It is also essential for brain plasticity; the genetically
      determined ability of the infant brain to change its structure and function in response to
      the environment. Studies in young animals have shown that sleep deprivation leads to
      increased programmed cell death, smaller brain size, and loss of brain plasticity, all of
      which have negative long-term impact on behaviour and learning ability.

      Infant massage, a form of systematic tactile stimulation by human hands, improves sleep
      hygiene. Very little is known about how massage influences early brain development but it is
      certainly linked to the theory of environmental enrichment, which has been well established
      in animal models.

      The aim of this project is to optimise the infant's sensory experience through a
      multi-sensory enrichment programme, including massage (a massage utilising a scented lotion
      before sleep each day), to encourage more structured sleep and ultimately show improved
      developmental and cognitive outcomes.
