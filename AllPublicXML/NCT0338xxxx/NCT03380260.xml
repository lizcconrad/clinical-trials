  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of the present study is to test whether neural activity in brain regions
      associated with processing threat and social stimuli may underlie paranoid thinking.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Paranoia is a prominent symptom of psychosis that occurs in several other diagnoses, as well
      as the general population, and that is associated with significant distress and impairment.
      Previous research suggests that increased baseline activity of the amygdala and related
      neural circuits may serve as a mechanism for paranoid ideation. This exploratory study will
      use a paranoia induction procedure in healthy individuals who vary in pre-existing levels of
      paranoid ideation to test whether increases in self-reported paranoia are accompanied by
      increases in resting cerebral blood flow (CBF), decreased stimulus-driven neural activity in
      social processing networks, and increased behavioral perceptions of untrustworthiness.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to participate in a paranoia induction procedure or a
      control condition and will then complete neuroimaging and behavioral assessments.
