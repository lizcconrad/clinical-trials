  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An open phase-1, first-in-human, clinical trial investigating the safety and immunological
      effects of peptide vaccination with Programmed Death Ligand 1 and 2 (PD-L1 and PD-L2)
      peptides in patients with relapsed follicular lymphoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the the most common of the indolent lymphomas, with an incidence
      in Denmark of 220 per year. In 90% of the cases the disease is incurable why the treatment
      strategy often is watchful waiting until significant signs of progression or transformation.
      After chemotherapy, maintenance therapy is often used to increase disease control.

      The microenvironment and immune escape mechanism are believed to play a major role in the
      persistence of the lymphoma. One escape mechanism is the PD-L1 and PD-L2 molecules expressed
      in the microenvironment of follicular lymphoma inhibiting the T-cells. By stimulating the
      T-cells to attack PD-L1 and PD-L2 expressing cells we hope to hamper the immunosuppressive
      tumor environment and establish immune tumor control.

      10 patients treated with standard therapy for relapse are needed for the trial and each
      patient will receive 15 vaccinations over the course of one year.
