  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants of Immediate Life Support and Advanced Life Support Courses, where two different
      summative assessment methods were used are asked about their satisfaction with the assessment
      method using a questionnaire. Both quantitative questions using an 11-point-Likert scale as
      well as open-ended qualitative questions will be asked. The primary aim of this study is to
      find out which variant of summative assessment is perceived by course participants as testing
      their leadership competency best, immediately after the comparison as well as 1 year later to
      identify any long-term effects on the students.
