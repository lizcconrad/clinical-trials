      Medical and Nursing care is a high-pressure work environment. The charterer of medical and
      nursing care includes urgency of patients' problems, an unpredictable number of patients, and
      lack of medical professionals. This high-level of pressure working environment not only
      affects the persons' physical and mental health, increase turnover rate, but also might
      indirectly reduce the quality of care, even threaten the life of patients.

      The purpose of this study is to explore the correlation between professional quality of life,
      health status, job involvement and intention to stay in medical professionals, and the
      predictive factors of intention to stay and turnover behavior.
