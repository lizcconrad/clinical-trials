  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized Phase II trial to
      determine whether oral hyaluronic acid will prevent aromatase inhibitor (AI)-associated
      arthralgias. Subjects must have ER/PR-positive breast cancer tumor with history of aromatase
      inhibitor-associated musculoskeletal symptoms (AIMSS) which resolved after cessation of their
      AI (anastrazole or letrozole) within 90 days of enrollment. Subjects will be stratified by
      initial AI, thus within each initial AI, subjects will be randomized to receive either the
      experimental treatment (hyaluronic acid) or placebo. Subjects will begin the assigned
      treatment for 2 weeks prior to transitioning to the second AI. Evaluations will be taken at
      baseline, 6 weeks (1 month on study drug and AI), 14 weeks (3 months on study drug and AI),
      and at 26 weeks (6 months on study drug and AI). Treatment with hyaluronic acid and placebo
      will last for 26 weeks total.

      Primary Objective To determine whether oral HA will prevent AI-induced arthralgias and
      preserve physical function.

      Secondary Objectives

        1. To explore whether oral HA will have an acceptable safety and tolerability profile.

        2. To determine whether oral HA will prevent other AI associated symptoms as assessed by
           patient reported outcomes (PRO's).

        3. To assess how many of the subjects are 90% compliant with taking the HA as directed.

      Exploratory Objective To determine if mi486, (a microRNA enriched in skeletal muscle) and
      other biomarkers associated with AIMSS (TNF, IL-6, IL-17) vary with the administration of HA.

    <time_frame>14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>As measured by the Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form (BPI-SF) questions #3-#6, #9A-G. This 14-item questionnaire was developed for use in patients with cancer that uses a scale from 0 to 10 to assess worst pain, pain severity, and pain interference over the past week. The first 8 items have to do with the severity of the pain, and the remaining 7 items ask about how the pain has affected function.</description>

             for rash), inhaled sprays (e.g., for obstructive airway diseases), eye drops or local
             insertion (i.e., intra-articular). A short duration of systemic corticosteroids is
             allowed but not within 30 days prior to registration.

          6. Self-reported compliance issues and lack of regular prescription filling.
