  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this pilot study, the feasibility of using tDCS (a non-invasive brain stimulation
      technique) while performing a task requiring cognitive flexibility will be examined in
      smokers and initial data will be collected regarding the effect of tDCS on smoking cessation
      behaviors. Smokers will be randomized to receive either active or sham tDCS daily for 5 days
      after which they will attempt to quit smoking. Smoking behavior after the attempted quit date
      will be assessed at four weekly visits.
