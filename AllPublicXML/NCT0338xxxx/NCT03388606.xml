      Background:

      Almost 20% of Americans have depression. It is a leading cause of disability because it is
      chronic and it starts early. The highest incidence is among adolescents and young adults. But
      researchers don t know much about how depression occurs. It may be linked to reward
      processing.

      Objective:

      To characterize and treat depression in youth by focusing on reward processing.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 11-17 with major depressive disorder or subthreshold depression

      Healthy volunteers ages 11-17

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with interviews and questionnaires. They will have memory,
      thinking, and concentration tests. They may have a urine pregnancy test or have photos or
      videos taken.

      At the initial visit, participants will:

        -  Repeat screening tests

        -  Watch an interactive video about mood problems and anxiety

        -  Have functional MRI. Participants will lie in a metal cylinder in a magnetic field. They
           will do study tasks on a screen.

        -  Look at pictures to evoke happiness, sadness, or fear and get money for making certain
           choices. Parents can check the pictures before the children see them.

        -  Have brain and eye activity monitored

        -  Do tasks in a virtual reality environment

        -  Wear an activity monitor

      Participants will get phone prompts at home to ask about their mood.

      Participants will have several follow-up visits the first year, then 1 a year until they are
      25. They will repeat some tests above.

      Some participants with depression will have more visits before and after they have treatment.
      They will do some of the tests above plus drug testing. Participants and their parents will
      talk with a nurse, social worker, or psychologist. They will have practice work between
      visits.

      OBJECTIVE:

      Depression has a prevalence of 19% in the US population (Kessler &amp; Bromet, 2013) and close to
      350 million people suffer from the disorder worldwide (WHO, 2012). The chronic course of
      depression and its early onset a maximal incidence in adolescence and young adulthood -
      contribute to it being a leading cause of disability worldwide (WHO, 2014). Yet, compared to
      many other medical conditions, we know little about the mechanisms underlying depression. In
      recent years, reward processing have been proposed to underlie several key behavioral and
      neural aberrations observed in depression. This has led to the promise that targeting reward
      processing may lead to much needed breakthroughs in the field. In this protocol we seek to
      characterize and treat depression in youth by integrating methodological and conceptual
      approaches that specifically focus on reward processing. Our objective is to answer four key
      questions:

        1. What is the concordance of measures of reward processing in depression over time?

           Measurement is fundamental to answering substantive questions in science. Our review of
           the literature identified gaps in the reliability of reward measurement, the concordance
           between measures, and a dearth of studies that employ repeated-measure designs. We
           propose to tackle this using a multi-method approach in a longitudinal design.

        2. Are reward processing aberrations in depression similar to those in other common
           problems of childhood, such as anxiety and irritability?

           Specificity-in this case establishing which reward aberrations are unique to a certain
           phenotype as opposed to a generic finding related to psychopathology-is important for
           both nosology (disease classification) and for esigning rational treatments for
           psychiatric problems. Below, we describe how we propose to answer this question by
           characterizing reward processing in those with depression and comparing it to processing
           in those with other common psychiatric problems in youth, such as anxiety and
           irritability.

        3. How does reward processing interact with systems subserving sense of agency?

           As described above, decision-making is an intricate part of reward processing. It is
           assumed that higher-order cognitive processes, such as the sense of ownership of one s
           actions-referred to as sense of agency-influence reward processing. Establishing the
           role of such higher-order processes in depression could lead to developing treatments
           that boost cognition and restore reward processing in depression. Below, we propose to
           answer this question by testing whether inter-individual differences in sense of agency
           explain variation in depression via reward processing (a mediation model).

        4. Do Growth Mindset Interventions (GMI) impact on reward processing to influence
           depression?

           Treatments of depression in youth have stalled and are on the whole still
           unsatisfactory. GMI have emerged as a concise, circumscribed means to influence
           perceived control and have an evidence base for improving emotional problems in youth.
           Here, we conduct a randomized Controlled Trial of a very concise GMI to examine whether
           GMI impacts on agency, reward and depression.

           STUDY POPULATION:

           We will study three populations: (1) Healthy volunteers (HVs; n=300); (2) Participants
           with Major Depressive Disorder

           (MDD; n=300); (3) Participants with subthreshold depression (s-MDD; n=200). Study
           participants will be aged 11-17 years.

           DESIGN:

           The study has two parts. The first part is Characterization, where HV, s-MDD and MDD
           subjects will be take part in a longitudinal, observational study that involves clinical
           assessment, computer tasks and fMRI and MEG scanning and continues up to age 25 years.
           The second part is Intervention, that has two components: a) GMI RCT, where participants
           will be invited to participate in a 30-minute, single-session RCT comparing GMI to a
           control session. This component, including assessment pre- and post- single-session-RCT,
           lasts for 2-5 weeks; b) CBT treatment, where upon completing the GMI RCT, patients who
           still suffer from MDD will be offered open-label Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT; up
           to 25 weeks or a total of 50 sessions). During and following completion of the RCT
           and/or CBT, participants with MDD will continue in Characterization. Upon completion of
           CBT patients will return to care in the community. MDD patients who are clinically
           unstable and are eligible for standard clinical treatment as inpatients or day-patients
           and may enter treatment at NIH after having started in Characterization or at the time
           of initial enrollment.

             assessment) which are:

               -  Five or more of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week
                  period and represent a change from previous functioning; at one of the symptoms

                    -  Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either
                       subjective report (e.g., feeling sad, blue, &quot;down in the dumps,&quot;or empty) or
                       observation made by others (e.g., appears tearful or about to cry). (In
                       children and adolescents, this may present as an irritable or cranky, rather

                    -  Fatigue, tiredness, or loss of energy nearly every day (e.g., even the
                       smallest tasks, like dressing or washing, seem difficult to do and take
                       longer than usual).

               -  Symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
                  occupational/academic, or other important areas of functioning.

               -  The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or to

               -  If the child has a psychiatrist, the child s psychiatrist or treater agrees that
                  the child s response to his/her current treatment makes it clinically appropriate
