    <textblock>
      Background Incidence of perioperative stroke In cardiac surgery is 2.6-5.2%. Ascending aortic
      atheromatous plaque and stroke are strongly associated.

      Propose of study To determine incidence of ascending aortic atheroma in Thai people To
      identify risk factors which associated with ascending aortic atheroma

      Methodology After received standard general anesthesia and start sternotomy. Epiaortic scan
      will be performed by surgeon use L15-7i Phillips® ultrasound probe cover with sterile cover.

      Five standard epiaortic views will be collected. Epiaortic clips will be review and determine
      about atheroma by two qualified echocardiographers. Atheroma more than third grade will
      defined to significant. Potential risk factors of atheroma will be gather from medical record

      To assess the relationship between risk factors and atheroma a univariate analysis was
      performed using an unpaired t-test and a Chi-square test.

      For higher accuracy regarding the impact of single risk factors, a multiple logistic
      regression analysis was also performed.
