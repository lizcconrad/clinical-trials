      The aim of this study was to identify the assistance effect of the new wearable hip assist
      robot, gait enhancing mechatronic system (GEMS) developed by Samsung Advanced Institute of
      Technology (Samsung Electronics Co, Ltd., Korea) during stair ascent by comparing the energy
      expenditure of elderly adults with and without the GEMS.

      Primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the effect of a wearable hip assist robot
      on cardiopulmonary metabolic efficiency during stair ascent in elderly adults.

      Fifteen elderly adults participated in this study. The stair ascent trials were designed to
      climb stairs from the first basement level to the fourth floor of the Proton Therapy Center,
      Samsung Medical Center, Korea. The metabolic energy expenditure was measured using a portable
      cardiopulmonary metabolic system (Cosmed K4b², Rome, Italy) while participants performed
      randomly assigned two different conditions consecutively:, free ascent without the GEMS
      (NoGEMS) or robot-assisted ascent with the GEMS (GEMS). Participants rested for 10 minutes
      between the two trial conditions.

    <description>All participants stood in a comfortable position for 5 minutes to obtain baseline variables before stair ascent. Participants were then asked to climb stairs from the first basement level to the fourth floor of the Proton Therapy Center, Samsung Medical Center, Korea, in a step-over-step manner under two different conditions, GEMS and NoGEMS. The GEMS and NoGEMS conditions were conducted in a random order, and just before the second condition, participants stood for 2～3 minutes to obtain baseline variables once more.</description>
