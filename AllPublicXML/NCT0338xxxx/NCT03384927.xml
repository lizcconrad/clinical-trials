      1. Assessing whether the treatment diary can help optimize the overall treatment of
           patients.

        2. To assess whether the patient finds the treatment diary useful and worth spending time
           on. Also if the patient finds it easier to evaluate the treatment and, if necessary, set
           new goals.

        3. To assess whether the patient's quality of life is increased by the use of the treatment
           diary.

      Hypothesis:

      A treatment diary will increase the patient's awareness of which spasticity symptoms are
      significant and can enable the patients to evaluate the treatment more easily.

      This will result in more relevant treatment goals. At the same time the treatment can be
      better addressed to the individual patient at routine controls. In addition, the treatment
      diary will result in closer cooperation between the physiotherapists and occupational
      therapists and the physician who administers the botulinum toxin. This collaboration is
      expected to lead to better common goals and optimization of treatment.

      Finally, it is expected that the above will help to increase the patient's quality of life.

        Patients with muscle overactivity / spasticity independent of the cause and who are being
        followed as outpatients in the Spasticity Clinic, Neurological Clinic, Rigshospitalet
        Glostrup.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have received at least two previous treatments before inclusion, ie.
             with approx. 3 months apart, and it is assessed that the patients have good effect of
             the treatments in relation to the agreed treatment goals.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients where changes are planned regarding their treatment for muscle overactivity
             during the study period.

        Patients where the disease is not stable and where it may have a major influence on the
        treatment effect of botulinum toxin treatment during the study period and where it can be
        difficult to set SMART (Specific, Measurable, Accepted, Realistic, Timed) goals.

        Patients who have previously been treated and have used a treatment diary in connection
        with the botulinum toxin treatment.

        Patients who can not collaborate on completing goals and evaluating treatment effect due to
        language or cognitive problems.

        Patients who at the same time are being treated with botulinum toxin in the bladder.

        If significant changes occur in the patient's health, which may involve new cancer, stroke,
        multiple sclerosis attack, etc. during the study period, the participant will be withdrawn
        from the study.
