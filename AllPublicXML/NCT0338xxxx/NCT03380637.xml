  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effectiveness of ultrasound in term pregnant patients posted for
      elective lower segment cesarean sections and compared them with non pregnant females posted
      for elective surgeries.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is increased risk of aspiration in pregnancy due to various reasons i.e. increased
      progesterone levels, decreased motilin levels and distortion of gastric antrum due to gravid
      uterus.Ultrasound was proposed to be point of care tool, to assess risk stomach. A comparison
      with respect to the effectiveness of ultrasound was made in this study. The visibility of
      gastric antrum by ultrasound in term pregnant females posted for elective lower segment
      cesarean sections was compared with non-pregnant females posted for elective surgeries.

      The secondary aim of the study was to compare the gastric antrum in either groups
      qualitatively and quantitatively.
