  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Melanoma is a malignant tumor caused by hyperplasia of abnormal melanoma cells.Most of the
      adults above 30 years of age occur in the skin, mucosa and internal organs. The investigators
      designed the study to explore the possibility of apatinib as the Second-line Therapy in
      Malignant Melanoma.
