  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effects of cervical spine manual therapy, including mobilization and manipulation, on
      cervical spine range of motion, joint position sense, and balance is unknown among
      individuals with cervicogenic headache. Previous studies have indicated improved frequency of
      headache, decreased perceived disability, and demonstrated improved neuromuscular function
      following upper cervical manipulation. Other authors report improved cervical spine range of
      motion, joint position sense, and balance following cervical spine manual therapy for
      individuals with cervicogenic dizziness. Through an experimental design, this study aims to
      determine the effects of cervical spine manual therapy on variables such as cervical spine
      range motion, joint position sense, and balance among individuals with headache of a cervical
      spine origin.

      A convenience sample will be utilized to obtain subjects who suffer from cervicogenic
      headaches, as defined by the International Headache Classification. Subjects will be given an
      online medical screening questionnaire to differentiate and screen additional types of
      headache symptoms (migraine, cluster, tension-type, for example) and identify possible
      contraindications for manual therapy treatment techniques and exclude individuals if
      necessary. Subjects will be randomized into one of three groups (upper cervical mobilization,
      upper cervical manipulation, or control) and be tested with the Cervical Flexion Rotation
      Test, Joint Position Error testing, and sensorimotor balance testing via NeuroCom Balance
      Master. Subjects with cervicogenic headaches will receive their assigned intervention and
      dependent variables will be reassessed immediately, as well as 4-weeks after initial
      intervention. Individuals in either intervention group (mobilization or manipulation) will
      also complete a specific home-exercise program, which has been reported to improve upper
      cervical range of motion, to the C1/2 segment.

    <measure>Change in Cervical Flexion Rotation Test (CFRT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-Intervention, 4-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Cervical Range of Motion (CROM) instrument will be placed on the subject. The subject will lie supine on the treatment table. The investigator will then passively flex the entire cervical spine and then rotate the head to both the left and right. The range of motion available in each direction, as measured by the CROM, will be recorded.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Joint Position Error</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-Intervention, 4-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The subject will have a small laser pointer mounted onto a lightweight headband, which they will wear. The patient will be seated 90 cm from the wall. The starting point that is projected by the laser on the bullseye is marked. The patient will have their eyes closed and will perform an active neck movement. After this, the patient will return their head as accurately as possible to the starting position. This will include 6 trials, which will include cervical flexion, extension and rotation. The final laser position is measured against the starting position in centimeters. Errors will be measured following active return from cervical extension, flexion and rotation.</description>

    <measure>Change in Balance as measured by NeuroCom Balance Master</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-Intervention, 4-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A pre-programmed option on the NeuroCom Balance Master will be utilized to assess the Modified Clinical test of Sensory Interaction on Balance (mCTSIB). Three different conditions will be utilized and each condition will last 30 secs. Three trials will be completed for each condition.First, the subject will be asked to maintain their balance while their eyes are closed. The amount of postural sway that they demonstrate will be recorded. Second, the subject will be asked to maintain their balance with their eyes open while the platform on the NeuroCom Balance Master force plate moves. The amount of postural sway demonstrated will be recorded. Third, the subject will be asked to rotate their head all the way to the left, then rotate their head all the way to the right. They will continue rotating between sides for the duration of the 30 second trial. The amount of postural sway that they demonstrate will be recorded.</description>
