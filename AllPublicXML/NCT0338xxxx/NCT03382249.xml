  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is a new treatment for carotid atherosclerotic plaque. The aim of
      this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of this technique.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Carotid atherosclerotic plaque is an important cause of ischemic stroke, causes about 30%
      stroke/TIA attacks. patients with carotid stenosis face an escalated risk of MI, PAD, and
      death. Treatments for patients with carotid plaque include lifestyle changes, medical
      management(such as control of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes) and carotid
      revascularization(carotid endarterectomy or carotid artery stenting). Studies have suggested
      that plaque morphology and composition are important determinants of plaque stability, using
      serial MR imaging of the carotid artery allowed observation of changes in plaque composition,
      and using dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging (DCE MRI) can reflect the extent of
      neovasculature and the plaque inflammatory activity.

      The aim of this trial is to assess the safety and efficacy of SDT. The SDT can induce
      macrophage elimination and inhibiting matrix degradation, which will promote plaque lipid
      depletion, inflammation level decrease and changes in other plaque tissue components, leading
      to plaque stabilization and reduction.

      An estimated 80 eligible patients will be randomly divided into two groups: optimal medical
      care (OMC) combined with pseudo-SDT and OMC combined with SDT. Recruitment will be performed
      over 1 year and patients will be followed for 3 months; the anticipated total study duration
      will be 2 years.

    <description>Optimal medical care (OMC) and pseudo-SDT are administrated in this arm. OMC is established according to the standards established by the 2017 China Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Carotid Artery Stenosis in order to promote best practices for risk factor management. Pseudo-SDT combines saline injection and obstructed ultrasound exposure on targeted lesions to simulate real SDT progression.</description>

    <description>Sonodynamic therapy(SDT) treatment is the combination of sonosensitizer administration and target atherosclerotic lesions ultrasound exposure. Sinoporphyrin sodium (DVDMS) as sonosensitizer, is dissolved in 0.9% sodium solution for following skin test and intravenous injection. 0.01mg/ml DVDMS solution (0.1ml) is prepared for skin test followed by 0.04 mg/ml DVDMS solution intravenous injection (0.2mg/kg).The target atherosclerotic lesions are marked on the corresponding skin with ultrasound guidance and underwent ultrasound exposure after 4 hours incubation. The therapeutic ultrasonic transducer is fixed to the marked skin site for 15min of each lesion. Ultrasound parameters included intensity of 1.6W/cm2 for carotid lesions, resonance frequency: 1.0 MHz and duty factor: 30%.</description>
