  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic and recurrent inflammatory disease, prevalent between 1
      and 20% in the world population, with a predominance of childhood, but which may be present
      in adult life. AD results from a complex interaction between genetic and environmental
      factors, with the presence of a defect in the skin barrier and deregulation of the immune
      response, culminating in an inflammatory response in the skin predominantly type 2. Disease
      control is based on restoring skin hydration, smoothing itching and controlling the process
      specific sensitizing agents such as inhalant allergens and foods that may pathogenesis of the
      disease. In selected patients who present IgE mediated response to inhalant allergens,
      allergen-specific immunotherapy can be effective. Classically, the subcutaneous route is the
      most used, however, sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) has been used in increasing form. There
      are still few studies on the efficacy and safety of SLIT in atopic dermatitis. Therefore, the
      present study aims to to investigate the role of SLIT in the management of patients with AD
      allergic mites, through a randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled study

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 94 patients, 3 years of age or older, with clinical diagnosis of AD, without
      distinction of gender, ethnicity or social group, will be selected at HCFMRP-USP Allergy and
      Dermatology outpatient clinics. These patients will undergo clinical evaluation and
      laboratory tests, including blood count, total IgE, inhalant panel specific IgE, and / or
      immediate hypersensitivity skin tests, and mite allergen specific IgG4 (Der p 1 and Der p 2),
      before of the study. In order to calculate the sample size, a response rate to the medication
      was defined as a 15 - point decrease in SCORAD (score that includes lesion extent, intensity
      and subjective symptoms such as pruritus and sleep), which was determined through the
      experience of the service. It was estimated that 40% of the patients in the treatment group
      and 15% of the placebo group reached the proposed rate through a test with 80% power, and the
      need for 47 individuals in each group was defined.

      Patients in the treatment group will undergo allergen-specific immunotherapy sublingually,
      with weekly doses of extracts of mites Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and Dermatophagoides
      farinae (60% and 40% respectively), according to the scheme described in Tables 1 and 2.
      Patients in the control group will be submitted to the same administration schedule, but with
      diluent of the allergenic extract (doubly distilled water solution, glycerin and sorbitol).
      Patients will be divided into groups according to randomization.

      Subjects will be randomly divided into blocks of random size 4 or 6 and stratified according
      to age (less than 12 years and greater / equal 12 years) and severity (SCORAD less than 50
      and greater / equal 50), performed by through the RedCap platform, available at FMRPUSP. This
      process will be performed by laboratory staff who will provide the extracts and the
      researchers will not have access to the lists of patients in each group. As for blinding, the
      bottles with extract and placebo will be provided by the already coded laboratory, and the
      team will only be responsible for the delivery and storage of the same.

      Individuals will be selected during the regular routine of the outpatient clinics of the
      Allergy and Dermatology Service of the HCFMRP-USP. All medical records and clinical and
      dermatological examination will be recorded in medical records, as well as clinical
      evaluation by SCORAD , quality of life questionnaire and subjective scale of symptoms, being
      evaluated at the beginning of treatment, after two, three, six, nine, twelve and sixteen
      months of evolution.

      Serum levels of IgG4 specific mite for Der p 1 and Der p 2 will be determined by a method
      standardized by the Federal University of Uberlândia, in collaboration with Prof. Ernesto
      Akio Taketomi, and evaluated at the beginning and at the end of treatment. Interleukins 4, 5,
      9, 10 13, 17, TNFα, TGFβ and interferon-γ will be performed in plasma by ELISA in
      collaboration with Prof. Vanessa Carregaro Pereira, with 4 months of evolution and at the end
      of the study.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Decrease in Severity Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measures at baseline and after 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SCORAD is calculated using the extent of the injury, intensity and subjective symptoms, the formula used for the calculation is A / 5 + 7B / 2 + C (A - extent B - intensity C-subjective symptoms). The extent can vary from zero to 100, applying the nine rule also used in large burned patients. The intensity varies from zero to 18, divided into six items, including erythema, edema, excoriation, lichenification, and dryness. Subjective symptoms range from zero to 30 evaluated by means of analog pruritus scale and sleep.
The SCORAD severity rating is:
0-20 mild 20-40 moderate &gt; 40 severe
Based on our clinical experience, it was decided to consider as the main outcome a 15-point decrease in SCORAD,in any degree of severity, in 40% of subjects in the treatment group and 15% in the placebo group.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dermatology Quality of Life Index (DLQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>3, 6, 9, 12 and 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The DLQI is a questionnaire of ten questions used to measure how much skin problems affected patient´s life in the last seven days.
SCORING
The scoring of each question is as follows:
Very much scored 3 A lot scored 2 A little scored 1 Not at all scored 0 Not relevant scored 0 Question 7, 'prevented work or studying' scored 3 The DLQI is calculated by summing the score of each question resulting in a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0. The higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired.
HOW TO INTERPRET MEANING OF DLQI SCORES 0 - 1 no effect at all on patient's life 2 - 5 small effect on patient's life 6 - 10 moderate effect on patient's life 11 - 20 very large effect on patient's life 21 - 30 extremely large effect on patient's life
The decrease of 4 or more points in DLQI is a secondary outcome measure</description>

How much your skin itched last week ? How much your skin peeled last week ? How atopic dermatitis interfered with last week's sleep ? Any reduction in the score of the visual analog scale of symptoms will be accepted</description>
