  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the addition of an automated physician-specific text-messaging (SMS) bot
      in patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty. Half of the patients received the
      traditional perioperative education and instructions (control group), while the other half
      were enrolled in their physician's SMS bot (intervention group).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In an era of value-based reimbursement and high-volume surgery, the patient experience is
      becoming increasingly important. Despite publicized efforts to place a greater emphasis on
      patient-centered care, patients often report poor access to their physician, lack of
      effective perioperative education, and frustration as their care is commoditized.

      A text-messaging (SMS) bot has the potential to help fill some of these voids. Bots are
      computer programs that are inherently automated to simulate human-like tasks. While a
      physician may wish he or she could contact each of their patients daily, it would be an
      impossible undertaking for most. An SMS bot could make daily contact possible by automating
      it, potentially improving patient education and engagement before and after surgery. Standard
      SMS has been previously reported to be an effective means for delivering timely information,
      increasing patient compliance and outcomes (medication adherence, decrease surgical
      infections with antiseptic showers), and reaching a socioeconomically diverse patient
      population. Further benefits may be seen with an SMS bot due to its automated capabilities.

    <description>Medications designated as &quot;narcotics&quot; included any medications that contained: hydrocodone, oxycodone, codeine, morphine, or tramadol. Patients were instructed to record their responses during the same two-hour window each day in a daily diary.</description>
