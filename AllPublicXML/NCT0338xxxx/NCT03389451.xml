  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates if a new drug (PSMA) makes prostate cancer easier to identify in
      positron-emission tomography (PET) imaging. If this works, prostate cancer treatments can be
      prescribed that match the location of the disease. PSMA is radiolabeled with Gallium-68
      (Ga-68). This means a participant receives a small dose of radiation from the drug - less
      than the annual radiation limit for a medical worker.

      To test this new drug, participants will receive an injection of Ga-68 PSMA and then have a
      PET scan. This PET scan, and the reported results, will be entered into the medical record
      and shared with the treating oncologists.

      This study evaluates PSMA-HBED-CC labelled with Gallium-68, abbreviated 68Ga PSMA. This is a
      radiotracer that attaches to receptors in the membrane of prostate cancer cells. The 68Ga
      PSMA is identified using a positron emission tomography (PET) scanner. It is believed that
      68Ga PSMA will identify prostate cancer more precisely than normal imaging methods (MRI, CT,
      or ultrasound). Imaging is key to successful treatment - disease must be identified to be
      treated.

      Men who have biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer are invited to test 68Ga PSMA.
      Participants undergo the 68Ga PSMA PET scan before further treatment. Clinical information,
      including any MRI, CT, or ultrasound imaging and biopsy/surgery information, will be used to
      determine if the 68Ga PSMA PET imaging was better than the standard imaging. The study team
      will collect this information for about 1 year after the PSMA scan.

      Depending on findings, participants may be invited back for a second 68Ga PSMA scan. This is
      done if the first scan showed positive lymph nodes or soft tissue metastases but a surgery or
      biopsy result does not.

      The results from these scans will be shared with the participant. Results will also be
      entered into the participant's medical record and shared with the treating oncologists.
