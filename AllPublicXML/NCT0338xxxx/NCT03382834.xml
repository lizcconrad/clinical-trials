      This study will evaluate the effects of tamoxifen exposure in combination with vorinostat on
      viral reactivation among HIV-1 infected post-menopausal women with virologic suppression on
      antiretroviral therapy (ART), when compared to vorinostat alone.

    <textblock>
      The selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) tamoxifen may enhance the ability of the
      histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) vorinostat to reverse HIV-1 latency. This study will
      evaluate the safety of tamoxifen therapy combined with vorinostat and the effectiveness of
      this combination on latent virus reactivation in HIV-1 infected post-menopausal women with
      virologic suppression on antiretroviral therapy (ART), when compared to vorinostat alone.

      The study will be conducted in two steps. During Step 1, the study will enroll women with HIV
      into two groups. Arm A will receive tamoxifen daily for 38 days, plus a single dose of
      vorinostat on Days 35 and 38. Arm B will have a 38-day observation period with no tamoxifen,
      plus a single dose of vorinostat on Days 35 and 38. All participants will continue to take
      the antiretroviral (ARV) drugs prescribed by their doctors. ARV drugs will not be provided by
      the study.

      Study visits during Step 1 will occur at Days 0, 28, 35, 38, 45, and 65. Study visits may
      include physical examinations, blood collection, electrocardiograms, and adherence
      assessments.

      During Step 2, all participants will be followed for 240 additional weeks for annual
      long-term safety follow-up. These visits will be conducted by phone and will collect
      information from participants on vital status and any new cancer diagnoses.

             (CDC) guidelines mandate that confirmation of the initial test result must use a test
             that is different from the one used for the initial assessment. A reactive initial
             rapid test should be confirmed by either another type of rapid assay or an E/CIA that
             is based on a different antigen preparation and/or different test principle (e.g.,
             indirect versus competitive), or a Western blot or a plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load.
