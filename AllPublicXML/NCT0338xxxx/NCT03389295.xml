      To determine the efficacy and safety of sequential chemoradiotherapy with regimen of
      docetaxel, cisplatin and fluorouracil and reduced target delineation radiotherapy for
      patients with locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although concurrent chemoradiation is the standard treatment modality for locally advanced
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), high incidences of distant metastases and severe treatment
      related toxicities have become an obstacle to be overcome. Besides, a common problem in
      locally advanced NPC is the narrow gap between the tumor and critical normal structures,
      which makes dose optimization difficult. Considering that significant tumor shrinkage may
      occur during induction chemotherapy, and incidences of distant metastases may be reduced by
      adjuvant chemotherapy, this study was designed to explore the efficacy and safety of
      sequential chemoradiotherapy with regimen of docetaxel, cisplatin and fluorouracil and
      reduced target delineation radiotherapy for patients with locoregionally advanced NPC.

    <description>All patients were assigned to receive induction chemotherapy (IC) followed by IMRT with adjuvant chemotherapy (AC). IMRT was administered 2 weeks after IC, and AC was administered 1 month after IMRT. IC or AC (TPF regimen) comprised docetaxel (60 mg/m2/day, day 1), cisplatin (25 mg/m2/day, days 1-3), and 5-fluorouracil (500 mg/m2/day with a 120-h infusion) administered once every 3 weeks for two cycles. During radiotherapy, involved retropharyngeal lymph nodes and intracavity lesions of the primary tumor were delineated according to the post-IC volume, whereas the remainder of the involved tissues (eg, pterygopalatine fossa) of the primary tumor were delineated according to the pre-IC volume of the primary tumor as shown by MRI. Post-IC volumes of involved neck lymph nodes were used for delineation.</description>

    <description>The target volumes were delineated according to the treatment protocol defined as follows: the GTV of the primary tumor (GTV-P) included retropharyngeal lymph nodes, considering the common phenomena of integration, and the rest involved lymph nodes that were defined as GTV-N. For the GTV-P, involved retropharyngeal lymph nodes and intracavity lesions were delineated according to the post-IC volume, whereas the remainder of the involved tissues (eg, pterygopalatine fossa) were delineated according to the pre-IC volume of the primary lesion as shown by MRI. Post-IC volumes of involved neck lymph nodes were used for GTV-N delineation.</description>
