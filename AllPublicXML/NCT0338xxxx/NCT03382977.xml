  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-part, dose-escalation study to define the safety, tolerability, and optimal
      dose level of candidate GBM vaccine VBI-1901 with subsequent extension of optimal dose level
      in recurrent GBM subjects. Subjects in the dose escalation (Part A of trial) as well as
      extension phase of the trial (Part B) will continue to receive vaccine every 4 weeks until
      tumor progression per iRANO criteria.
