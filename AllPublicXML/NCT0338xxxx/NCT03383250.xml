  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have recently shown that postprandial sensations correlate with changes in
      circulating metabolites after a meal ingestion; however this phenomenon was demonstrated with
      a meal load up to the level of tolerance which involved an unpleasant fullness sensation. The
      aim of the present study is to determine changes in circulating metabolites of a satiating
      pleasurable meal. Healthy men (n = 32) will be evaluated after a 5 h fast. Perception
      measurements and blood samples will be taken before and 20 minutes after ingestion of a
      palatable probe meal (juice and warm ham and cheese sandwich, total 300 ml, 440 kcal). NMR
      spectroscopy will be performed to determine plasmatic Low Molecular Weight Metabolites (LMWM)
      and to characterize lipoprotein profiles (number of particles, lipid content and size of the
      main three lipoprotein classes (VLDL, LDL and HDL). Homeostatic (satiety, fullness) and
      hedonic sensations (digestive well-being, mood) will be measured by 10 cm analogical scales.
