  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is designed to assess the safety, dosing, and preliminary efficacy of a
      novel penile traction device on correcting deformities relating to Peyronie's disease, a
      condition which results in penile curvature and length loss. The trial is designed as a
      randomized, placebo-controlled study with men randomized to receiving no therapy or penile
      traction therapy 30 minutes once, twice, or three times daily. The study will occur over a 3
      month period, after which an open label phase for 3 months will be conducted. Final
      assessments for adverse effects will also be assessed at 9 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peyronie's disease (PD) is a fibrotic condition of the penis, affecting 1-13% of the US male
      population. The disease results in penile curvature and significant psychosocial bother.
      Current preferred therapies for PD include repeated penile injections with bacterial enzymes
      and surgery. However, these therapies are expensive and in some cases result in permanent
      reductions in penile length and sensation. Penile traction therapy (PTT) is a relatively
      newer treatment which has been proposed as a treatment for PD with preliminary data
      suggesting a potential role. However, currently available PTT devices are primarily designed
      for penile lengthening and have many significant limitations including a requirement of use
      for 9 hours daily and significant difficulties in personal application. Given these
      limitations, a new penile traction device (RestoreXÂ® ) was created and funded through Mayo
      Ventures and was specifically designed to treat men with PD. The primary objective of the
      current study is to evaluate safety of the device using various dosing schedules, with
      secondary endpoints designed to assess efficacy and subjective outcomes. To accomplish the
      study, a population of men from Mayo Clinic with PD will be enrolled and will be randomized
      to utilize the device for varying amounts of time. Outcomes will be assessed at 3, 6, and 9
      months, and results are to be used with the intent to publish in a scientific journal.

    <intervention_model_description>Men will be randomized into one of four groups: no traction therapy, penile traction 30 minutes once daily, penile traction 30 minutes twice daily, and penile traction 30 minutes three times daily. This treatment will continue for 3 months, after which men will enter an open label phase for 3 months. Primary and secondary outcomes will be evaluated at the completion of the 3 month and 6 month time points. Additional AEs will be assessed at 9 months after study initiation.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Double (Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Objective outcomes including penile length and curvature will be masked for the investigator and outcome assessor by obtaining photographs of the penis in the lateral and dorsal planes. Curvatures will also be assessed by a clinician in the case where photographs are not able to be obtained or if the participant refuses photographs. These will be assessed without any knowledge as to which grouping the patient is located by two independent reviewers. If there are differences &gt;5 degrees (curvature), or 0.5 cm (length), a 3rd individual will mediate the difference.</masking_description>
