  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is the most common reason for intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Sepsis flares up
      the systemic inflammatory response with its mediators. Sepsis treatment protocols have been
      established in many centres with immune nutrient as adjuvant treatment. Omega-3 fatty acid
      and other anti-oxidants formulae have been found to improve sepsis outcome. In most of the
      studies, immune nutrients were giving parenterally, however, nowadays the preferable route of
      feeding in critically ill patients is enterally. The present study was done to investigate
      the effect of enteral Omega-3 fatty acid in septic critically ill patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A hundred and ten critically ill septic patients were included in the study. Patients were
      divided into two groups fifty-five patients each. Group A received enteral nutrition
      supplemented with Omega-3 fatty acid and group B received enteral nutrition without Omega-3.
      Demographic data, sepsis characteristics, number of patients required invasive ventilation,
      ventilation days, ICU sequential organ failure assessment score (SOFA), organ failure
      free-days, haemodynamic failure free-days, ICU stay, ICU and hospital outcomes were recorded.
