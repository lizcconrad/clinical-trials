  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of a collaborative advance care planning intervention on the
      quality of life in palliative oncological patients. Research indicates, that talking about
      wishes for end of life care and death, may improve the quality of life, but can be difficult
      for involved parties.

      The intervention especially developed for this study trys to reduce psychosocial barriers
      that make conversations about these topics difficult. The study will measure the effect of
      the intervention on patients and caregivers quality of life.

      The study will give additional information about implementation of advance care planning
      interventions in different care settings in a complex health care systems.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A high quality of end of life care and a &quot;good death&quot; as part of an improved patient centered
      care at the end of life have become important goals of palliative care. To achieve these
      goals, patient's preferences for end of life (EOL) care need to be known.

      This study (randomized controlled trial) will evaluate effectiveness of a new type of advance
      care planning (ACP) intervention in different palliative care settings in Germany. The study
      addresses a new concept of ACP called collaborative advance care planning (cACP). This new
      concept is focusing on psychosocial barriers of patients and caregivers in addition to a
      standardized ACP process in order to reduce distress of patients and care-givers and enhance
      the chance of successful ACP-implementation. The main research questions are: a) Can cACP
      improve quality of life in palliative patients and caregivers?, b) Does cACP reduce distress
      in patients and caregivers and enhance consistency of end-of-life care? and c) Does cACP
      improve quality of end of life care and reduce utilization of health care resources? The
      investigators will try to answer theses research questions through a so called &quot;randomized
      controlled trial&quot; methodology. Admissible palliative cancer patients who are willing to
      participate in the trial will be randomly assigned to three groups. The first group will
      receive treatment as usual for palliative care patients. The second group will receive
      treatment as usual and an unspecific psychological intervention (sham-intervention). The
      third group will receive treatment as usual and the intervention designed for this trial.
      Both interventions will be equally long in duration and will be delivered by the same
      psychologists.

      The primary outcome is the quality of life at 16 weeks measured by the internationally
      recognized &quot;Functional Assessment of Cancer - General Version (FACT-G)&quot; questionnaire.
      Secondary endpoints include measurements of the development of QoL over time, distress,
      depression, and the quantity of advance directives in the different groups.

      Patients will be recruited in four different recruiting sites: a palliative care ward in an
      university hospital, an oncologists office, a rehabilitation clinic, and an outpatient
      palliative care network.

      The study will recruit 90 patients in every group, 270 patients in total.

    <description>The sham intervention does not target the specific topics of the study intervention group (i.e. no special focus an ACP or end of life communication). Supportive therapy uses common factors of psychotherapy such as elicitation of affect, reflective listening, and feeling understood, but provides no explicit theoretical formulation to the patient. The therapist tries to elicit and validate the patients' affect for instance on the realization that there is no curative treatment option. Supportive therapy has been used as an unspecific control condition in several studies (Cohen et al. 2011; Markowitz et al. 1998). Patients of the sham intervention will be informed about the benefits of advance directives in general.</description>

    <description>The design of the study-intervention was influenced by dignity therapy (Chochinov et al. 2005), the End-of-life-Review (Ando et al. 2010) and barriers concerning participation of ACP identified by research (Bollig et al. 2017; Gjerberg et al. 2015). It is the goal of the study-intervention to enhance communication about death related topics of patients and their relatives/caregivers.
Our study intervention extends over six therapeutic sessions. The length of each session will be adjusted to the patients physical condition, it should not exceed 45 minutes in total.
In the first four sessions, patients and relatives will be informed about the relevance of ACP. Potential barriers for an efficient patient-caregiver communication and ACP are discussed. The intervention focuses on encouraging end-of-life communication and on jointly modifying barriers to EOL communication.
The fifth and sixth session focus on ACP based on the standardised concept of &quot;beizeiten begleiten&quot;.</description>
