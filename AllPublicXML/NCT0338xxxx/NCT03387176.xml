  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elevated plasma zonulin levels, which are supportive of a diagnosis of CD (celiac disease) in
      children with gastrointestinal symptoms, may indicate patients with difficult-to-manage NS
      who will benefit from initiation of a GFD (gluten free diet). This pilot study will determine
      whether high plasma zonulin levels can be used as a screening tool to identify patients with
      NS (nephrotic syndrome) who are likely to demonstrate a beneficial response to a GFD. It will
      provide important information about the feasibility of testing the efficacy of a GFD for this
      condition and assist in the design and sample size calculation for a definitive trial to test
      the beneficial effect of this dietary intervention. Although NS is a rare condition in
      childhood, it is a chronic disease that can lead to short- and long-term disability
      especially in those with difficult-to-manage disease. There is an urgent need to develop safe
      and effective new therapies in this subgroup. This project may indicate the utility of a
      common dietary modification, a GFD, to treat these patients. The growing medical use of and
      greater access to gluten-free food items underscore the feasibility and timeliness of this
      approach.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Steroid sensitive NS: complete remission of proteinuria in response to administration
             of a standard course of corticosteroids

          -  Difficult-to-manage NS: disease that cannot be controlled without incurring
             intolerable side effects from currently available immunosuppressive agents, namely
             corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, mycophenolate mofetil, or rituximab. Patients
             with biopsy-proven MCD or FSGS will be eligible as long as they have steroid sensitive
             disease. However, a renal biopsy will not be required for enrollment into the trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any patient diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome that is not considered steroid sensitive
             or frequently relapsing

          -  Pre-existing celiac disease or gastro-intestinal disorder that precludes use of a GFD
