  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility of the ambulatory monitoring
      protocol, called Pain Buddy, in documenting children's pain, symptoms and quality of life
      while receiving outpatient chemotherapy. The long term goal of Pain Buddy is to help doctors,
      nurses, and parents get the information they need to give children treatments for pain and
      symptom management that work. Using Pain Buddy, we aim to quantify the prevalence and
      intensity of daily pain and symptom episodes in children at home, data that will be used to
      develop a psychosocial intervention to be delivered electronically to children at home with a
      goal of improving quality of life. Secondary aims also include examining children's quality
      of life pre- and post- Pain Buddy and satisfaction with the use of Pain Buddy. This project
      has the potential to improve the quality of life of tens of thousands of children suffering
      from cancer each year using transformative mobile health information technology based
      approach to pain assessment and management.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 12,000 children are diagnosed with cancer in the United States each year and
      the majority of these children will experience moderate to severe pain and disabling symptoms
      such as fatigue and nausea during the course of their illness. Survivors of childhood cancer
      are also at high-risk for long-term chronic pain. Unfortunately, the World Health
      Organization (WHO) indicates that current efforts to manage pain in pediatric oncology
      patients are seriously inadequate. Reasons for under treatment of pain and symptoms in
      children diagnosed with cancer are complex and are likely related to deficits in the process
      of assessment and management as well as lack of timely access to pharmacological and
      non-pharmacological interventions. Management of pain in this population is also compounded
      by the fact that increasing numbers of children currently receive chemotherapy on an
      outpatient basis due to advances in healthcare and changes in the medical-economical
      environment.

      To date, interventions targeting pain and symptom management in the home setting of children
      suffering from cancer are seriously lacking. To address this significant gap, the candidate
      is proposing significant training in pediatric cancer pain and symptom management and an
      innovative two-phase research strategy. The first phase of research will focus on the
      development and formative evaluation of an innovative handheld electronic program (Pain
      Buddy) that provides remote monitoring of pain and symptoms and delivery of cognitive and
      behavioral skills training to children undergoing treatment for cancer. The second phase of
      this application involves evaluation of the efficacy of the program using a randomized
      controlled trial design. Pain Buddy will allow for collection of &quot;real time&quot; pain and symptom
      data that will be transmitted immediately and monitored remotely by the oncology treatment
      team. Remote symptom monitoring in real time will provide an opportunity for timely
      implementation of appropriate interventions, thereby introducing the potential to decrease
      pain and symptoms and improve quality of life. Pain Buddy will also deliver psychosocial
      skills training, teaching cognitive and behavioral strategies to manage pain and
      symptom-related distress. The skills training will target coping and self-efficacy in
      children without the need for face-to-face intervention which is not feasible in the majority
      of settings. Symptom monitoring and skills training will further increase patient engagement
      in their own health care, which is a main goal of the Institute of Medicine and many other
      organizations. The objectives outlined above will be accomplished by the following specific
      aims:

      PHASE I: Development and Formative Evaluation Specific Aim 1: Through collaboration with the
      California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology (Calit2), develop and
      examine the usability of a cognitive and behavioral skills training intervention (Pain Buddy)
      delivered via electronic, handheld technology in conjunction with a validated pain and
      symptom assessment protocol (Jacob, E.) that will allow for monitoring of and response to
      pain and symptoms of pediatric oncology patients in real time.

      Hypothesis 1. Children and their parents will demonstrate the ability to use Pain Buddy on
      the electronic device and will rate high levels of acceptability, usability and satisfaction
      on beta testing.

      PHASE II: Randomized Controlled Trial of Pain Buddy Specific Aim 2: Using a randomized
      controlled trial design, we will examine the efficacy of Pain Buddy in managing pain and
      symptoms in children suffering from cancer.

      Hypothesis 2. Children enrolled in the Pain Buddy group will report lower symptom-related
      distress as measured by the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS), compared to children in
      the monitoring group (primary outcome).

      Hypothesis 3. Children in the Pain Buddy group will evidence lower pain severity and higher
      quality of life compared with children in the monitoring group (secondary outcomes).

      Hypothesis 4. Children and nurses will demonstrate high rates of compliance (85% or greater)
      with Pain Buddy (secondary outcome).

      The long-term goals of this research are to develop a usable, engaging electronic
      decision-support pain and symptom management intervention for children receiving outpatient
      chemotherapy using Smartphone technology and to examine the efficacy of the electronic
      decision-support intervention on children's pain and quality of life. These long-term goals
      will be accomplished through assessment of the data collected from patients, parents and
      physicians using the ambulatory monitoring protocol.

    <time_frame>Baseline and day 60</time_frame>
    <description>As part of the daily electronic Pain Buddy diary, children are administered the Memorial Symptoms Assessment Scale. Children 8-9 receive an 8-item instrument and are asked to report frequency (i.e. a very short time, a medium amount, almost all the time) severity (i.e. a little, a medium amount, very), and how distressful (i.e. not at all, a little, a medium amount, very) each symptom was. Children 10-18 receive a 30-item instrument and are asked to report how often (i.e. almost never, sometimes, a lot, almost always), how severe (i.e. slight, moderate, severe, very severe), and how distressful (i.e. not at all, a little bit, somewhat, quite a bit, very much) each symptom was.</description>

    <measure>Changes in pain severity, location, and affective dimensions</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and day 60</time_frame>
    <description>Child's pain is assessed using the 3 components of the Adolescent Pediatric Pain Tool. 1. Children use a body outline/map to identify areas they are experiencing pain. 2. Children report pain intensity from &quot;not in pain&quot; (score of 0) and &quot;worst pain&quot; (score of 100) using the 100-mm Visual Analog Scale for Pain. 3. Children are presented with a pain quality word descriptor list within 4 categories (Sensory, affective, evaluative, and temporal).</description>

    <measure>Changes in children's quality of life since using Pain Buddy is assessed using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (child self-report, ages 8-12, 13-18; parent report child ages 8-12, 13-18)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, day 30, and day 60</time_frame>
    <description>Children and parents are asked to report on the child's health related quality of life. The measure incorporates a generic, cancer, and fatigue module and asks question on a 5-point likert scale from 0 (&quot;Never&quot;) to 4 (&quot;Almost Always&quot;) For questions like &quot;I have trouble sleeping.&quot; Higher scores on the scale suggest a better health related quality of life. These responses are useful in understanding pain information collected in Pain Buddy.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) (parent self-report)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Only the Trait section of the questionnaire is administered to parents to assess their self reported anxiety. Items rated on a 4-point Likert Scale from 1 (&quot;Almost Never&quot;) to 4 (&quot;Almost Always&quot;). Higher scores suggest higher levels of anxiety.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Perceived Stress (parent self-report)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, day 30, and day 60</time_frame>
    <description>Parents are administered the 14-item Perceived Stress Scale and asked to rate statements such as &quot;In the past month, how often have you been upset because of something that happened unexpectedly?&quot; and &quot;In the past month how often have you felt that things were going your way?&quot; Subjects rate the items on a 5-point Likert-type scale with higher scores reflecting greater perceived stress.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Medication Attitude Questionnaire (MAQ) (parent self-report)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Parents were asked to report their attitudes regarding use of pain medication for treating children's pain. The factors assessed were Appropriate-Use (e.g., &quot;Giving children pain medication for pain teaches proper use of drugs&quot;), Side-Effects (e.g., &quot;Side effects are something to worry about when giving children pain medication&quot;), and Avoidance (e.g., &quot;Pain medication works best if saved for when the pain is quite bad&quot;).</description>

    <description>Pain Buddy is a user interface (application) which contains a personalized avatar (Pain Buddy) to guide children and parents through daily diary entries using mobile devices. The Pain Buddy application has been designed to be used with children age 8-18, receiving outpatient chemotherapy, as well as their parents. Pain Buddy will capture real time pain data from patients and that will ultimately allow for remote monitoring of patient symptoms. Remote symptom monitoring in real time will provide an opportunity for implementation of appropriate interventions, thereby introducing the potential to decrease pain and symptoms and improve quality of life in children with cancer. The use of symptom monitoring and skills training will further increase patient engagement in healthcare.</description>
