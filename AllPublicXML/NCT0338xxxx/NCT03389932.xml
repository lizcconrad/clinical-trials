  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Today, there are 25 million Americans with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and 660,000 patients
      in full kidney failure, the final CKD stage, known as end stage renal disease (ESRD). Over
      half of ESRD patients are Black, Hispanic, or Asian. ESRD patients must either receive
      regular dialysis treatments, by which waste is filtered from the blood by a machine, or a
      kidney transplant from a deceased or living donor. Five-year survival on dialysis is only
      40%, compared to 74% with a deceased donor kidney transplant (DDKT) and 87% with a living
      donor kidney transplant (LDKT). Despite the known health benefits of DDKT and LDKT, 70% of
      ESRD patients remain on dialysis, especially ethnic/racial minorities.

      An American Society of Transplantation (AST) Consensus Conference recently recommended that
      patients in all CKD stages should have the opportunity to learn about and decide which
      treatment option is right for them, particularly about LDKT. However, early education about
      LDKT and DDKT is inconsistent and often poor, with early stage CKD patients and ethnic/racial
      minorities even less likely to receive it.

      Through previous HRSA grants, Dr. Waterman designed the Explore Transplant@Home (ET@Home)
      video-guided education program, and found that it significantly increased LDKT knowledge and
      informed decision-making for Black and White dialysis patients in Missouri when delivered by
      mail and supported through bimonthly postcards and texting. Now based at the University of
      California, Los Angeles (UCLA), she has partnered with Kaiser Permanente Southern California
      (KPSC), an integrated learning healthcare system providing insurance coverage and
      comprehensive care to 65,000 patients in CKD Stages 3, 4 and 5 (ESRD) (24% Hispanic, 52%
      White, 15% Black, and 9% Asian; 10% Spanish-speaking).

      Today, there are 25 million Americans with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who are at risk for
      kidney failure and 660,000 patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). To sustain life,
      ESRD patients, among whom 31% are Black, 15% are Hispanic, and 5% are Asian, must either
      receive daily or weekly dialysis treatments, by which waste is filtered from the blood by a
      machine, or receive a kidney transplant from a deceased or living donor. Five-year survival
      for patients on dialysis is only 40%, compared to 74% for patients who receive a deceased
      donor kidney transplant (DDKT) and 87% for patients who receive a living donor kidney
      transplant (LDKT)1. Patients who receive kidney transplants live 5-15 years longer than if
      they remained on dialysis, and have a better health-related quality of life (HRQOL),
      including a greater likelihood of being in the workforce during their critical earning
      years2. While LDKT is the medically optimal and most cost effective renal replacement therapy
      (RRT) for patients with ESRD, LDKT rates have declined by 17% from 2004-2014. In 2014, in the
      U.S., 17,106 patients received a transplant (5,536 LDKTs) while 8,021 patients also died or
      became too ill to remain on the list, 70% of whom were racial/ethnic minorities. Of the 2,039
      transplants performed in California in 2014, only 595 were from living donors (OPTN data as
      of 12/11/2015).

      Since kidneys often fail slowly over months or years, a patient's level of kidney function is
      monitored over time as it decreases in nephrologists' offices nationwide. As recommended by a
      recent American Society of Transplantation (AST) Consensus Conference, all patients in Stage
      3 (Moderate CKD), Stage 4 (Severe CKD), or Stage 5 (End Stage CKD) should receive
      comprehensive education about DDKT and LDKT, especially racial/ethnic minorities. Once
      patients reach ESRD and begin dialysis, established CKD and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
      Services (CMS) guidelines recommend that dialysis patients be educated about their RRT
      options, the medical risks involved, and the advantages to transplant so that they can make
      informed RRT decisions4. Since transplants received within the first 6 months of beginning
      dialysis result in the best health outcomes,5 one Healthy People 2020 goal is to, &quot;Increase
      the proportion of dialysis patients wait-listed and/or receiving a deceased donor kidney
      transplant within one year of ESRD start (among patients under 70 years of age).&quot;
      Unfortunately, research has shown that many patients in CKD clinics are inconsistently
      educated about LDKT, particularly patients who are socioeconomically disadvantaged or members
      of racial/ethnic minority groups.

      Without a nationally-coordinated healthcare system, it is extremely difficult to ensure that
      kidney patients in Stages 3-5 who are served by different health practitioners and
      organizations all learn about DDKT and LDKT and make informed treatment decisions. Providers
      also report having limited time to educate about transplant outside of transplant centers and
      inadequate educational materials. Thus, disseminating transplant education within a large
      health care system, with its fully integrated care management program, diverse membership,
      and ability to track a large patient population across the entire course of their kidney
      disease, may be an opportune way to educate large numbers of diverse patients about the
      opportunities for and risks and benefits of living kidney donation.

      Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) is a large, integrated healthcare system
      providing coverage and care to over 4 million members throughout Los Angeles, San Diego,Kern,
      San Bernardino, Riverside, and Ventura Counties. KPSC provides coverage to nearly 65,000
      patients with CKD stages 3-5. About 24% of these patients are Hispanic, 52% White, 15% Black,
      and 9% Asian, similar to the broader CKD population in California.

      First, this team will conduct extensive qualitative and quantitative formative research to
      understand and compare the knowledge, informed decisionmaking and educational needs of these
      diverse patient groups prior to intervention. Second, they will design a Spanish-language
      version of ET@Home. Third, they will conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 1,200
      Black, Hispanic, Asian, and White patients in CKD Stages 3-5 where patients will be
      randomized to receive: (1) no additional education other than what is provided within KPSC
      (standard-of-care); or (2) a video-guided, four-part ET@Home program delivered by mail and
      supported through bimonthly postcards and texting over six months. The study aims and
      hypotheses are as follows: Aim 1: Using qualitative methodology, to assess the LDKT
      educational needs of CKD Stage 3-5 patients and their support networks by race/ethnicity and
      primary language spoken.

      Hypothesis 1: CKD Stage 3-5 patients and their support networks will have varying needs for
      educational content about LDKT based on their race/ethnicity and primary language spoken.

      Hypothesis 2: Providers will identify important patient needs for LDKT educational content
      and opportunities for improvement within the KPSC transplant educational system.

      Aim 2: Before intervention, to assess differences in knowledge and decision-making about the
      opportunities for and risks and benefits of living kidney donation for 1200 CKD Stage 3-5
      patients by race/ethnicity and primary language spoken.

      Hypothesis: Patients earlier in the CKD continuum, patients who speak Spanish, and non- White
      patients will have less knowledge about the opportunities for and risks and benefits of
      living kidney donation and will be making less informed LDKT decisions.

      Aim 3: Compared to KPSC education, to conduct a randomized controlled trial in English and
      Spanish of ET@Home for CKD Stage 3-5 patients to assess its effectiveness to increase LDKT
      knowledge and decision-making by race/ethnicity and primary language spoken.

      Hypothesis 1: At the conclusion of the trial, CKD patients who receive ET@Home will have
      greater transplant knowledge and be more likely to make an informed treatment decision than
      patients receiving KPSC education alone.

      Hypothesis 2: ET@Home will be more or equally effective for patients earlier in the CKD
      continuum, patients who speak Spanish, and non-White patients than patients in these
      subgroups receiving KPSC education alone.

    <measure>Deceased Donor Kidney Transplant (DDKT) and Living Donor Kidney Transplant (DDKT) Knowledge</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be asked true/false and multiple choice questions to determine their level of knowledge regarding basic facts, advantages, risks and outcomes of DDKT and LDKT (e.g., &quot;Patients older than 75 years can receive transplants&quot;; &quot;Compared to transplants from donors who have died, how long do transplants from living donors last?&quot;). Scores for this scale are created by summing the number of correct answers given by the patient, creating a theoretical range of 0-25 with higher scores indicating more knowledge.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Decisional Balance</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Decisional Balance will be measured for DDKT (DB-DDKT) and for LDKT (DB-LDKT). DB-DDKT, a measure of a patient's perception of the benefits and disadvantages of deceased donor kidney transplant. This measure has been validated in a sample of dialysis patients84. Both measures contain two subscales, Pros and Cons of 6 items, wherein patients rate the importance of a specific Pro or Con to their DDKT or LDKT decision-making (e.g., &quot;I would not have to be on dialysis&quot;) on a Likert-type scale from (1) &quot;Not important&quot; to (5) &quot;Extremely important&quot;. Scores for the subscales will be obtained by summing the patients' responses to the items, implying a theoretical range of 6-30, with higher scores indicating more Pros or Cons, depending on the subscale. The DB-LDKT was also recently validated in a sample of dialysis patients.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Informed Decision-Making</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Informed Decision-Making will be assessed in two ways. First, patients will be asked the following three questions: &quot;I have all the facts I need to make an informed decision about whether to pursue DDKT/LKDT/remain on dialysis&quot; (agree/disagree). Each of these questions will be treated as individual items and analyzed separately as outcomes.
We will also use a validated measure of decisional conflict, the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS). This scale assesses factors contributing to patients' uncertainty in making health-related decisions, and patients' assessment of their perceived effective decision-making. Each of these dimensions of decisional conflict will be considered as subscales, and together they will be considered as a total decisional conflict measure. The entire scale has 16 items (3 for decision uncertainty, 9 for factors contributing to uncertainty, and 4 for effective decision-making), each measured on a scale of (1) strongly agree to (5) strongly disagree.</description>
