  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a new counseling tool for patients deciding whether
      or not to undergo prostate cancer screening. This screening decision aid is a computer
      program that provides individual patients estimates of their risks of prostate cancer
      diagnosis, prostate cancer related death, or death from any cause. The researchers are
      evaluating whether or not patients find this screening decision aid helpful. As part of this
      study, participants will be asked for their response on questionnaires.

      If patients find the screening decision aid helpful, the researchers will make it available
      at other clinic locations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To conduct a feasibility study on implementing the computer-based screening decision aid for
      prostate cancer screening in a primary care setting during a 60-minute interview. To aid in
      informed decision making, the screening decision aid will include a graphical representation
      of predicted probabilities of prostate cancer diagnosis, prostate cancer-specific mortality,
      death from competing causes based on a man's unique demographic information. The study team
      will provide standardized counseling followed by individualized counseling with the screening
      decision aid. It will assess the quality of the decision making process (patient feels
      knowledgeable, informed of the risks/benefits, feels clear about their values, is involved in
      the decision), and quality of the decision.

    <description>The research intervention will be exposure to the screening decision aid. Patients will receive standardized counseling including population based risks and benefits of prostate cancer screening. Then, patients will be given opportunity to review the screening decision aid prior to offering a decision on whether or not to undergo prostate cancer screening. The patient decision aid will be a computer application that generates predicted risks associated with prostate cancer.</description>
