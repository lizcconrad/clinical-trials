  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to assess the long-term success rates of pulmonary vein isolation
      using first and second generation cryoballoons in patients with paroxysmal and persistent
      atrial fibrillation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The success of ablation is determined by the absence of recurrence of atrial fibrillation in
      the short term beyond 3 months, medium and long term on regular clinical follow-up and ECG
      holters. The patient cohort followed since 2007 allows a very long-term follow-up of patients
      who have benefited from atrial fibrillation cryoablation.

      Isolation of the pulmonary veins by cryoballoon (IVP) has emerged as an alternative to
      radiofrequency in the treatment of drug resistant atrial fibrillation (AF). (1) The potential
      benefits of cryoablation include shorter procedure times, decreased fluoroscopy time, shorter
      hospital duration, a different rate and type of complications compared to radio frequency
      offers potential benefits, including Including shorter procedure times, a decrease in the
      length of hospital stay 1 and a reduction in fluoroscopic time. (2) Effectiveness on a one
      year follow-up in cryoablation for AF is comparable to that of radiofrequency ablation in a
      prospective, randomized study with a lower major complication rate (3,4). The number of
      subjects is limited and most retrospective studies on cryoablation have a limited number of
      patients or an average follow-up not exceeding one year.

      Study of the data and results of the procedures of ablation of AF by cryoablation and
      long-term follow-up of the patients of the CHU of Grenoble.

      Regular monocentric cohort study based on collected data To identify the success rate of
      cryoablation ablation in paroxysmal and persistent AF

-The success rate is evaluated at clinical follow-up and Holter, the efficacy of treatment is evaluated by per-ablation data. Total procedure times, catheter time in the left atrium, fluoroscopy time, cryoablation time are collected during the procedure and will be retrospectively analyzed with patient records and ablation records. The comparison will be made on the patient group having been treated with the new techniques and in particular the second generation balloon and those having been treated with the first generation balloon.</description>
