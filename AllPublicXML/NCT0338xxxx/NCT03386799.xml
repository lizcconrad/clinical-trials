  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Power assisted wheelchairs have specific advantages compared to manual propelled or powered
      Wheelchair. Autonomad Mobility has developed a new device (DUO), the assistance being
      triggered by the motion of the wheelchair and not an push on the hand rim, people who use
      their foot to move or people pushing the wheelchair can be helped by the device as people
      propelling the wheelchair with their arms.

      Furthermore DUO has an option with a longer assistance (AEP+) which can be preferred by some
      people.

      To be referenced and reimbursed by the French health insurance, DUO has to be compared with
      an other power assistance device for wheelchairs, already referenced.

      The study is a comparative study between DUO and the ALBER E Motion. Each patient is his own
      control and is assessed in 4 experimental conditions, with intervals of 3 or 4 days, manually
      propelled, with the E mtion device, with the DUO device and the single push configuration,
      with the DUO device and the AEP+ configuration.

      The main outcome measure will be the user's satisfaction (using 8 items of the ESAT
      questionnaire)
