    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter individual patient-based meta-analysis that will assess the
      performances of liver stiffness measurements performed with supersonic shear imaging
      shearwave elastography (SSI-SWE) in patients with liver fibrosis to predict progression of
      chronic liver disease.
