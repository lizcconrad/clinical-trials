  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory distress after extubation is associated with increased morbidity and mortality.
      Its multifactorial pathophysiology causes a loss of pulmonary aeration during the weaning
      process, the clinical translation being impaired gas exchange and the occurrence of
      respiratory distress. Lung ultrasound can accurately quantify the loss of pulmonary aeration
      before, after end during the weaning trial by calculating the Lung Ultrasound Score (LUS).
      Investigators have recently demonstrated in a prospective two-center study of 100 patients
      that the intensity of the lung aeration loss occurring during the weaning trial, was
      predictive of the development of postextubation respiratory distress within 48 hours
      following extubation. A LUS ≥ 14 could identify patients at high risk of developing
      postextubation respiratory distress. A second study that investigators have just completed in
      80 patients weaned from mechanical ventilation shows a 30% reduction of respiratory distress
      in post-extubation High Flow Nasal Cannula oxygen group compared to a standard O2 group.

      The establishment of a targeted therapeutic strategy proposed in a group of high-risk
      patients, defined as having a ≥ 14 LUS at the end of the weaning trial could reduce the
      incidence of extubation failure and associated morbidity and mortality.
