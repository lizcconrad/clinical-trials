  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes control is often assessed by tests of glucose levels over time, such as the
      glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and fructosamine. In the later stages of chronic kidney
      disease (CKD) there is limited data available on the utility of these tests. There are
      reasons to believe that the tests may be less accurate in this population. Continuous glucose
      monitoring (CGM) offers an effective method for understanding the totality of glucose
      exposure and incidence of both hyperglycemic and hypoglycemic excursions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the proposed study Investigator plan to utilize CGM in patients with late stage CKD stages
      3b-5 to 1) determine accuracy of HbA1c and serum fructosamine testing as measures of glucose
      control in patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), 2) Better understand test
      characteristics in the late stage CKD population (correlation, linear equation, slope, Y
      intercept, average glucose at different HbA1c levels), 3) Develop a preliminary understanding
      of how test characteristics differ in late stage CKD compared to other patients with
      diabetes, 4) quantify time burden and number of episodes of hypoglycemia, 4) study
      hyperglycemic burden and 5) analyze glucose variability. The research staff will explain the
      study to patients that meet all inclusion criteria. Patients will get time to understand the
      study, review the consent document, ask questions to the PI, and then provide their consent
      to participate in the study. On Day 1 of the study, a CGM (Freestyle Libre) device will be
      placed on patients with CKD 3b-5 which will be worn for 14 consecutive days. Patients will
      return on Day 14 to remove the CGM device. HbA1c and fructosamine values will be drawn on Day
      14 and these results will be compared with average glucose monitoring values as recorded on
      the CGM device. Incidence, duration, and severity of both hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic
      events will be analyzed. Investigators hypothesis that there will be significant variability
      in the serum HbA1c values when compared with calculated HbA1c from CGM readings.
      Investigators also hypothesize that the results will reflect a greater incidence of
      hypoglycemia in this population by CGM analysis.
