  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a multi-center, prospective, non-controlled, consecutive cohort post market
      surveillance study. The objective of this study is to obtain survival and outcome data on the
      Continuum Metal Bearing System in primary total hip arthroplasty.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The subject of this clinical investigation is the Continuum Metal Bearing THA System in
      primary total hip arthroplasty. This system consists of a cementless modular Trabecular
      Metal™ (TM) Continuum Acetabular Shell, a modular Metasul Taper liner, and a modular Metasul
      femoral head. The characteristics of this THA system may allow for reduction in wear and
      osteolysis as compared to other approved and marketed THA systems and thus increase the
      expected implant life.

      In total, 3 centers will be involved. This number of clinical sites will permit assessment of
      the consistency among a multitude of investigators. A total number of 100 subjects will be
      included in the study. It is anticipated that each clinical site will enroll 10 to 45
      eligible study subjects, who have provided written informed consent.

        The study population will be comprised of max. 100 males and females who require primary
        total hip arthroplasty. Subjects will be enrolled at 3 investigative centers. Subjects must
        be geographically accessible throughout the study and be willing and able to attend
        required follow-up appointments. Candidates who express interest in study participation
        will be offered informed consent, and eligibility will be determined based upon the
        inclusion/exclusion criteria.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is 18 to 75 years of age, inclusive.

          -  Patient is skeletally mature.

          -  Patient qualifies for primary unilateral or bilateral total hip arthroplasty (THA)
             based on physical exam and medical history including the following:

               -  Avascular necrosis (AVN) Osteoarthritis (OA)

               -  Inflammatory arthritis (i.e. Rheumatoid arthritis)

               -  Post-traumatic arthritis

          -  Patient has no history of previous prosthetic replacement device (any type, including
             surface replacement arthroplasty, endoprosthesis, etc.) of the affected hip joint(s).

          -  Patient has a Harris Hip Score &lt;70 in the affected hip

          -  Patient is willing and able to provide written informed consent.

          -  Patient is willing and able to cooperate in the required post-operative therapy.

          -  Patient is willing and able to complete scheduled follow-up evaluations as described
             in the Informed Consent.

          -  Patient has participated in the Informed Consent process and has signed the Ethics
             Committee approved informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient is:

               -  A prisoner

               -  Mentally incompetent or unable to understand what participation in the study
                  entails

               -  A known alcohol or drug abuser

               -  Anticipated to be non-compliant.

          -  The patient has a neuromuscular disorder, vascular disorder or other conditions that
             could contribute to prosthesis instability, prosthesis fixation failure, or
             complications in postoperative care.

          -  The patient has a neurologic condition in the ipsalateral or contralateral limb which
             affects lower limb function.

          -  The patient has a diagnosed systemic disease that could affect his/her safety or the
             study outcome.

          -  The patient is known to be pregnant.

          -  The patient is unwilling or unable to give consent, or to comply with the follow-up
             program.

             months.

          -  The patient has an active or latent infection in or about the affected hip joint or an
             infection distant from the hip joint that may spread to the hip hematogenously. The
             patient has insufficient bone stock to fix the component. Insufficient bone stock
             exists in the presence of metabolic bone disease (i.e. osteoporosis), cancer, and
             radiation. Note: Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) may be used to assess the
             presence of adequate bone stock.

          -  The patient has known local bone tumors and/or cysts in the operative hip.

          -  The patient has a known allergic reaction to one or more of the implanted material.

          -  The patient is Grade III obese with a Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥ 40.

          -  The patient has osteoradionecrosis in the affected hip joint

          -  Kidney insufficiency (Kidney insufficiency will be determined based on eGFR value.
