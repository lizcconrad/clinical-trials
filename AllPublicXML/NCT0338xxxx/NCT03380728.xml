  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 5% of the world's adult population has some alcohol-related disorder, which in
      addition is associated with 3% of all deaths in the world. In Brazil, harmful use and
      dependence on alcohol reach about 10% of the population, with alcohol being one of the main
      factors of disease and mortality. Although the medications currently used have some efficacy,
      the adverse effects and relatively long time of treatment are factors that may reduce
      patients' motivation to continue taking the medication correctly. Therefore, it is necessary
      to conduct research with new drugs for the treatment of alcoholism. Ibogaine is an alkaloid
      present in the bush Tabernanthe iboga (iboga), a plant from Central Africa traditionally used
      in countries such as Gabon and Cameroon. Animal studies and case series suggest that one or a
      few doses of ibogaine significantly reduce withdrawal symptoms and the intensity of use of
      various drugs, including opioids, psychostimulants, and alcohol. However, there are no
      controlled clinical studies that have explored these effects. The aim of the present study is
      to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of increasing doses of ibogaine in 12
      alcoholic patients. Each patient will be hospitalized for 20 days and receive 3 increasing
      doses of ibogaine. The first 3 patients will receive oral doses of 20 to 400 mg of ibogaine
      in an open-label design. If the 3 higher doses (240, 320 and 400 mg) are well tolerated, the
      next 9 volunteers will receive these doses or placebo randomly. The volunteers will also be
      evaluated 7, 14 and 21 days and 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after leaving the hospital to monitor
      the consumption of alcohol and other drugs.
