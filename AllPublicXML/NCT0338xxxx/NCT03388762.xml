  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of a polyherbal dietary
      supplement (Designs for Health - GlucoSupreme™ Herbal) on markers of glycemic control and
      other structure/function outcomes among a sample of prediabetic adults.

      A 12-week randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial will be conducted to
      achieve the purpose of this study. The research team hypothesizes that GlucoSupreme™ Herbal
      will improve a variety of validated markers of glycemic control that are commonly used in
      clinical practice more effectively than placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prediabetes is a common state in which blood glucose levels are elevated, but are not
      elevated high enough to be considered Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). The worldwide prevalence of
      prediabetes is high and rapidly increasing. People with prediabetes are at increased risk for
      developing a variety of chronic diseases. Most notably, prediabetes nearly always precedes
      diagnosis of T2D, a poorly-controlled disease adversely affecting 14% of adults in the United
      States. T2D is responsible for increased risk of heart disease, stroke, blindness and other
      vision problems, kidney disease, amputations and death. Prediabetes often progresses to T2D
      relatively quickly, as pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction perpetuates. There are currently
      limited pharmacological options available for safely reducing the burden of prediabetes.
      Furthermore, these pharmacological options often carry potentially deleterious side effects.
      Low-risk alternatives are needed where lifestyle modifications, such as increased physical
      activity and weight loss, have failed.

      Herbal dietary supplements have shown promise in safely managing impaired glycemic control in
      prediabetic adults in many clinical studies. A wide variety of herbs have been previously
      studied for these purposes, including cinnamon, fenugreek, banaba, curcumin, and a variety of
      combination products. Of these, most have demonstrated improved management of glycemic
      control, particularly with regard to reducing fasting blood glucose and postprandial glucose,
      HbA1c, fasting insulin levels, HOMA-Insulin Resistance, and increasing HOMA-β cell function
      among prediabetic adult populations. Many herbs have also demonstrated benefit in the
      management of glycemic control in clinical trials among T2D populations. These herbs include
      berberine, ginseng, gymnema, banaba, cinnamon, fenugreek, and kudzu, all of which are present
      in GlucoSupreme™ Herbal.

      The research team hypothesizes that GlucoSupreme™ Herbal will demonstrate superior
      improvements in markers of glycemic control than placebo over twelve weeks of daily
      supplementation among a sample of healthy adults. The research team aims to conduct a
      randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded clinical trial to evaluate this hypothesis
      among a diverse sample of 40 prediabetic adults, and will implement a 1:1 study allocation
      ratio. This study will utilize an adaptive sample size re-estimation (SSR) approach where
      participant enrollment may be extended beyond the originally planned sample size if interim
      effect size is smaller than anticipated, but still promising, thereby preserving study power;
      this will be determined by examination of available unblinded endpoint data by an independent
      statistician after 30 subjects are enrolled.

    <intervention_model_description>This study is a 12-week, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial of GlucoSupreme™ Herbal. Eligible participants will be recruited from within participating clinical practices. All study outcomes will be biomarkers, capturing normal structure and function of the human body, derived from blood draws ordered during two physician visits spaced 12 weeks apart. This is a typical interval between blood assessments of glycemic control in routine clinical practice. An IRB-approved research associate will call each study participant at the 6-week mid-point of the study to assess compliance and collect data on any adverse events. Serious adverse events, while not anticipated, will be reported by the participant to a study physician as soon as possible.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fasting Blood Glucose</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and study end (12 weeks from baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>Elevated fasting blood glucose is one of the markers of the prediabetic state. According to American Diabetes Association criteria, the prediabetic fasting blood glucose range is 100 to 125 mg/dL (5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L). After fasting for 8-12 hours, &gt; 0.5mL of blood will be collected from each participant, followed by centrifuge separation of plasma from cells within 45 minutes of collection. After maintaining the plasma fasting blood glucose at room temperature, it will be analyzed using standard enzymatic methodology.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Glycated hemoglobin/A1C (HbA1c)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and study end (12 weeks from baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>Elevated HbA1c is another one of the markers of the prediabetic state and is defined as being within the range of 5.7-6.4%. A four mL sample of whole blood will be obtained from participants using techniques described above, and placed in an EDTA, lithium heparin, or sodium fluoride tube, followed by analysis using the Roche Tina Quant (Roche, Germany).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fasting insulin</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and study end (12 weeks from baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>In prediabetes, pancreatic beta cells can no longer produce enough insulin to overcome insulin resistance, which can cause blood glucose levels to rise above the normal range. Thus, fasting insulin is a glycemic parameter of interest and is also used to determine insulin resistance. While normal values for fasting insulin are &lt;25 microU/L, fasting insulin can vary widely among prediabetic individuals. After fasting for 8-12 hours, 0.8mL blood serum will be obtained from each participant. This fasting insulin assay will be performed using a 2-site electrochemiluminescent immunoassay on the Roche automated platform (Roche, Germany.).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and study end (12 weeks from baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>Insulin resistance often sets the stage for progression to T2D by placing a high demand on insulin-producing beta cells during a prediabetic state. The advantage of using the validated HOMA-IR calculation is its relative simplicity and low-cost since it is derived from other primary outcomes of interest in this study. HOMA-IR is calculated as: [Fasting insulin (microU/L) x Fasting Blood Glucose (nmol/L)]/22.5.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>β-cell function (HOMA-β)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and study end (12 weeks from baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>Pancreatic beta cells (β-cells) produce insulin. Thus, their function is of interest in this prediabetic study population. As is the case with HOMA-IR, this formula utilizes values from our other study outcomes. HOMA- β is calculated as: (20 x Fasting insulin [microU/L])/(Fasting blood glucose [mmol/l] - 3.5).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index (QUICKI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and study end (12 weeks from baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>The validated QUICKI measurement to assess insulin sensitivity has also been studied in herbal dietary supplement clinical trials. QUICKI is calculated as: 1/(log-fasting blood glucose [mg/dL] + log-fasting insulin [uU/mL]).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fructosamine</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and study end (12 weeks from baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>Many serum proteins are involved in glucose synthesis. Fructosamine represents the degree of glycation in these proteins, and is the concentration of plasma glucose over the lifetime of the protein. This useful test has been utilized in previous clinical studies of natural products3 4 and is an adjunct to the A1C and other fasting glycemic measurements, and reflects intermediate-term (previous 2-3 weeks) glycemic change. One mL of serum or plasma will be collected, followed by centrifuge separation within 45 minutes of collection, and analyzed using standard colorimetric assay methodology (LabCorp, Inc.).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>GlycoMark</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and study end (12 weeks from baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>A blood test commonly used in clinical practice to determine peak hyperglycemia. The GlycoMark test provides accurate recognition of recent glycemic deterioration or improvement (within the previous 2-4 weeks)5 6 and is commonly given adjacently to A1C (a longer-term indicator of glycemic change) in clinical practice. One mL of serum or plasma will be collected, followed by centrifuge separation within 60 minutes of collection, and analyzed using standard enzymatic colorimetric assay methodology (LabCorp, Inc.).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lipid profile</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and study end (12 weeks from baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>A standard lipid panel consisting of total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and triglycerides will be compared at baseline and the 12-week follow up visit. One mL of serum or plasma will be collected for all lipid parameters after 8 -12 hours of fasting and in the manner as described above, followed by centrifuge separation within 45 minutes of collection, and analyzed using standard enzymatic methodology (LabCorp, Inc.).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Inflammation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and study end (12 weeks from baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (Hs-CRP) is a common measure of inflammation that is commonly collected in clinical practice. Samples will undergo analysis by latex immunoturbidimetry on a COBAS Integra 800 (Roche, Germany).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
