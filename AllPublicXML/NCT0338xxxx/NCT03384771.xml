      Objectives. The primary objective of the current proposal is to identify teacher-related
      factors that can be feasibly measured and shown to predict mindfulness-based intervention
      (MBI) participant outcomes. The secondary objective of this R34 proposal is to lay the
      groundwork for a large-scale R01-funded study in which the investigators anticipate studying
      participants in Mindfulness-Based Stress reduction (MBSR) courses provided by 50 or more
      teachers in a range of university- and community-based settings.

      Objectives. The primary objective of the current proposal is to identify teacher-related
      factors that can be feasibly measured and shown to predict mindfulness-based intervention
      (MBI) participant outcomes. The secondary objective of this R34 proposal is to lay the
      groundwork for a large-scale R01-funded study in which the investigators anticipate studying
      participants in Mindfulness-Based Stress reduction (MBSR) courses provided by 50 or more
      teachers in a range of university- and community-based settings. Design and Outcomes. This is
      an observational study of MBSR participants, teachers, and raters. Student participants will
      receive recruitment videos of different lengths and varying compensation schedules; The study
      will examine these to optimize participation and retention in the future R01 study.

      Interventions and Duration. There is no study intervention per se, but participants will be
      teaching or enrolled in public 8-week MBSR classes. Outcome data will be collected from
      participants using internet-administered questionnaires at baseline, 2 months (immediate
      post-MBSR) and 4 months (post-MBSR follow-up). Rater study: The investigators will invite
      experience meditation teachers to be trained to use a the Mindfulness-Based Interventions
      Teaching Assessment Criteria (MBI-TAC) tool as a standardized approach to rating MBSR teacher
      competency. As part of the training, the study will be collecting data on how the training
      works. Thus, those who join the training will be asked to sign a consent form and complete a
      brief questionnaire about their teaching and meditation experience, as well as demographics;
      the study will also collect data on the ratings they do as part of the training. The goal of
      this part of the study is to assess the rater-training process.

      Sample Size and Population. The study aims to enroll about 19 MBSR teachers and 200 MBSR
      participants, along with about 30 raters to be trained in the MBI-TAC system.

    <measure>MBI-TAC inter-observer variability</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The key metric to be used to evaluate inter-observer variability is intraclass-correlation (ICC). 1 ICC provides a measure of how strongly ratings of the same item by different raters resemble each other, with values ranging from 0 (only random agreement) to 1 (perfect agreement). ICC will be calculated for each of the six domains in MBI:TAC, as well as the summary score.</description>

    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The difference in ratings of novice and experienced teachers with raters blinded to teacher experience will be examined. Comparison of mean scores will be performed using t-tests to compare mean scores between dichotomously grouped teachers (novice vs. experienced), and regression to test associations with ratings using experience as an ordinal variable (by grouped years of experience).</description>

    <description>Iinternal consistency of the multiple items meant to measure each domain of teacher quality (e.g. coverage and pacing) using Cronbach's alpha. Scores on questions for each domain will be averaged to provide an overall score for the domain. ICC will be tested for each domain in a similar fashion to that described for the MBI:TAC; note that lower ICC values are anticipated on this instrument than the MBI:TAC, given the varied perspectives of different participants. Finally, the correlation of participant ratings of each domain (averaging ratings across participants) to ratings from the MBI:TAC.blinded to teacher experience will be tested. Comparison of mean scores will be performed using t-tests to compare mean scores between dichotomously grouped teachers (novice vs. experienced), and regression to test associations with ratings using experience as an ordinal variable (by grouped years of experience).</description>

    <measure>Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS-29) Fatigue scale</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Higher scores indicate more fatigue (worse outcome). PROMIS-29 scales use a T-score metric in which 50 is the mean of a relevant reference population and 10 is the standard deviation (SD) of that population. On the T-score metric, a score of 40 is one SD lower than the mean of the reference population, while score of 60 is one SD higher than the mean of the reference population. Scores 0.5 - 1.0 SD worse than the mean = mild symptoms/impairment. Scores 1.0 - 2.0 SD worse than the mean = moderate symptoms/impairment. Scores 2.0 SD or more worse than the mean = severe symptoms/impairment</description>
