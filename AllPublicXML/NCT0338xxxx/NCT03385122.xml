      Environmental factors constitute an important but underappreciated risk factor towards the
      development and progression of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Environmental exposure in
      variable pollutants is implicated in the derangement or propagation of adverse
      pathophysiological processes linked with atherosclerosis, including genetic, hemodynamic,
      metabolic, oxidative and inflammation parameters. However no data exists concerning
      environmental pollution in rural or semi-rural areas. Therefore the purpose of the
      &quot;Corinthia&quot; study is to examine the impact of environmental pollution in indices of
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in a cross-sectional and longitudinal design.
      Corinthia study began in October 2015 and is planned to recruit 2400 individuals from
      different regions of Corinthia country with different environmental exposure to pollutants
      and different patterns of soil-ground and/or air pollution until September 2018. Baseline
      measurements will include lifestyle measurements, anthropometric characteristics and a
      comprehensive cardiovascular examination. The follow-up is planned to extent, prospectively,
      up to 10 years and this study is anticipated to provide valuable data on the distinct impact
      of soil and air pollution in early markers of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease and
      in the overall impact of environment pollution to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

      Introduction

      Despite major advances in cardiovascular (CV) medicine during the last decades, deaths and
      morbidity from cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are increasing globally [1, 2]. It seems that
      population aging and population growth balances out the decline in age-specific death rates
      from CVD that could be attributed to more effective prevention and treatment strategies [2].

      Interestingly, the progress in confronting CVD is evident around the world but notably
      heterogeneous. Regions with the fastest growing population dynamics experienced relative
      increase in CV deaths in line with global trends. In contrast, developed regions reported no
      detectable change or little decrease in CV mortality as rapid aging of the population offsets
      the declines in age-specific death rates [3]. Residual CV risk beyond traditional risk
      factors should be reassessed and further explored in the quest of new underlying mechanisms
      that could provide the substrate for innovative preventive interventions and therapeutic
      goals.

      Under this prism, environmental factors constitute an important but underappreciated risk
      factor towards the development and progression of CVD [4]. Environmental exposure in variable
      pollutants is implicated in the derangement or propagation of adverse pathophysiological
      processes linked with atherosclerosis, including genetic, hemodynamic, metabolic, oxidative
      and inflammation parameters [4]. Recent studies suggest that chronic environmental stress is
      an important determinant of CVD risk, even below current regulatory standards for exposure
      levels [4, 5].

      One of the most important studies in the field of environmental cardiology, the Multi-Ethnic
      Study of Atherosclerosis and Air Pollution (MESA Air) investigated the association between
      long-term air pollution exposure and the progression of subclinical atherosclerosis and the
      incidence of CVD at an urban dwelling population [6]. However no data exists concerning
      environmental pollution in rural or semi-rural areas. Therefore the purpose of the
      &quot;Corinthia&quot; study is to examine the impact of environmental pollution in indices of CV
      morbidity and mortality in a cross-sectional and longitudinal design.

      Rational of the study National-based data for Greece concerning environment pollution and CVD
      morbidity and mortality are markedly scarce. Research activity has focused on soil and
      groundwater anthropogenic contamination in river basin of heavy polluted industrialized areas
      but without reporting associations with CVD [7]. Moreover, certain prospective or
      retrospective studies have examined the association of long-term exposure to air pollution
      with CVD morbidity in urban population [8, 9]. The region of Corinth has rural or semi-rural
      areas with high exposure to soil and air contamination in distinct territories-patterns. The
      investigators hypothesized that long term exposure to environmental pollutants mediates
      detrimental epigenetic, oxidative, inflammatory and pro-atherogenic effects that could
      accelerate the progress and the severity of CVD as well as the quality of life and the
      overall morbidity and mortality. Therefore, the investigators sought to investigate in a
      cross sectional and longitudinal design the impact of different type of environmental
      pollution in indices of subclinical atherosclerosis, on rates of CV morbidity and mortality
      and on CVD risk.

      Hypothesis of the study I. The primary hypothesis of the study is that individual exposed to
      different environmental pollutants have increased rate of all-cause mortality.

      II. The secondary hypothesis of the study is that individuals exposed to different
      environmental pollutants have increased rate of CV mortality and increased incidence of
      non-fatal CVD (i.e. acute coronary syndromes, peripheral aortic disease, cerebrovascular
      disease).

      III. Additional hypothesis of the study is that:

        1. Individuals exposed to different environmental pollutants present an adverse
           cardiometabolic profile in terms of surrogate markers of early atherosclerosis and
           oxidative stress

        2. Environmental pollution affects adversely the quality of life in exposed subjects

        3. Environmental pollution confers epigenetic alterations (telomere shortening, microRNAs
           mobilization and circulation) in subjects exposed to different pollutants

      Experimental details and design of the Corinthia study The present study began at October
      2015 and is planned to recruit 1500 individuals from different regions of Corinth with
      different environmental exposure to pollutants and different patterns of soil-ground and/or
      air pollution until December 2016.

      The investigators plan to recruit individuals living in three different areas according to
      environmental pollution (Figure 1):

      i. Subjects living in areas with no evidence of soil/ground or air pollution ii. Subjects
      living in areas with air pollution iii. Subjects living in areas with soil/ground pollution
      Residents of the selected regions who are not planning to move within the next 10 years will
      be approached. An acceptance rate of participation of approximately 80% of those eligible
      subjects is anticipated. Exclusion criteria for the study would be

        1. Inability and unwillingness to obtain informed consent

        2. Individuals less than 40 years of age The recruitment into Corinthia study will be
           community-based, with an emphasis on balancing recruitment across the three areas,
           census blocks, age categories (per decades) and gender. The sampling frame will
           implement information from the latest national Census and will proceed along geographic
           boundaries. As sampling unit we will use each household, with a goal of including no
           more than 2 eligible participants from different households per census block. Initial
           contact will be performed by telephone or door-to-door. Telephone recruitment will be
           based on a list built from the specified geographic boundaries. Initial contact included
           a screening questionnaire and household enumeration of all eligible persons. The
           recruitment goal is 500 participants from each of the three areas of interest. During
           this period the research team will communicate with the local authorities and with
           health services in the areas of research in order to organize the volunteering selection
           of the participants in each area. Responsibility of the research team is also the
           organization of the places where field research will take place. Pilot measurements will
           take place and accordingly the research team will estimate the validity of the tests,
           and will calculate variability coefficients of the tests.

      The first 24 months will be devoted to recruitment (October 2015- September 2018).

      Quality Control and repeatability of measures The research fellow recruited for the study
      will perform all vascular and anthropometric measurements. The research fellow will undergo a
      2 month training and accreditation for these measurements. Echocardiographic measurements
      will be performed by the same trained cardiac physiologist.

      Study Measurements Baseline measurements for participants in the &quot;Corinthia&quot; Study will
      include parameters affecting the everyday lifestyle such as smoking habits, physical activity
      and diet. Anthropometric (height, weight, waist circumference) socio-economic and lifestyle
      characteristics (marital status, educational level, economic and professional status), as
      well as, family history and history of cardiovascular risk factors and diseases will be
      recorded. The investigators also planning to identify the psychological state of individuals
      (using a valid Depression Scale ZUNG) and participants mental status (MMSE-Mini Mental State
      Examination). We will record the presence and the treatment in use, if any, of hypertension,
      diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolemia. Subjects will be submitted to a full cardiac
      examination, including physical examination, electrocardiography, echocardiography
      (Evaluation of left ventricle ejection fraction, of left ventricle dimensions, evaluation of
      valvular function, of transmittal flow pattern, of right ventricle systolic pressure, of
      aortic distensibility etc.), blood pressure measurements, arterial wall properties
      measurement with non-invasive estimation of pulse wave velocity and estimation of
      atherosclerotic burden with evaluation of carotid intima media thickens and of
      atherosclerotic plaques in carotid arteries. Peripheral blood samples will be gathered for
      DNA analysis, routine biochemical tests and measurement of inflammatory markers and markers
      of oxidative stress. Subsequent examinations, which will include repetitions of certain
      baseline measurements as well as new measures, will be scheduled at approximately adjacent
      2-year intervals.

      Selection of regions-Environmental measurements Data on soil/ground contamination with
      pollutants (pesticides, fertilizers etc) and of air pollution from industrial gasses and
      exposures will be provided from records and measurements of the Faculty of Geology and
      Geoenvironment and the faculty of Environmental Physics of the National and Kapodistrian
      University of Athens.

      Follow-up The study investigators will prospectively perform the 5 and 10-year follow-up
      about participants': (a) Vital status (death from any cause or due to CVD), (b) development
      of coronary heart disease (CHD) (i.e., myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, other
      identified forms of ischemia, heart failure of different types, and chronic arrhythmias) and
      (c) development of cerebrovascular disease.

      With an anticipated loss to follow-up of approximately~15% [10] the ten year follow up data
      are expected to decipher the effect of long term exposure to pollution on overall and
      cardiovascular mortality and morbidity as well as on interim endpoints of surrogate markers
      of subclinical atherosclerosis. Respectively, with a type I error predefined to 0.05 and all
      considered to be 2-tailed, a sample size of 1500 subjects would yield adequate power (&gt;80%)
      to detect a 1.5- fold change in Hazzard ratio per area-group change in the aforementioned
      index variable towards the secondary endpoint (all-cause mortality) taking into account an
      event rate of 6%, a follow up period of minimum 60 months and an anticipated loss to follow
      up of less than 15%. Type I error was predefined at 0.05 and all tests were considered to be
      2-tailed.

      Conclusion The Corinthia study is an epidemiological study of Environmental importance with a
      cross-sectional and prospective longitudinal design planning to provide data on the distinct
      impact of soil and air pollution in indices of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and in
      the overall health status of a rural or semi-rural population of the Greek country.
