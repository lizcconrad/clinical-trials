  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of the study is to investigate the possible long-term therapeutic effects of
      psilocybin on the symptoms of severe depression, as well as the brain mechanisms underlying
      these changes. Depression severity is assessed before and after (i.e., 1 week, 3 months and 6
      months after) a single dose of psilocybin and compared to respective scores of a group
      receiving an active placebo, ketamine. Brain activity (using functional magnetic resonance
      imaging) is measured before and one week after drug administration in order to determine
      whether changes in brain networks related to emotional and self-referential processing
      correlate with any observed changes in depression scores. Further, blood samples will be
      obtained from the participants and analyzed in order to reveal gene expression and molecular
      level correlates underlying rapid antidepressant effects, and to identify biomarkers that
      predict treatment outcome.

    <intervention_model_description>In a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled design, 20 of the participants will receive ketamine, and 20 will receive psilocybin. 20 of the participants will be included in the study as a no-treatment group, so that natural time-dependent changes in depressive symptoms can be controlled for and thus the antidepressive effects of ketamine and psilocybin treatment can be verified. The no-treatment group will only attend the initial clinical interviews, and their depressive symptoms will be assessed remotely.</intervention_model_description>
    <primary_purpose>Basic Science</primary_purpose>
    <masking>Quadruple (Participant, Care Provider, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Since the psilocybin is ingested orally in capsule form, whereas ketamine is administered intranasally, the participants will either receive a placebo capsule containing microcrystalline cellulose (if they belong to the group receiving ketamine), or intranasally administered saline solution (with added bitter flavoring which will mimic the taste of ketamine that is often detectable even when administered intranasally).</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The 16-Item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measures in this study will be the mean change in QIDS scores from pre-administration baseline at day 1 to Follow-up 2 at day 103 (3 months after the administration session). Additionally, an electronic version of the QIDS will be performed 6 months after the administration session. The criteria for determining response will be a reduction of 25% in the (QIDS; Rush et al., 2003) scores from baseline (screening), and remission will be scores of ≤5 on the QIDS.</description>
