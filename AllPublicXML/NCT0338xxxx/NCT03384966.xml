  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to find out if a drug called ACT-246475 can prevent platelets from
      binding together when administered by an injection under the skin in the thigh or in the
      belly. Another goal is to know how fast and for how long ACT-246475 works and if there is a
      difference if the drug is injected in the thigh or in the belly. This study will also help to
      find out more about the safety of this new drug.

    <masking_description>Double-blinding will apply to treatment (ACT-246475 vs placebo). The dose (8 mg vs 16 mg) will be single blinded (subject blinded). The site for the sub-cutaneous injection (thigh vs abdomen) will not be blinded.</masking_description>

    <description>The primary outcome measure is the pharmacodynamic response that is defined for each subject as a P2Y12 Reaction Units &lt; 100 starting 30 min after injection and lasting for at least 3 h, as measured via the VerifyNow® assay. This corresponds to inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation (IPA) &gt; 80%</description>
