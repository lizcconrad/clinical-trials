    <textblock>
      The study is a multi-center, prospective, non-controlled, consecutive cohort post market
      surveillance study. The objective of this study is to obtain survival and clinical outcome
      data on the Hyperion® system in primary and revision total hip arthroplasty.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This multi-center, prospective, non-controlled, consecutive cohort post market surveillance
      study will serve the purpose of confirming long-term safety and performance of the Hyperion®
      system. The performance of the Hyperion® THA System will be evaluated using standard scoring
      systems (Merle d'Aubigné Score, Harris Hip Score, HOOS Score) and using documentation of
      sintering, wound healing and radiographic/clinical signs of loosening. Safety will be
      evaluated by adverse event reporting.

      The study will be performed at 6 sites, enrolling in total 70 patients. Follow-up visits are
      planned after 3 to 6 month, 1, 2 and 5 years. The scores will be filled in pre-operatively
      and post-operatively until 5 years. In order to obtain mid- to long-term patient satisfaction
      data the patient questionnaire will be send to the patient at 7 and 10 years, additionally.
      Xrays will be done pre-operatively, immediate post-operatively and at each of the Follow-up
      visits.

        Because of the studiesindications it is assumed that patients have a relatively high (&gt; 60
        Jahre) age at the time of their operations. Therefore a higher letality and a higher
        drop-out-rate is expected compared to study populations of primary hip replacement. To
        reach the necessery power for this clinical study at least 70 patients should be recruited.
