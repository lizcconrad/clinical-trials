  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to collect data from 8,476 fracture patients during a pre-and
      post-intervention phases of two years length each. The intervention consists on the
      implementation of the AOT SSI Prevention Bundle.

      During the first phase of the study, 4,238 patients will be recruited and the baseline
      incidence of surgical site infection at each participating site will be determined. At the
      beginning of the third year, the bundle will be implemented and data on 4,238 additional
      patients will be collected. The incidence rate on surgical site infection before and after
      the intervention will be compared. We hypothesize that this intervention will reduce the
      infection rate within the first 3 months after surgery from 6% to 4.5% (5% to 3.75% in closed
      fractures and from 10% to 7.5% in open fractures).

    <intervention_model_description>During two years, patients with fractures are recorded and the occurence of surgical site infections (SSI) in these patients is monitored in different sites over the world. After two years, a bundle of known prevention measures are teached and enforced in these sites. Then the occurence of SSI in fracture patients is monitored for another two years to see whether the bundle decreased the SSI occurence.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>It is that preventino measures are enforced in the hospital. This will apply to all patients and no masking is required.</masking_description>
