      Clinical data validation of the C3 device as a Vital Sign Monitoring System for patients
      under cancer treatment.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cortrium has developed the C3 device. The C3 device contains sensors that monitors
      Electrocardiogram (ECG), Respiratory rate (breathes per minute), and Body surface
      temperature. Also, the C3 device contains an accelerometer for registration of the body
      posture.

      The following thesis will be tested:

      Thesis 1) Pulse: The C3 device produces clinically validated pulse data. Thesis 2)
      Respiratory rate: The C3 device produces clinically validated respiratory rate data (breaths
      per minute). Thesis 3) Infection: With no justified statistical significant correlation
      between skin and body temperature, the study is exploring how to prevent aggravated or lethal
      outcomes of cancer treatment, e.g. chemotherapy, by using vital signs measurements combined
      with accelerometer data to detect infection levels. Thesis 4) The qualitative study: The
      study will report the advantages and disadvantages regarding new technological solutions, and
      the change in workflow and healthcare provision as it is experienced by the healthcare
      personnel and the patients. The data validation studies (thesis 1-3) will be tested in
      comparison with golden standard measurements methods and/or data validated medical equipment.
