      The objective is to assess efficacy and safety of Acetylcysteine/Doxofylline 1200/400 mg
      Effervescent Tablet once daily treatment besides standard/usual treatment, as compared with
      placebo once daily in patients with stable moderate to severe COPD.

      The objective is to assess efficacy and safety of Acetylcysteine/Doxofylline 1200/400 mg
      Effervescent Tablet once daily treatment besides standard/usual treatment, as compared with
      placebo once daily in patients with stable moderate to severe COPD.

      Patients who met all inclusion criteria will be randomized to receive double-blind treatment
      with Acetylcysteine/Doxofylline 1200/400 mg Effervescent Tablet once daily (n = 35) or
      placebo (n = 35) once daily for 4 weeks.

      Patients will be evaluated at 2 consecutive visits: screening &amp; treatment visit (first visit)
      and after treatment visit (second visit).

      Spirometric measurements will be performed at pre-treatment during the first visit and
      post-treatment at two different time points (23 hr + 15 min and 23 hr + 45 min) during the
      second visit. The average of the values at 23 hr 15 min and 23 hr 45 min during the second
      visit will be defined as trough value.
