  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates if a new drug (PSMA) makes prostate cancer easier to identify in
      positron-emission tomography (PET) imaging. If this works, prostate cancer treatments can be
      prescribed that match the location of the disease. PSMA is radiolabeled with Gallium-68
      (Ga-68). This means a participant receives a small dose of radiation from the drug - less
      than the annual radiation limit for a medical worker.

      To test this new drug, participants will receive an injection of Ga-68 PSMA and then have a
      PET scan. This PET scan, and the reported results, will be entered into the medical record
      and shared with the treating oncologists.

      This study evaluates PSMA-HBED-CC labelled with Gallium-68, abbreviated 68Ga PSMA. This is a
      radiotracer that attaches to receptors in the membrane of prostate cancer cells. The 68Ga
      PSMA is identified using a positron emission tomography (PET) scanner. It is believed that
      68Ga PSMA will identify prostate cancer more precisely than normal imaging methods (MRI, CT,
      or ultrasound). Imaging is key to successful treatment - disease must be identified to be
      treated.

      Men who are scheduled to undergo a prostatectomy are invited to test 68Ga PSMA. Participants
      undergo the 68Ga PSMA PET scan before the prostatectomy. Information from the prostatectomy,
      including any MRI, CT, or ultrasound imaging, will be used to determine if the 68Ga PSMA PET
      imaging was better than the standard imaging.

      Depending on the prostatectomy findings, participants may be invited back for a second 68Ga
      PSMA scan. This is done if the first scan showed positive lymph nodes or soft tissue
      metastases but the surgery/biopsy results do not.

      The results from these scans will be shared with the participant. Results will also be
      entered into the participant's medical record and shared with the treating oncologists.
