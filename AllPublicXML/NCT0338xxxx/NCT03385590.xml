  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this intervention study is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of
      soy-fiber-maize versus soy-maize complementary foods on bowel movement frequency, transit
      time, growth, gastrointestinal symptoms, microbiota composition and activity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 6-month randomized study to assess the feasibility and acceptability of
      soy-fiber-maize complementary food. Participants (caregiver/mother - child pairs) will
      complete a 2-week baseline period during which stool frequency, and stool consistency will be
      collected by paper questionnaire, and participants will collect a single stool. Dietary data
      will be obtained at baseline, 3 months and at 6 months during the study period. Participants
      will receive soy-fiber-maize or maize complementary foods twice a day for 6 months.
      Participants will attend a study visit every week for study food collection. During the study
      visit at baseline, 3 and 6 months, participants will complete a 24-hour dietary recall and
      height, weight and Mid Upper Arm Circumference will be measured on the children. At these
      same times, participants will provide stool samples. Participants will complete weekly
      questionnaires to assess gastrointestinal health, stool frequency and stool form.
      Furthermore, participants will participate in a focus group discussion at the end of the 6
      months' study period to assess the feasibility and acceptability of soy-fiber-maize
      complementary foods for their children. Stool samples will be analyzed for differences in the
      microbiota.
