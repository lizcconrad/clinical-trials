    <textblock>
      Cancer patients receiving treatment such as chemotherapy experience a variety of symptoms
      that interfere with their appetite and their ability to eat and enjoy meals. Therefore,
      adapting meals in a way that responds to these symptoms might be a good strategy to improve
      patient satisfaction, nutritional status and hence, quality of life. In this vein, the
      investigators hypothesize that meals from FoodforCare at Home will contribute to the quality
      of life of advanced abdominal cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy when compared to usual
      care.

    <textblock>
      Cancer patients receiving treatment such as chemotherapy experience a variety of symptoms
      that interfere with their appetite and their ability to eat and enjoy meals. Several studies
      suggest that nutritional intake increases when the patient is satisfied about the quality of
      the meals. Therefore, adapting meals in a way that responds to these symptoms might be a good
      strategy to improve patient satisfaction, nutritional status and hence, quality of life. In
      this vein, the investigators hypothesize that meals from FoodforCare at Home will contribute
      to the quality of life of advanced abdominal cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy when
      compared to usual care. Also, the investigators expect that this strategy will have a
      positive effect on patient satisfaction, other nutrition-related issues, including nausea and
      vomiting, on nutritional intake per se and hence, on the nutritional status. Additional
      benefits might include reduced use of medication, especially anti-emetics.

    <description>The intervention group will receive meals from FoodforCare at Home. The FoodforCare at Home concept consists of five to six small protein and energy enriched meals that will be delivered twice a week. After an individual intake, the composition of the dishes will be tailored to the needs of the patient in terms of composition, diet, taste, flavor and portion size. Besides the meals, patients in the intervention group will also receive an information leaflet about the importance of protein during treatment and how to reach their protein requirements.</description>
