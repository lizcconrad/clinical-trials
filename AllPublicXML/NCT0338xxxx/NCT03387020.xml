    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of ribociclib and everolimus and to
      see how well they work in treating patients with malignant brain tumors that have come back
      or do not respond to treatment. Ribociclib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as everolimus,
      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by
      stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving ribociclib and
      everolimus may work better at treating malignant brain tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended phase II dose (RP2D)
      of ribociclib and everolimus in children with refractory or recurrent central nervous system
      (CNS) tumors. (Phase I) II. To describe the toxicity profile and define the dose-limiting
      toxicities (DLTs) of ribociclib and everolimus in children with refractory or recurrent CNS
      tumors. (Phase I) III. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of ribociclib and everolimus in
      children with refractory or recurrent CNS tumors, and the potential for drug-drug
      interactions between the two compounds in this population. (Phase I) IV. To characterize
      ribociclib concentrations in tumor, and plasma in children with refractory or recurrent CNS
      malignancies undergoing neurosurgical procedures. (Surgical Study)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the response rate of relapsed and refractory malignant brain tumors to
      ribociclib and everolimus in the context of a phase I study. (Phase I) II. To explore the
      effect of ribociclib treatment on Ki-67 by immunohistochemistry (IHC) by comparing archival
      and post-treatment tumor tissue. (Surgical Study)

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To increase knowledge of the genomic landscape of treatment-refractory pediatric CNS
      tumors, including mechanisms of resistance and response.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive ribociclib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 of course 1 and
      subsequent courses and days 2-21 of course 2, and everolimus PO QD on days 3-28 of course 1
      and days 1-28 of subsequent courses. Patients who are undergoing surgery also receive
      ribociclib PO QD on days 7-10 before surgery. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 13
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable
      disease after 13 courses may continue receiving ribociclib and everolimus every 28 days for
      up to 13 additional courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.

                    -  Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or
                       other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure
                       rate &lt; 1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone
                       contraception

                    -  Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)

                    -  Barrier methods of contraception: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or

                       suppository

               -  Note: oral contraceptives are allowed but should be used in conjunction with a
                  barrier method of contraception due to unknown effect of drug-drug interaction;
                  in case of use of oral contraception, women should have been stable on the same
                  pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment

          -  Female patients must agree not to breastfeed their infants while on study; patients of
             child fathering potential (defined as &gt; Tanner stage 2) must use a condom during
             intercourse while taking the drug during treatment, for 8 weeks after stopping
             treatment and should not father a child in this period; a condom is required to be
             used also by vasectomized men during intercourse with a male or female partner in
             order to prevent delivery of the study drug via semen

          -  The patient or parent/guardian is able to understand the consent and is willing to
             sign a written informed consent document according to institutional guidelines;
             assent, when appropriate, will be obtained according to institutional guidelines

             additional risk for toxicity or would interfere with the study procedures or results

          -  Patients who are receiving any other anticancer or investigational or/and

               -  Patients who are currently receiving treatment with agents that are known to
                  cause corrected QT (QTc) prolongation or induce Torsades de Pointes

                  ventriculo-peritoneal shunt, endoscopic ventriculostomy and central venous access
                  are NOT considered major surgery

          -  Patient is currently receiving any of the following medications and cannot be
