      The purpose of the pre-study screening is to test for DNA abnormalities or biomarkers.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This testing will be done on a samples of blood to see whether or not patients are eligible
      to take part in one of the main studies. Each study will be looking at what effects a new
      drug or drugs has on prostate cancer and will also be looking at the side effects of
      treatment. The purpose of the main studies is to see if the biomarkers that were identified
      screening samples can help predict which patients are most likely to be helped by that drug
      or drugs and to see how the cancer cells respond to treatment.
