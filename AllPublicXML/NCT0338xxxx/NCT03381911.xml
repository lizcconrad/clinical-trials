  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate how consent forms and other health care documents are explained
      to patients. The findings will be used to create a computer program that can successfully
      explain consent and other health-related forms to individuals who have difficulty reading and
      understanding consent forms on their own as a supplement to the normal consent process done
      in research settings.

      In a prior study, the investigators delivered a similar protocol, where subjects were first
      consented and then given a mock consent form (administered in 1 of 3 arms: RA, ECA, or ECA +
      RA). Subjects in this protocol struggled with the concept of a &quot;mock&quot; consent process,
      especially after they had just completed a consent process for the study itself. The current
      protocol, using deception research methods, aims to provide a more pure assessment of ECA
      consent vs the standard (here, E-consent) by waiving consent and delivering the sham consent
      as if it were reality. In the context of a protocol that employs deception methods,
      participants in the current study would be invited as healthy volunteers, and be randomized
      to 1 of 2 different consent processes to evaluate the relative benefits of different
      approaches for informed consent. After the knowledge tests have been completed, subjects will
      undergo a debriefing where they are made fully aware of the deception and its purpose. At
      that time, subjects will also be given the opportunity to &quot;opt out&quot; and not have their data
      included in the study results.

      Participants who call in response to the clinic flyers will first confirm eligibility
      criteria of age (â‰¥21) and language (able to complete a study visit in English). Once
      eligibility is confirmed, participants will be scheduled to come to BMC for a single study
      visit that will take approximately 60-90 minutes. Randomization to one study arm or the other
      will occur when subject arrives for appointment.

      The following activities will occur at a single study visit:

        1. administer sham consent (via e-consent or ECA per randomization result)

        2. knowledge test

        3. data collection

             1. socio-demographics

             2. health literacy assessment (REALM)

             3. ECA satisfaction (for ECA arm subjects only)

             4. Emotional connection (adapted PROMIS) (for ECA arm subjects only)

        4. Debriefing

             1. Describe true study aims

             2. Opt out option (subject can request that their data not be used)

    <intervention_model_description>There are 2 study arms: ECA and E-Consent. In the ECA group subjects will have the consent form reviewed with them by the Embodied Conversational Agent character. In the E-Consent group (the standard of care), subjects will review the consent form on a computer screen with the option to have it read to them verbatim.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>In this arm an Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA) which is a computer generated character reads the consent form aloud to the subject, and also describes each section using a pre-loaded script. In addition, the character performs &quot;teach-back&quot;, where she asks the subject a question about the section that was just described, and then repeats the section if the question is answered incorrectly.</description>
