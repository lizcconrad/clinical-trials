  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in composition of the microbiota</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after 4 weeks, after 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will assess changes over time in the presence of all gut bacteria species in the microbiome of the participants based on DNA sequencing from fecal samples. Samples will be collected at three occasions; baseline (reference sample), midtime (after 4 weeks) and at the end (after 8 weeks). From frozen samples, all DNA will be extracted and full shotgun metagenomic sequencing performed using next generation sequencing technologies (Illumina and BGISEQ). A total of 120 samples (3*40 participants) will be sequenced to a depth of at least 3 giga base pairs (Gbp) each.</description>

    <description>Participants in the 'Climate friendly' group will be assigned a diet generating low emissions of greenhouse gases. The target is to reduce the participants' diet-related carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) to 2.5 kg per person and day, which is approximately a reduction by 50% compared the average CO2e, according to a previous study on diet-related CO2e in Sweden. The participants will be instructed to reduce their consumption of beef and dairy products and increase their consumption of plant-foods i.e. fruits, vegetables, legumes and whole-grain cereals.</description>
