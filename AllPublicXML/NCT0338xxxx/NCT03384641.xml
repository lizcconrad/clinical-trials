    <measure>Change from Baseline in the Odds of Mycobacterium leprae (M. leprae) Growth in Mouse Footpads Following 8 Weeks of Treatment with Bedaquiline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in the odds of M. leprae growth in mouse footpads will be evaluated. M. leprae bacilli will be inoculated in footpads of mice, according to the method of Shephard. M. leprae growth will be determined by technologists trained and experienced in mouse footpad procedures, at 1 year after infection (or at mouse death or humane endpoint, if it occurs greater than or equal to [&gt;=] 6 months after footpad inoculation). The number of footpads with positive growth (&gt;=10^5 M. leprae) will be counted and used to determine the odds of bacterial growth.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 124 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical event that occurs in a participant administered an investigational product, and it does not necessarily indicate only events with clear causal relationship with the relevant investigational product.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants with AEs by Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 124 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Severity of adverse events will be graded by using division of microbiology and infectious diseases (DMID) adult toxicity scale to estimate grade of severity. Severity scale ranges from Grade 1 (Mild) to Grade 4 (Life-threatening). Grade 1= Mild, Grade 2= Moderate, Grade 3= Severe, and Grade 4= Life-threatening.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Has multibacillary (MB) leprosy, defined as 6 or more skin lesions, and is either
             borderline lepromatous or polar lepromatous, as determined using Ridley and Jopling
             classification system

          -  Has an average bacteriological index greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 4+ from a six-site
             skin smear assessment at screening

          -  Otherwise healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical history, vital signs,
             and 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at screening. If there are
             abnormalities, they must be consistent with the underlying illness in the study
             population. This determination must be recorded in the participant's source documents
             and initialed by the investigator

          -  Otherwise healthy on the basis of clinical laboratory tests performed at screening. If
             the results of the serum chemistry panel, including liver enzymes, other specific
             tests, blood coagulation, hematology, or urinalysis are outside the normal reference
             ranges, the participant may be included only if the investigator judges the
             abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not clinically significant or to be
             appropriate and reasonable for the population under study. This determination must be
             recorded in the participant's source documents and initialed by the investigator

          -  Willing and able to adhere to the prohibitions, restrictions, and long-term follow up
             requirements specified in this protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has experienced a lepra reaction

          -  Has a contraindication limiting the implementation of a medically accepted MB leprosy
             regimen

          -  Has ever received pharmacotherapy for leprosy or is known to have ever received a
             pharmacotherapy that could be used to treat leprosy (for example, dapsone,
             clofazimine, rifampicin, moxifloxacin, ofloxacin)

          -  Has a concomitant infection that requires an additional systemic antimicrobial agent

          -  Has tuberculosis (TB), as determined by medical history and chest x-ray
