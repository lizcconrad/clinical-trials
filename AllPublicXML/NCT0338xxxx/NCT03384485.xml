  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fabry disease, an X-linked disorder of glycosphingolipids that is caused by mutations of the
      GLA gene that codes for α-galactosidase A, leads to dysfunction of many cell types and
      includes a systemic vasculopathy. As a result, patients have a markedly increased risk of
      developing ischemic stroke, small-fiber peripheral neuropathy, cardiac dysfunction and
      chronic kidney disease. Because this disease is a rare disease most of the time it is
      misdiagnosed, so in this study we will check out the Prevalence of lysosomal hydrolase
      alpha-glagtosidase deficiency ( Fabry disease) in patients with Antiphospholipid Syndrome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      the investigators would like to assess the prevalence of Fabry in men and women aged 18-100
      who were diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome in our departmental clinic in 2000-2017 It
      is very important to diagnose Fabri that then the treatment of patients can vary
      dramatically.

      The study will include 100 adult patients (18-100) men and women. Testing for the Fabri test
      in men is an enzyme test and will be performed subject to their consent to sign informed
      consent. In the women, an enzyme test will be carried out, and the plasma Lys-3-3 plasma
      storage, as recommended in the recently published diagnostic algorithms, is examined. If
      diagnosed, a patient will be referred to a genetic institute for further genetic counseling
