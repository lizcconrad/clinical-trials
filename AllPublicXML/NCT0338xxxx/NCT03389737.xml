  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For the purpose of this pilot study, the investigators hypothesize that the use of the Step
      Up Your Game protocol will result in statistically significant improvements in health and
      athletic performance. The key to this is the coordination of resources from a supervising
      physician, physical therapist, trainer, dietitian, coach, competitor, role model,
      psychologist, and spiritual leader. Notably, Step Up Your Game provides resources which would
      allow patients to find or be their own physical therapist, trainer, dietitian, coach,
      competitor, role model, psychologist, and spiritual leader. The role of the supervising
      physician, however, is meant for a qualified professional, who follows the osteopathic
      approach to medicine, in which the body is treated as an integrated whole, while also working
      to prevent and treat injuries. Though not limited solely to osteopathic physicians, it is
      critical to take into account every health aim and injury in the context of the athlete and
      how these affect all aspects of participants lives.
