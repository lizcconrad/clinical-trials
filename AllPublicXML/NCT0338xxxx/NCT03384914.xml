    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of each study vaccine and to
      evaluate the effect on the time to disease recurrence (assessed by disease free survival).

      Participants will be assigned to receive one of two study vaccines (DC1 study vaccine vs.
      WOKVAC). The study vaccine will be administered in two phases: a study vaccination phase and
      a booster phase.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The total duration of the study will be 6 years (4 years of patient enrollment and 2
      additional years of clinical follow-up). Assessment for disease recurrence and survival will
      be conducted every 6 months (with a phone call/secure email, medical records or follow up
      visit) from the end of treatment for a total of 2 years, until the completion of the trial or
      until documented disease recurrence.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical stage I-III breast cancer with any invasive residual disease in the breast or
             axillary nodes following neoadjuvant chemotherapy including HER-2 directed treatment.

          -  Patients who have received a total of at least 36 weeks of trastuzumab therapy
             (including neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings).
