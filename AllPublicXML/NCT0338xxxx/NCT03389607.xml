    <textblock>
      One consequence of tissue damage caused by tourniquet is ischemia-reperfusion injury.
      Short-term ischemia leads to vasodilatation and reactive hyperemia resulting in post-ischemic
      reperfusion microcirculation failure and tissue edema that extends from 30 minutes to 4
      hours.

      SCUBE-1 is a newly defined cell surface molecule. It emerges from many developing cells,
      including endothelium and platelets. Immunohistochemical demonstration of subendothelial
      matrix deposition in atherosclerosis in humans. We did not find any study that showed the
      post-ischemic regression of scube 1, which was shown to be significantly higher in ischemic
      events in the literature.

      in this study is aimed to investigate the location / sensitivity of SCUBE-1 in diabetics and
      nondiabetics after application of regional anesthesia for ischemia-reperfusion injury induced
      by tourniquet application in knee prosthesis attempts in our aimed patients and compare this
      with other total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and MDA of ischemia-reperfusion parameters

      After being taken to the operation room, the patient will be divided into two groups as group
      D (diabetic) and group K (control) by standardized anesthesia monitoring with 5-lead
      electrocardiogram (ECG), peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) and noninvasive blood pressure
      measurements.

      In both groups, spinal anesthesia will be applied in a lateral decubitus position using a 22
      gauge Quincke spinal needle from the interspinal space as 0.5% heavy marcaine 10-12.5 mg 1
      min. Atropine 0.5 mg and ephedrine 5 mg should be administered if bradycardia develops in
      both groups. The disease tourniquet will be applied after induction, in accordance with the
      literature, to be above 150 mmHg of the systolic blood pressure.
