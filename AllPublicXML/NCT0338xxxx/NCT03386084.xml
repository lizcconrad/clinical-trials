  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lumbar pain is considered one of the most frequent health problems faced by human populations
      on a global scale.

      This study will be carried out to evaluate the efficiency of motor control treatments
      combined with diathermy in patients diagnosed with acute lower back pain, focusing upon the
      potential for accelerated patient recuperation if both treatments are applied simultaneously
      and jointly.

    <measure>Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by nerve endings of nociceptive neurons.
The measurement tool that will be used is Visual Analog Scale. This scale is a unidimensional measure of pain intensity. It has a continuous scale comprised of a horizontal line with an interval of 10 points, where 1 is the minimum intensity of pain the patient can endure and 10 is the maximum intensity of pain the patient can endure.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disability</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Determination of the degree of a physical patient´s handicap. The measurement tool that will be used is Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire. This questionnaire is used to establish physical disability degree of people with non specific acute low back pain. It has 24 questions the patient should point out to determinate his/her limitation for make normal activities.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the assessment of the satisfaction regarding the attention and quality of the services received and the degree of compliance with the patient's expectations about the treatment.
The measurement tool that will be used is Client Satisfaction Questionnaire. This questionnaire is used to evaluate patient's satisfaction with the care and quality of the health services received. It has 8 items from 1 to 4 points (where 1 is the minimum satisfaction and 4 is the maximum satisfaction) to assess the satisfaction degree.</description>
