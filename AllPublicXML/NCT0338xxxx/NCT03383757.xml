      The purpose of the study is to demonstrate proper function of the U-TruSignal device via
      clinical performance testing in a neonatal human subject population under standard clinical
      conditions. A study with human subjects will provide the needed clinical evidence for
      assessing the accuracy of the pulse oximeter as recommended by the FDA Guidance Document
      (Pulse Oximeters - Premarket Notification Submissions [50(k)s]: Guidance for Industry and
      Food and Drug Administration Staff.)

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect blood samples from neonates under normal clinical
      conditions to ensure proper function (clinical performance) with the U-TruSignal device.

      The study will include both the TruSignal AllFit Sensor and TruSignal Sensitive Sensor.

      After providing consent, no preparation beyond the investigational site's standard of care is
      required before study procedures begin. At the start of the procedure, one to two sensors,
      upon the discretion of the investigator, shall be applied to the subject.

      The duration of the subject's participation in the study is dependent upon the scheduled
      routine arterial blood draw and obtaining the maximum of 6 data pairs (3 data pairs per
      sensor). The Investigator or designated study staff will collect of SpO2 and pulse rate for
      each study subject. Laboratory results from arterial blood draw will be collected from the
      hospital's medical records. The description, severity, and device relatedness of any AE or
      SAE during the study will be recorded.
