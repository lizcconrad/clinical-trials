  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intensive care units (ICUs), with high antibiotic consumption, are epicentres of
      antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) is the commonest
      hospital-acquired infection (HAI) in ICUs and is associated with a high morbidity and
      mortality in these vulnerable patients despite antibiotic therapy. No well-designed clinical
      trials studying antibiotic duration for VAP caused by predominantly non-fermenting
      Gram-negative bacteria have been conducted to date. Shortening antibiotic duration has the
      potential to improve individual patient outcomes and indirectly benefit other patients by
      reducing the selection pressure for multidrug resistant (MDR) bacteria within the ICU.

      This study aims to show non-inferiority of short antibiotic treatment duration (7 days or
      less) versus long antibiotic therapy (8 days or more) for VAP. Patients who have been
      ventilated for more than 48 hours will be screened daily for signs and symptoms of VAP
      according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention VAP criteria. Recruited
      patients will be reviewed daily for clinical signs of stability including temperature &lt;38°C
      for 48 hours, systolic blood pressure &gt;90mmHg without inotropes. Recruited patients will be
      randomised once they fulfill these clinical criteria of stability. In the intervention arm,
      antibiotics should be stopped within 7 days once the above criteria are fulfilled. In the
      control arm, antibiotics should be at least 7 days with the exact duration decided by the
      managing physicians.

      The primary outcome of the study is a combined endpoint of mortality and VAP recurrence at
      day 60 of recruitment. The study hypothesis is that a shorter duration of treatment for VAP
      (7 days or less depending on clinical response) is noninferior to a longer duration (8 days
      or more). The secondary outcomes of the study include clinical parameters such as rate of
      acquisition of MDRO hospital-acquired infections, duration of ventilation and hospitalization
      and days of antibiotics use. The study team will also characterise the microbiome changes in
      study participants according to the type and duration of antibiotics. MDROs collected will
      undergo whole genome sequencing for transmission dynamics study. The study is a multinational
      multicenter study involving hospitals in Asia.

    <intervention_model_description>Randomisation will be done via stratified block randomisation by the study sites to ensure participants with similar characteristics such as gender and age are distributed equally in the intervention and control groups.

    <masking_description>Patients will be blinded to the study, as they will not be informed of the treatment duration and likely to be sedated and unaware of the treatment regimens. Investigators will be blinded during the assessment of the participants for clinical stability based on the above-described criteria to minimise observer bias. Once conditions for stopping antibiotics are satisfied, the investigator will be unblinded and contact the primary physicians to stop antibiotics. The physicians will remain blinded until they are informed that the participant is suitable to stop antibiotics.</masking_description>
