      Primary Objective:

      To assess the effects of multiple-dose hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) on the steady-state
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of sotagliflozin.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of multiple-dose sotagliflozin with and without
           co-administration of multiple-dose HCTZ

        -  To assess the effects of multiple-dose sotagliflozin on the steady-state PK of HCTZ

        -  To assess the effects of multiple-dose HCTZ on the steady-state PK of
           sotagliflozin-3-O-glucuronide

          -  Certified as healthy by a comprehensive clinical assessment (detailed medical history
             and complete physical examination).

          -  Normal vital signs, electrocardiogram, and laboratory parameters.

          -  Female subject must use a double contraception method including a highly effective
             method of birth control, except if she has undergone sterilization at least 3 months

             use of 1 of the following contraceptive options: (1) intrauterine device; (2) condom
             or diaphragm or cervical/vault cap, in addition to spermicide. Menopause is defined as
             being amenorrheic for at least 2 years with plasma follicle stimulating hormone level
             &gt;30 IU. Hormonal contraception is NOT acceptable in this study.

          -  Male subject, whose partners are of childbearing potential (including lactating
             women), must accept to use, during sexual intercourse, a double contraception method
             according to the following algorithm: (condom) plus (spermicide or intra-uterine
             device or hormonal contraceptive) from the inclusion up to 4 months after the last
             dosing.

          -  Male subject, whose partners are pregnant, must use, during sexual intercourse, a
             condom from the inclusion up to 4 months after the last dosing.

          -  Male subject has agreed not to donate sperm from the inclusion up to 4 months after
             the last dosing.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Any medication (including St John's Wort) within 14 days before inclusion or within 5
             times the elimination half-life or pharmacodynamic half-life of the medication, with
             the exception of hormonal contraception or menopausal hormone replacement therapy; any
             vaccination within the last 28 days and any biologics (antibody or its derivatives)
             given within 4 months before inclusion.

          -  Positive result on any of the following tests: hepatitis B surface (HBs Ag) antigen,
             anti-hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) antibodies, anti-human immunodeficiency virus 1 and
             2 antibodies (anti-HIV1 and anti HIV2 Ab).

          -  Positive result on urine drug screen or alcohol test.

          -  Any contra-indications to hydrochlorothiazide, according to the applicable labeling.

          -  Any history or presence of deep leg vein thrombosis or embolism or a recurrent or
             frequent appearance of deep leg vein thrombosis in first degree relatives (parents,
             siblings or children).

        The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's
        potential participation in a clinical trial.
