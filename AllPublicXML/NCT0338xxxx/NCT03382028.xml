      Identification and characterization of the link between psychomotor development and the
      appearance of associated signs in children with &quot;Equinus Deformity &quot; considered isolated at
      birth.

      The main objective of this study is to define the frequency of developmental abnormalities in
      children with &quot;Equinus Deformity Idiopathic&quot; compared to the general population

      The secondary objective is to identify the prenatal and / or neonatal characteristics that
      could be predictive of the occurrence of developmental abnormalities in

      Prenatal and postnatal follow-up data are derived from the child's medical file. To complete
      these data and after inclusion, parents of children carrying &quot;Equinus Deformity Idiopathic&quot;
      will be sent a questionnaire that assesses overall psychomotor development and lists the
      medical events since the birth of their child (scoliosis, epilepsy ...).
