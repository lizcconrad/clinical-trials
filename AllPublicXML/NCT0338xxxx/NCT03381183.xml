    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if the IRX-2 regimen, durvalumab, and tremelimumab will
      have a tolerable safety profile and will increase the intratumoral immune profile compared
      with the pretreatment tumors.

    <description>The dose escalation phase of the study will enroll 3 to 6 patients per dose level using a standard 3+3 design. Cohort 1 will be 3 participants enrolled at dose level 1. If no dose-limiting toxicities are observed during first 8 weeks of treatment, the enrollment will continue in dose expansion phase (expansion cohort at dose level 1). A dose limiting toxicity (DLT) will be defined as any Grade 3 or higher toxicity that occurs during the DLT evaluation period and are considered related to the combination of the IRX-2 regimen, durvalumab and tremelimumab (IDT) occurred during Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 2 Day 28 (= 8 weeks). Toxicity that is clearly and directly related to the primary disease or to another etiology is excluded from this definition.</description>
