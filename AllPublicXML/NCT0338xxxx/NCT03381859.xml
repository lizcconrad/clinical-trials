      Primary Efficacy Objective

      -To assess whether a 12-week treatment course with oral 50 mg elbasvir plus 100 mg
      grazoprevir given in a single daily dose to treatment-naïve patients with end-stage renal
      disease (ESRD) and infected with genotype 4 (GT4) chronic HCV (CHC) infection can produce a
      sustained viral response (SVR), i.e. HCV RNA below the lower limit of quantification [LLOQ]
      for 12 weeks (SVR12) after completion of the study treatment course

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To assess the efficacy of elbasvir/grazoprevir in suppressing HCV viremia in
           treatment-naïve GT4 CHC patients at each scheduled visit and clinically meaningful
           endpoints (Week 2, 8 and 12 [End of Treatment - EOT]) and 24 (SVR12)

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of a 12-week treatment course with
           elbasvir/grazoprevir in treatment-naïve patients with ESRD and infected with GT4 CHC.

        -  To assess liver fibrosis by non-invasive evaluation of liver stiffness (Fibroscan®) in
           the same patients before treatment and EOT and SVR12

      Clinical hypotheses.

      Primary Efficacy Hypothesis

      - A 12-week treatment course with elbasvir/grazoprevir in treatment-naïve patients with ESRD
      and infected with GT4 CHC infection will result in an HCV RNA below the LLOQ in 95% of
      patients within 2 weeks of treatment, and at least 95% will have an SVR12.

      Secondary hypotheses

        -  A 12-week treatment course with elbasvir/grazoprevir in ESRD GT4 treatment-naïve
           patients will result in undetectable viremia in 95% patients at Week 2, 4, 8 and 12
           (EOT) and 24 (SVR12)

        -  Treatment will be safe and well-tolerated in these patients, as determined by the type
           and number of adverse events identified through laboratory testing, vital signs and
           physical examinations.

        -  In these patients with liver fibrosis before treatment, the liver fibrosis as assessed
           by non-invasive evaluation of liver stiffness (Fibroscan®) will improve by EOT and SVR12
