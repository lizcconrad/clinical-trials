  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate if dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) delivered into
      intrabony defects in a collagen scaffold would enhance the clinical and radiographic
      parameters of periodontal regeneration.

      In this randomized controlled trial, 29 chronic periodontitis patients presenting one deep
      intrabony defect and requiring extraction of one vital tooth were consecutively enrolled.
      Defects were randomly assigned to test or control treatments which both consisted of the use
      of minimally invasive surgical technique. The dental pulp of the extracted tooth was
      mechanically dissociated to obtain micro-grafts rich in autologous DPSCs. Test sites (n=15)
      were filled with micro-grafts seeded onto collagen sponge, whereas control sites (n=14) with
      collagen sponge alone. Clinical and radiographic parameters were recorded at baseline, 6 and
      12 months postoperatively.

    <description>Defects were accessed with the MIST In the test group the obtained micro-grafts enriched in DPSCs were endorsed onto a collagen sponge scaffold (CondressÂ®, Istituto Gentili, Milano, Italy) to form a bio-complex. In the control group the collagen sponge was only hydrated using physiologic sterile solution. The collagen sponge with or without cells was provided to the masked surgeon who filled the intrabony defect. The flaps were repositioned and tension-free primary flap closure was obtained using horizontal internal mattress and interrupted sutures</description>
