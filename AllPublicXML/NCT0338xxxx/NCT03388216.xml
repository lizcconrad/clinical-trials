    <textblock>
      This is Prospective Randomized Placebo controlled Single Blind Phase I study to evaluate the
      safety, tolerance and pharmacokinetics of the anti-Shiga toxin hyperimmune equine
      immunoglobulin F(ab')2 fragment (INM004) in healthy volunteers.

    <textblock>
      This is a study that will be conducted at a single site in Argentina to characterize the
      Pharmacokinetics (PK) profile, safety and tolerability of anti-Shiga toxin hyperimmune equine
      immunoglobulin F(ab')2 fragment (INM004) in 14 healthy subjects. This is a dose escalation
      study. Subjects will receive a single dose of an infusion of the biological product or
      placebo in Stage I where 2 cohorts will be assessed with 2 different doses of INM004.
      Subjects will receive a repeated dose (3 doses total, every 24 hs) of an infusion of the
      biological product or placebo in Stage II. The total duration of study participation is 4
      weeks for each subject. Subjects will complete a follow-up visit at Day 30 after the dosing.
      Study duration is expected to last 6 months. The investigational product intent to use is for
      the prevention of the development of Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) associated to Shigatoxin
      producing Escherichia coli (STEC).
