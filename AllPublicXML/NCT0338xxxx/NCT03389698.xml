  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aging is the primary risk factor in aging-related dementia. An important initiating factor
      for the development and progression of cognitive impairment is disruption of the blood-brain
      barrier (BBB). BBB plays an important role in maintaining normal brain homeostasis and
      protecting neural tissues from toxins. It is hypothesized that such changes known to be
      common in aging and can be an early process that precedes Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The
      microvascular changes related to subtle BBB disruption can be measured with
      permeability-surface area (PS) derived from GRASP DCE-MRI acquired less than 10 minutes, and
      the patterns of increased PS in normal and abnormal aging are different.
