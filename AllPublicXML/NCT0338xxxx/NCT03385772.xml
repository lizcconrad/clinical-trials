      This study aims to determine the efficacy of the sphenopalatine ganglion block in the
      treatment of post-dural puncture headache in post-partum women at the Brigham and Women's
      Hospital by measuring VAS scores at times between 0 and 24 hours after the block. We
      hypothesize that there will be at least a 50% reduction in VAS scores at 4 hours after
      performing the sphenopalatine block as compared to baseline VAS scores.

    <textblock>
      Post-dural puncture headache (PDPH) is a major cause of morbidity in postpartum patients who
      received neuraxial anesthesia for labor analgesia or cesarean delivery. The headache in PDPH
      is thought to be due to loss of cerebrospinal fluid causing downward traction on the meninges
      with parasympathetic ally mediated reflex vasodilation of the meningeal vessels. The epidural
      blood patch is currently the gold-standard treatment for postdural puncture headache, however
      it is an invasive procedure with possible risks and complications including bleeding,
      infection, pain, hematoma, neurologic complications, and repeat dural puncture. Patients are
      often offered conservative treatment including medications, bed rest, abdominal binders, and
      fluids for at least 24 hours prior to being offered an epidural blood patch. Once the
      decision is made to proceed with a blood patch, it may take several hours before the
      procedure is performed due to staffing issues. We propose that the sphenopalatine ganglion
      block, a relatively noninvasive procedure which has been used by neurologists as a treatment
      for a variety of types of headaches, may play a role in the treatment of postdural puncture
      headache in the obstetric population.The sphenopalatine ganglion is a parasympathetic
      ganglion located in the pterygopalatine fossa which can be accessed topically through the
      nose. The proposed mechanism of the sphenopalatine ganglion block is parasympathetic blockade
      preventing the profound vasodilation associated with the headache after a dural puncture,
      thus providing the patient with symptomatic relief. While the sphenopalatine ganglion block
      has been used by neurologists for the treatment of migraines and cluster headaches for years,
      little is known about its effectiveness in the treatment of post-dural puncture headache in
      post-partum women. A small case series by Kent et al demonstrated that offering the
      sphenopalatine ganglion block as a first-line treatment for post-dural puncture headache
      provided symptomatic relief and reduced the need for epidural blood patch. If the
      sphenopalatine ganglion block is found to be an effective treatment for post-dural puncture
      headache in the obstetric population, the block could be offered to patients as a firstline
      treatment as a way to improve VAS scores, reduce the need for medications with potential side
      effects, and possibly reduce the need for epidural blood patch.The primary outcome will be
      change in VAS scores at 4 hours after the sphenopalatine ganglion block. Secondary outcomes
      will include time to first Fioricet dose after the sphenopalatine ganglion block, presence of
      nausea at 4 hours, presence of neck pain at 4 hours, presence of visual changes at 4 hours,
      change in VAS scores at 12 hours, change in VAS scores at 24 hours, and need for epidural
      blood patch.

    <description>The patient will be placed supine, with head in sniffing position. Two long cotton-tipped applicators will be soaked in 4% lidocaine for 30 seconds. An anesthesia provider, after visually inspecting each nostril for any sign of deformity or blockage, will perform the block. A cotton tipped applicator will be inserted into one nostril at an angle perpendicular to the face, and will be advanced to the back of the nasopharynx until resistance is met. The procedure will be repeated in the other nostril. If the patient experiences any pain or discomfort, the physician will stop and redirect the applicator. The applicators will be left in place for 10 minutes, and then removed by the anesthesia provider.</description>
