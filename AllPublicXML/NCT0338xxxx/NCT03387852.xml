      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate the effects of SAR440340/REGN3500 with or without dupilumab, compared to placebo,
      on reducing the incidence of &quot;loss of asthma control&quot; (LOAC) events.

      Secondary Objectives:

      To evaluate the effects of SAR440340/REGN3500 and coadministration of SAR440340/REGN3500 and
      dupilumab, compared with placebo, on forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1).

      To evaluate the effects of coadministration of SAR440340/REGN3500 and dupilumab, compared
      with SAR440340 and compared with dupilumab, on FEV1.

      To assess safety and tolerability of SAR440340/REGN3500 alone and in coadministration with
      dupilumab.

             the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) 2017 Guidelines.

          -  Patients with existing treatment with medium to high dose ICS (≥250 mcg of fluticasone
             propionate twice a day (BID) or equipotent ICS daily dosage to a maximum of 2000
             mcg/day of fluticasone propionate or clinically comparable) in combination with a LABA
             as second controller for at least 3 months with a stable dose ≥1 month prior to Visit
             1.

          -  Patients with prebronchodilator forced expiratory volume (FEV1) &gt;40% of predicted
             normal at Visit 1/Screening. Pre-bronchodilator FEV1 ≥50% but ≤85% of predicted normal
             at Visit 2/Baseline.

          -  Patients with reversibility of at least 12% and 200 mL in FEV1 after administration of
             2 to 4 puffs (200-400 mcg) of albuterol/salbutamol or levalbuterol/levosalbutamol
             during screening or documented history of a reversibility test that meets this
             criteria within 12 months prior to Visit 1 or documented positive response to
             methacholine challenge (a decrease in FEV by 20% [PC20] of &lt;8mg/mL) within 12 months
             prior to Visit 1/Screening is considered acceptable to meet this inclusion criterion.

          -  Co-morbid disease that might interfere with the evaluation of investigational
             medicinal product (IMP).

             disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, primary biliary
             cirrhosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, etc.) and other diseases,
             within 2 months or 5 half-lives prior to Visit 1, whichever is longer.

          -  Patients with a history of a systemic hypersensitivity reaction to a biologic drug.

          -  Patients on or initiation of bronchial thermoplasty within 2 years prior to Visit 1 or
