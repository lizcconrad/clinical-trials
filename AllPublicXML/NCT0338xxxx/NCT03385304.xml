  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevention of infection is the single most important goal influencing peri-operative care
      of patients with open fractures. Standard practice in the management of open fractures
      includes sterile technique and pre-operative skin preparation with an antiseptic solution.
      The available solutions kill bacteria and decrease the quantity of native skin flora, thereby
      decreasing surgical site infection (SSI). While there is extensive guidance on specific
      procedures for prophylactic antibiotic use and standards for sterile technique, the evidence
      regarding the choice of antiseptic skin preparation solution is very limited for open
      fracture surgery.

    <allocation>Randomized</allocation>
    <intervention_model>Crossover Assignment</intervention_model>
    <intervention_model_description>Treatment allocation will be determined using a cluster-randomized crossover trial design. The order of treatment allocation for each orthopaedic practice will be randomly assigned using a computer generated randomization table. Each site will start with the initially allocated study solution and eventually crossover to the other solution for their second recruitment period. This process of alternating treatments will repeat approximately every 2 months as dictated by the initial randomization.</intervention_model_description>
    <primary_purpose>Treatment</primary_purpose>
    <masking>Single (Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>The orthopaedic team (including the study coordinators) cannot be blinded to the treatment allocation as the antiseptic solutions are visually distinguishable and these individuals need to lead the implementation of the cluster-crossover protocol at their clinical site. The Adjudication Committee Members and data analysts will be blinded to the study treatment. All interpretation of study results will initially be done in a blinded manner by developing two interpretations of the results. One interpretation will assume treatment A is povidone-iodine, the other interpretation will assume it is CHG. Once the data interpretations for each assumption are finalized, the data will be unblinded and the correct interpretation will be accepted.</masking_description>
