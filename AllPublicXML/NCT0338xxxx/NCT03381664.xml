  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted to evaluate the relative bioavailability, pharmacokinetics,
      safety, and tolerability of AVP-923 (dextromethorphan hydrobromide [DM] and quinidine sulfate
      [Q] capsules) when the contents of a capsule are administered in applesauce or via a
      nasogastric feeding tube, compared with administration of a capsule in healthy, fasting,
      adult participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-center, randomized, single-dose, 3-treatment, 3-period,
      6-sequence crossover study in healthy adult participants consisting of approximately 7 weeks
      of treatment. The study population will be limited to extensive metabolizers of cytochrome
      P450 (CYP) 2D6.

      Approximately 18 participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 6 sequences (ABC, ACB, BAC,
      BCA, CAB, CBA).
