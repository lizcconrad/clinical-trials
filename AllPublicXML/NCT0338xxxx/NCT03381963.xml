  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this prospective cohort study is to evaluate the modifications of the biological
      hemostatic profile associated with the use of endocrine therapy in women with breast cancer
      (tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this cohort study, women with breast cancer and an indication for endocrine therapy will
      be prospectively enrolled. At the 1st visit (before the start of endocrine therapy (tamoxifen
      or aromatase inhibitor)) and at the 2nd visit (at ~3 months after the start of treatment),
      demographical / clinical data and blood samples will be collected. We will evaluate the
      hemostatic biological profiles associated with the use of endocrine therapy by comparing
      hemostatic biomarkers before and during its use.
