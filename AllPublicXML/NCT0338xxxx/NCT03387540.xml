  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) might have high grade immune-related adverse events
      (irAEs) on the cardio-vascular system. This study investigates reports of cardio-vascular
      toxicity with treatment including anti-PD1, Anti-PDL-1, and Anti CTLA4 classes using the
      World Health Organization (WHO) database VigiBase.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ICIs have dramatically improved clinical outcomes in multiple cancer types and are
      increasingly being tested in earlier disease settings and used in combination. However, irAEs
      can occur. Here the investigators use VigiBase (http://www.vigiaccess.org/), the World Health
      Organization (WHO) database of individual safety case reports, to identify cases of
      cardiovascular adverse drug reaction following treatment with ICIs.
