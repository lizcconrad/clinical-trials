  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Resident-to-resident elder mistreatment (R-REM) is a significant problem in long-term
      services and support settings (LTSS), and likely to cause physical and or psychological
      distress. The proposed project tests an intervention developed for use by LTSS staff. As
      such, it represents an important step in the process of developing approaches for
      ameliorating and preventing R-REM in assisted living residences which house residents with
      dementia and related behavioral disorders, and is thus likely to have significant public
      health impact.
