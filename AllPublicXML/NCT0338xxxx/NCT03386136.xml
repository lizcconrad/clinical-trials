  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a non invasive study to see if 100% oxygen therapy will help to resolve an
      intestinal obstruction.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TOGA involves the provision of a 6- hour treatment with 100% oxygen via non breather mask to
      hospitalized patients with ileus, small bowel obstruction and/or colonic pseudo-obstruction
      will be a useful supplemental therapy, decreasing the diameter of the intestinal lumen and
      enhancing resolution of ileus/pseudo-obstruction
