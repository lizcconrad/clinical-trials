  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin D is important risk factor for developing multiple sclerosis (MS) and for disease
      progression. Patients with MS who had lower vitamin D levels were at increased risk for more
      clinical attacks and faster disease progression. It was also shown that patients with MS had
      lower vitamin D levels in serum than healthy controls. It is not clearly defined, which are
      the levels of vitamin D in serum, that are high enough to trigger immunomodulatory effect and
      are safe for patients.

      This double-blind randomized clinical trial was designed to compare impact of vitamin D
      supplementation in two different doses (1000 IU/day vs 4000 IU/day) in patients with
      relapsing remitting MS. The main goal of this trial is to compare dose response on vitamin D
      supplementation and to estimate more closely appropriate level of vitamin D in serum which
      triggers some of experimentally shown immunomodulatory actions.

      This double-blind randomized clinical trial was designed to compare impact of vitamin D
      supplementation during four months in winter time in two different doses (1000 IU/day vs 4000
      IU/day) in patients with relapsing remitting MS. The main goal of this trial is to compare
      dose response on vitamin D supplementation and estimate more closely appropriate level of
      vitamin D in serum which triggers some of experimentally shown immunomodulatory actions. To
      define immunomodulatory response different laboratory, clinical and genetic tests will be
      performed.
