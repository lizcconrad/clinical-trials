    <textblock>
      82 cases of recurrent miscarriage women with a diagnosis of arcuate uterus, confirmed by
      three-dimensional intra-vaginal sonography (3D-TVS) and hysteroscopy, will be recruited. The
      subjects will be randomly divided into two groups, the experimental group will be given
      hysteroscopic treatment, the control group will receive no treatment. The pregnancy rates
      (&gt;12 weeks) of the two groups will befollowed and compared.

      This study will be carried out at the Hysteroscopy center of the Fuxing Hospital, Beijing,
      China. A total of 82 recurrent miscarriage women with a diagnosis of arcuate uterus who had
      unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortion (less than 12 weeks) before and have fertility
      requirement will be recruited. The patients will be explained the study and sign the informed
      consent. According to the random number table, the corresponding cases were divided into
      treatment group and control group. The experimental group will be given hysteroscopic
      treatment, the control group will receive no treatment. The follow up of the spontaneous
      abortion rate and the pregnancy rate of two groups will be screened within 1-2 years and the
      correlation between the arcuate uterus and recurrent miscarriage will be analyzed.
