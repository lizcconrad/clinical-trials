    <textblock>
      Neonatal adaptation to extrauterine life has many physiological changes in neonatal organ
      systems. These adaptative changes may be affected such as type of delivery and anesthesia
      management at birth. near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a popular non-invasive method that
      can be used in newborns thus monitorize tissue oxygenation regularly. In this study we have
      purposed to compare the effects of general anesthesia versus spinal anesthesia on newborn's
      cerebral and renal oxygenation in elective cesarean operations

      The cases divided into two groups those spinal anesthesia group ( group:1; n:30 ) and general
      anesthesia group (group:2; n:30). The preoperative and intraoperative mean arterial pressures
      (MAP), heart rate (HR), arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO2), intraoperative blood loss
      values of pregnants and 1st-5th minute APGAR scores, preductal and postductal SpO2, perfusion
      index, heart rates, body temperature, cerebral and renal regional oxygen saturations of
      newborns after birth have been recorded.
