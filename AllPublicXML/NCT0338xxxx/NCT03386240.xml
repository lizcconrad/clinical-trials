  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Abdominal closure with antibacterial-coated sutures has been shown to reduce wound infections
      after a number of surgical procedures, but none of the previous trials included cesarean
      delivery. Our objective is to determine whether use of antibacterial-coated sutures reduces
      surgical site infection (SSI) after cesarean delivery.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A review of 18 studies demonstrated a significant benefit of antimicrobial coated sutures in
      reducing SSI (RCTs: OR 0.72; 95% CI 0.59-0.88; observational studies: OR 0.58; 95% CI
      0.40-0.83). As there are no clinical trials focusing on cesarean delivery, and because the
      risk factors and pathogenesis for post-cesarean SSI may not mirror other procedures, further
      data is needed before generalizing the WHO recommendations to cesarean procedures.
