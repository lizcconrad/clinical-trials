  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Asian-Pacific Consensus Report has recommended that proton pump inhibitor
      (PPI)-clarithromycin-amoxicillin or metronidazole treatment for 7 to14 days is the first
      choice treatment for H pylori infection. As a general rule for the treatment of other
      infectious diseases, clinicians should prescribe therapeutic regimens that have a
      per-protocol eradication rate ≥ 90% for anti-H pylori therapy. However, the eradication rate
      of the standard triple therapy has generally declined to unacceptable levels (i.e., 80% or
      less) recently. The reasons for this fall in efficacy with time may relate to the increasing
      incidence of clarithromycin-resistant strains of H. pylori. Clarithromycin resistance is the
      major cause of eradication failure for stand triple therapy. Standard triple therapies should
      be abandoned in the areas with clarithromycin resistance ≥ 20% because the per-protocol
      eradication rates of standard therapies are often less than 85% and the intention-to-treat
      eradication rates are usually less than 80%..7-10 day non-bismuth containing quadruple
      therapy (Concomitant therapy) had been successful in the presence of clarithromycin
      resistance. Another novel treatment with 14-day high dose PPI and amoxicilin dual therapy
      could also attained &gt;90 eradication rate in some studies. This novel treatment is simple and
      involved only two drugs and the most important of all is that amoxicillin resistance is still
      0% in Taiwan . High dose PPI has been used in several studies for H. pylori eradication in
      order to increase the intra-gastric PH for optimal eradication So far, there is still unclear
      which one is the best first-line H. pylori eradication regimen with highest eradication rate
      and least adverse effects. We therefore design a randomized controlled trial to
      simultaneously assess the efficacy novel 14-day high dose dual therapy by comparing to the
      7-day non-bismuth containing quadruple therapy in Taiwan and to investigate the host and
      bacterial factors predicting the treatment outcomes of eradication therapies.

      The Asian-Pacific Consensus Report has recommended that proton pump inhibitor
      (PPI)-clarithromycin-amoxicillin or metronidazole treatment for 7 to14 days is the first

      of the standard triple therapy has generally declined to unacceptable levels (i.e., 80% or
      less) recently.[3-9] The reasons for this fall in efficacy with time may relate to the
      increasing incidence of clarithromycin-resistant strains of H. pylori. The main reasons for
      eradication failure for H pylori infection include antibiotic resistance, poor compliance and
      rapid metabolism of PPI. Clarithromycin resistance is the major cause of eradication failure
      for stand triple therapy. The rate of clarithromycin-resistant strains ranged from 49%
      (Spain) to 1% (Netherland) worldwide. Standard triple therapies should be abandoned in the
      areas with clarithromycin resistance ≥ 20% because the per-protocol eradication rates of
      standard therapies are often less than 85% and the intention-to-treat eradication rates are
      usually less than 80%. 7-10 day non-bismuth containing quadruple therapy (Concomitant
      therapy) had been successful in the presence of clarithromycin resistance. Another novel
