      Objectives:

      Secondary objectives are to investigate the effects of wakame and spirulina consumption on
      fasting markers for lipid metabolism, glucose metabolism and blood pressure.

      Study design:

      This study is a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover intervention trial
      consisting of three intervention periods of 17 days each, separated by a minimum washout
      period of 14 days.

      Study population:

      The study population will consist of 37 healthy, non-hypercholesterolemic men and women aged
      between 18 and 70 years.

      Intervention:

      All subjects will receive wakame, spirulina and placebo capsules in randomized order.
      Subjects will be asked to consume 12 capsules per day for 17 days, which is equal to 4.8
      grams of wakame or spirulina a day.
