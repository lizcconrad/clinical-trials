      -  &quot;Osteopathy&quot; group: 3 osteopathy sessions of 45 min with one session every 3 weeks at
           S2, S5 and S8. Fascial osteopathic techniques performed will consist of gentle and
           non-impulsive manipulation

        -  &quot;Simulated&quot; group: 3 simulated osteopathy sessions lasting 45 minutes, one session every
           3 weeks at S2, S5 and S8. The techniques performed will consist of an application of the
           hands to different anatomical regions than the group &quot;osteopathy&quot; without therapeutic
           intention, that is to say without tissue tensioning.

      The pain will be assessed at inclusion (S0) and at the end of the procedure (S12) by the head
      physician, the coordinating physician or the psychomotor therapist, ignoring the assignment
      group of the subject and before each session. osteopathy (at S2, S5 and S8) by a nurse or
      psychomotor also ignoring the patient's assignment group.

      Both groups will continue to benefit from their usual allopathic management and
      recommendations.

      Patients will not be aware of the treatment received (osteopathy or simulated) and will be
      randomized by a computer server.
