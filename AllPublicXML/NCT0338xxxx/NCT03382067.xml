  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, blind parallel group design. Single intake of 55 g high Epicatechin /Melissa dark
      chocolate containing 160 mg Epicatechin per 55 g serving or single intake of 55 g low
      Epicatechin/ oat bran white chocolate containing &lt; 0,00045 mg Epicatechin per 55 g serving.

      A Total of 128 participants, 64 in each group, approx. equal number of male and female. There
      will be replacement of Drop-Outs until data from 128 participants are completed.

      The primary endpoints will be performance in a pictorial memory task and a verbal memory task
      .

      The secondary endpoints will be performance in a working memory test, Saliva cortisol, Visual
      analog scales assessing, anxiety, confidence, interference, solicitude, and excitement.
