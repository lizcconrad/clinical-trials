             Harmonisation (ICH) M3(R2) is a method that result in a low failure rate of less than

             control must be used before starting Mycophenolate mofetil/Azathioprine (MMF/AZA) and
             the trial drug; then continue during the trial period; and for at least 50 days after

             with AZA the contraception shall continue for 90 days after treatment with AZA.A list
             of contraception methods meeting these criteria is provided in the patient
             information.

             induction therapy (historical data).

          -  Achieved either a CRR or a PRR or proteinuria ≤ 1.5g/d (or UP/UC ≤ 1.5) after at least
             6 months of induction treatment (either with Standard of Care (SOC) (Cyclophosphamide
             (CYC) or MMF-based) or SOC in combination with other available therapies used for
             induction treatment of Lupus Nephritis (LN) e.g. tacrolimus, cyclosporin, experimental
             drug etc.); and within 12 months after initiating induction therapy outside of 1293.10

             patient or the quality of the data. This criterion provides an opportunity for the
             investigator to exclude patients based on clinical judgment, even if other eligibility
             criteria are satisfied.

                  treatment regimen at least 6 months prior to the first administration of study
