  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Particularly in CRT (Cardiac Resynchronisation Therapy), limited accessibility of the
      coronary sinus along with its branches and the mismatch between the region of latest left
      ventricular (LV) contraction and an adequate epimyocardial vein frequently lead to therapy
      failure and might even be responsible for the 30 % non-responders, although this aspect has
      not been thoroughly investigated yet. Further complications such as postoperative micro-
      (i.e. increased thresholds) or macro-dislodgement (i.e. loss of stimulation success) of the
      LV electrodes are frequent complications leading to reoperation or a change of strategy. The
      current transthoracic epimyocardial approach via mini-thoracotomy circumvents the aforesaid
      obstacles and is regarded as the first-choice alternative approach. Participation in the
      trial would prevent patients from this invasive, transthoracic approach and at the same time
      allow the same degree of freedom in lead placement. Risks and complications are in this case
      comparable to the open surgical approach but with a lower risk of intraoperative rib
      fracture, postoperative pain with consecutive pulmonary hypo-ventilation and pneumonia.

      Apart from the benefit of the single individual, societies benefit will include a much higher
      responder rate in CRT patients and less lead-associated infections. Thoracotomy with breach
      of the pleural cavity and single lung ventilation - a procedure that itself bears a high risk
      for postoperative atelectasis, pleural effusion and infection will be avoided.

      In patients on hemo-dialysis and patients who suffer from an infected pacemaker-system,
      extravascular lead placement should be preferred. Again, the current open, transthoracic
      epimyocardial approach via mini-thoracotomy is regarded as the first-choice alternative
      approach.

      Aim of this study is the validation of the feasibility of an alternative, minimal-invasive
      therapy method for implanting a cardiac pacemaker.

      Treatment:

      Video- assisted pericardioscopic surgery for implanting epimyocardial pacemaker leads

      Abridged Operation Protocol:

      10 mm skin incision below the xiphoid process, blunt preparation towards the pericardial sac,
      insertion of the endoscope-carrying trocar, opening of the pericardium with endoscopic
      forceps, standardised inspection of the pericardial cavity, insertion of the bipolar
      Stingray速 electrode via the endoscope working channel into pericardial space, implantation of
      the electrode into designated epimyocardial site under endoscopic vision, pacing measurements
      sensing, impedance, pacing threshold, interventricular delay (in CRT), panoramic fluoroscopy
      for future controls, retraction of the endoscope/trocar, subcutaneous tunnelling and
      connection of the respective electrode to:

        -  existing, infraclavicular CRT device, suture in layers, wound dressing.

        -  a single- or dual-chamber pacemaker device implanted epigastrically, suture in layers,
           wound dressing
