  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, promoting wakening attempts in patients with disorders of consciousness are
      increasing, but there are a lack of objective indicators to evaluate the efficacy and further
      researches on the brain mechanism during the wakening processing. So, the study first
      assessed the cerebral response during emotional acoustic stimuli with quantitative EEG and
      ERP(Event-related potential), and next, the investigators explored the relationship between
      brain activation and patients' recovery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Auditory stimuli have potential beneficial effects on cognitive functions and consciousness
      in patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC)，especially the emotional sound; however,
      precise and accurate quantitative indices to estimate cerebral activation to different
      auditory stimuli remain scarce. In this study, investigators assessed the response of
      different brain regions to three acoustic stimuli using quantitative electroencephalography
      (QEEG) and ERP(Event-related potential),and further investigated the predictive value of QEEG
      in the prognosis of DOC.
