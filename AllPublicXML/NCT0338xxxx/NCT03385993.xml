      D.R.E.A.M.S. will assess an immersive digital reality-augmenting system in reducing the
      occurrence of cognitive, behavioral, and emotional consequences of critical illness and
      environmental exposures that are risk factors for the development of delirium.

      The purpose of Digital Rehabilitation Environment Augmenting Medical System (D.R.E.A.M.S.) is
      to research the feasibility and clinical potential of an immersive digital reality-augmenting
      system in reducing the occurrence of cognitive, behavioral, and emotional consequences of
      critical illness (e.g. pain, anxiety and insomnia) and environmental exposures (noise &amp;
      light) that are risk factors for the development of delirium, a common and devastating
      complication in the intensive care unit (ICU).

Patients with a RASS of 2 to 4 are not sedated enough and should be assessed for pain, anxiety, or delirium. The underlying etiology of the agitation should be investigated and appropriately treated to achieve a RASS of -2 to 0.</description>
