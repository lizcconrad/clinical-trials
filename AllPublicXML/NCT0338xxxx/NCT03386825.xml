    <textblock>
      The aim of this local NIS(Non-Interventional Study) is to determine the proportion of Belgian
      patients with a duration of treatment(DoT) to Stivarga of 4 months or more in relation to the
      total population of Belgian metastatic colorectal cancer(mCRC) patients who were treated with
      Stivarga between the 1st of July 2015 and 31 July 2017. In addition, this study aims to
      describe the clinical characteristics of Belgian patients with a short- or long-term DoT to
      Stivarga.
