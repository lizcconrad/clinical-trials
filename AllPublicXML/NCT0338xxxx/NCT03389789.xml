  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Minor painful procedures are frequently performed on newborn infants and non-pharmacological
      analgesia is commonly used. As more than one analgesic method may be applied simultaneously
      in clinical practice, the relative contribution and efficacy of analgesic components still
      needs to be further elucidated. In the present study neonatal cortical brain response during
      four types of non-pharmacological analgesia (oral glucose, expressed breastmilk, maternal
      holding plus oral glucose, maternal holding plus breastfeeding) will be studied. The aim is
      to assess the differential effect of oral solutions (glucose, breastmilk), when given alone
      or in combination with maternal relationship (holding, breastfeeding). The study will test
      the hypothesis that the mother-infant relationship would improve the analgesic effect of oral
      solutions.

    <measure>Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>During the procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The NIPS assesses 5 behavioral factors (facial expression, cry, arms, legs, and state of arousal) and one physiological factor (breathing patterns), each of which contains two items that are assigned scores of 0 or 1 (except for the crying factor, which comprises three items and is scored on a scale of 0 to 2). The scale yields a total score ranging from 0 to 7, where scores more than 3 are indicative of pain.</description>
