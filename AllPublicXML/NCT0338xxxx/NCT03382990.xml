      The benefit of a drug-eluting stent (DES) in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI)
      is controversial. This study will aim to observe the effect of a DES on the risk of new-onset
      AF in patients with AMI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is the leading cause of mortality in the world. Early
      invasive strategy with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has been demonstrated to be
      the most effective strategy to treat AMI. Although drug-eluting stent (DES) has not shown
      benefits to reduce mortality rate among AMI patients compared with bare-metal stent (BMS),
      the use of DES in real-world is increasing because of reduced restenosis rates. AMI patients
      are at higher risk to develop atrial fibrillation (AF) than general population. However,
      whether early PCI with DES implantation is related to a reduced risk of AF still remains
      unclear. The purpose of this study is to investigate the association of DES implantation and
      the risk of AF among patients with AMI treated by early PCI.

        Within the retrospective cohort, we include patients who had received a primary diagnosis
        of AMI based on the discharge claim between 2007 and 2013. After the exclusion by the
        mentioned criteria, patients with AMI treated with PCI and stent placement are intended to
        be analyzed in the present study.
