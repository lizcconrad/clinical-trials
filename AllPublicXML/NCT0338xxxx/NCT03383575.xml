  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if enasidenib (AG-221) alone or in
      combination with azacitidine can help to control myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The safety
      of this drug will also be studied.

      Any time the words &quot;you,&quot; &quot;your,&quot; &quot;I,&quot; or &quot;me&quot; appear, it is meant to apply to the potential
      participant.

      This is an investigational study. Enasidenib is not FDA approved or commercially available.
      It is currently being used for research purposes only. Azacitidine is FDA approved and
      commercially available for the treatment of MDS. It is considered investigational to give
      enasidenib and azacitidine in combination for the treatment of MDS. The study doctor can
      explain how the study drug(s) are designed to work.

      Up to 105 participants will be enrolled in this multicenter study. Up to 75 will take part at
      MD Anderson.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to 1 of 2
      study groups based on the status of your disease and the treatment you may have received in
      the past.

        -  If you have never received a hypomethylating drug (such as azacitidine or decitabine),
           you will be assigned to Arm A.

        -  If you have received a hypomethylating drug (such as azacitidine or decitabine) and you
           have relapsed (has come back) or refractory (has not responded to treatment) MDS, you
           will be assigned to Arm B.

      Participants in Arm A will receive azacitidine and enasidenib.

      Participants in Arm B will receive enasidenib alone.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each study cycle is 28 days.

      If you are in Arm A, you will receive azacitidine by vein over about 30-60 minutes on Days
      1-7 of every cycle. If needed, you may be given azacitidine as an injection under the skin.
      If you are receiving azacitidine at a clinic that closes over the weekend, alternate dosing
      schedules (such as receiving azacitidine on Days 1-5 and 8-9 of each cycle) are possible.

      All participants will take enasidenib tablets by mouth with a cup (about 8 ounces) of water
      at the same time every day. You should swallow the tablets whole without chewing them. You
      should fast (not have anything to eat or drink except water) for 2 hours before and 1 hour
      after each dose.

      If you miss your dose, you can still take it as long as it is within 6 hours of your
      scheduled dose time. If more than 6 hours have passed, you should skip that dose and wait to
      take the next dose at the normal time the next day.

      Length of Treatment:

      You may continue taking the study drug(s) for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug(s) if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of Cycle 1, you will have the following procedures. You should fast before this
      visit, so do not eat breakfast until the study staff tells you that you can eat. You may have
      water during this time. You will take your dose of enasidenib during your clinic visit:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine, pharmacokinetic (PK), and biomarker
           testing, which may include genetic biomarkers. Biomarkers are found in the blood/tissue
           and may be related to your reaction to the study drug. PK testing measures the amount of
           study drug in the body at different time points.

        -  You will have a bone marrow aspirate/biopsy for biomarker testing.

      On Days 8, 15, and 22 (+/- 3 days) of Cycle 1:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      On Day 1 (+/- 5 days) of Cycle 2 and beyond, you will have the following procedures. During
      Cycles 2 and 3 only, you should take your dose of enasidenib during your clinic visit:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine and biomarker testing.

        -  During Cycle 2 only, you will have a bone marrow biopsy/aspirate to check the status of
           the disease and for biomarker and pharmacodynamic (PD) testing. PD testing measures how
           the level of study drug in your body may affect the disease.

        -  During Cycles 2 and 3 only, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for PK testing
           before your dose of study drug. During Cycle 2, blood will also be drawn 4 times over
           the 8 hours after the dose. During Cycle 3, blood will also be drawn about 4 hours after
           the dose.

      On Day 1 (+/- 5 days) of Cycle 4, 6, and every 3 cycles after that (Cycle 9, 12, 15, and so
      on), you will have a bone marrow biopsy/aspirate for biomarker testing, PD testing, and to
      check the status of the disease.

      End-of-Study Visit:

      Within 28 days of your last dose of study drug(s):

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine testing.

        -  You will have an EKG.

        -  If the disease appears to be getting worse or returns, you will have a bone marrow
           aspirate/biopsy for biomarker and PD testing.

        -  If you are able to become pregnant, blood (about 1 tablespoon) or urine will be
           collected for a pregnancy test.

      Long-Term Follow-Up:

      Every 3 months for up to 3 years after the last patient enrolls on this study, a member of
      the study staff will call and ask you how you are doing and if you have started any new
      anti-cancer treatments. This phone call should last about 5 minutes.
