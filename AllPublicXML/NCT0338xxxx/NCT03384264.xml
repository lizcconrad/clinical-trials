  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to analyze the effects of a 12-week suspension exercise training programme
      on handgrip strength (HG) and anthropometric and bioelectrical impedance parameters in older
      adults.

    <description>The suspension device was securely attached to a fixed beam. The suspension programme included an initial 10 min warm-up with very low-intensity joint mobility exercises. The central part of the program had a duration of 40 min and included six exercises in which the level of intensity was based on the inclination of the body. The exercises were performed in a split routine, alternating by segment to prevent joint overload. Finally, participants performed 10 minutes of stretching.</description>
