      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and serum concentrations of a human
      monoclonal antibody, VRC-HIVMAB075-00-AB (VRC07-523LS), administered in multiple doses and
      routes to healthy, HIV-uninfected adults.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of six groups. Participants in Group 1 will
      receive 2.5 mg/kg of VRC07-523LS by intravenous (IV) infusion at Weeks 0, 16, 32, 48, and 64.
      Participants in Group 2 will receive 5 mg/kg of VRC07-523LS by IV infusion at Weeks 0, 16,
      32, 48, and 64. Participants in Group 3 will receive 20 mg/kg of VRC07-523LS by IV infusion
      at Weeks 0, 16, 32, 48, and 64. Participants in Group 4 will receive 2.5 mg/kg of VRC07-523LS
      by subcutaneous (SC) injection at Weeks 0, 16, 32, 48, and 64. Participants in Group 5 will
      receive 5 mg/kg of VRC07-523LS by SC injection at Weeks 0, 16, 32, 48, and 64. Participants
      in Group 6 will receive 2.5 mg/kg of VRC07-523LS or placebo by intramuscular (IM) injection
      at Weeks 0, 16, 32, 48, and 64.

      Participants will attend numerous study visits throughout the course of the study, beginning
      at Week 0 through Week 112. Visits may include physical examinations, blood and urine
      collection, HIV testing, risk reduction counseling, and questionnaires.

                  140 mm Hg systolic and less than or equal to 90 mm Hg diastolic, with or without
                  medication, with only isolated, brief instances of higher readings, which must be
                  less than or equal to 150 mm Hg systolic and less than or equal to 100 mm Hg
                  diastolic. For these volunteers, blood pressure must be less than or equal to 140
                  mm Hg systolic and less than or equal to 90 mm Hg diastolic at enrollment.

               -  If a person has NOT been found to have elevated blood pressure or hypertension
                  during screening or previously, exclude for systolic blood pressure greater than
                  or equal to 150 mm Hg at enrollment or diastolic blood pressure greater than or
                  equal to 100 mm Hg at enrollment.

          -  Bleeding disorder diagnosed by a doctor (eg, factor deficiency, coagulopathy, or

          -  Malignancy (Not excluded from participation: Volunteer who has had malignancy excised
             surgically and who, in the investigator's estimation, has a reasonable assurance of
             sustained cure, or who is unlikely to experience recurrence of malignancy during the
             period of the study)

          -  Seizure disorder: History of seizure(s) within past three years. Also exclude if
             volunteer has used medications in order to prevent or treat seizure(s) at any time
             within the past 3 years.
