    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic
      profile of HB002.1M, a human immunoglobulin Fc fusion protein containing domain 2 and
      flanking sequence of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor-1 in subjects with
      age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
