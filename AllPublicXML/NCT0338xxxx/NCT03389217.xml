  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is a common symptom experienced by people with MS and can significantly interfere with
      participation in the activities of daily living and adversely affect health-related quality
      of life. Pain in people with MS has the potential to become chronic, as a consequence of
      neuronal reorganization. Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) promotes the
      modulation of brain activity and its prolonged and continuous application can effect plastic
      modification. Combining tDCS with rehabilitation treatment may have effect in reducing pain
      in people with MS. This is a pilot randomized control trial to test the effects of tDCS in
      MS-related pain rehabilitation, its efficacy on pain (intensity, quality, interference with
      physical functioning), catastrophizing, emotional functioning and quality of life.
      Furthermore, we will explore the effects on pressure pain threshold and EEG recording.
      Correlations between sample characteristics and pain features will be investigated.
      Considering role of tDCS on neuropsychological functions, selective attention will be
      assessed.

    <intervention_name>Real-tDCS + rehabilitation programme</intervention_name>
    <description>tDCS stimulation will be delivered using a constant current stimulator, with rechargeable batteries. The active electrode will be placed on the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the reference electrode will be placed over the controlateral supraorbital region. The direct current will be delivered through a pair of sponge electrodes with a surface of 35 cm2 (7 × 5), soaked in saline solution. This continuous stimulation will last 30 minutes, with an intensity of 1 mA. Rehabilitation programme will last for 30 minutes and includes specific exercises for prevention and management of pain. All the subjects enrolled will receive treatments for 4 weeks. During the first week the experimental group underwent tDCS daily (Monday-Friday) and rehabilitation programme 3 days per week. tDCS will be delivered before rehabilitation treatment. During the second, third and fourth week subjects will receive only rehabilitation treatment, 3 days per week.</description>

    <description>The control group will receive the same protocol treatment but they underwent sham-tDCS during the first week of treatment. For sham condition tDCS, current was delivered for only 30 seconds and then the current was discontinued, but the tDCS apparatus was left in place for the same time as active tDCS (30 minutes)</description>
