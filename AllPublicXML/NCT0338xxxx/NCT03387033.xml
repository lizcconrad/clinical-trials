  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and cancer often have complicated courses while
      hospitalized and often deal with pain, anxiety and depression. Advances in the field of
      technology provide potential avenues for innovative and improved care models for our
      patients. Virtual reality (VR) has been recently utilized to improve anxiety and pain in a
      variety of patient populations including children undergoing elective surgery and children
      experiencing intravenous cannulation in the Emergency Department. Patients with SCD and
      cancer, both adults and children, are a group of patients that can benefit from VR as part of
      their care. Over the past four years, our team has successfully implemented several
      self-developed mobile applications (&quot;apps&quot;) for our patients, in addition to integrating
      objective data (heart rate, activity, stress) from wearable activity trackers. The
      investigators now propose implementing a feasibility study followed by a pilot study and
      randomized-controlled trial of the use of VR in patients with SCD and cancer. The
      investigators plan to assess pain and anxiety prior to the session as well as following the
      session in hospitalized patients and outpatients with SCD and cancer. The sessions will
      include a ten-minute relaxation response introductory narrative segment (deep breathing and
      mindfulness) followed by a ten-minute narrated and immersive VR. Heart rate will be tracked
      using an Apple iWatch for 30 minutes prior to the session, during the session, and following
      the session. We anticipate VR will not only be a feasible method to provide non-pharmacologic
      treatment, but will also significantly reduce pain and anxiety.

  <detailed_description>

      The investigators will perform a feasibility and pilot study evaluating relaxation response
      (narration leading through deep-breathing, mindfulness, and other relaxation techniques)
      followed by VR in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and caner. The VR headset (NeuTab
      VR Virtual Reality Headset, Dynamic Virtual Viewer, or similar device) used will be
      compatible with an iPhone purchased by the PI. The VR session will be narrated by Jon
      Seskevich, RN. Patients will be provided with a second iPhone to play the recording while the
      other iPhone is used to display the VR session.

      The patients will first be provided a consent form and consented. They will have the
      opportunity to ask questions prior to and following consent. They will subsequently give a
      pain score and fill out a GAD-7 (Generalized Anxiety Disorder) and PHQ-9 (Patient Health
      Questionnaire) form. They will be taught how to use the VR headset. Patients will listen to a
      recording by Jon Seskevich, RN of a ten-minute relaxation response. An iPhone will then be
      placed in the VR headset, the recording started, and the headset placed on the patient. The
      VR scene is available through Provata VR app and has been previously chosen prior to the
      start of the study. Following this, patients will again give a pain score as well as complete
      another GAD-7, PHQ-9, Presence Questionnaire, and Patient's Global Impression of Change
      (PGIC) form. Patients will be asked to fill out pain score and general health questions via
      the TRU-Pain app. Patients will then be able to ask questions/provide further feedback.
