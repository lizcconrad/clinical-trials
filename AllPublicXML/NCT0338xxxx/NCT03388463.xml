  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Upper gastrointestinal (GIT) bleeding is common in high risk critically ill patients.
      Hyperacidity has been identified as one of the main reasons for bleeding.1 2 Antacids with
      different treatment modalities have been studied to establish the best regimen for
      prophylaxis against bleeding.3 4 Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) are the most common drugs used
      in the medical field as antacids. The present study was carried out to investigate the
      beneficial effects of high dose omeprazole versus standard low dose as a prophylaxis against
      upper GIT bleeding in high risk critically ill patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A hundred and ten high risk critically ill patients were divided into two groups, fify five
      patients each. Group A received intravenous (IV) omeprazole 40mg bolus dose once daily
      followed by normal saline infusion. Group B received IV bolus of 80 mg omeprazole followed by
      8mg/h infusion. The treatment was for the whole period of ICU stay. Gastric pH, residual
      gastric volume, signs of significant upper GIT bleeding, ICU stay Hb, number of ventilator
      free days, ICU stay haemoglobin (Hb), number of red cell units transfused in ICU, ICU stay,
      and numbers of ICU survivors were recorded.
