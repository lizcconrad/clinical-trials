  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To better define the clinical characteristics of oromandibular dystonia, we aimed to study
      voice, speech and swallowing disorders in idiopathic oromandibular We planned to include
      consecutive patients followed in Lille Movement disorders department for idiopathic
      oromandibular dystonia and matched, healthy control subjects. Voice and speech disorders had
      to be assessed with the phonetic analysis, perceptive analysis and motor examination modules
      of the &quot;Batterie d'Evaluation Clinique de la Dysarthrie&quot; (Clinical Evaluation of Dysarthria),
      the Grade, Rough, Breathy, Asthenic, Strained scale, and a computer recording. Activities of
      daily living had to be assessed with the Oromandibular Dystonia Questionnaire, the Voice
      Handicap Index and the Deglutition Handicap Index.
