  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to investigate the clinical effectiveness of the Sponsor's experimental cream
      treatment on eczema as measured by visual grading of SCORAD (scoring of atopic dermatitis).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a 9-week, randomized, double blind, parallel comparison study consisting of a
      1-week washout phase followed by an 8-week treatment phase. This study will be executed by
      one clinical research company utilizing two test sites and up to 62 subjects with moderate or
      severe atopic dermatitis, ages 12-65, will be enrolled. Subjects that are enrolled will be
      placed on one of three products (e.g. Sponsor's Experimental Cream Treatment, a basic
      moisturizer, or a positive control - Desonide) and will be required to use the assigned
      product twice a day for the duration of the 8-week treatment phase.

    <measure>Severity Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>SCORAD (Severity Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis) Change from Baseline to Week 8 of atopic dermatitis lesion as measured by the Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD). SCORAD is a composite severity index comprising a) the amount/extent of body area affected; b) 2 subjective symptom visual analog assessments [Itchy 0 (No Itching) to 3 (Severe Itching) and Sleep Disturbance 0 (No Sleep Disturbance) to 3 (Severe Sleep Disturbance)]; and c) 6 disease intensity assessments [Dryness/Scaling, Erythema, Excoriation, Induration/Papulation, Lichenification and Oozing/Weeping/Crusting, each graded from 0 (None) to 3 (Severe). A SCORAD score ranges from 0 (No AD present) to 103 (Severe) SCORAD is calculated:
Extent 7*Intensity SCORAD = --------- + ---------------- + Subjective 5 2</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Change from Baseline to Week 8 of atopic dermatitis lesion as measured by The Physician's Global Assessment (PGA). The PGA is a severity index for dermatological conditions based on a five point scale from 0 (Clear) to 4 (Severe). The physician assesses severity on primary and secondary lesions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Change from Baseline to Week 8 of atopic dermatitis lesion as measured by The Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI). The EASI is a composite severity index for eczema comprising a) the extent of the body area affected across four body regions (head &amp; neck, trunk, lower extremities, and upper extremities) each graded from 0 (0% affected) to 6 (100% affected) and b) disease severity assessments (Erythema, Lichenification, Edema/Papulation, and Excoriation) each graded from 0 (None) to 3 (Severe). An EASI score ranges from 0 (No Eczema present) to 72 (Severe).</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Improvement</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Condition improvement from Baseline to Week 8 as measured by the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). The DLQI is a ten question questionnaire to measure the impact of skin disease on the quality of life for the affected person. Each question is measured on a scale of 0 (no impact) to 3 (large impact). The total score range is 0 (no impact) to 30 (maximum impact).</description>
