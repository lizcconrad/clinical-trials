  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-invasive respiratory support has been emerging in the management of respiratory distress
      syndrome (RDS) in preterm infants to minimise the risk of lung injury. Intermittent positive
      pressure ventilation (NIPPV) provides a method of augmenting continuous positive airway
      pressure (CPAP) by delivering ventilator breaths via nasal prongs.It may increase tidal
      volume, improve gas exchange and reduce work of breathing. However, NIPPV may associate with
      patient-ventilator asynchrony that can cause poor tolerance and risk of intubation. It may
      also in increased risk of pneumothorax and bowel perforation because of increase in
      intrathoracic pressure.

      On the other hand, neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) is a newer mode of
      ventilation, which has the potential to overcome these challenges. It uses the electrical
      activity of the diaphragm (EAdi) as a signal to synchronise the mechanical ventilatory
      breaths and deliver an inspiratory pressure based on this electrical activity. Comparing
      NI-NAVA and NIPPV in preterm infants, has shown that NI-NAVA improved the synchronization
      between patient and ventilator and decreased diaphragm work of breathing .

      There is lack of data on the use of NI-NAVA in neonates post extubation in the literature. To
      date, no study has focused on short-term impacts. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the
      need of additional ventilatory support post extubation of NI-NAVA and NIPPV and also the risk
      of developing adverse outcomes.

      Aim:

      The aim is to compare NI-NAVA &amp; NIPPV in terms of extubation failure in infants&lt; 32 weeks
      gestation.

      Hypothesis:

      Investigators hypothesized that infants born prematurely &lt; 32 weeks gestation who extubated
      to NI-NAVA have a lower risk of extubation failure and need of additional ventilatory
      support.
