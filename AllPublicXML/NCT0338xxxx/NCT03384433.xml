      Administration of cell-free exosomes derived from mesenchymal stem cell (MSCs) can be
      sufficient to exert therapeutic effects of intact MSCs after brain injury. In this study we
      aim to assay the administration of MSC derived exosome enriched by miR-124 on improvemen of
      disability of patients with acute ischemic stroke

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exosomes derived from multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) promote neurovascular
      remodeling and functional recovery after stroke. Animal study has shown that Exosome
      treatment markedly increased the number of newly formed doublecortin (a marker of
      neuroblasts) and von Willebrand factor (a marker of endothelial cells) cells. Based on
      previous literature, intravenous administration of MSC-generated exosomes post stroke
      improves functional recovery and enhances neurite remodeling, neurogenesis, and angiogenesis
      and represents a novel treatment for stroke. Also some studies have presented which
      miR-124-Loaded Exosomes ameliorate the brain Injury by promoting neurogenesis. So in present
      research we aim to assess improving of patients with acute ischemic stroke who received MSC
      derived exosome enriched by miR-124
