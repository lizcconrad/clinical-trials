  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this pilot project is to test the hypothesis that a decline in muscle
      strength precedes the decline in bone strength in men undergoing androgen deprivation therapy
      (ADT) for prostate cancer. The investigators will measure changes in serum biomarkers
      involved in muscle-bone crosstalk, anatomic changes in muscle and bone structure and strength
      that could ultimately contribute to fractures. The findings from this research will inform
      design of interventions to reduce falls and hip fractures in patients undergoing ADT as well
      as application to broader populations of at risk patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty-five men from urology clinic with prostate cancer will be recruited and enrolled prior
      to initiating ADT and studied at three time points. Baseline (before first does of ADT), and
      at approximately weeks 6 and 24 while receiving ADT for prostate cancer. Study measures will
      be the same during each of three data acquisition time points and include ascertainment of
      venous blood to determine serum biochemical markers of muscle and bone metabolic activity,
      MRI and CT imaging studies to assess muscle strength, volume, composition, bone volume,
      density and strength, and validated tests of muscle strength. Subjects will serve as their
      own controls.
