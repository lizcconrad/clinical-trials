  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Is the ability to perceive motion altered by diabetes? The investigators are measuring motion
      perception using a technique called vestibular thresholds. Subjects will undergo 3 hours of
      testing in which they sit in a chair that makes small movements and report their perception
      of motion. The investigators are currently looking for individuals who have had type 2
      diabetes for at least 10 years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have found that individuals with diabetes fall more frequently, have less
      stable posture, and have reduced motion and touch sensation in the lower extremities. This
      study will examine whether vestibular sensation is also affected by diabetes.

      This study is observational because measurements will be made without the application of an
      intervention. The same measurement protocol was applied to a large group of normal subjects,
      and this published data will serve as normative controls.

    <description>Vestibular thresholds are measured while subjects sit in a chair that makes small motions in a variety of directions. After each motion, subjects press a button to report their perceived direction (e.g., did I rotate to the left or the right). The size of the motions is adjusted based on subject responses to find the level at which they get approximately 80% of responses correct.</description>

    <description>This is an observational study in which we will quantify vestibular thresholds in individuals who have had type 2 diabetes for at least 10 years. Normative data has recently been published and subjects with diabetes will be compared to a model that includes age effects.</description>

          -  Medications not to be used include: Ambien (Zolpidem), Antivert, Bonine (Meclizine),
             Ativan (Lorazepam), Benadryl (diphenhydramine), Dalmane (Flurazepam), Dramamine, Doral
             (Quazepam), Fiorinal, Fiorcet (Butalbital), Halcion (Triazolam), Klonopin

          -  Individuals meeting the following criteria will be excluded: a) a history of head
             trauma, b) posterior fossa pathology, c) a well-defined otologic diagnosis (e.g.,
             Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV), Meniere's disease, superior canal
             dehiscence, etc., unilateral or bilateral vestibular hypofunction) d) a recent history

             other severe health problem (heart disease, pulmonary disease, cancer, etc.).

          -  Due to nauseogenic nature of some motions and to protect fetus and mother, pregnant
             women will also be excluded from this study.
