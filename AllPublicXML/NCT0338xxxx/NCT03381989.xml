      Background:

      TAVR is a common therapy for people with heart problems. It stands for transcatheter aortic
      valve replacement, TAVR can be a better option than surgery. But it isn t safe for everyone.
      It may block the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle by pushing heart valve tissue
      outward. Researchers want to study a method that may make TAVR safer. It is known as
      Bioprosthetic or native Aortic Scallop Intentional Laceration to prevent Iatrogenic Coronary
      Artery obstruction (BASILICA).

      Objective:

      To study the feasibility and safety of BASILICA in people at high risk of coronary artery
      obstruction that complicates TAVR.

      Eligibility:

      People at least 21 years old whose heart doctors do not think they can have TAVR safely

      Design:

      Participants will be screened by a team of heart specialists. They will have heart and blood
      tests. They will answer questions.

      Participants will have TAVR using BASILICA.

      They will get general anesthesia or they will be sedated.

      While using x-rays and ultrasound, doctors will cross and split the aortic valve leaflet with
      tubes and wires.

      A standard TAVR valve will be implanted. Coronary artery stents (metal tubes) will also be
      inserted.

      After the procedure, participants will have blood tests and physical exams. They will answer
      questions. They will have heart tests.

      Participants will have a scan within 1 month and after 12 months. They will have heart tests
      during follow-up visits in the first year.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is an option to treat aortic valve stenosis or
      failure of a surgically implanted tissue valve. Sometimes TAVR displaces the diseased aortic
      valve leaflets outwards, causing life-threatening obstruction of the coronary arteries that
      supply blood to the heart. This is more common in surgically implanted tissue valves that are
      designed to achieve the largest aortic valve orifice area. Despite attempts to protect the
      coronary arteries from obstruction in these patients using coronary stents, the mortality of
      TAVR-associated coronary artery obstruction remains prohibitively high.

      The investigators have developed and tested a technique to tear the existing aortic valve
      leaflet and enable TAVR in such patients. The procedure is called Bioprosthetic or native
      Aortic Scallop Intentional Laceration to prevent Iatrogenic Coronary Artery obstruction
      (BASILICA).

      The purpose of this study is to perform BASILICA in patients who have no good options to
      prevent coronary artery obstruction during TAVR.

    <description>The BASILICA procedure has three steps: (1) leaflet traversal with a guidewire, followed by (2) leaflet laceration, immediately followed by (3) TAVR.Laceration of the aortic valve leaflet using electrosurgery energy.</description>

    <intervention_name>ASHI_INTECC Astato XS 20 0.014 guidewire</intervention_name>
    <description>A coaxial traversal guiding catheter system (typically tandem catheters) directs electrosurgery devices (typically a rigid 0.014 guidewire inside a polymer jacket wire convertor) against the base of the coronary cusp targeted for laceration, using fluoroscopic and/or echocardiographic guidance. Traversal is accomplished by transcatheter electrosurgery by connecting the back end of the 0.014 guidewire to an electrosurgery pencil during short bursts of pure, cutting radiofrequency energy at ap-proximately 30W. The guidewire is repositioned as needed until it crosses the aortic leaflet and is snare-retrieved and externalized. Laceration is performed by positioning the laceration surface along the intended leaflet base, and applying tension on both free ends of the guidewire while simultaneously apply electrosurgery energy (typically 70W) in short bursts, until the laceration is complete and the guidewire is free.</description>
