    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the fluoride dose response of different dentifrice
      fluoride concentrations - 0, 250, 500 and 1100 ppm fluoride of our existing in situ model
      involving the use of human enamel specimens placed in the buccal flange area of the subjects
      partial denture with the modified model involving placement of bovine enamel specimens in a
      denture tooth location.

      This will be a double blind, single center, 4-way crossover design study involving 34 adult
      subjects, between the ages of 18 and 85 years. Two to three days before the start of each
      treatment period the subjects will have their teeth cleaned to remove all accessible plaque
      and calculus and will be provided with a non-fluoride dentifrice to use until their next
      visit. At the beginning of each testing period, two gauze-covered 4 × 4 mm partially
      demineralized human enamel specimens will be placed in the buccal flange area of the
      subject's mandibular partial denture. In addition, two gauze-covered 4 mm round partially
      demineralized bovine enamel specimens will be placed in the buccal surface of two posterior
      denture teeth of the same side of the partial denture. Once specimens are placed, subjects
      will wear their partial dentures twenty-four hours a day and use their assigned toothpaste
      twice daily, as instructed, until their next visit. Specimens will be removed after two weeks
      and the subjects will undergo a four to five day washout period followed by another cleaning
      and two to three day lead in period. This process will be repeated until all subjects have
      used all four test products. Changes in the mineral content of the enamel specimens will be
      assessed using the SMH and TMR. Enamel fluoride uptake (EFU) will be determined using the
      microdrill enamel biopsy technique. In addition the net acid resistance (NAR) and the
      comparative acid resistance (CAR) of the remineralized enamel specimens will be determined.

    <measure>%Surface Microhardness Recovery (%SMH)</measure>
    <time_frame>Enamel specimens will be evaluated after 14 days of intra-oral exposure</time_frame>
    <description>The extent of remineralization will be calculated based on the method of [Gelhard et al., 1979].
SMH recovery = (D1-R)/(D1-B) ×100 B = indentation length (µm) of sound enamel specimen at baseline D1 = indentation length (µm) after in vitro demineralization R = indentation length (µm) after intra-oral exposure.</description>

    <time_frame>Enamel specimens will be evaluated after 14 days of intra-oral exposure</time_frame>
    <description>The amount of fluoride-uptake by enamel will be calculated based on the amount of fluoride divided by the area of the enamel cores and expressed as µg F/cm2.</description>

    <measure>Transverse Microradiography (TMR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Enamel specimens will be evaluated after 14 days of intra-oral exposure</time_frame>
    <description>Lesions will be analyzed after in situ demineralization and the following three parameters calculated:
Integrated Mineral Loss - ∆Z= [(lesion depth x 87) - area under the curve*]
Lesion Depth - L (83% mineral i.e. 95% of the mineral content of sound enamel)
Maximum mineral density at the surface-zone - SZmax</description>

    <measure>Net Acid Resistance (NAR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Enamel specimens will be evaluated after 14 days of intra-oral exposure</time_frame>
    <description>The %NAR will be calculated by the method of Corpron [Corpron et al., 1986]:
Net Acid Resistance = [(D1-D2) / (D1-B)] * 100 B= Indentation length (µm) of sound enamel at baseline D1= Indentation length (µm) after first in vitro demineralization D2= Indentation length (µm) after second in vitro demineralization</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparative Acid Resistance (CAR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Enamel specimens will be evaluated after 14 days of intra-oral exposure</time_frame>
    <description>Using the data from the four centrally located enamel specimens, the equation used will compare explicitly the reduction in SMH brought by the first and second acid challenges:
Comparative Acid Resistance = [(D2-R) / (D1-B)] * 100 B= Indentation length (µm) of sound enamel at baseline R= Indentation length (µm) of enamel after in situ remineralization D1= Indentation length (µm) after first in vitro demineralization D2= Indentation length (µm) after second in vitro demineralization</description>
