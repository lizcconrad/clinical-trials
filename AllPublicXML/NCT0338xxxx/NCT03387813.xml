      The GUIDE-HF IDE clinical trial is intended to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
      CardioMEMS™ HF System in an expanded patient population including HF patients outside of the
      present indication, but at risk for future HF events or mortality.

      The trial includes patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II, III, or IV HF
      who have an elevated N-terminal pro-Brain Natriuretic Peptide (NT-proBNP) (or an elevated
      Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP)) and/or a prior HF hospitalization (HFH).

      The GUIDE-HF IDE trial will include approximately 3600 subjects at approximately 140 North
      American sites and consists of two arms: a Randomized Arm and a Single Arm.

        Inclusion Criteria:

             a. Subjects should be on stable, optimally titrated medical therapy for at least 30
             days, as recommended according to current American Heart Association (AHA)/American
             College of Cardiology (ACC) guidelines as standard-of-care for HF therapy in the
             United States, with any intolerance documented.

          2. GUIDE-HF Randomized Arm Only: NYHA Class II, III or IV HF symptoms documented within
             30 days prior to consent.

             to consent.

          4. HF hospitalization (HFH) within 12 months prior to consent and/or elevated N-terminal
             pro-Brain Natriuretic Peptide (NT-proBNP) (or Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP)) within
             30 days prior to consent defined as:

             implantation of the CardioMEMS™ PA Sensor

          8. Implanted with mechanical right heart valve(s)

          9. Unrepaired severe valvular disease

         10. Pregnant or planning to become pregnant in the next 12 months

         11. An active, ongoing infection, defined as being febrile, an elevated white blood cell
             count, on intravenous antibiotics, and/or positive cultures (blood, sputum or urine).

         12. History of current or recurrent (≥ 2 episodes) pulmonary emboli and/or deep vein
             thromboses

         13. Major cardiovascular event (e.g., unstable angina, myocardial infarction, percutaneous
             coronary intervention, open heart surgery, or stroke, etc.) within 90 days prior to
             consent

         14. Implanted with Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT)-Pacemaker (CRT-P) or
             CRT-Defibrillator (CRT-D) for less than 90 days prior to consent

         16. Anticipated life expectancy of &lt; 12 months

         17. Any condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would not allow for
             utilization of the CardioMEMS™ HF System to manage the subject using information
             gained from hemodynamic measurements to adjust medications, including the presence of
             unexpectedly severe pulmonary hypertension (e.g., trans-pulmonary gradient &gt;15) at
             implant right heart catheterization (RHC), a history of non-compliance, or any
             condition that would preclude CardioMEMS™ PA Sensor implantation
