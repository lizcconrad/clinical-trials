  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Screening colonoscopy for colorectal cancer is essential to diagnose and remove adenomas,
      precancerous stages of colorectal cancer. Unfortunately approximately 25 % of all adenomas
      are missed during the examination. Recently a new colonoscopy accessory, the Endorings-2
      (EndoAid Ltd., Casearea, Israel), has been designed to improved the detection of adenomas
      during colonoscopy (adenoma detection rate).

      Endorings-2 is a silicone-rubber device that is fitted on the colonoscope and is equipped
      with circular flexible silicon rings mechanically stretching the colonic folds during
      withdrawal.

      This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of Endorings-2 to improve the adenoma detection rate
      in a prospective, blinded clinical trial. 292 patients with an indication for a screening
      colonoscopy shall be included (1:1 randomization in standard colonoscopy versus
      Endorings-2-assisted colonoscopy).
