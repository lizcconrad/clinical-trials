  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Both macitentan and riociguat are indicated in the treatment of pulmonary arterial
      hypertension (PAH) and may be administered concomitantly. The primary objective of this study
      is to evaluate the effect of macitentan administered for 11 days on the pharmacokinetics (PK)
      (i.e., amount and time of presence in the blood of riociguat) of a single dose of riociguat
      in healthy male subjects.
