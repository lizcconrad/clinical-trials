    <intervention_model_description>This is a Phase 1 study of MORAb-202 in participants with solid tumors. This study will be conducted in 2 parts (Part 1 and Part 2). Part 1 will be the dose escalation portion of this study to evaluate dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of MORAb-202 in participants with solid tumors. Considering efficacy, safety, and the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile, one dose may be selected from Part 1 for Part 2. Part 2 will comprise cohort expansions to further characterize the safety of MORAb-202 and to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of MORAb-202 in participants with folate receptor α (FRA)-positive triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and Type 2 endometrial carcinoma. The recommended dose for future studies will be determined based on the data from Part 1 and Part 2.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The following toxicities developed in Cycle 1 and causal relationship with MORAb-202 cannot be ruled out are regarded as DLTs: 1) febrile neutropenia; 2) Grade 4 neutropenia that persists for more than 7 days or that requires hematopoietic-stimulating agents; 3) Grade 4 thrombocytopenia, or thrombocytopenia that requires platelet transfusion; 4) Grade 4 anemia or anemia that requires blood transfusion; 5) any Grade 3 non-hematological toxicity with the exception of: a) abnormal clinical laboratory values with no clinical significance; b) any events that can be managed and controlled to Grade 2 or less by maximal medical management; c) infusion reactions of Grade 3 or higher are not considered DLTs because they are stochastic and idiosyncratic events, not related to dose; 6) any Grade 4 non-hematologic toxicity; 7) development of any toxicity that is considered to be related to MORAb-202 and where dose at C2D1 is necessary to postpone for over 14 days for recovery from the toxicities.</description>

    <description>Part 1 (Dose-escalation): The initial dose level of MORAb-202 will be 0.3 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) every 3 weeks in the first cohort with 1 participant for dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) evaluation. DLTs will be evaluated in successive dose level cohorts with a single participant until a drug-related Grade 2 or higher toxicity is observed. If such a toxicity is observed, the cohort will be expanded to enroll a total of 3 participants.
Part 2 (Treatment Phase): MORAb-202 will be administered every 3 weeks during the treatment phase at the dose determined in Part 1 until participants meet any of the criteria for discontinuation. Criteria for discontinuation include: withdrawal of consent, major protocol violations, unable to continue due to adverse events, pregnancy, progressive disease, Investigator decision, or infusion reactions.</description>
