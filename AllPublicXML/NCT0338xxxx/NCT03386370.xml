      To evaluate, in a controlled setting, the early safety and effectiveness of the
      Penumbra/Indigo aspiration thrombectomy Systems (San Francisco, California), and to define
      optimal technique for the use of these systems in patients with confirmed peripheral acute
      occlusions.

    <measure>Technical success of the thromboaspiration with the Indigo system.</measure>
    <time_frame>At intra-procedural completion angiography</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint of the study is the technical success of the thromboaspiration with the Indigo system. Assessment of vessel patency will be recorded using the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) score classifications both before and after use of the device.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical success at 1 month follow-up.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical success at follow-up is defined as an improvement of Rutherford classification at 1-month follow-up of one class or more as compared to the pre-procedure Rutherford classification.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety Rate at discharge: Serious adverse event.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Safety rate at discharge, defined as absence of any serious adverse events (SAE). A SAE is defined as any clinical event that is fatal, life-threatening, or judged to be severe by the investigator; resulted in persistent or significant disability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Primary Patency</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Primary patency at 1 month. Primary patency is defined as a target lesion without a hemodynamically significant stenosis/reocclusion on duplex ultrasound (&gt;50%,) and without target lesion reintervention (TLR) within 1 month.</description>

      <textblock>
        Patients will be selected based on the investigator's assessment and evaluation of the
        underlying disease.

        The patient's medical condition should be stable, with no underlying medical condition that
        would prevent them from performing the required testing or from completing the study.

        Patients should be geographically stable, willing and able to cooperate in this clinical
        study, and remain available for mid term follow-up. Patients who do not wish to participate
        in this study can obtain any other standard commercially available device therapy. Refusal
        to participate in this study will in no way affect their care at the institution.

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Patient presenting with an acute occlusion of lower limb arteries (thrombosis no
             longer than 14 days)

          -  Patient presenting a score from I to IIb following Rutherford classification for acute
             limb ischemia

          -  Patient is willing to comply with specified follow-up evaluations at the specified
             times for the duration of the study

          -  Patient is &gt;18 years old

          -  Patient (or their legal representative) understands the nature of the procedure and
             provides written informed consent, prior to enrolment in the study

          -  Patient is eligible for treatment with the Indigo System (Penumbra)

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Estimated time of intraluminal thrombus &gt; 14 days

          -  Patients refusing treatment

          -  Patients for whom antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulants or thrombolytic drugs are
             contraindicated

          -  Patients with a history of prior life-threatening contrast medium reaction

          -  Life expectancy of less than six months

          -  Any patient considered to be hemodynamically unstable at onset of procedure
