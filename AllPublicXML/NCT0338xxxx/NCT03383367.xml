  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      France is one of the European countries where the incidence of colorectal cancer is the
      highest among cancers for both sexes. Fecal occult blood screening has been implemented since
      2008. However, this screening excludes high risk people who have a 10 to 30 % risk of
      developing a CRC during their lifetime. Colonoscopy follow up of these persons is not
      organized, and it is up to the attending physician to recall the date of the surveillance
      colonoscopy. This results in a poor compliance with the recommendations by these people. A
      postal reminder of the surveillance colonoscopies sent by The French screening organizations
      to the patients should increase adherence to follow-up recommendations. The colorectal cancer
      screening organizations will collects from the hepatogastroenterologists (HGE) informations
      on colonoscopies of people more than 50 years old who live in the Rhone. These informations
      will allow to send a reminder 3 months before the date recommended by the HGE. Participation
      rate and timeliness will be assessed, as well as the severity of the lesions found. A
      medico-economic analysis will also be carried out.

    <measure>Cost-utility analysis of the reminder letter for surveillance colonoscopy</measure>
    <time_frame>Lesions'severity will be evaluated at 6, 9 or 15 months following the reminder sent according to the colonoscopist's recommendation (1,3 or 5 years after reference exams). The costs will be registered at the same time.</time_frame>
    <description>French Health Insurance is the point of vue selected for the evaluation. It's a cost-utility analysis. A Markov model will be performed. The data will proceed from litterature and from data registration during the study. A complementary study will be performed specifically if needed.
For the Markov model the data needed : neoplasia, adenocarcinoma, advanced adenoma, reminders costs, treatments costs, examinations costs, organization costs.</description>
