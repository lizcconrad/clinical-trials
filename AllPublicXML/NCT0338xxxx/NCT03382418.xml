      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of an HIV vaccine
      (gp145 C.6980) with aluminum hydroxide adjuvant in healthy, HIV-1-uninfected adults in the
      United States.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups. Participants in Group 1 will
      receive 300 mcg of gp145 C.6980 and aluminum hydroxide adjuvant on Day 0 and Months 2 and 6.
      Participants in Group 2 will receive 100 mcg of gp145 C.6980 and aluminum hydroxide adjuvant
      on Day 0 and Months 2 and 6. Participants in Group 3 will receive placebo on Day 0 and Months
      2 and 6.

      Study visits will occur at Day 0 (study entry), Weeks 1 and 2, and Months 2, 2.5, 6, 6.25,
      6.5, 9, and 12. Visits may include physical examinations, blood and urine collection, HIV
      testing, risk reduction counseling, and questionnaires.

             excluded: history of isolated gestational diabetes.)

          -  Thyroidectomy, or thyroid disease requiring medication during the last 12 months

          -  Hypertension:

               -  If a person has been found to have elevated blood pressure or hypertension during
                  screening or previously, exclude for blood pressure that is not well controlled.
                  Well-controlled blood pressure is defined as consistently less than or equal to
                  140 mm Hg systolic and less than or equal to 90 mm Hg diastolic, with or without
                  medication, with only isolated, brief instances of higher readings, which must be
                  less than or equal to 150 mm Hg systolic and less than or equal to 100 mm Hg
                  diastolic. For these volunteers, blood pressure must be less than or equal to 140
                  mm Hg systolic and less than or equal to 90 mm Hg diastolic at enrollment.

               -  If a person has NOT been found to have elevated blood pressure or hypertension
                  during screening or previously, exclude for systolic blood pressure greater than
                  or equal to 150 mm Hg at enrollment or diastolic blood pressure greater than or
                  equal to 100 mm Hg at enrollment.

          -  Bleeding disorder diagnosed by a doctor (eg, factor deficiency, coagulopathy, or
             platelet disorder requiring special precautions)

          -  Malignancy (Not excluded from participation: Volunteer who has had malignancy excised
             surgically and who, in the investigator's estimation, has a reasonable assurance of
             sustained cure, or who is unlikely to experience recurrence of malignancy during the
             period of the study)

          -  Seizure disorder: History of seizure(s) within past 3 years. Also exclude if volunteer
             has used medications in order to prevent or treat seizure(s) at any time within the
             past 3 years.

          -  Asplenia: any condition resulting in the absence of a functional spleen

          -  History of hereditary angioedema, acquired angioedema, or idiopathic angioedema.
