  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Get Fit, Be Fit Study is to examine the effect of incorporating pistachios
      in an intensive 4-month cognitive-behavioral weight loss intervention in overweight and obese
      men and women, to examine effects on metabolic factors, and to monitor and examine changes in
      dietary intake and food choices during the intervention, in a randomized controlled study.

    <textblock>
      This study investigates whether pistachios help to promote weight loss and improve metabolic
      and cardiovascular disease risk factors in 100 overweight or obese men and women who are
      participating in a 4-month behavioral weight loss intervention. Participants will be assigned
      to a cognitive-behavioral weight loss intervention and will be provided either general
      dietary advice as a component of the behavioral curriculum or prescribed an individualized
      pistachio-enriched reduced-energy diet plan. The pistachio-enriched diet will prescribe 42
      g/day of pistachios, or approximately 13-20% (averaging 18%) of energy intake across a range
      of 1200-1800 kcal/day. Dietary intake will be assessed at three time points (baseline, one
      month, and four months) to examine changes in dietary intake and food choices that may be
      indicative of compensatory intake in response to regular nut consumption. Results from this
      study will contribute to understanding the role of pistachios in weight control, including
      further knowledge of the metabolic factors linked to chronic disease, and will expand
      knowledge of how pistachios in the diet may contribute to the prevention and management of
      obesity.

    <description>Composition of prescribed diets will be based on individual preferences, with the goal of consuming 1.5 oz of pistachios per day and increased energy expenditure. During the 4-month intervention, study subjects will participate in individualized counseling and group sessions, with in-person, telephone, email and text message contacts to provide support and behavioral guidance and strategies. Pistachios will be provided to participants. The overall content of the intervention consists of key elements of cognitive-behavioral therapy for obesity. The physical activity component emphasizes planned aerobic exercise, increased physical activity in the lifestyle, and strength training.</description>
