  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a school- and family-based prospective study in randomly selected clusters among
      Primary/Grade 3-4 (P3-4) students in all the 5 regions of Hong Kong, which aims at reducing
      children's exposure to secondhand and thirdhand smoke. This study includes a baseline
      screening survey (to identify eligible subjects), baseline assessments (including hair
      nicotine analysis and child-reported outcomes), interventions and 12-month follow-up
      assessments.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The interventions consist of a 30-minute briefing, worksheets and mobile instant messages.
      Worksheets aiming at preventing students' tobacco exposure will be mailed weekly to the homes
      for them and parents to complete together in the first 12 weeks. About 4 mobile instant
      messages per week will be sent to students and parents in the first 12 weeks. Control
      students will receive minimal interventions to reduce tobacco exposure. The assessments in
      the follow-up 6 months and 12 months include hair nicotine analysis, student and parent
      survey. All questionnaire data, individual baseline and follow-up data (6-month and 12-month)
      will be matched and analysed.

      Aims of this study: (1) to reduce exposure to tobacco smoke, secondhand smoke (SHS) and
      thirdhand smoke (THS) among children, (2) to reduce children's intention to smoke, (3) to
      reduce children's respiratory symptoms, (4) to promote avoidance of SHS among children, (5)
      to promote children's perception of family happiness, (6) to promote smoking cessation of the
      primary source of SHS exposure.

    <masking_description>All participants will be told that they will be randomly allocated to one of two interventions, and will be advised not to discuss with others parents and students about the intervention. The group status of hair samples will not be revealed to the Laboratory. Variables applicable only to the intervention arm (e.g. process evaluation items) will be kept in a separate data set, and the data analysts will be blinded to the group status of observations.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Objectively measured exposure to tobacco smoke among children.</measure>
    <time_frame>6-month</time_frame>
    <description>In the 6th month, students will be gathered in a classroom for hair collection separately for each group to reduce potential contamination subsequently. A small sample of 30-50 strands of hair will be cut at the back of head near the scalp by trained research staff. The hair sample will be clearly labelled and stored in a zip lock bag and sent to an overseas laboratory to analyse the nicotine content with a standard method. Hair grows at about 1cm per month, so the examination of 1-2cm of hair closest to the scalp will reflect exposure to tobacco smoke in the past 1-2 months.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Children's self-reported exposure to secondhand smoke and thirdhand smoke.</measure>
    <time_frame>6-month and 12-month</time_frame>
    <description>In the 6th and 12th months, children will report their exposure to secondhand smoke and thirdhand smoke by answering 3 questions in the questionnaire: 1) During the past 7 days, how many days did people smoke near you when you were at home? 2) During the past 7 days, how many days did you smell secondhand smoke from outside when you were at home? 3) During the past 7 days, if there was no one smoking, how many days did you smell tobacco when you were at home?</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Children's avoidance of secondhand smoke.</measure>
    <time_frame>6-month and 12-month</time_frame>
    <description>In the 6th and 12th months, children will report their avoidance of secondhand smoke by answering 2 questions in the questionnaire: 1) During the past 7 days, what did you do if anyone smoked in your home when you were at home? The options include opening windows, turning on exhaust fan, staying far away from smokers or smoking areas, asking smokers go to another place, asking smokers stop smoking, other actions and no actions. 2) If anyone smoked in your home when you were at home, whether would you ask them to stop smoking?</description>

    <measure>Children's intention to smoke.</measure>
    <time_frame>6-month and 12-month</time_frame>
    <description>In the 6th and 12th months, children will report their intention to smoke by answering 2 questions in the questionnaire: 1) If one of your good friends ask you to smoke, whether would you accept? 2) Do you think you will smoke in the following 12 months?</description>

    <measure>Children's respiratory symptoms.</measure>
    <time_frame>6-month and 12-month</time_frame>
    <description>In the 6th and 12th months, children will report their respiratory symptoms by answering 2 questions in the questionnaire: 1) On the whole, how do you think of your health status? The options include excellent (=5), very good (=4), satisfactory (=3), fair (=2) and poor (=1), with higher scores indicating better health status. 2) During the recent 30 days, did you often cough or have phlegm in your throat?</description>
