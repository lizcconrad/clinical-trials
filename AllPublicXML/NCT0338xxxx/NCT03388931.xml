  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 single arm study of a novel schedule of hyperfractionated radiotherapy (RT)
      in combination with our standard chemotherapy program for patients with stage 3-4 squamous
      cell carcinoma of the larynx. The primary hypothesis of our study is that the study program
      will improve Laryngectomy-Free Survival compared to historical controls. The study is limited
      to patients who would be receiving primary RT-C as standard therapy off-study.

      The novel radiotherapy schedule that is the subject of this study is only slightly different
      from the program that has been used in the cooperative group trial RTOG 9003. The radiation
      therapy dose schedule in our study twice-daily alternating fractions over 30 treatment days.
      The Biologically Effective Dose (BED) of this schedule is about 11% higher than our standard
      schedule twice-a-day. During radiotherapy, patients will receive chemotherapy with our
      standard program of weekly.

          -  Supraglottic Larynx:

        T2: Primary tumor volume &gt; 4.0cc T3-4: Any primary tumor volume

          -  Hypopharynx:

        T2: Primary tumor volume &gt; 4.0cc T3-4: Any primary tumor volume

          -  Currently taking Disease Modifying Rheumatoid Drugs (DMRDs)

          -  Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease exacerbation or other respiratory illness
