  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this clinical trial is to assess the clinical performance of the
      investigational device. To that end, for each measure and the in-vivo repeatability will be
      quantified, as well as the mean measurement deviation with respect to the current gold
      standard device. As a secondary objective of the study, raw measurement data will be
      collected, to allow for improvements of existing algorithms, development of additional
      measure and and for retrospective analysis.

      EYESTAR 900 (the investigational device) is a new device by HAAG-STREIT AG, for measurement
      of optical biometry and advanced corneal topography by swept-source optical coherence
      tomography (OCT).
