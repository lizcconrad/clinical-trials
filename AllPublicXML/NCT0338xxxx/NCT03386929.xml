  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with advanced/metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with no documented
      targetable alterations (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutation, Anaplastic Lymphoma
      Kinase (ALK) translocation, ROS1 mutation if available or MET exon 14 skipping mutation if
      available) will receive a tri-therapy associating avelumab, axitinib and palbociclib.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the Phase 1 (approximately 30 patients), the tri-therapy will be tested at different
      doses following a specific dose-escalation scheme (3 + 3 model) in order to establish the
      safety and identify the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and recommended dose (RP2D) for the
      Phase 2. The phase 2 will confirm the safety and will assess the clinical utility of the
      tri-therapy approach in the treatment of advanced/metastatic NSCLC (100 patients). The study
      will also explore the clinical utility of the Simplified Interventional Mapping System
      (SIMS), a new tool/algorithm enabling matching of NSCLC patients with combination therapy.
      For this purpose tumor/metastasis and matched normal tissue biopsies will be requested in
      order to obtain sequencing and expression profiles.
