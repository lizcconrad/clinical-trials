  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-arm, open-label study that aims to compare the incidence and severity of the
      most common adverse reactions, particularly contact dermatitis, when Valchlor is used alone
      or in conjunction with triamcinolone ointment 0.1% in early stage MF subjects (Stage IA and
      IB) for a period of 4 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mechlorethamine hydrochloride, or most commonly known as nitrogen nitrogen mustard, was
      approved by the FDA in 2013 for the treatment of IA and IB Mycosis Fungoides. The most common
      side effect of Valchlor is a skin rash, which is routinely ameliorated with the application
      of topical corticosteroids, such as topical Triamcinolone. The main purpose of this study is
      to determine the efficacy of Triamcinolone in reducing side effects cause by Valchlor and
      further understand the nature of this skin rash.

      This is a split-face study, meaning that subjects will receive both therapies, but limit use
      to designated areas. Treatment lasts 4 months with follow ups at 5 and 12 months.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Contact Dermatitis</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Incidence (%) of dermatitis in lesions treated concurrently with Triamcinolone 0.1% ointment versus those that are not. Dermatitis will be defined as a finding of cutaneous inflammatory reaction occurring as a result of treatment. This will be assessed as a value of present or not present, and may be confirmed by biopsy of the specimen.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Nature of Contact Dermatitis (Allergic versus Irritant)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The presence of allergic versus irritant dermatitis will be characterized through skin biopsies sent for pathological review, patch testing, and measuring the genetic variability of the T-cell clones through sequencing of the CD3 region of all T-cell clones found in skin biopsies collected at timepoints when contact dermatitis develop versus those collected at baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Severity of Dermatitis</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) differences between lesions treated with Valchlor and Triamcinolone versus lesions treated with Valchlor only. SCORAD measures the extent and severity of dermatitis (Score ranges: Mild: below 25, Moderate: between 25 and 50, and Severe: above 50). A lower score would be a better outcome.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Pruritus and sleep disturbance</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>To determine if there is any difference in pruritus and sleep disturbance caused by itch among lesions treated with Valchlor or Valchlor and Triamcinolone, measured as an average of a composite score of pruritus in each individual lesion for each treatment arm. Scores will range from 0 (least itch and sleep disturbance) to 10 (worst imaginable itch and sleep disturbance).</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of skin hyperpigmentation</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>To determine rate (%) and severity of hyperpigmentation in both treatment groups.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of ulceration</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>To determine rate (%) and severity of ulceration in both treatment groups.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of skin blistering</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>To determine rate (%) and severity of skin blistering in both treatment groups.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy of Valchlor vs Valchlor plus Triamcinolone</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Efficacy of Valchlor therapy with Triamcinolone compared to Valchlor using a composite assessment of index lesion severity (CAILS). CAILS is an objective, quantitative, method to assess the extent of skin lesions. Skin lesions and erythema will be evaluated using CAILS. A Composite Assessment will be generated for each time point by a summation of the grades for each index lesion's erythema, scaling, plaque elevation, hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation, and area of involvement. The index lesion grade at baseline will be divided into the grade at each subsequent study visit to determine the subject's response to treatment. Any ratio of the grade obtained at the visit vs. the one obtained at baseline that is &gt;1.0 will indicate worsening of disease.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Be eligible to receive Valchlor therapy.

          -  Be at least of 18 years of age and ability to give informed consent

          -  Have stage IA or IB CTCL

          -  Subjects with histologic variants of Mycosis Fungoides such as folliculotropic,
             granulomatous slack skin, syringotropic MF, or large cell transformation ARE eligible.

          -  A skin biopsy within the last 60 days before start of treatment. In cases with
             equivocal histological features, the diagnosis may be confirmed with clinicopathologic
             and/or genetic testing consistent with the National Comprehensive Cancer Network
             guidelines for Mycosis Fungoides. If sufficient tissue is not available to perform
             genetic testing, a new biopsy will be performed even if the subject has had a biopsy
             within 60 days of start of treatment.

          -  Females of child bearing potential must agree to use two highly effective methods of
             contraception (strongly recommended that one of the two forms of contraception be
             non-hormonal such as condom plus spermicide, condom plus diaphragm with spermicide, or
             have a vasectomized partner) or use an intrauterine device until 30 days after the
             last day of drug administration. Perimenopausal women must be amenorrhoeic for at
             least 12 months to be considered of nonchildbearing potential.

          -  Males with female partners of child bearing potential must agree to sexual abstinence
             or use two reliable forms of effective contraception simultaneously (strongly
             recommended that one of the two forms should be non-hormonal as described above)
             during the entire treatment period and 30 days after the last dose.

          -  Must be able to comply with the study instructions, apply the study medication as
             directed, and attend all visits.

          -  Willingness to avoid sun exposure and ultraviolet B light in areas to be treated.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have been treated with topical mechlorethamine within 6 months in lesions followed
             during this study.

          -  Have received any topical therapy directed against MF within 2 weeks of start of
             treatment in areas intended to be treated in this study.

          -  Have received any systemic therapy (oral or injectables) within 3 weeks of start of
             treatment.

          -  Not have any intercurrent illness or infection that would interfere with study
             participation

          -  Known hypersensitivity to mechlorethamine or triamcinolone.

          -  Breastfeeding, pregnancy, or intention to become pregnant.

Study data that is de-identified will be maintained at the study site. As this field is rapidly changing, if a database is available for safe, public upload at the end of study embargo, it will be uploaded to a national database.
