  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the change of cholesterol efflux capacity in
      patients with coronary artery disease treated with secondary prevention drugs, and the
      correlation with the prognosis.

      In this clinical trial, serum samples and associated clinical data of patients with coronary
      artery disease were collected from Department of Cardiology of Lu'an Shili Hospital and the
      First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University. Blood samples collected from all the
      participants at baseline (prior to the follow-up) and the time points of follow-up were
      placed into ordinary test tubes and stored at 4°C for less than 4 hours. The blood was then
      centrifuged, and serum was separated and stored at -80°C. The change of cholesterol efflux
      capacity, HDL-C subclasses (preβ1-HDL, HDL2, HDL3), the concentration and activity of plasma
      LCAT were measured. A follow-up form was designed according to the research purpose and
      discussed among the team members. The follow-up was performed through telephone by the
      trained investigators with good communication skills and knowledge on the diagnosis and
      treatment of coronary artery disease. Patients were followed up every six months from the day
      of discharge. The results of the follow-up were entered into the database, a process that was
      carried out by a designated person and double-checked by an independent person. The primary
      clinical endpoints were composite atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease outcomes, defined as
      nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular mortality. Secondary
      clinical endpoints were revascularization, including percutaneous coronary intervention and
      coronary artery bypass grafting, and Class IV heart failure requiring hospitalization.
