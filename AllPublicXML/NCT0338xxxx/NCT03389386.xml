  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The congestive heart failure (HF) is a condition associated with substantial morbidity,
      mortality, and high healthcare expenditures. From the pathophysiological standpoint, several
      mechanisms contribute to the progression and dysfunction of the failing heart such as an
      increased hemodynamic overload, impaired myocyte calcium cycling, upregulated apoptotic
      activity, deficient or increased production of extracellular matrix, genetic predilections
      and, finally, excessive neurohumoral stimulation. The vasoactive neurohumoral systems such as
      sympathetic nervous system, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and arginine
      vasopressin (AVP) system all play a role in maintaining volume and circulatory homeostasis in
      the situation of impaired cardiac output.

      Catestatin (CST), on another hand, is a novel endogenous peptide cleaved from chromogranin A
      (CgA) that is involved in regulation of cardiac function and arterial blood pressure. The
      role of this peptide is to elicit potent catecholamine release-inhibitory activity by acting
      at the level of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Therefore, the main hypothesis of this
      study is that the observed plasma CST levels will reflect the degree of neurohormonal
      activation in HF, showing a significant relationship with the degree of disease severity
      (according to NYHA classification). The investigators expect that among participants with
      worst clinical phenotypes of HF, CST levels in plasma will be highest and will decrease as
      the disease severity decreases. Secondly, the investigators expect to observe the significant
      correlation between CST levels in plasma with the echocardiographic parameters of the
      ventricular function, both in terms of systolic and diastolic cardiac function. Parameters of
      inflammation, NT-proBNP levels and basic hematologic/biochemistry indices from peripheral
      blood will also be obtained and analyzed from all the participants enrolled in the study.
      Furthermore, according to the latest European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines,
      participants with established congestive HF will be prospectively stratified in three
      categories in respect to their left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) - HFrEF, HFmrEF,
      HFpEF. All the examined echocardiographic and blood parameters will be recorded and compared
      with respective healthy and matched control participants while participants diagnosed with HF
      will additionally be analyzed for potential differences between subgroups according to their
      LVEF value.

    <description>The goal is to determine and compare plasma catestatin levels in patients with congestive heart failure, stratified by the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in three groups: reduced, mid-range, and preserved ejection fraction (HFrEF, HFmrEF, HFpEF). Furthermore, catestatin plasma levels will be compared between patients with congestive heart failure and healthy volunteers.</description>
