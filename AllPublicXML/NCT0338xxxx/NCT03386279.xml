  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, single-dose, randomized, 3-treatment, 3-period cross-over, sponsor-open,
      placebo-and positive-controlled trial to be conducted in approximately 36 adult healthy
      volunteers. There will be 3 crossover treatments: PF-04965842 600 mg (A), placebo (B) and
      moxifloxacin 400 mg (C). Treatment assignments to PF-04965842 and placebo will be blinded to
      the subjects, investigator and Clinical Research Unit (CRU) staff (except pharmacist) but
      open to the sponsor. Moxifloxacin administration will be unblinded. Dosing in each of the 3
      treatment periods will be separated by a washout period of at least 5 days

      Screening evaluation will occur within the 28 days prior to dosing in the first treatment
      period. During each treatment period, eligible subjects who meet the entry criteria will be
      admitted on Day -1, prior to treatment administration on Day 1, and will reside in the CRU
      until completion of protocol assessments on Day 2. There will be a washout of at least 5 days
      between dose administrations in consecutive crossover treatment periods. After completion of
      the 3 study periods or upon withdrawal from the study, subjects will return for a follow-up
      visit approximately 7-14 days following last dose of investigational product. Further
      follow-up contact will be made at least 28 calendar days and up to 35 calendar days after the
      last administration of the investigational product to capture any potential AEs and
      concomitant treatments, and to confirm appropriate contraception usage, contact with the
      subject may be done via phone. For each subject, the duration of participation from Day 1
      admission to follow-up visit will be approximately 10 weeks. The follow-up call will occur up
      to 4 weeks after the follow-up visit.

      In each treatment period, the subject will be admitted to the CRU the day prior to dosing.
      Genotyping samples for CYP2C19 and CYP2C9 will be collected pre-dose in Period 1 only. The
      subject will receive a single dose of the assigned trial medication in the morning of Day 1.
      Triplicate 12-lead ECG measurements (approximately 2 minutes apart) will be performed on Days
      1 and 2 of each treatment period as follows: -1, -0.5 and 0 hours pre-dose and at 0.25, 0.5,
      1, 2, 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours post-dose. Blood samples will be collected following the 0 hour
      and post-dose ECG measurements at the same time-points to evaluate the PK of PF-04965842 and
      moxifloxacin (if needed). Clinical safety laboratory tests will be performed on Day -1 and at
      24 hours on Day 2, and vital signs (supine pulse rate and BP) will be monitored pre-dose and
      at 2 and 6 hours post-dose on Day 1 and at 24 hours on Day 2. The subject will be discharged
      from the CRU after completing all trial procedures of the particular treatment period in the
      morning of Day 2 (24 hours post-dose).

          8. Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days (or as determined by the local
             requirement) or 5 half-lives preceding the first dose of investigational product

         14. History of tuberculosis (TB) or active or latent or inadequately treated infection.

             of nonprescription medications that are not believed to affect subject safety or the
             overall results of the study may be permitted on a case-by-case basis following
             approval by the sponsor. Herbal supplements and hormone replacement therapy must have
             been discontinued at least 28 days prior to the first dose of investigational product.

             cigarettes per day.

         18. Blood donation (excluding plasma donations) of approximately 1 pint (500 mL) or more

             the study and their family members, site staff members otherwise supervised by the
             investigator, or subjects who are Pfizer employees, including their family members,
             directly involved in the conduct of the study.

         23. Other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the
             past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior or laboratory abnormality that may
             increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product
             administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the
             judgment of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this
             study.
