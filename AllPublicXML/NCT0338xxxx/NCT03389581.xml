  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the majority of patients, anxiety and fear are observed at different levels before
      surgery. Preoperative anxiety was reported in 60-80% of the patients who underwent surgery.
      This anxiety and fear can be attributed to many factors. Some of these are mainly anesthesia,
      previous experience of the patient, personality traits, concerns about surgical intervention,
      and postoperative pain. Patients' anxiety levels can be influenced by a variety of factors,
      including previous experience, type of hospital arrival, sex, age, and type of
      surgery.Anesthesia-related awareness among the experiences of anesthesia is described in the
      literature. In a study of 20,402 patients in the United States, the awareness rate was 0.13%.
      Being aware is that the patient is awake during the surgery and recalls seeing bad dreams. At
      that time the patient could not specify this because he was immobile. Being awake is that the
      patient is awake and showing it through his movements. The patient may not remember this
      situation later. It is a condition that can always be overlooked in previous experience,
      which is an important parameter of anxiety in the preoperative period. The patients included
      in the study were planned to use the modified Brice awareness score, first mentioned in 1970
      as the name of the person who used the anesthesia and anesthesia for awareness. In this
      study, investigators aim to reveal the effect of anesthesia awareness on preoperative anxiety
      in patients with previous anesthesia story.
