        Inclusion Criteria (Group A &amp; B participants)

          -  Participant is willing and able to give informed consent for participation in the
             trial.

          -  Male or Female, aged 18 years or above.

          -  Undergoing elective laparoscopic abdominal surgery or undergoing planned laparoscopic
             donor nephrectomy (donation)

          -  Participant has available laboratory and ECG results within 3 months of enrolment.

          -  Female participants of child bearing potential and male participants whose partner is
             of child bearing potential must be willing to ensure that they or their partner use
             effective contraception during the trial and for 3 months thereafter

          -  In the Investigator's opinion, is able and willing to comply with all trial
             requirements.

          -  Group A only: Participant is undergoing laparoscopic colorectal surgery

          -  Group B only: Participant is undergoing laparoscopic donor nephrectomy

             may either put the participants at risk because of participation in the trial, or may
             influence the result of the trial, or the participant's ability to participate in the
             trial.
