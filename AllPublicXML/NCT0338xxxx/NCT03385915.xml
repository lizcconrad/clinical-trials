      The FinnValve investigators planned a nationwide registry to investigate the early and late
      outcome of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) compared to surgical aortic valve
      replacement (SAVR) in patients with aortic valve stenosis performed from 2008 to 2017 at five
      Finnish University Hospitals. Data will be collected in a dedicated electronic case report
      form.

    <textblock>
      Rationale of the study Uncertainty regarding the potential benefits of transcatheter aortic
      valve implantation (TAVI) compared to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in patients
      with aortic valve stenosis (AS) requires well-designed studies with long-term data on the
      outcome of these patients. A Finnish nationwide registry would allow complementing of the
      knowledge gained from randomized trials by providing data on the outcome of a more inclusive
      patient population, within a Health Care System that reflects the actual clinical practice in
      Scandinavia. In fact, the internal validity attained in randomized trials is often achieved
      at the expense of uncertainty about generalizability, especially since the populations
      enrolled in such studies may differ in significant ways from those seen in practice.

      The choice among different surgical aortic valve prostheses is based on solid data with
      20-year follow-up, which have shown significant risk of structural valve deterioration of
      bioprosthesis on the second decade after implantation. However, much less is known about the
      structural durability of TAVI prostheses beyond 3 years of follow-up. This nationwide
      registry would provide data on the durability of surgical bioprostheses as well as second and
      third generation TAVI prostheses at 7 years . Continuous follow-up of these patients will
      allow monitoring of the durability of these prostheses on the long run.

      Furthermore, the introduction of TAVI prompted a rapid development of minimally invasive
      surgical techniques and rapid deployment surgical bioprostheses in order to reduce the risk
      of early adverse events after SAVR. However, it is unclear whether these advances have a real
      clinical benefit on the early and late outcome of patients undergoing SAVR.

      Patients and Methods

      Patients operated on for AS at each Finnish University Hospitals from January 2008 to
      September 2017 will included in to this registry. The following inclusion and exclusion
      criteria will be considered:

      Inclusion criteria:

        -  Patients aged &gt;18 years

        -  Primary aortic valve procedure with a bioprosthesis for AS with or without associated
           regurgitation.

        -  TAVI and SAVR with or without associated coronary revascularization

        -  TAVI and SAVR for AS after any prior major cardiac surgery with exception of any maze
           procedure and/or closure of the left atrial appendage.

      Exclusion criteria:

        -  Patients who underwent any prior SAVR or TAVI

        -  Patients undergoing concomitant procedures on the mitral valve, tricuspid valve or the
           ascending aorta.

        -  Patients operated on for aortic valve endocarditis

        -  Patients operated for isolated aortic valve regurgitation.

      Definition criteria for baseline and operative variables as well as early and late outcomes
      will be according to the Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC) 2 guidelines (Kappetein et
      al. Eur J Cardiothorac Surg 2012;42:S45-60). Prosthetic valve structural deterioration and
      failure will be reported according to the last specific guidelines on this topic (Capodanno
      et al. Eur J Cardiothorac Surg. 2017;52:408-417). However, because of the lack of complete
      echocardiographic follow-up in these patients, valve structural valve deterioration will be
      classified only according to the definition criteria of severe hemodynamic structural valve
      deterioration of these guidelines.

      The late events of interest are all-cause mortality, stroke, myocardial infarction,
      myocardial revascularization, structural deterioration, non-structural valve dysfunction,
      repeated procedures on the aortic valve and implantation of permanent pace-maker. Data on
      these late events will be collected at each participating center. These will be further
      checked and implemented for patients residing outside the catchment areas by interrogation of
      the Finnish National Health Institute for Health and Welfare database as well as Statistics
      Finland database.
