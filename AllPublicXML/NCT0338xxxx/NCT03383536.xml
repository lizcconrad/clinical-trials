  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will use a neuroeconomic paradigm with state-of-the-art imaging protocols to probe
      abnormal social reward processing underlying social withdrawal in symptomatic trauma-exposed
      women. By also gathering self-report measures of social anhedonia, performance on non-social
      and social reward valuation tasks, and measures of real-world social functioning including
      social network size, we aim to specify how alterations in social reward processing result in
      social withdrawal and functional impairment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Impaired social functioning is a frequent and disabling sequela of trauma-related disorders.
      PTSD is associated with a high rate of severe impairment in quality of life relative to other
      anxiety disorders, including panic disorder, social phobia, and OCD, with particularly marked
      impairment in social quality of life. Mounting evidence indicates that impairment in quality
      of life in PTSD is strongly related to its effect on social functioning. Such difficulties
      are widespread and affect multiple social networks, including marital relationships, and
      friendships and family relationships. Social withdrawal, defined here in terms of reduced
      social network size, is of particular interest because of its strong relationship with health
      outcomes, including increased risk of disability, reduced immune response, and increased
      mortality risk; most critically, poor social integration is associated with a threefold
      increase in suicide risk. Because women are at a 2.3-to-3-fold increased risk compared to men
      of developing PTSD following trauma, understanding the differential neurobiological pathways
      that may contribute to the development of stress-related disorders in women is particularly
      critical. Women are more likely than men to endorse social detachment following trauma,
      especially when the trauma involves exposure to violence.

      In this project, we propose abnormal reward processing (anhedonia) as a specific mechanism
      underlying social withdrawal in trauma-exposed women, and we present a paradigm that
      capitalizes on advances in neuroeconomics to elucidate the neural underpinnings of social
      withdrawal. Additionally, we propose to identify the possible influences of a stress peptide
      (pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide: PACAP) implicated in sex-specific
      changes in social behavior following stress exposure.

    <description>Because social withdrawal will occur in response to reduced social reward value, we hypothesize that across the PTS groups, reduced VS, DS, and mPFC activity during the outcome phase of the trust game for 'share' outcomes will be associated with lower Trust Task investments, greater self-reported social anhedonia, and smaller social network size.</description>
