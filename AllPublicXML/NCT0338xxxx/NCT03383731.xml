    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the surgical outcomes of inverted internal limiting membrane insertion
      combined with air tamponade in the treatment of macular hole retinal detachment (MHRD) in
      high myopia, and also to compare the treatment efficacy and safety between different surgical
      approaches of MHRD

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study uses a new surgical method (vitrectomy combined with inverted internal limiting
      membrane insertion and intraocular sterilized air tamponade) to assess its effectiveness and
      safety on the prognosis of macular hole retinal detachment secondary to high myopia, and also
      compares this new type of surgery with the current commonly used surgery (vitrectomy combined
      with internal limiting membrane peeling + silicone oil infusion).
