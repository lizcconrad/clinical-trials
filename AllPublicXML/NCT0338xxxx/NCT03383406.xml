      A phase II trial of ifosfamide, etoposide, cytarabine, and methotrexate (IVAM) chemotherapy
      for refractory or relapsed diffuse large B cell lymphoma
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diffuse Large B-Cell lymphoma is currently used as a standard treatment, with a combination
      of chemotherapy (R-CHOP), which includes Rituximab. However, the survival rate is very poor
      if the primary treatment is refractory or relapsed within a year or less. The duration of
      these patients ' lives is around one year and the five-year survival rate is 15-20 %. Thus, a
      new treatment strategy is needed to improve the survival of the patient with DLBCL, which are
      either refractory and relapsed.
