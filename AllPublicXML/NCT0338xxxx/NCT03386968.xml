  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot feasibility study is to assess the feasibility of using the
      Playstation Xbox 360 and Rutgers V-step via a Kinect Sensor with active video game software
      as a part of a physical therapy intervention to improve obstacle negotiation, gait speed, and
      stair negotiation in ambulatory children with Cerebral Palsy (CP) hemiparesis or spastic
      diplegia, or non-progressive brain injury (BI). Children will be assessed using perceptual,
      balance, functional and gait assessments.

    <intervention_model_description>A Randomized Block Design will be utilized in order to attempt to &quot;match&quot; subjects according to functional level and diagnosis (cerebral palsy or acquired brain injury). Upon signing consent the subjects will be grouped based on their diagnosis. At that time gait speed for the 10 M Walk Test will be utilized to categorize all participants into a &quot;fast&quot; and &quot;slow&quot; group. (subjects performing the 10 M Walk Test at a speed less than .4 m/s will be placed in the &quot;slow&quot; group, and subjects testing at a speed greater than or equal to .4 m/s will be placed in the &quot;fast&quot; group After this determination is made, subjects will be randomized to &quot;control&quot; (usual care), and &quot;intervention&quot; one therapy session replaced with a session utilizing Active video games and the Rutger's V-step. A minimum of 2 subjects per grouping will be sought in order to analyze for differences.</intervention_model_description>

During each session, children will play a video game on the X-Box Kinect system, using the games &quot;Kinect Adventures&quot; and &quot;Kinect Sports&quot;. The child will first play a &quot;Kinect Adventures&quot; game, which requires ambulating, ducking, and dodging one's way through an obstacle course.</description>
