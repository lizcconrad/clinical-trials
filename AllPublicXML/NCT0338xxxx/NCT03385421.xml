      The Nutritional Practices and Outcomes in Non-Invasive Ventilation (NPO/NIV) study is a
      collaboration with lead sites from pediatric critical care units within US and Canada, and
      participating sites from multiple international regions. The goal of NPO/NIV is to understand
      how non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is used to treat critically ill children and,
      concurrently, how these children are fed while on NIV. Designed as a period prevalence study,
      NPO/NIV will collect observational, cross-sectional data over the course of five study weeks.
      Each study week will require two days of screening for eligible patients. On Mondays, study
      staff will screen for patients eligible in the previous 48 hours. On Tuesdays, study staff
      will screen for patients eligible in the previous 24 hours. Patients meeting study inclusion
      will be eligible to complete V0, V1, and V2. Included patients will be followed for 7 days
      after the initiation of NIV or until the patient is discharged from the pediatric intensive
      care unit. This study was granted exempt status by the University of Arizona Human Subjects
      Protection Program, including a waiver of informed consent. As no personal health information
      is transmitted during the course of the study, the University of Arizona does not require
      Data Use Agreements between sites to participate.
