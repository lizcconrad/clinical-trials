  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myeloablative allogeneic hematopoetic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) are prone to frequent
      secondary malnutrition to metabolic and digestive troubles due to conditioning regimen,
      treatments (antibiotics, immunosuppressive therapy…) and graft complications (graft versus
      host disease). In the absence of appropriate nutritional support, myeloablative conditioning
      lead to a rapid serious denutrition. But, it is known as negative independent prognostic
      factor of overall survival of patients who presented malignant hemopathy treated by high-dose
      chemotherapy or AHSCT. Furthermore, it increases hospitalisation delay and decreases quality
      of life. In AHSCT with myeloablative conditioning, introduction of nutritional support is
      recommended. However, type of nutritional support remains not clearly defined. Parenteral
      nutrition is user but favour infections and secondary effects potentially decrease by
      intravenous glutamine. Few previous studies with low number of patients, mainly retrospective
      or combining allo-and auto HSCT had shown feasibility, acceptable tolerance and low cost of
      enteral nutrition (EN). A recent prospective no-randomized study in 45 adults patients who
      had undergone AHSCT with myeloablative conditioning find a significant decrease of day-100
      mortality (5% vs 30%), of infection mortality, of median duration of parenteral nutrition
      (PN) and prevalence of GvH (Graft versus Host Disease) grade III-IV in EN (enteral nutrition)
      group. These results had to be confirmed by a randomized study. As EN is 4 to 5 more cheaply
      than PN, besides mortality/morbidity stakes for the patient, this study could have potential
      economic interest.

      EN (enteral nutrition) or PN (parenteral nutrition) artificial nutrition will be launched at
      D1-D2 of the transplantation (D0 being the day of the transplantation),without taking into
      account the oral intake. This helps in particular to launch the EN after the stage of
      significant digestive problems related to the conditioning and before the mucositis
      appearance.

      EN group: According to the HAS and SFNEP (Societe francophone nutrition clinique)
      recommendations and the good practice rules, a polyurethane or silicone NGT(Naso gastric
      tube), 8 to 10 French units, will be inserted and its positioning will be controlled by
      radiography before the EN beginning. Polyurethane and silicone are very well tolerated by
      nasal and oesophagus mucosa and have a long life duration allowing keeping the same tube
      during 2 to 3 months.

      PN group: PN will be administrated by a central venous catheter, which is usually inserted in
      allo-HSCT patients to allow the administration of chemotherapy and of the different
      parenteral treatments.
