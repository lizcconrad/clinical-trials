      In this study, investigators are trying to see if LMP specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs)
      will prevent or treat disease called Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) Disorder including either
      Hodgkin Lymphoma or non-Hodgkin Lymphoma or Lymphoepithelioma or severe chronic active EBV
      infection syndrome (SCAEBV) or Leiomyosarcoma which has come back or has not gone away after
      treatment, including the best treatment. Investigators are using special immune system cells
      called third party LMP specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), a new experimental therapy.

      Some patients with Lymphoma or SCAEBV or Leiomyosarcoma show evidence of infection with the
      virus that causes infectious mononucleosis Epstein Barr virus (EBV) before or at the time of
      their diagnosis. EBV is found in the cancer cells of up to half the patients with Hodgkin's
      and non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, suggesting that it may play a role in causing Lymphoma. The cancer
      cells (in lymphoma) and some B cells (in SCAEBV) infected by EBV are able to hide from the
      body's immune system and escape destruction. The investigators want to see if special white
      blood cells, called T cells, that have been trained to kill EBV infected cells can survive in
      patient's blood and affect the tumor or infection.

      Investigators used this sort of therapy to treat a different type of cancer that occurs after
      bone marrow or solid organ transplant called post transplant lymphoma. In this type of cancer
      the tumor cells have 9 proteins made by EBV on their surface. They grew T cells in the
      laboratory that recognized all 9 proteins and were able to successfully prevent and treat
      post transplant lymphoma. However in Hodgkin Lymphoma, the tumor cells and B cells only
      express 2 EBV proteins. In a previous study they made T cells that recognized all 9 proteins
      and gave them to patients with Hodgkin Lymphoma. Some patients had a partial response to this
      therapy but no patients had a complete response. They think one reason may be that many of
      the T cells reacted with proteins that were not on the tumor cells. In this present study the
      investigators are trying to find out if the investigators can improve this treatment by
      growing T cells that recognize proteins expressed on EBV infected Lymphoma cells and B cells
      called LMP-1 and LMP2. These special T cells are called third party LMP 1/2 -specific
      cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs). These LMP-specific cytotoxic

      T cells are an investigational product not approved by the Food and Drug Administration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will first test a biopsy of the tumor or lymph node that has already been done
      to see if the tumor or tissue cells are EBV positive. If the patient is eligible,
      investigators will then take 60 mL (about 12 teaspoons) of blood from the patient or their
      donor on one or two occasions. They will use this blood to grow T cells. First they will grow
      a special type of cells called dendritic cells or monocytes which will stimulate the T cells.
      Next they will put a specially produced human virus that carries the LMP genes into the
      dendritic cells or monocytes. They will then be used to stimulate T cells. This stimulation
      will train the T cells to kill cells with LMP on their surface. Investigators will then grow
      these LMP specific CTLs by more stimulation with EBV infected cells. These EBV infected cells
      will be treated with radiation so they cannot grow.

      Once sufficient numbers of T cells have been made, investigators will test them to make sure
      they kill cells with LMP on their surface. If the counts are low they may need to obtain
      additional blood samples to make these cells. Prior to giving the patient the CTLs, the cells
      will be tested to make sure they don't attack the tissue.

      The cells will then be thawed and injected into the patient over 10 minutes. Initially, two
      doses of T cells will be given two weeks apart. If after the second infusion there is a
      reduction in the size of the lymphoma on CT or MRI scan as assessed by a radiologist, the
      patient can receive up to six additional doses of the T cells if the patient wishes. This is
      a dose escalation study which means that for some patients the second dose may be larger than
      the first. All of the treatments will be given by the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at
      Texas Children's Hospital or the Methodist Hospital.

      For follow-up after the CTL infusions, the patient will be seen every 3 months for the first
      year. Then the patient will either be seen in the clinic or they will be contacted by a
      research nurse yearly for 5 years.
