  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of Whey Protein (WP) and Soy Protein
      (SP) nutritional supplements on nutritional status and disease activity in Crohn's disease
      patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patients were split into two groups: one group was supplemented with whey protein and the
      other, with soy protein. Participants were assessed at three moments: before starting the
      intervention and after 8 and 16 weeks. The nutritional status and body composition were
      measured using bioimpedance analysis, anthropometry and albumin and pre-albumin dosages.
      Dietary intake was determined by 24-h dietary recalls. The disease activity was evaluated by
      Crohn's Disease Activity Index, serum cytokines and C-reactive protein dosages.
