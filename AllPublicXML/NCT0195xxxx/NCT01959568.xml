      Purpose: to assess the efficacy and safety of double tamponade versus silicone oil tamponade.

      Design: parallel-group study with balanced [1:1] stratified block randomization. Eligible
      participants are all adults aged 18 or over with first diagnosed rhegmatogenous total retinal
      detachment with retinal breaks located both in upper and lower retina. Also investigators
      include those patients with total retinal detachment with proliferative vitreoretinopathy
      (PVR) in which it is impossible to remove epiretinal membranes completely during the surgery
      (with arbitrary retinal breaks localization). Exclusion criteria are severe concomitant eye
      pathologies (glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, macular hole, traumas etc) and eye length more
      than 27mm.

      Patients are randomized in two groups (test group and control group).

      In the test group patients undergo subtotal vitrectomy, epiretinal membrane removal,
      perfluorodecalin (PFD) tamponade, retinal photocoagulation. After that the surgeon replaces ½
      of PFD volume by &quot;conventional&quot; SO (with density less than one of water). The result is
      vitreous cavity (VC) filled in a half with PFD and in another half - with SO. In the control
      group patients undergo subtotal vitrectomy, epiretinal membrane removal, PFD tamponade,
      retinal photocoagulation and PFD-SO exchange, so the result is VC filled with &quot;conventional&quot;
      or heavy SO, depending on predominant retinal breaks location. 30 days after the surgery in
      both groups tamponing agents are removed from VC and VC is filled with sulfur hexafluoride
      gas (SF6) which dissolves during 1 month. Follow-up is at least 12 months.

      Along with standard examinations, after SF6 gas dissolution investigators perform spectral
      optical coherence tomography (OCT) and microperimetry. With OCT investigators measure
      thickness of retinal inner and outer nuclear layers. With microperimetry investigators
      determine light sensitivity in 12° and 4° zones from the fixation point.

      Outcome measures: reattachment rate, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), intraocular
      pressure (IOP), thicknesses of inner and outer nuclear layers according to the OCT, light
      sensitivity according to microperimetry, the rate of cataract formation in phakic eyes and
      the rate of tamponing agents emulsification.

      For final analysis each group will include 145 participants.

      OCT, microperimetry data and visual acuity will be compared between the groups using
      Student's t-test; proportions will be compared using exact Fisher's test.

      The investigators include in the study all successive patients operated by the same surgeon.
      The study takes place in the S.N. Fyodorov &quot;Eye Microsurgery&quot; Federal State Institution
      located in Moscow, Russian Federation.

      Patients are randomized in two groups with stratified block randomization. Strata were
      defined by combination of two binary prognostic factors: duration of retinal detachment (less
      than 3 months and ≥ 3 months) and PVR (present/absent).

      Early interim analysis will be performed in order to reveal possible adverse effect of
      long-term PFD tamponade. For interim report success will mean the rate of post-surgical BCVA
      &gt;/= 20.200. Groups sizes for interim analysis will be 35 patients in each group. For interim
      analysis the investigators choose group sizes able to reveal 30% absolute difference in
      functional success rate with one-sided test (to detect possible toxicity of double tamponade
      for the retina) having power of 0.8 and significance level of p=0.05. In the final analysis
      success will mean retinal reattachment.

      For final analysis each group will include 145 participants, so that the investigators are
      able to detect 15% difference in reattachment rate with power of 0.8 and significance level
      of p=0.05. Group sizes were computed with exact Fisher's test function in G*Power 3.1.7
      software (Erdfelder, Faul, &amp; Buchner).

      OCT is performed with Cirrus HD-OCT system (Zeiss Meditec Inc). Microperimetry is performed
      with MP-1 microperimeter (Nidek). All the examinations are assessed by one ophthalmologist.

      The allocation concealment is implemented with the help of a third party, who stores the
      randomization list and prepares envelopes containing directions what method of tamponade to
      employ in each particular patient. Patients are blind to the method of tamponade.
