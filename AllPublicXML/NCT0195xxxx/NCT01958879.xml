      The study aims to evaluate effectiveness of ringer injection with or without corticosteroid
      during arthrocentesis of the temporomandibular joint in the treatment of internal derangement
      of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ).

      This prospective clinical study was approved by Local ethical committee and written informed
      consent will be obtained before the trial starts. Criteria for selection of the patients was
      based on history and clinical findings characteristic of internal derangement. All these
      patients were initially treated with NSAIDS for 1 week and occlusal splints for 1 month had
      failed to respond to these conservative treatments. The patients with systemic problems which
      affect bone and joints,psychological problems ,history of maxillofacial fractures and
      orthognathic surgery were excluded from the study. A total of 60 patients with TMJ internal
      derangement with failed conservative management, were subjected to TMJ arthrocentesis. All
      arthrocentesis were performed by the same maxillofacial surgeon. Subjects were randomly
      allocated into two groups (30 cases in each group). Subjects in the group 1 received
      irrigation with Ringer solution and in the group 2 ,subjects underwent irrigation with Ringer
      solution with corticosteroid (Dexamethasone ) .Two examiners evaluated Temporomandibular
      disorder's signs ( mouth opening,click , crepitus and pain) before, one month and 6 months
      after arthrocentesis.

    <description>Intra-articular irrigation was performed under local anesthesia with subcutaneous injection of 1%lidocaine solution (0.6 to 0.9 mL anaesthetic solution )was injected to block the auriculotemporal nerve. Then the skin on the TMJ was penetrated with a 21-gauge needle at the articular fossa followed by the injection of 3 mL Ringer solution to distend the joint space, pumping it in and out repeatedly. Another 21-gauge needle was inserted into the distended compartment in the area of the articular eminence, and the superior joint space was irrigated with 200 mL Ringer solution, allowing a free flow through the first needle in the both groups .In this group patients received 1mg dexamethasone after finishing the irrigation .</description>
