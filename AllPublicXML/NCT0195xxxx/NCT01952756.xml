    <textblock>
      1. The number and function of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are inversely
           associated with coronary risk factors and atherosclerotic diseases such as PAOD.

        2. This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the effects of
           cilostazol on human early EPCs and angiogenesis as well as the potential mechanisms of
           action in patients with mild-to-moderate PAOD.

    <description>Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (one million cells in each) are suspended in 100 µL phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 30 min with monoclonal antibodies against human peridinin chlorophyll protein-conjugated cluster of differentiation antigen-45, phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-human cluster of differentiation antigen-34 antibody and anti-human kinase insert domain receptor (KDR) antibody conjugated with Alexa Flour 647. Cells are washed and analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer with 100,000 events in the lymphocyte gate. EPCs, which are defined as negative for cluster of differentiation antigen-45 and positive for cluster of differentiation antigen-34 and KDR. Based on the peripheral blood mononuclear cell counts, the absolute number of circulating EPCs/µL is calculated.</description>

    <description>Peripheral blood mononuclear cells are isolated by density gradient centrifugation according to standard protocols. After centrifugation, cells are washed, resuspended in M199 medium supplemented with 20% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum, 10 ng/ml vascular endothelial growth factor, 2 ng/ml basic-fibroblast growth factor, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor and 2 ng/ml insulin growth factor, and cultured in 24-well plates coated with human fibronectin for 7 days. EPCs cells are confirmed by uptake of acetyl-low density lipoprotein and lectin and by the expression of EPC markers. Cells are harvested after 7 days, fixed and stained with crystal violet reagent. The colony densities are quantified with an Olympus microscope at 100-fold magnification using an imaging measurement software.</description>

    <description>250,000 cells are seeded in each well of a 96-well plate and the cells are added with 200 μl of the culture medium and incubated at 37°C. Medium change is performed 3 days later. On 7th day, the plate is then re-incubated with 100 μl fresh medium and additional 50 μl of 2,3-Bis-(2-Methoxy-4-Nitro-5-Sulfophenyl)-2 Hydrogen-Tetrazolium-5-Carboxanilide reagent, and further incubated in dark at 37°C for 4 h. After incubation, the orange colored complex formed is read at 450 nm using a microplate reader with a 450 nm reference filter.</description>
