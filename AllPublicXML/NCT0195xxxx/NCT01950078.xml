      Objective: This study was conducted to explore the possible correlation between some gene
      related to pain sensation and individual basal pain perception and postoperative pain
      intensity in the general population. Methods: Patients receiving elective surgery under
      general anesthesia were recruited into this study. The investigators measured their
      preoperative pressure pain threshold (PPT) and pressure pain tolerance (PTO). Pain intensity
      at rest and movement after the operation was evaluated . And the PCA drug consumption were
      recorded. Also there were healthy college students volunteer be recruited into this study.
      The investigators measured their experimental pain sensitivity including pressure pain
      threshold (PPT) and pressure pain tolerance (PTO), etc. Then genotyping was carried out.
