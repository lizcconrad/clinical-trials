  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A suspicious circumferential resection margin (CRM), defined as tumor cells within 1 mm of
      the CRM, is still controversial. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical
      significance of a suspicious CRM to histologically positive (R1) and negative margin (R0)
      resections in patients with pT3 esophageal and GE-Junction tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      From our prospectively build database 923 consecutive pT3 patients operated between january
      1990 and june 2013 were selected. CRM status in patients treated by surgery only (n = 747) or
      after neoadjuvant therapy (n = 176) was recorded prospectively after surgery.

      Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated, and factors affecting survival were assessed by
      Cox regression multivariate analysis.
