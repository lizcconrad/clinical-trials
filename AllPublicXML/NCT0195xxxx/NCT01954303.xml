  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality
      worldwide. Life threatening manifestations such as acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and
      sudden cardiac death are the most important causes of death in many countries. Cardiac
      troponin is a biomarker with a high specificity for cardiac necrosis and is recommended for
      diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction by the Universal definition of myocardial
      infarction. Since a new generation of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays has become
      commercially available a few years ago, myocardial infarction can be detected earlier and
      even small AMIs, that were classified as unstable angina pectoris (UAP) with the less
      sensitive assays, are detectable now. On the other side, more patients with acute or chronic
      myocardial damage not due to AMI are identified now. Thereby, the reason for elevated
      troponin levels should be sought actively, because high troponin levels were associated with
      adverse outcome - independent of the underlying pathomechanism. The reasons for troponin
      elevations in patients with stable CAD are not clear yet. Associations with extensive
      atherosclerosis, carotid lesions and complex coronary plaques in coronary CT scans were
      reported. Therefore, patients with elevated troponin levels represent a risk population and
      might profit from intensified secondary prevention. In this context, ticagrelor might be part
      of a prevention strategy as currently tested in the PEGASUS trial.

      We plan to conduct a single-centre pilot study in a cohort with clinically stable patients of
      our outpatient clinic, because data regarding prevalence, causes and prognosis of elevated
      troponin values in unselected cohorts is sparse. Therefore, all patients (n=910) that
      presented to our outpatient clinic 12 months after introduction of the high-sensitivity
      troponin T assay (june 2009) and were free of complaints or presented with UAP are being
      enrolled. All patients are characterized by demographic, laboratory and clinical
      characteristics (including medication) and all available imaging data (exercise-ecg,
      echocardiography, stress-echocardiography, computed tomography, cardiac MRI and coronary
      angiography) in order to compare baseline characteristics of troponin positive and troponin
      negative patients. In addition, the Framingham- and PROCAM-Score representing established
      calculators of long-term risk prediction are calculated.

      Prognostic endpoints are defined as severe cardiovascular events and progress of the
      initially diagnosed disease. Those endpoints are associated with the initial hs-cTnT value
      and serial changes.

        We plan to conduct a single-centre pilot study in a cohort with clinically stable patients
        (n=910) of our outpatient clinic who presented 12 months after introduction of the
        high-sensitivity troponin T assay (june 2009) for routine workup. No patients will be
        excluded.

        All patients with stable CAD with or without cardiovascular comorbidities will be selected
        and classified as &quot;troponin positive&quot; or &quot;troponin negative&quot; according to initially
        documented hs-cTnT value.
