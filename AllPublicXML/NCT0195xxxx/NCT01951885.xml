      This randomized clinical trial studies standard GVHD prophylaxis with tacrolimus and
      methotrexate compared to tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and a reduced-dose methotrexate in
      patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant.
      Both mycophenolate mofetil and reduced-dose methotrexate, in combination with a calcineurin
      inhibitor, have been shown to be safe and effective in GVHD prevention with less toxicity
      than standard dose methotrexate. It is not yet known, however, whether this combination of
      mycophenolate mofetil and reduced-dose methotrexate with tacrolimus is more effective than
      tacrolimus and standard dose methotrexate in preventing GVHD.

      Study Design This is a prospective randomized trial to determine the effectiveness of
      different doses of GVHD prophylaxis on mucositis, engraftment and aGVHD. Study consists of
      two study groups of 50 subjects each.

      Group A will receive Tac and MTX (15 mg/m2 day +1, 10 mg/m2 day +3, +6, +11). Group B will
      receive Tac, Mini-dose MTX (5 mg/m2 on day +1, +3, +6) and MMF.
