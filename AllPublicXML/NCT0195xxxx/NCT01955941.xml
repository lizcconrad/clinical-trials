      The purpose of this study is to learn how blood flows to tumors in patients treated with
      I-125 plaque brachytherapy for uveal melanoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite having excellent local tumor control rates, uveal melanoma remains a life-threatening
      cancer, and even eye-sparing therapy with radiation treatment often leads to significant loss
      of vision. Major challenges to providing care to patients with uveal melanoma include the
      inability to accurately predict long-term vision in an eye treated with radiation, due to a
      poor understanding of the nature of radiation retinopathy and optic neuropathy. Optical
      coherence tomography (OCT) is a commonly used ophthalmic imaging modality that provides
      precise, real-time data in vivo in a non-invasive manner. Our research group has recently
      developed two novel functional OCT technologies: (1) Doppler OCT to quantitatively measure
      total retinal flow and (2) OCT angiography technology to map optic nerve head, retinal, and
      choroidal blood flow with unprecedented accuracy. The investigators believe this technology
      can be utilized to improve understanding of radiation-induced vascular changes in the optic
      nerve and retina that cause vision loss in patients treated with radiation, as well as
      provide a tool to monitor tumor response to treatment.

      In this study, the investigators intend to utilize these novel functional OCT technologies to
      describe the changes over time in optic nerve head and retinal blood flow after I-125
      radiation therapy, and to evaluate the relationship between changes in flow and decreased
      vision. The investigators will also study the association between changes in flow and the
      total radiation doses received by the optic nerve head and macula, which varies based upon
      tumor location and size.

    <description>Patients with uveal melanoma for which brachytherapy is recommended will be considered and evaluated for enrollment into this study in order to describe the association between radiation treatment and changes in vision and blood flow within these treated eyes. Changes in vision and blood flow will be monitored at yearly intervals over a 5-year period. Up to 60 subjects will be recruited for this group.</description>

    <description>Patients with uveal melanoma who have previously undergone I-125 plaque brachytherapy will be considered for enrollment into this study to evaluate blood flow in eyes with more advanced radiation-induced changes. This group will only undergo a one-time study session. Up to 40 subjects will be recruited for this group.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults age 18 and older with uveal melanomas involving the ciliary body and/or the
             choroid undergoing I-125 plaque brachytherapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to give informed consent.

          -  Inability to maintain stable fixation for OCT imaging

          -  Significant renal disease, defined as a history of chronic renal failure requiring
             dialysis or kidney transplant

          -  A condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude participation in
             the study (e.g., unstable medical status including blood pressure, cardiovascular
             disease, and glycemic control).

          -  Blood pressure &gt; 180/110 (systolic above 180 OR diastolic above 110). If blood
             pressure is brought below 180/110 by anti-hypertensive treatment, subject can become
             eligible.

          -  Women who are pregnant or lactating at the time of enrollment due to unknown safety of
             fluorescein angiography. Women that become pregnant during the course of the study may
             remain enrolled; however, flurorescein and ICG angiography will not be performed until
             they are no longer pregnant or nursing an infant.
