  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well modern, conformal radiation therapy after surgery works
      in treating patients with high-risk bladder cancer. Specialized radiation therapy that
      delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause
      less damage to normal tissue.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the feasibility of adjuvant radiation in the management of high-risk disease.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Prospectively evaluate patterns of failure in high-risk bladder cancer patients after
      cystectomy and aggressive adjuvant therapy.

      II. Define surgical and histopathologic parameters predictive of local and distant outcomes
      (e.g. grade, lymphovascular space invasion [LVSI], extent of resection/lymph node dissection
      [LND]).

      III. Assess quality of life (QoL) outcomes after this treatment using a standardized
      questionnaires (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General [FACT-G], FACT-Bladder Cancer
      [BL], Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite [EPIC] Bowel and Urinary).

      OUTLINE:

      Within 24 weeks of surgical resection, patients undergo 3D conformal radiation therapy once
      daily 5 days per week for 28 fractions. Treatment continues in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks, every 3 months for
      2 years, every 6 months for 3-5 years, and then annually thereafter.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pathologic diagnosis of urothelial or squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder

          -  Patients must have undergone cystectomy (total cystectomy, radical cystectomy +/-
             pelvic lymph node dissection) with no evidence of macroscopic residual disease

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)/Zubrod performance status of 0-2

          -  Patients treated with simple cystectomy with macroscopically negative margins are
             eligible for this study

          -  Clinical T-stage (prior to systemic therapy, if applicable) ≥ T3a and/or positive
             lymph nodes by transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT)/magnetic resonance
             imaging (MRI)/computed tomography (CT)/positron emission tomography (PET)-CT or
             pathologic T-stage ≥ T3a and/or positive lymph nodes

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with metastatic disease outside of the pelvis

          -  Prior invasive malignancy (except non-melanomatous skin cancer) unless disease free
             for a minimum of 3 years

          -  Prior radiation therapy to the pelvis

          -  Patients with active inflammatory bowel disease

          -  Severe acute co-morbidity, defined as follows:

               -  Unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization in the
                  last 3 months

               -  Transmural myocardial infarction within the last 6 months

               -  Acute bacterial or fungal infection requiring intravenous antibiotics at the time
                  of registration

               -  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation or other respiratory illness
                  requiring hospitalization or precluding study therapy at the time of registration

               -  Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) based upon current Centers for Disease
                  Control and Prevention (CDC) definition; note, however, that human
                  immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing is not required for entry into this
                  protocol; the need to exclude patients with AIDS from this protocol is necessary
                  because the treatment involved in this protocol may be significantly
                  immunosuppressive; protocol-specific requirements may also exclude
                  immunocompromised patients
