  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The importance of good nutrition and food security among people living with HIV infection
      (PLHIV) is widely recognized. In resource-constrained settings, food insecurity is
      increasingly recognized as an important barrier to retention in care and adherence to
      antiretroviral therapy (ART). However, there are few studies demonstrating that food and
      nutrition assistance programs can improve HIV-related outcomes. This study will address this
      gap by comparing the effectiveness of three models for short-term support for PLHIV. Food
      insecure women and men on ART will be randomized into one of three groups: 1) nutrition
      assessment and counseling (NAC) alone, 2) NAC plus food assistance, or 3) NAC plus cash
      transfers. The investigators will compare the effect of the three approaches on ART adherence
      and retention in care after 6, 12, and 24-36 months of follow-up. The investigators
      hypothesize that NAC plus short-term support in the form of food or cash assistance will
      result in better adherence to ART and retention in care than NAC alone, and that the effects
      of NAC plus food assistance will be the same as NAC plus cash assistance. The results from
      the study will provide evidence about which assistance modalities for PLHIV work best to
      improve ART adherence and retention in care, and under what conditions. This study will be
      conducted in Shinyanga Region, Tanzania, where approximately 17 percent of households have
      poor or borderline food consumption and 7.4 percent of people are living with HIV infection.

  <detailed_description>

      The investigators will randomize 785 food insecure women and men who recently initiated ART
      (determined with the Household Hunger Scale1) into one of three groups: 1) NAC alone , 2) NAC
      plus food assistance, or 3) NAC plus cash transfers. Food assistance will be a standard food
      ration consisting of maize flour, groundnuts, and beans. The cash transfer will be the
      equivalent value as the food ration (approximately $13 USD/month). Participants will receive
      the monthly food ration or cash transfer for up to six months if they continue to receive
      monthly HIV care (the standard of care). The investigators will compare the effect of NAC and
      food or cash assistance to the effect of NAC alone on ART adherence and retention in care at
      6, 12, and 24-36 months (Objective #1). The investigators will also compare the effectiveness
      of NAC plus food assistance and NAC plus cash transfers to determine if their effects are the
      same (Objective #2).

    <description>ART adherence will be measured with the medication possession ratio (MPR), the proportion of time an individual is in possession of &gt;1 ARV or prescription for ARV. MPR is computed as the number of days ARVs are prescribed or dispensed divided by the number of days in the interval, and has been shown to be associated with short-term virologic outcomes. We will determine the proportion of patients with MPR ≥95% in each of the study arms.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. at least 18 years of age;

          2. living with HIV infection;

          3. initiated antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV infection in the last 90 days;

          4. food insecure, as measured with the Household Hunger Scale; and

          5. willing and able to provide written informed consent for the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        PLHIV who are severely malnourished (BMI&lt;18.5) will be excluded from the study, as these
        individuals require therapeutic food support (ready-to-use food products for nutritional
        recovery). In this study, we will enroll food insecure PLHIV who are at risk of
        malnutrition but are not severely malnourished (BMI&gt;18.5).
