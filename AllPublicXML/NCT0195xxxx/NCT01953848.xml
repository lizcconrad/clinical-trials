  <brief_title>A Study to Evaluate How Tamsulosin (at 1 Dose) and Solifenacin (at 2 Different Doses) Are Taken up From the Intestine, Distributed Through the Body and Eliminated From the Body When Administered in Combination as a Single Tablet (Called EC905)</brief_title>
  <official_title>An Open-label, Randomized, Two-way Crossover, Multiple Dose Study to Evaluate the Steady State Pharmacokinetics of the Two Final Combination Tablet Formulations (EC905; Tamsulosin HCl/ Solifenacin Succinate; 0.4 mg/6 mg and 0.4 mg/9 mg) in Healthy Male Volunteers Over 45 Years of Age</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tamsulosin (sold under the name Omnic OCAS) is used for treatment of voiding complaints
      related to an enlarged prostate. Solifenacin (sold under the name Vesicare) is used for the
      treatment of patients suffering from problems related to overactive bladder, such as needing
      to go to the toilet frequently and often having a sudden urgent need to go to the toilet.
      Certain patients with an enlarged prostate have complaints that may benefit from a
      combination of tamsulosin and solifenacin. EC905 is a single tablet containing both
      tamsulosin and solifenacin. The current study aims at investigating how tamsulosin and
      solifenacin are taken up from the intestine, distributed through the body and eventually
      eliminated from the body when taken as a single EC905 tablet.

      In this study there are two sequence groups with 27 subjects in total. In Period 1, subjects
      are randomized to receive one of the two final combination tablet formulations of tamsulosin
      HCl and solifenacin succinate. In Period 1, 13 subjects receive one combination and 14
      subjects receive the other combination. In Period 2, the alternate treatment is provided.

      Screening takes place from Days -21 to -2 before the first admission day (Day -1). EC905 is
      administered from Day 1 to Day 12 (treatment period 1), and from Day 13 to Day 24 (treatment
      period 2). All treatments are administered with subjects in the fasted state.

      Blood samples for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis of tamsulosin HCl and solifenacin free base
      are collected, and assessments of vital signs, safety electrocardiogram (ECG), safety
      laboratory, adverse events and concomitant medications are performed.

      Subjects are discharged on day 25 and an End of Study Visit takes place at least 10 days
      after the second treatment period, or after withdrawal.
