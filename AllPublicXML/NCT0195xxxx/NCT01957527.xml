    <textblock>
      Ticagrelor administration, whose molecule resembles to adenosine, led to reduction in overall
      mortality and thrombotic cardiovascular (CV) events when directly compared to clopidogrel in
      the PLATO trial, implicating possible pleiotropic actions for the drug. It has been shown
      that ticagrelor increases adenosine concentration, by interfering with its red blood cells'
      uptake and by inducing the release of ATP which is then converted to adenosine. Recent
      studies in healthy volunteers and patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) have shown that
      ticagrelor increases the coronary blood flow in response to intravenous adenosine
      administration. Ticagrelor administration, in comparison with other P2Y12 inhibitors, may
      influence the endothelial function, as assessed by the Peripheral Arterial Tonometry method
      (EndoPAT 2000 system (Itamar Medical, Caesarea, Israel), which is a method for evaluating
      endothelial dysfunction and has been found to positively correlate with flow mediated
      dilatation (FMD).

      This is a prospective, observational study, which will be conducted in patients with coronary
      artery disease subjected to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) under ticagrelor
      maintenance dose (MD) 90mg x 2, who are about to stop treatment, due to completion of 1 year
      antiplatelet therapy. Eligible patients will be subjected to peripheral arterial tonometry at
      Day 0 (immediately after receiving the last pill of ticagrelor) and at day 2 and day 5 post
      study drug discontinuation. Peripheral blood sample will be taken from the patients at Day 0
      for genotype analysis.
