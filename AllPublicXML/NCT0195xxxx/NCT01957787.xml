      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of cryoablation therapy used
      to treat tumors in patients with pulmonary metastatic disease. This study is to enroll
      patients who will undergo cryoablation of at least 1 metastatic pulmonary tumor that is less
      than or equal to 3.5cm. Patients will be followed 24 months post their cryoablation
      procedure.

    <textblock>
      Treatment for pulmonary metastatic disease may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation
      therapy, or a combination of treatments. However, several variables may exclude patients from
      these treatments such as multiple tumors, multiple previous surgeries, pulmonary dysfunction,
      or co-morbid medical conditions. For these patients, percutaneous cryoablation may be a
      suitable option.

      Ablation of metastatic lung tumors is a rapidly expanding area within interventional
      oncology. Cryotherapy, radiofrequency, laser and microwave have all been shown to be
      effective. Cryotherapy offers a wide range of anatomic and tumor treatment options because of
      the ability to visualize the ice under imaging guidance and the preservation of collagenous
      tissue structure. Cryoablation has been extensively performed in the prostate and kidney with
      favorable outcomes reported in the literature. More recently, cryoablation has been shown to
      be safe in the treatment of lung tumors with CT guidance.

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in physical function</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Physical function assessments will be measured using Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS). The Karnofsky Performance Scale is a standard way of measuring the ability of cancer patients to perform ordinary tasks. The scores range from 0 to 100. A higher score means the patient is better able to carry out daily activities. KPS may be used to determine a patient's prognosis, to measure changes in a patient's ability to function. Assessments will be made by examining the change in the baseline scores to those reported post-operatively.
KPS will be assessed at screening and months 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24.</description>

    <measure>Changes in quality of life over time</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>This protocol will utilize the Short Form-12 (SF-12) generic measure. The SF-12 is a shortened version of the well-known SF-36. The SF-12 uses twelve items to assess eight domains (physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health problems, bodily pain, social functioning, general mental health, role limitations due to emotional problems, vitality, general health perception). The shorter instrument will provide a general measurement of quality of life. Assessments will be made by examining the change in the baseline scores to those reported post-operatively.
SF-12 will be completed by the patient at screening, month 1 and month 3.</description>
