      the purpose of this study is to develop and validate a new PRO measurement tool for the knee
      joint, the so-called Munich Knee Questionnaire (MKQ), allowing for a qualitative
      self-assessment of the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), the International
      Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), the Lysholm Knee Score, the Western Ontario Meniscal
      Evaluation Tool (WOMET) and the Tegner Score.

      A systematic review of the literature was performed to identify valid and commonly used
      instruments regarding follow-up examinations in the field of knee surgery. PubMed.gov was
      searched for knee-specific terms (knee, surgery, joint, lower extremity) combined with
      psychometric (follow-up, validity, reliability, responsiveness) and instrument-specific terms
      (self-reported, patient-based, measurement tool, outcome measure, questionnaire). Hence, the
      KOOS, IKDC, Lysholm, WOMET and Tegner Score were identified as frequent used and valid
      measurement tools in the evaluation of knee joint function. After analysing each single
      question of these questionnaires for coincidences regarding measurement of specific knee
      function, the identified items were condensed to one single question for each specific item.
      Typical functional abilities (flexion/extension) were depicted as photographs. Thus, one
      single questionnaire with a total of 33 questions divided in five subscales (Symptoms, Pain,
      Work and Activities of daily life, Sports and Recreational activities, Physical function and
      knee related Quality of Life), was created.
