  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this clinical study is to observe the therapeutic effect of acupuncture and
      intradermal acupuncture in the treatment of insomnia

      Participants were randomized into the acupuncture group and control group. Both groups were
      treated 3 times in a week and assessed before and after the treatment.

      Hypothesis :

        1. Acupuncture group will produce superior effect in the treatment of insomnia compared
           with control group.

        2. Acupuncture group will produce superior improvement in anxiety, depression, quality of
           life, sleep log, recognition, attention, and memory.

      The acupuncture group is received acupuncture and intradermal acupuncture therapy at 5
      acupoints on wrist and ankle. The control group is received same treatment at 5 sham points
      approximately 1cm lateral to the acupoints.

      Except for the location of acupuncture points, all details of treatment are same between
      acupuncture group and control group. A certified practitioner treat both groups 3 times in a
      week. The acupuncture inserted into the skin for 20 minutes and the intradermal acupuncture
      inserted and fixed on the same points for 48~72 hours.

      Severity of insomnia, anxiety, depression, quality of life, recognition, attention, and
      memory are assessed at the baseline, after the last treatment and at a week after the end of
      last treatment.

    <description>Acupuncture and intradermal acupuncture The acupuncture was applied at 5 acupoints(HT7 Shenmen, PC6 Neiguan, SP6 Sanyinjiao, KI6 Zhaohai, BL62 Shenmai) 3 times in a week. It was performed by a certified practitioner with sterile needles (0.25*40.0mm). The needles were inserted at least 10.0mm deep through the skin and maintained for 20 minutes The intradermal acupuncture was applied at the same acupoints, immediately after the acupuncture needles were removed. It was performed by the same practitioner with sterile needles (0.20*8.0mm).attached to skin tape (10.0*10.0mm). The needles were inserted 3.0~5.0mm deep and maintained for 48~72 hours</description>
