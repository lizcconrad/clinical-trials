  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ischemic stroke (AIC) is the leading cause of non-traumatic disability in adults, the second
      leading cause of dementia and the third leading cause of death in France.

      Clopidogrel is one of the recommended first line in the secondary prevention of AIC non
      cardioembolic origin. However recurrences occur in approximately 9% of patients receiving
      clopidogrel. Some studies in patients with coronary artery disease have made the connection
      between these treatment failures and non-biological response to clopidogrel. This
      non-biological response is found for approximately 30% to 50% of patients. Several mechanisms
      may explain this non-response. The most accepted mechanism is pharmacokinetic. Indeed,
      clopidogrel is a prodrug that requires intestinal absorption by P-glycoprotein (PGP) and a
      transformation by hepatic cytochrome into active metabolites. The genetic polymorphism of
      proteins involved in these two steps explain the low plasma concentration of active
      metabolites and thus the low efficacy of clopidogrel in some patients.

      A new pharmacodynamic hypothesis suggests the involvement of platelet alpha 2-adrenergic
      receptors. The activation of these receptors potentiates signaling pathway P2Y12 receptor
      (channel inhibited by clopidogrel) and helps reduce platelet aggregation inhibiting response
      to clopidogrel.

      Interest in the biological response to clopidogrel in the AIC is innovative because few data
      are available in this area. In addition to testing a new pharmacodynamic hypothesis, we also
      wish to study and compare other measures of platelet function methods in order to be able to
      use commonly in treatment decisions.
