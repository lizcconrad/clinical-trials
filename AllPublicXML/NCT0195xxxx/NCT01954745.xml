  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating a drug called cabozantinib as a possible treatment cancer
      of the bile duct. Cabozantinib is a drug that targets specific pathways inside the cells of
      the body. By blocking the c-MET and VEGFR2 pathways from sending signals, cabozantinib may
      prevent cells from multiplying. This drug has been used in other research studies and
      information from those other research studies suggests that this drug may help to stop the
      growth of bile duct cancer.

      In this research study, the investigators are looking to see how well cabozantinib works in
      slowing the growth of bile duct cancer. The investigators are also assessing the safety and
      tolerability of cabozantinib in participants with this type of cancer.

      After the screening procedures confirm that the participants are eligible to participate in
      the research study:

      A two-stage design will be employed in this study where at least 9 of the 20 patients
      enrolled in the first stage need to be progression-free at 16 weeks before the second stage
      can proceed. If this criterion is met, an additional 24 patients will be enrolled in the
      second stage for a total of 44 patients in the study. Patients will be treated with
      cabozantinib 60 mg daily administered orally continuously for 28-day cycles. Tumor
      assessments will be performed every 8 weeks until documented disease progression by RECIST
      criteria or drug intolerance.

      In this research study, the participant will be given a study drug-dosing diary for each
      treatment cycle. Each treatment cycle lasts 28 days (4 weeks), during which time the
      participant will be taking the study drug, cabozantinib daily. The diary will also include
      special instructions for taking the study drug(s).

      The participant will continue to take cabozantinib for as long as it is tolerated without any
      unacceptable side effects and the cancer does not get worse.

      The following tests and procedures will be done during the research study:

      Cycle 1 - On days 1, 8 and 15

        -  Medical History

        -  Physical Exam including vital signs and height and weight

        -  Performance Status

        -  Review of side effects (day 8 and 15 only)

        -  Routine blood tests (day 8 and 15 only)

        -  TSH blood sample on day 1 only

      Additional research procedures during Cycle 1:

        -  Medical History

        -  Physical Exam including vital signs, height and weight

        -  Urine pregnancy test on day 1 of each cycle for women of childbearing potential

        -  TSH blood sample on day 1 only

      Cycle 4 and Beyond: Day 1 ONLY

        -  Medical History

        -  Physical Exam including vital signs, height and weight

      The following tests will be done every 2 cycles during the research study:

        -  CA 19-9 blood sample

        -  Tumor measurements

        -  Chest/Abdominal/Pelvic CT/MRI of your tumor

      Planned Follow-up:

      The participant will return to the clinic between 30-37 days after the last dose of
      cabozantinib for the following tests and procedures:

        -  Medical History

        -  Physical Exam including vital signs, height and weight

             methods of contraception (eg, male or female condom) during the course of the study
             and for 4 months after the last dose of study drug(s), even if oral contraceptives are
             also used. All subjects of reproductive potential must agree to use both a barrier

             for 12 or more months are still considered to be of childbearing potential if the
             amenorrhea is possibly due to prior chemotherapy, antiestrogens, ovarian suppression
             or any other reversible reason.

             biopsy is permitted if completed at least 3 months before starting study treatment.
             (Baseline brain imaging with contrast-enhanced CT or MRI scans for subjects with known

             indicative of significant pulmonary hemorrhage within 3 months before the first dose
             of study treatment.

          -  The subject has radiographic evidence of cavitating pulmonary lesion(s)

          -  The subject has a lesion abutting, invading, or encasing a major blood vessel.

          -  The subject has evidence of tumor invading the GI tract (esophagus, stomach, small or
             large bowel, rectum or anus), or any evidence of endotracheal or endobronchial tumor
             within 28 days before the first dose of cabozantinib.

          -  The subject has received any other type of investigational agent within 28 days before
             the first dose of study treatment.

          -  The subject has a corrected QT interval calculated by the Fridericia formula (QTcF)
             &gt;500 ms within 28 days before randomization. . Note: if initial QTcF is found to be &gt;
             500 ms, two additional EKGs separated by at least 3 minutes should be performed. If
             the average of these three consecutive results for QTcF is ≤ 500 ms, the subject meets
             eligibility in this regard

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to cabozantinib.

          -  The subject requires concomitant treatment, in therapeutic doses, with anticoagulants
             such as warfarin, warafarin-related agents, heparin, thrombin inhibitors, Factor Xa
             inhibitors, or antiplatelet agents (eg, clopidogrel). Low dose aspirin (≤ 81 mg/day),
             low-dose warfarin (≤ 1 mg/day), and prophylactic Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH)
             are permitted.

          -  The subject requires concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers (eg, dexamethasone,
             phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentin, phenobarbital, and St.
             John's Wort) or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole,
             clarithromycin, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, and ritonavir).

          -  The subject has received prior treatment with a small molecule kinase inhibitor or a
             hormonal therapy (including investigational kinase inhibitors or hormones) within 14
             days or five half-lives of the compound or active metabolites, whichever is longer,
             before the first dose of study treatment. Note: Subjects with prostate cancer
             currently receiving LHRH or GnRH agonists may be maintained on these agents.

          -  The subject is unable to swallow tablets

          -  Individuals who are known to be HIV-positive are excluded from this study. HIV
             positive individuals are at increased risk of lethal infection when treated with
             marrow-suppressive agents, and cabozantinib has not adequately been tested in this
             population. Also, antiretroviral therapy may have pharmacokinetic interactions with
             cabozantinib that have not been fully characterized yet.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study due to the potential for teratogenic or
             abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk of adverse
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with cabozatinib,
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with cabozantnib. These
             potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.

          -  Subjects may not be receiving any other study agents concurrently while on this study

Cabozantinib: Cabozantinib 60 mg (free base weight) per day will be administered daily and continuously for a cycle length of 28 days. Subjects will be provided with a sufficient supply of study treatment and instructions for taking the study treatment on days without scheduled clinic visits. After fasting (with exception of water) for 2 hours, subjects will take study treatment daily with a full glass of water (minimum of 8 oz/ 240 mL) and continue to fast for 1 hour after each dose of study treatment.</description>
