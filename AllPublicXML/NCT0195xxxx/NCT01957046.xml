  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to assess how effective and tolerable the country specific
      clinical practice guidelines of SLTs are for UK, France and Sweden are.

      The main rationale behind this study is that well controlled comparisons of the various
      laxatives for the treatment of OIC are lacking. There is lack of evidence suggesting which
      laxative or combination of laxatives is optimal for managing OIC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study comprises of nine study visits and the total duration of the study is up to 42-52
      days Potential subjects, aged 18 years and over, with OIC will be screened for entry into the
      study at Visit 1 Eligible subjects will attend a 7-day Screening Period (Visit 1). This will
      be followed by a 28-day Treatment Period (visits 2 to 8:), made up of four clinic visits
      scheduled 7 days apart (visits 5(day 7), 6(day 14), 7(day 21), 8(day 28): days 7 to 28) and
      two telephone visits (visits 3 and 4) which will take place during the first week of the
      Treatment Period. There will be a 7-day Follow-up Period with a follow-up phone call to
      conclude the study (Visit 9).

      Study assessment/ evaluation include vital sign measurements, ECG, safety labs, pregnancy
      test and physical examination assessments, AEs, Investigator and subject questionnaires and
      subjects daily diaries.

      Subjects will continue to take their prescribed pre-study opioid medication throughout the
      study.

             to the first dose of study medication, be non-lactating, and willing to use adequate
             and highly effective methods of contraception throughout the study. (A highly
             effective method of birth control is defined as those which result in a low failure
             rate (i.e. less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly e.g.
             sterilisation, implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some intrauterine
             devices ((IUDs), hormonal), sexual abstinence or vasectomised partner).

          -  Documented history of malignant or non-malignant pain that requires around-the-clock
             opioid therapy (WHO step II/III opioid analgesics).

          -  Subjects treated with WHO step II/III opioid analgesics for at least 2 weeks prior to
             Screening Visit (Visit 1), who will continue with the opioid(s) over the proposed
             study period.

          -  Subjects meeting the following criteria for OIC:

               -  Subject and Investigator confirm that the Subject's constipation is induced, or
                  worsened by the Subject's opioid medication (present at Screening)

               -  Subjects with mean BFI score &gt; 30 at Visit 1

               -  Subjects with &lt; 3 complete bowel movements (CBMs) in the week preceding the Visit
                  1, based on Subject's retrospective memory in response to Investigator's
                  question.

          -  Subjects taking at least one laxative on regular basis (i.e. ≥2 intakes per week
             during the ≥2 weeks prior to screening) for the treatment of OIC.

          -  Subjects must be willing to take SLT.

          -  Subjects taking daily natural dietary fibre supplementation are eligible if they can
             maintain their diet throughout the study, and in the Investigator's opinion are
             willing and able to maintain adequate hydration.

          -  Subjects must be willing and able (e.g. mental and physical condition) to participate
             in all aspects of the study, including use of medication, completion of subjective
             evaluations, attending scheduled clinic visits, completing telephone contacts, and
             compliance with protocol requirements as evidenced by providing written, informed
             consent.

          -  In the Investigator's opinion the Subject's concomitant medication dose will remain
             stable throughout the study Period (here concomitant medications mean all medications
             besides opioids (standard and rescue opioid treatment)).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Medical Conditions:

          -  In the Investigator's opinion any contraindication and precautionary condition for
             laxative medication(s) used in the study as per the SmPC.

          -  Subjects having any potential non-opioid cause of constipation that might be a major
             contributor.

          -  Surgery within 2 months prior to the start of the Screening Visit (Visit 1), or
             planned surgery during the Screening and Treatment periods that may affect GI
             motility.

          -  Subjects with colostomy or ileostomy.

          -  Hospitalisation expected/planned within the study Period (e.g. planned hospitalisation
             for the treatment of a pre-existing condition before informed consent) which can
             affect the outcome measure analysis.

        Treatments/Medications:

        • Subjects presently taking, or who have taken opioid antagonist(e.g. naloxone, naltrexone
        and methylnaltrexone) or opioid antagonists containing products (e.g. oxycodone/naloxone,
        buprenorphine/naloxone, pentazocine/naloxone, tilidine/naloxone) &lt; 30 days prior to the
        start of the Screening Period.

          -  Subjects already taking maximum daily dose of country specific SLT (both First and
             Second Line SLT) on a regular basis (i.e. ≥4 days per week) for the treatment of OIC.

          -  Subjects receiving opioid substitution therapy for opioid addiction (e.g. methadone or
             buprenorphine).

        Additional Screening Exclusion Criteria for Subjects Suffering from Non-malignant Pain:

        - Subjects who participated in a clinical research study involving a new chemical entity or
        an experimental drug within 30 days of study entry

        Additional Screening Exclusion Criteria for Subjects Suffering from Malignant Pain:

          -  Subjects who have received a new chemical entity or an experimental drug within 30
             days of study entry (defined as Visit 1). Concurrent participation in another clinical
             trial is not permitted except the epidemiological study performed to assess the
             long-term survival data.

          -  Subjects with an expected life expectancy of &lt; 3 months.
