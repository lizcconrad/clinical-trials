  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether AMG 333 is safe and well tolerated
      in healthy subjects and subjects with migraines. As part of the secondary objectives, this
      study will characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of AMG 333, as well as characterize
      the effect of AMG 333 on the cold pressor test (CPT)-induced increase in blood pressure after
      single oral doses in healthy subjects and subjects with migraines

      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending single-dose study
      evaluating AMG 333 in healthy subjects and subjects with migraines. The study will consist of
      8 cohorts: 7 cohorts of healthy subjects and 1 cohort of subjects with migraines. For cohorts
      1 to 7, 8 subjects each will be enrolled, and subjects will be randomized such that 6
      subjects will receive AMG 333 and 2 subjects will receive placebo (3:1 ratio). In cohort 8,
      up to 24 subjects with migraines will be enrolled, depending on enrollment rate and emerging
      safety and tolerability data. These migraine subjects will be randomized to receive AMG 333
      or placebo in a crossover fashion. Both healthy and migraine subjects will be monitored in
      house for 4 days then allowed to return home for the remainder of the 14 day observation
      period. Both healthy and migraine subjects will keep headache diaries.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male and female subjects with or without migraines ≥18 and ≤55 years of age at
             the time of screening, with no history or evidence of clinically relevant medical
             disorders as determined by the investigator in consultation with the Amgen physician.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History or evidence of a clinically significant disorder, condition, or disease that,
             in the opinion of the investigator and Amgen physician, would significantly impair
             pain perception (eg, history of stroke, history of neuropathy) or interfere with
             evaluation, procedures, or study completion.
