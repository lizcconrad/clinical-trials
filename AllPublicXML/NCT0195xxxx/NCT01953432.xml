  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cocaine use disorders affect approximately 1.5 million Americans annually. Currently, there
      are no US Food and Drug Administration approved medications for treatment of cocaine
      dependence; however, both animal and human studies suggest that medications affecting the
      noradrenergic system can reduce cocaine craving and use. The investigators will study the
      effect of doxazosin, an alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist, in reducing cocaine use and anxiety
      symptoms among cocaine-dependent individuals. In addition, the investigators will identify
      genetic subpopulations of participants who preferentially respond to the medication.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The noradrenergic system, especially the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor, may play an important
      role in cocaine addiction in humans. Doxazosin is a long-acting and selective alpha
      1-adrenergic receptor blocker, which inhibits the binding of norepinephrine to alpha
      receptors in the autonomic nervous system. This study will evaluate the efficacy of doxazosin
      in reducing cocaine-using behavior in treatment seeking cocaine-dependent individuals, and
      will guide future pharmacotherapy trials using Doxazosin or related alpha 1 receptor
      antagonists for treatment of cocaine addiction. Additionally, this study will identify
      genetic subpopulations of participants for whom doxazosin is preferentially effective,
      specifically examining the R492C functional polymorphism of the ADRA1A gene.

      This 15-week double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial will provide treatment for 100
      cocaine-dependent patients and includes a 13 week medication trial (weeks 1-13) and up to 2
      week washout period (weeks 14-15). Qualifying subjects will be randomized to receive
      Doxazosin 8 mg/day, or placebo during the study participation.

      Subjects will be receiving 2 mg study medication/placebo capsules at week 1, with 2mg/week
      induction rate for 3 weeks, according to their randomized assignments, and are maintained on
      these agents through week 13. During the course of the trial, all participants will receive
      manual-guided cognitive behavioral therapy. At the end of the study (weeks 14-15),
      participants will undergo discontinuation from active/placebo medication over a 2-week
      period. Subjects who wish to be transferred to an appropriate treatment program or
      treatment-research program will be helped with referral during the 2 week period (weeks
      14-15).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Current diagnosis of other drug dependence, especially alcohol or benzodiazepine
             dependence, or abuse (other than cocaine, tobacco, or cannabis)
