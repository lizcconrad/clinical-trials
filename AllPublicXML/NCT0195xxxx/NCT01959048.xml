  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clostridium difficile has become one of the leading causes of hospital acquired infections,
      and is associated with increased mortality. Patients with C. difficile associated disease
      (CDAD) possess deficiencies in 'normal' fecal microbial composition, most likely as a result
      of earlier antibiotic usage. The current standard of care treatment for severe C. difficile,
      which consists of antibiotics, does not restore the microbiota. Restoration of the normal
      colonic microbiota by fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) may enable reversion colonic
      microbial population to a more 'normal'state and lead to cure.

      A few patients develop severe CDAD which may be complicated by adynamic ileus, or toxic
      megacolon. The management in this context is based on limited data, and for some the only
      available option is sub-total colectomy.

      Although FMT is by no means a new therapeutic modality, there is limited information on its
      use for the treatment of acute CDAD, including severe CDAD. Because of the high morbidity and
      mortality associated with treatment of patients with severe CDAD, and because the evidence
      supporting the current recommendations is weak and based upon the demonstration that FMT is
      an effective strategy to re-establish a balanced intestinal microbiota with resultant cure of
      recurrent CDAD, we propose to study the efficacy and safety of FMT for severe CDAD.

      Patients with severe CDAD can be divided into two operational groups; those that have
      diarrhea and those that suffer from adynamic ileus. We propose to apply FMT through
      colonoscopy for all patients because current data suggest that the overall success rate of
      FMT for recurrent CDAD with lower gastrointestinal tract FMT was higher than FMT through the
      upper gastrointestinal tract. In addition, for patients with adynamic ileus and toxic
      megacolon (i.e., the population with the highest CDAD-associated morbidity and mortality),
      intra-colonic FMT administration is the preferred alternative.

        5. Stool suspension drawn up into 50 mL slip-tip syringes

      Procedure

        1. Informed consent for colonoscopy obtained including the additional theoretical risk of
           infection related to fecal transfusion

        2. Document that examination of the colon is not adequate for cancer screening purposes
           (stool infusion interferes with visualization)

        3. Colonoscopy performed aiming to reach the cecum with or without decompression without
           bowel inflation. If the cecum is not reachable the injection will be performed at the
           most distal site.

        4. No biopsies taken

        5. Upon withdrawal, injection of the fecal suspension via the biopsy channel of a
           colonoscope, majority into the right colon. Deliver between 300-500 ml.

      Post procedure

      1. Patient encouraged to retain stool (if possible) for 4 hours

      Clinical and laboratory follow up

        1. A blood culture will be drawn immediately following the procedure

        2. Subjects will be followed during hospitalization and after discharge for at least 30
           days. Data on symptoms of CDAD, on-going medical history review, physical examination,
           and laboratory tests as described in Table 1 will be collected.

        3. Safety will be assessed by monitoring the subjects for adverse events.
