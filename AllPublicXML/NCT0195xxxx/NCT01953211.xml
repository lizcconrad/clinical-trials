  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The degree of suppression and subsequent activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian
      axis during the hormone-free interval in combined oral contraceptive (COC) hormone users
      varies depending on the dose of ethinyl estradiol in the formulation. This variation in
      activation may be associated with different side effects during the hormone free interval.
      Progesterone (P) remained suppressed during all 6 COC regimens (&lt;1.8 ng/mL), which indicates
      continuous contraceptive efficacy during the 7-day hormone free interval of all formulations
      studied.

        Healthy, reproductive age women 18 to 35 years old, who were seeking contraception from the
        general gynecology clinics of the LAC and USC Medical Center were recruited. The research
        team identified potential candidates who were taking one of 6 possible monophasic COC
        formulations. Informed consent was obtained from participants by the research staff. To be
        eligible for participation, women reported regular menstrual cycles prior to COCs, and had
        taken at least 3 cycles of the same monophasic COC prior to enrollment.
