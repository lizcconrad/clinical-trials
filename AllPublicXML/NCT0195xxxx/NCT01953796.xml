      The objective of our study is to evaluate the efficacy of the clomiphene stair-step protocol
      to induce ovulation in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) compared to traditional
      protocol.

      Methods:This was a randomized controlled clinical trial at the Fertility clinic of Al sadder
      teaching hospital at Al- Najaf city, Iraq . It included 140 women who met all of the
      inclusion criteria, they were divided into two groups; 65 patients for the stair step
      protocol and 75 patients for the traditional protocol.

      Overall study design This was a randomized clinical trial using toss a coin as randomization
      technique carried out on subfertile women attending the Fertility Clinic of AL Sadder
      Teaching Hospital at Al- Najaf city, Iraq from May 2010 till May 2011. 170 infertile women
      were selected at that time for study participation after their written consent.

      Participant, recruitment and randomization:

      The diagnostic criteria adopted for PCOS was according to Rotterdam ESHRE/ASRM sponsored PCOS
      consensus workshop group, 2004 based on the presence of two of the following three criteria:
      i.e. Oligo- and/or anovulation, hyperandrogenism clinical and/or biochemical, Polycystic
      ovaries, an ovary with 12 or more follicles measuring 2-9 mm indiameter and increased ovarian
      volume (&gt;10 cm3) on transvaginal ultrasound(1) .

    <description>50 mg clomiphene given for 5 days beginning on day 2 of the cycle. Tv USS done at days 11-14. When there is no response (no follicle &gt;10 mm), 100 mg clomiphene is initiated immediately for 5 days, and U/S is repeated 1 week after the first tvUSS at day 21. If there is no response, another 150 mg clomiphene is initiated immediately for 5 days and U/S is performed 1week after the second U/S (day28). Ovulation for the stair-step cycles was confirmed by folliculometry (follicle tracing) by tvUSS.</description>

    <description>Clomiphene medication was initiated at day two of the cycle. The starting dose was 50 mg/day for 5 consecutive days. In case of absent response, the patient was treated with 10 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) for10 days. Daily doses of clomiphene citrate were increased by 50 mg in the next cycle up to 3 treatment cycle. In each cycle monitoring of follicular growth was done by tvUSS at day 11-14 of each cycle. First ovulation was used as the endpoint and the duration of follow-up was three treatment cycles (up to 150mg). Ovulation was assessed by tvUSS monitoring of follicle growth.</description>

    <description>For both protocols follow up of the follicular growth has been made by frequent tvUSS monitoring, which have the advantage of providing direct information about the size and number of follicle and measurement of endometrial thickness during clomiphene medication.</description>
