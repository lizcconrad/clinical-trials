      Purpose: African American cancer patients, as compared to their White counterparts, continue
      to initiate treatment later and remain less apt to undergo complete treatment; fueling worse
      treatment outcomes including shorter survival. The concepts of &quot;transparency&quot; and
      &quot;accountability,&quot; as mechanisms of systems change have been applied for decades by
      anti-racism organizations to civil rights and social change. Yet, the application of these
      concepts to health systems' change and unequal treatment has rarely been done. The Greensboro
      Health Disparities Collaborative and two Cancer Centers have joined together to specify
      structures built into cancer care systems that make cancer care vulnerable to institutional
      racism and investigate how they can be changed to reduce racial inequity in quality and
      completion of treatment for Stage 1-2 breast and lung cancer patients.

      Participants: White and African American patients with first diagnosis of Stage 1-2 breast
      and lung cancer, with intention to treat, and their cancer care staff at 2 cancer centers.
      The 2 cancer centers are Cone Health Cancer Center (CHCC) in Greensboro, North Carolina and
      the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) Hillman Comprehensive Cancer Center in
      Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

      Procedures (methods): Using a 5-year interrupted time-series, with an embedded randomized
      control trial (RCT) study design, we will test the effectiveness of the ACCURE intervention
      components. Having received Institutional Review Board approval for Phase 1, we completed a
      5-year, retrospective review of de-identified Electronic Medical Record data to establish a
      baseline of repeated outcome measures, convening of an expert committee to design the
      intervention, and design of the real-time, electronic breast and lung cancer registry coupled
      with dummy testing of the registry system.

      The randomized trial will compare patients who receive usual care to those who receive visits
      and calls from a trained ACCURE Navigator, who is well versed in issues specific to breast
      and lung cancer and trained to serve as a two-way communication bridge to optimize the cancer
      care system's accountability and transparency for equity in quality of care. Given
      unintended, but likely variation in implementation of the ACCURE intervention by the two
      Cancer Centers (at our two research sites), 6 elements of implementation and their potential
      effect on outcomes will be documented through a process evaluation.

      The ACCURE Interventions include:

        1. Quality Improvement / Race specific feedback for providers regarding breast and lung
           surgery and adjuvant treatments.

        2. A real time registry with automated electronic health record feeds that provides warning
           signs if milestones in cancer care have not been met or if patients miss scheduled
           appointments

        3. Health Equity Training for cancer center staff at quarterly intervals

        4. Accure Navigation (based on special training regarding trust, culturally appropriate
           communication, and Kleinman's Patient Model of Illness)

        5. Additional efforts will be made to collect information on symptoms and side effect
           management from patients and medical charts.

    <description>For those patients assigned to the ACCURE Navigator, the ACCURE Real-Time Registry is programmed to automatically alert the Navigator when a patient misses a scheduled treatment appointment and to require the Navigator to include details as to how she addressed and resolved that missed appointment, ensuring the ACCURE Navigator's proactive approach to addressing such issues. In addition, a warning message will be produced if no follow-up appointments or procedures are scheduled within 21 days of the index visit.</description>

    <description>The ACCURE Real-Time Registry will automatically alert the ACCURE Navigator to follow a schedule of patient-interactions. The Navigator has been trained to employ the &quot;teachback&quot; method of patient education as appropriate per encounter. For instance: (1) initial face-to-face interaction, after the patient's first visit with the oncologist; (2) telephone call 3 business days after the initial visit; (3) contact the patient 10-21 days after the initial visit; and (4) after treatment has begun, contacting the patient every 8 weeks.It is projected that 50% of the staff will attend the Healthcare Equity Training (HET) and Booster Sessions.</description>
