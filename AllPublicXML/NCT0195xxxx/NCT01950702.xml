      Light wand intubation is well known for safety intubation in cervical injury patiets.
      Traditional method of using light wand can damage the supraglottic cavity by scooping the
      apparatus. The investigators try to evaluate the efficacy of laryngoscope assisted light wand
      intubation compared to traditional method of using light wand alone.

    <description>After standard total intravenous anesthesia using propofol and remifentanil continuous infusion, traditional lightwand intubation was done by pre-specified anesthesiologist who experienced more than 100 times of lightwand intubation.
Patient's head were fixed at neutral position during all intubation period.</description>

    <description>After standard monitoring(EKG, pulse oximetry, NIBP), participants were induced with remifentanil and propofol continuous infusion, using targe-controlled infusion device with prexoygenation with 100% oxygen.
Manual in-line stabilization was applied with velcro during intubation to maintain neutral head position.
The Macintosh laryngoscope (female: 3rd blade, male: 4th blade) was inserted into the oral cavity to provide direct view of the epiglottis and then the tip of the lightwand was placed below the epiglottis.</description>

Manual in-line stabilization was applied with velcro during intubation to maintain neutral head position.
After 2min from administration of rocuronium, the clinician holds the wand similar to a pencil, stands directly behind the patient's head, inserts the device into the side of the mouth and sweeps the tip to the midline. After confirmation of precise location via clear light source on anterior neck, endotracheal tube was inserted and withdrawn lightwand.</description>
