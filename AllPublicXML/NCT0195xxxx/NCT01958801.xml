      plexus blocks in the patients undergoing arthroscopic shoulder surgery.

      This study aims to compare supraclavicular brachial plexus block to interscalene brachial
      plexus block with regard to degree of sensory and motor blockades, side effects and
      complications of the blocks, and frequency of intraoperative analgesics or antihypertensives
      use.

    <measure>Degree of sensory blockade</measure>
    <time_frame>20 minutes after the end of local anesthetics injection</time_frame>
    <description>Sensory blockade of the C5 to T1 dermatomes was assessed by rating the absence of cold sensation between 100 (intact sensation) and 0 (no sensation) with an alcohol swab.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Degree of motor blockade</measure>
    <time_frame>20 minutes after the end of local anethetics injection</time_frame>
    <description>Motor blockade was evaluated by elbow and wrist extension (radial nerve), finger abduction (ulnar nerve), wrist flexion (median nerve), and elbow flexion (musculocutaneous nerve). The muscle force was rated on a scale of 0 to 6 as follows (6: normal muscle force; 5: slightly reduced muscle force; 4: greatly reduced muscle force; 3: slightly impaired mobility; 2: greatly impaired mobility; 1: near complete paralysis; 0: complete paralysis).</description>

    <description>Interscalene block is performed under ultrasound guidance. Linear probe is placed on the ipsilateral interscalene groove visualizing the brachial plexus located between anterior and middle scalene muscles. Using in-plane technique, nerve stimulation needle is advanced into the brachial plexus sheath, into which 25 ml of 1.5% mepivacaine is injected.</description>

    <description>Supraclavicular block is performed under ultrasound guidance. Linear probe is placed on the ipsilateral supraclavicular fossa visualizing the brachial plexus located lateral to the subclavian artery. Using in-plane technique, nerve stimulation needle is advanced into the brachial plexus sheath, into which 25 ml of 1.5% mepivacaine is injected.</description>
