      This pilot research trial studies collecting, analyzing, and storing samples from patients
      with triple negative breast cancer (breast cancer cells that do not have estrogen receptors,
      progesterone receptors, or large amounts of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 protein)
      that has spread to other places in the body receiving anti-cancer therapy. Studying samples
      of tissue, blood, buccal swab, saliva, and urine in the laboratory from patients receiving
      anti-cancer therapy may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in deoxyribonucleic
      acid (DNA) and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To establish the safety and feasibility of collecting, analyzing and storing clinically
      annotated panomic and other data from serially monitored subjects with metastatic triple
      negative breast cancer (TNBC) who receive care from up to ten oncology practices across the
      United States.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether molecular changes associated with resistance to treatment can be
      identified.

      II. To understand subject perceptions regarding panomic data and its application to cancer
      treatment.

      III. To apply other technologies to the characterization of subject tumors as they become
      available.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo collection of tissue biopsy, blood, buccal mucosa, saliva, and urine at
      baseline. Additional biopsies may be performed prior to treatment change.

      After completion of biopsy, patients are followed up at 1 day and 7 days. Patients will be
      followed indefinitely or for as long as they agree to be in the study, depending on the
      availability of resources.
