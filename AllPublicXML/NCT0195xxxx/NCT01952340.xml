  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The World Health Organization has deemed high blood pressure as a global crisis because it is
      the number one risk factor associated with most deaths worldwide. Therefore, the need for
      effective and desirable treatment options is vitally necessary. The purpose of the current
      investigation is to determine the efficacy of a new therapeutic strategy: flaxseed. The aim
      is to determine the efficacy of consuming milled flaxseed every day for 6 months on the
      reduction of blood pressure in individuals newly diagnosed with high blood pressure yet to
      receive any blood pressure lowering medications. Secondary objectives are to understand how
      flaxseed at the molecular level can reduce blood pressure. The study hypothesis is that the
      flaxseed group will exhibit significant reductions in blood pressure and therefore not
      require any blood pressure lowering medication. The aim is to provide knowledge on a new
      therapeutic strategy to help manage high blood pressure.

      This trial is a phase II/III, randomized, double-blinded, controlled clinical trial to
      determine the efficacy of dietary flaxseed as a therapeutic strategy to reduce blood pressure
      in newly diagnosed hypertensive individuals. The aim of the trial is to recruit 100
      participants that have been clinically diagnosed with hypertension within 6 months and yet to
      receive any anti-hypertensive medication. The control and flax groups will be provided food
      products to consume on a daily basis for 6 months. Assessment parameters such as averaged
      automated blood pressure, anthropometrics, 24-food recall, physical activity questionnaire,
      and blood and urine analysis will be conducted at baseline, 2, 4, and 6 months.
