  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares costs and effectiveness / utility of three common orthopedic surgeries in
      shoulder and hand from the perspective of the Swiss health system and the clinic.

      The cost of health care is continuously rising, making economic considerations part of the
      decision process, in particular for the allocation of available resources. However,
      cost-effectiveness and cost-utility studies of interventions in the upper extremities are
      rare. The purpose of this study is to gain more information and to provide a basis for the
      decision process.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Among various recognized methods used to assess the benefits and value of medical services,
      cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) and cost-utility analysis (CUA) are taking an increasingly
      important role. Over recent years, economic evaluations gained interest in orthopedics,
      suggesting the inclusion of economic factors in addition to traditional outcome measures in
      the evaluation of surgical interventions.

      This is a prospective mono-center observational study involving three independent patient
      groups (Total shoulder prosthesis for arthritis (TSA), Arthroscopic repair of rotator cuff
      tears (RCR), Trapeziectomy for Trapeziometacarpal Osteoarthritis (TMC OA)) of 150 patients
      each. Before-and-after comparisons will be made: Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility data
      collected post-operatively up to one (TMC OA) and two years (TSA and RCR) will be compared
      with those collected up to one year pre-operatively. Eligible patients unwilling to receive
      surgery will be followed-up for one and two years, respectively, to allow for a parallel
      comparison group.

    <measure>Change of Constant (Murley) score (CS) due to surgery in TSA- and RCR-patients</measure>
    <time_frame>preOP, immediately preOP, 3, 6 months postOP. TSA additionally: 12, 24 months postOP</time_frame>
    <description>The Constant (Murley) score is possibly the most commonly used tool for assessment of shoulder function. The physician asks and documents answers to Quality of life questions (pain and activity of daily living, ability to work, sleep, sports and leisure) and certain clinical parameters (active range of motion, abduction strength). The different scales will be summed and normalized to 0 = worst to 100 = best. A German version is available for clinical use.
With the CS we can assess the change and gain in functional shoulder outcome.</description>

    <measure>Change of Kapandji index and grip + key pinch strength due to surgery in TMC OA-patients</measure>
    <time_frame>preOP, immediately preOP, 3, 6, 12 months postOP</time_frame>
    <description>The ability to oppose the thumb of both hands will be quantified using the Kapandji index. The flexion/extension of the metacarpo-phalangeal (MCP) and inter-phalangeal (IP) joint of the affected and contralateral thumb will be measured with an electrical Goniometer (ELINK, Biometrics Ltd., Gwent, UK).
Grip strength as well as key pinch strength of both hands will be measured with the help of an electrical dynamometer and pinch gauge (ELINK, Biometrics Ltd., Gwent, UK). Three records will be taken and the mean value will be taken for analyses. The standardized testing position as recommended by the American Society of Hand Therapists will be used.</description>

    <measure>Change of Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) during study participation in TSA-patients</measure>
    <time_frame>preOP, immediately preOP, 3, 6, 12, 24 months postOP; respectively 6, 12 and 24 months after enrollment for non-operated patients</time_frame>
    <description>The Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) is a short, self-administered questionnaire that provides an item scoring by a visual analogue scale (VAS) from 0 (no pain/no difficulty, i.e. best) to 11 (worst pain imaginable/so difficult required help, i.e. worst). Five items assess pain and 8 items disability of the arm (function). The unweighted means of the 5 pain and the 8 function items will be transformed into the scale from 0 (=worst) to 100 (=best) for both scales and are used to determine pain and function scores. The average of these two scores then gives the total SPADI score. A validated German version is available.</description>

    <measure>Change in Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS) during study participation in RCR-patients</measure>
    <time_frame>preOP, immediately preOP, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months postOP; respectively 6, 12 and 24 months after enrollment for non-operated patients</time_frame>
    <description>The OSS is a condition-specific questionnaire developed for patients with a degenerative or inflammatory state of the shoulder. It contains 12 items to be answered by the patient independently, which deal with pain (degree, time point) and possible handicaps in private and professional life. There are five categories of response for every question, corresponding to a score ranging from 0 to 4. Scores are combined to give a single score, with a range from 0 (worst outcome) to 48 (best outcome). The score can also be standardized from 0 to 100 (best) for comparison with other outcome instruments. A German version of this questionnaire is available and it is suitable for patient-based outcome after rotator cuff repair.</description>

    <measure>Change in Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire (brief MHQ) during study participation in TMC OA-patients</measure>
    <time_frame>preOP, immediately preOP, 3, 6, 12 months postOP; respectively 6 and 12 months after enrollment for non-operated patients</time_frame>
    <description>The Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire MHQ was specifically designed to measure health state domains important to patients with hand disorders. In contrast to the widely applied DASH, the MHQ seems to be more sensitive to functional changes in hand patients. Compared to the DASH and Patient Evaluation Measure, the MHQ shows the highest correlation in finger patients with grip strength and range of motion.
In this study we will use a short version of the MHQ that includes only 12 questions for patients with acute or chronic disorders of the hand. The answers are rated on a 5-point Likert scale and scores are normalized on a scale of 0 to 100. The brief MHQ demonstrated an excellent test-retest reliability.</description>

    <measure>Change in Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire (QuickDASH) during study participation in TSA- and TMC OA-patients</measure>
    <time_frame>TMC OA + TSA: preOP, immediately preOP, 3, 6, 12 months postOP. TSA additionally: 24 months. 6, 12 and 24 months after enrollment for non-operated patients.</time_frame>
    <description>The Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire (DASH) is a comprehensive self-administered questionnaire about symptoms and functioning of the entire upper extremity. The DASH enquires about the ability to perform simple and complex activities of daily living (ADL) that are commonly performed with either one or both arms. The total score is derived from the unweighted mean of 30 items, of which at least 27 have to be answered. The QuickDASH is a more efficient version of the DASH outcome measure that appears to retain its measurement properties. It contains eleven items and is similar with regard to scores and properties to the full DASH. A validated full-length German version is available that can be used in the shortened version.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Subjective shoulder value (SVV) during study participation in TSA- and RCR-patients</measure>
    <time_frame>RCR + TSA: preOP, immediately preOP, 3, 6, 12, 24 months postOP; respectively 6, 12 and 24 months after enrollment for non-operated patients</time_frame>
    <description>The Subjective Shoulder Value (SSV) is based on a single question that is answered subjectively by the patients. The formulation of this question is: &quot;What is the overall percent value of your shoulder if a completely normal shoulder represents 100%?&quot; It is an easily administered measure of shoulder function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in general health during study participation</measure>
    <time_frame>preOP, immediately preOP, 3, 6, 12 months postOP. TSA + RCR additionally: 24 months postOP; ; respectively 6, 12 and 24 months after enrollment for non-operated patients</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome measure &quot;general health&quot; is a composite of these three questions:
patients will be asked to report their general health status on a visual analog scale from 0 (worst possible health) to 100 (best possible health) using the EQ-5D-5L instrument.
In addition, patients will be asked to assess their current state of health related to the operated shoulder or hand at follow-up compared to the state before surgery. This so-called 'transition' question has the possible answers 'much worse', 'slightly worse', 'equal', 'slightly better', and 'much better'.
A similar question will be asked regarding their perceived change in quality of life at follow-up compared to the state before surgery.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in level of satisfaction during study participation</measure>
    <time_frame>preOP, immediately preOP, 3, 6, 12 months postOP. TSA + RCR additionally: 24 months postOP. ; 6, 12 and 24 months after enrollment for non-operated patients</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome measure &quot;level of satisfaction&quot; is a composite of these two questions:
Patients are asked to rate their level of satisfaction, with the help of a numeric rating scale (NRS: 0-10), in terms of how the outcome met up to their preoperative expectations.
Finally, they will be asked whether - with their current knowledge of the outcome - they would again choose the operation if they found themselves in similar circumstances to those which prevailed preoperatively.</description>
