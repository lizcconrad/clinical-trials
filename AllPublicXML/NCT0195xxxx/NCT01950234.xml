  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study to
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH, Acthar
      gel) administered as a pulsed regimen consisting of injections on three consecutive days per
      month in patients with progressive forms of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Patients will be
      randomly assigned to either an ACTH arm or a placebo arm. The main hypotheses are that 1)
      pulsed ACTH will be safe and well-tolerated, and 2) pulsed ACTH will slow progression of
      clinical and paraclinical measures of MS progression compared to placebo.

          -  Able to understand the consent process

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known intolerance of ACTH or corticosteroids

          -  Diabetes mellitus, defined as pre-existing diagnosis, fasting blood glucose &gt; 125
             mg/dl, or glycosylated hemoglobin &gt;/= 6.5%

          -  Current serious medical condition which may interfere with subject's ability to
             complete the study, or for which pulsed ACTH therapy is contraindicated or might
             complicate current therapy (e.g., cancer, severe psychiatric illness, chronic
             infections, autoimmune disorders)

          -  Treatment with cytotoxic agents (including but not necessarily limited to
             mitoxantrone, cyclophosphamide, alemtuzumab, or rituximab) within 3 years prior to
             randomization

          -  Treatment with non-cytotoxic immunosuppressive agents (including but not necessarily
             limited to corticosteroids, ACTH, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate or
             natalizumab) within 3 months prior to randomization

             glatiramer acetate, fingolimod, teriflunomide or dimethyl fumarate) will be permitted,
             as long as treatment has been ongoing and stable for at least 3 months prior to
             randomization

          -  Treatment with dalfampridine or compounded 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) will be permitted as

          -  Stimulant medications for fatigue (such as methylphenidate, modafinil, armodafinil,
             amantadine or dextroamphetamine) will be permitted, but subjects will be asked to not
             take these medications on study visit days until all study procedures/assessments are
