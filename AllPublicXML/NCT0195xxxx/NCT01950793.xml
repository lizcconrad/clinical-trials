  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is to compare the effect between steroid injection and Hyaluronic acid in treatment
      trigger finger. Using sonoguided injection technique achieves more accurate injection
      location and therapeutic effect. We hypothesize hyaluronic acid has both lubricant and
      anti-inflammation effect in treatment of trigger finger, and can provide better outcome and
      lower adverse effect than steroid injection.

      This is a prospective, randomized, double-blinded controlled study. Patients with the
      diagnosis of trigger finger will be recruited and enrolled from Taipei Veteran General
      Hospital PM&amp;R outpatient clinic. Subjects will be randomized into two groups; hyaluronic acid
      and triamcinolone acetonide injections, both via ultrasound-guided with one injection only.We
      hypothesize that through the anti-inflammatory property of the hyaluronate acid, the
      treatment effects will be as effective as the traditionally used steroid injections with
      equal or even lower recurrence rate for treatment of trigger finger. We expect that
      injections of hyaluronate into tendon sheath could become a new treatment option for trigger
      finger.
