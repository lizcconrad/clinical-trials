      Individuals with insomnia have been shown to have higher overall metabolic rates compared to
      good sleepers, but it is not known which metabolic processes are involved. The goal of this
      study is to compare a wide array of metabolic processes in 15 people with insomnia and 15
      good sleepers. We hypothesize that there will be distinct metabolic processes that are
      functioning differently in those with insomnia.

    <description>Metabolomics analysis of blood samples were carried out using Spectroscopy. This approach allows for rapid, unbiased and quantitative metabolic profiles ('fingerprints) to be acquired. A total of 70 metabolites were measured and compared between individuals with insomnia and good sleepers.</description>

    <time_frame>1 night</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will have their sleep measured with polysomnography for one night. The sleep of individuals with insomnia will be compared to that of good sleepers. Sleep quality is defined as sleep efficiency, which is calculated at total sleep time / total time spent in bed x 100. It indicates the % of time spent asleep while in bed.</description>

        <title>Number of Metabolites Elevated Relative to the Other Group.</title>
        <description>Metabolomics analysis of blood samples were carried out using Spectroscopy. This approach allows for rapid, unbiased and quantitative metabolic profiles ('fingerprints) to be acquired. A total of 70 metabolites were measured and compared between individuals with insomnia and good sleepers.</description>

            <title>Individuals With Insomnia</title>
            <description>Participants with insomnia met the following Research Diagnostic Criteria for primary insomnia: subjective complaint of difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, waking up too early or nonrestorative sleep, daytime consequences as a result of the poor sleep, duration of at least 1 month, sleep disturbance is not secondary to a medical or psychiatric condition based or the effects of a substance, as determined by clinical history. In order to exclude individuals with mild insomnia, insomnia had to occur on 3 or more nights per week for three months or longer. A 30-minute criterion was used such that subjects had to report taking 30 minutes or longer to fall asleep and/or spend 30 minutes awake during the night.</description>

A 15-minute criterion was used such that subjects had to report taking 15 minutes or less to fall asleep and spend 15 minutes or less awake during the night.</description>

        <title>Sleep Efficiency Percentage on Overnight Sleep Study</title>
        <description>Participants will have their sleep measured with polysomnography for one night. The sleep of individuals with insomnia will be compared to that of good sleepers. Sleep quality is defined as sleep efficiency, which is calculated at total sleep time / total time spent in bed x 100. It indicates the % of time spent asleep while in bed.</description>
