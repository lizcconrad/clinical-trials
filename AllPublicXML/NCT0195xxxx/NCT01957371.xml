  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the current study is to establish the safety and acceptability of
      Mindful Yoga Therapy as an adjunctive treatment for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and
      chronic pain among OEF/OIF/OND Veterans. The current study also seeks to establish
      preliminary efficacy of MYT for reduction of PTSD and chronic pain symptoms and explore
      anxiety sensitivity as a mechanism of therapeutic action.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PTSD is a chronic, debilitating anxiety disorder associated with disability, functional
      impairment, and a host of co-morbid physical and mental health conditions. Although several
      treatments are successful in treating Veterans with PTSD, many Veterans fail to complete
      these treatments and many others complete treatment without significant relief from symptoms.
      Yoga is one integrative treatment option that has shown promise for a number of physical and
      mental health conditions, including the treatment of depressive, and anxiety disorders in
      civilian samples, and chronic pain in Veterans. Yoga is widely offered in Veterans Affairs
      (VA) PTSD Treatment Programs, yet there is a lack of research on its efficacy for PTSD in
      Veterans.

      Mindful Yoga Therapy (MYT) is a 12-week treatment protocol incorporating meditation,
      breathing exercises, mindful movement practice, and guided rest (yoga nidra) that has been
      developed specifically for Veterans with PTSD. This pilot clinical trial will examine the
      efficacy of MYT with baseline, 12 week, and 24 week follow-up assessments that will include
      diagnostic, neurocognitive, and psychophysiological measures conducted by a research team
      member blinded to the study purpose.

    <description>Shoulder, hip, and, knee measurements will be obtained. Specifically, flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, medial rotation and lateral rotation will be assessed on the right and left shoulders. Lumbar flexion, extension, and lateral flexion will also be assessed. Flexion, extension, medial rotation and lateral rotation will be assessed on both hips, and flexion/extension will be assessed in both knees. Normal angles of joint movement according to age and sex will be taken from the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons and used as a referent for each participant.

    <measure>YMCA Sit and Reach Test</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Individuals will first be asked to engage in a 5 minute warm up by walking around the room. They will then sit on the floor with their legs outstretched in front of them and their feet perpendicular to the floor (toes facing up). A vertical 12 inch box will be placed against their feet. The participant will then be asked to place one hand over the other such that the tops of their two middle fingers will be on top of one another. Finally, the participant will be instructed to slowly stretch forward and slide their fingers along the box as far as possible. A ruler will be used to measure the distance they can reach. This test will be repeated three times and the best score will be retained.</description>

    <measure>90-90 Hamstring Test</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The participant will be instructed to lie supine with the tight leg outstretched with the foot perpendicular to the floor (toes facing up). The left hip and knee are flexed to 90 degrees and the participant wraps both hands around the thigh to brace the leg; this is the starting position. The participant then extends the left knee into the air until they feel a stretch in the hamstring. A goniometer is used to measure the degree of knee extension. This procedure is then repeated on the opposite leg. A difference of 20 degrees of flexion or more is indicative of hamstring tightness.</description>
