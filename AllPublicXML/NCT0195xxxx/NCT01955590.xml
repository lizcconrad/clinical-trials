  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a frequently occurring and often debilitating anxiety
      disorder resulting from exposure to trauma. Trauma-focused cognitive-behavioural therapies,
      such as Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR), are generally considered to be
      evidence-based treatments for PTSD. Although a majority of patients achieve improvement, a
      substantial minority either drop out of treatment, present with residual symptoms following
      treatment or fail to make any improvement. Furthermore, a substantial portion of the clinical
      trials on PTSD is characterised by major methodological limitations. In addition, there's a
      pressing need for research on mediators of treatment outcome. Taken together, these results
      highlight the need for methodological rigorous and stringent clinical trials comparing
      treatment modalities for PTSD. The first aim of this study is to investigate whether a
      treatment not based on the principles of exposure, i.e. metacognitive therapy (MCT) is as
      efficient as exposure-based treatments. The second aim to elucidate potential mediators of
      treatments effects by incorporating process-related variables.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      EMDR is based on the assumption that posttraumatic symptoms are due to the traumatic
      experience(s) being stored in an unprocessed way disconnected from existing memory networks.
      The procedure in EMDR is postulated to facilitate the processing of the traumatic memory into
      existing memory networks. There is currently no empirical knowledge as to the therapeutic
      mechanisms of EMDR, but the protocol overlaps with core components of cognitive behavior
      therapy (CBT), such as imaginal exposure and cognitive restructuring of negative
      trauma-related cognitions. Thus, EMDR could be viewed as a form of CBT, although its
      originator maintains that it is a distinct treatment. EMDR is usually considered an
      evidence-based treatment of PTSD.

      MCT is one of the new approaches in the treatment of PTSD. The metacognitive model posits
      that adaptation following exposure to trauma depends on metacognitive beliefs that guide how
      the individual interprets and responds to posttraumatic symptoms and can lead to styles of
      thinking that facilitate or impede emotional processing. MCT focuses on &quot;unlocking&quot; or
      removing the barriers to natural adaptation. This equips the client with general skills and
      therefore protects the individual from the risk of any future re-traumatisation. In contrast
      to EMDR, MCT does not involve proscribed exposure exercises or restructuring of negative
      trauma-related cognitions.

      In addition we will include a group of 30 patients matched for age, gender and personality
      disorders receiving treatment as usual (TaU) in an outpatient setting as a non-randomized
      comparative control condition.
