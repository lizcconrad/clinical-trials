  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to compare the effects of MV targeted ASV in addition to optimized
      medical therapy versus optimized medical therapy alone at 6 months in patients with acute
      decompensated HF. The study will also assess changes in functional parameters, biomarkers,
      quality of life (QOL), and sleep.

      This study is a randomized, unblinded, multi-center trial with parallel group design, with
      subjects randomized to either control (optimized medical therapy for chronic heart failure)
      or active treatment (optimized medical therapy plus use of MV-targeted ASV) in a 1:1 ratio.

    <measure>Global Rank Endpoint</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>A rank order response based on survival free from CV hospitalization and improvement in functional capacity measured by 6MWD. All participants were first ranked by time to death, then ranked by time to CV hospitalization, and then ranked by percentage change in 6MWD. For time to event measures (time to death and time to hospitalization), the shorter the amount of time, the lower the rank assigned to that participant. For percentage changes in 6MWD, the smaller the percentage change, the lower the rank assigned to that participant. Each component was then combined to create a rank value that ranged between 0 and 100. Overall, higher rank values are associated with better outcomes.</description>

    <description>Patients in the new treatment and control groups are formed into matched pairs based on their risk profiles. For each matched pair, the new treatment patient is labeled a 'winner' or a 'loser' depending on who had a CV death first. If that is not known, they are labeled a 'winner' or 'loser' depending on who had a HF hospitalization first. Otherwise they are considered tied. The win ratio is the total number of winners divided by the total numbers of losers.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized self-report questionnaire that is used as a measure of health outcome. The EQ-5D-5L questionnaire is comprised of the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. Responses were indexed using the EQ-5D-5L US value set to scale the 5 dimensions. A score of -0.109 indicates extreme problems for all dimensions and a score of 1.000 indicates no problems for all dimensions. Therefore, a higher score indicates better general health.</description>

    <description>The PHQ-9 is the nine item depression scale of the Patient Health Questionnaire. The PHQ-9 is a self-administered instrument for screening, diagnosing, monitoring and measuring the severity of depression. The PHQ-9 incorporates DSM-IV depression diagnostic criteria with other leading major depressive symptoms into a brief self-report tool. The tool rates the frequency of the symptoms which factors into the following scoring severity index: 0 - Not at all, 1 - Several Days, 2 - More than Half the Days, 3 - Nearly Every Day. Total score can range from 0 to 27. A higher score indicates increased severity.</description>

    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index is a 19-item subjective measurement of sleep. It is an effective instrument used to measure the quality and patterns of sleep in the older adult. It differentiates &quot;poor&quot; from &quot;good&quot; sleep by measuring seven areas: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication and daytime dysfunction over the last month. The subject self-rates each of these seven areas of sleep. The seven component scores are then added to yield a total score with a range of 0-21 points, &quot;0&quot; indicating no difficulty and &quot;21&quot; indicating severe difficulties in all areas.</description>

    <measure>ESS</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Epworth Sleepiness Scale is a simple, 8-item self-administered questionnaire which provides a measurement of the subject's general level of daytime sleepiness. The individual is asked on a scale of 0-3 to score the likelihood of falling asleep in eight various situations. With a total range of 0 to 24, a higher score indicates increased severity.</description>

          <description>NYHA Class I: Cardiac disease, but not symptoms and no limitation in ordinary physical activity, e.g. shortness of breath when walking, climbing stairs etc.
NYHA Class II: Mild symptoms (mild shortness of breath and/or angina) and slight limitation during ordinary activity.
NYHA Class III: Marked limitation in activity due to symptoms, even during less-than-ordinary activity, e.g. walking short distances (20-100m). Comfortable only at rest.
NYHA Class IV: Severe limitations. Experiences symptoms even while at rest. Mostly bedbound patients.</description>

        <title>Global Rank Endpoint</title>
        <description>A rank order response based on survival free from CV hospitalization and improvement in functional capacity measured by 6MWD. All participants were first ranked by time to death, then ranked by time to CV hospitalization, and then ranked by percentage change in 6MWD. For time to event measures (time to death and time to hospitalization), the shorter the amount of time, the lower the rank assigned to that participant. For percentage changes in 6MWD, the smaller the percentage change, the lower the rank assigned to that participant. Each component was then combined to create a rank value that ranged between 0 and 100. Overall, higher rank values are associated with better outcomes.</description>

        <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized self-report questionnaire that is used as a measure of health outcome. The EQ-5D-5L questionnaire is comprised of the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. Responses were indexed using the EQ-5D-5L US value set to scale the 5 dimensions. A score of -0.109 indicates extreme problems for all dimensions and a score of 1.000 indicates no problems for all dimensions. Therefore, a higher score indicates better general health.</description>

The PHQ-9 is a self-administered instrument for screening, diagnosing, monitoring and measuring the severity of depression. The PHQ-9 incorporates DSM-IV depression diagnostic criteria with other leading major depressive symptoms into a brief self-report tool. The tool rates the frequency of the symptoms which factors into the following scoring severity index: 0 - Not at all, 1 - Several Days, 2 - More than Half the Days, 3 - Nearly Every Day. Total score can range from 0 to 27. A higher score indicates increased severity.</description>

        <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index is a 19-item subjective measurement of sleep. It is an effective instrument used to measure the quality and patterns of sleep in the older adult. It differentiates “poor” from “good” sleep by measuring seven areas: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication and daytime dysfunction over the last month. The subject self-rates each of these seven areas of sleep. The seven component scores are then added to yield a total score with a range of 0-21 points, &quot;0&quot; indicating no difficulty and &quot;21&quot; indicating severe difficulties in all areas.</description>
