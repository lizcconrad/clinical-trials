  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is universally accepted that high-pressure balloon inflation is required to most
      effectively deploy a coronary balloon-expandable stent. However, there is not consensus nor
      are there any guidelines regarding the method of balloon inflation, particularly the duration
      of inflation. Underexpansion and strut malapposition after stent deployment are among the
      most powerful predictors for adverse vessel outcomes. High-pressure inflation for stent
      deployment is effective to optimally expand the stent, but unlike in vitro testing in air,
      there are poorly distensible plaque elements that may not instantaneously yield to the
      balloon pressure. However, these elements may ultimately yield to prolonged inflation. Most
      clinical interventional cardiologists inflate for a relatively short period (15-30 sec). The
      investigators have noted that when balloon pressure is maintained at a certain pressure level
      it tends to decrease over time, and may require 60-180 or more seconds to maintain pressure
      stability. This finding implies that plaque elements are yielding slowly over time to the
      increased pressure, thus increasing expansion, and suggests that a prolonged inflation until
      balloon pressure stabilizes is more effective than a rapid inflation/deflation sequence to
      fully expand and appose the stent to the vessel wall. At present there is no consensus on
      stent deployment strategy. It is our hypothesis that prolonged inflation is superior to the
      more commonly used strategy of rapid inflation/deflation.

      Optimal coherence tomography (OCT), a novel technology that measures near-infrared light
      reflections and translates them into a 2D image, has an axial resolution nearly 10-times that
      of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). Thus it is possible to examine the extent of stent
      apposition and stent expansion using this modality.

      The current randomized trial tests the hypothesis that prolonged balloon inflation until a
      stable balloon pressure is maintained is more effective than a rapid inflation/deflation
      sequence when performed to the same balloon inflation pressure.
