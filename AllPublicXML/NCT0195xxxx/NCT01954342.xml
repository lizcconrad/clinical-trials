    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure energy intake and energy expenditure during and after
      pregnancy. The investigators hypothesize that obese pregnant women with weight gain above the
      IOM guidelines, 'High Gainers', will have increased energy intake but no evidence for changes
      in energy expenditure after adjustment for the weight gained when compared to women with
      appropriate gestational weight gain, 'Normal Gainers'. Additionally, the investigators will
      measure the babies born to the pregnant women enrolled in MomEE at one time point before 10
      days of life.
