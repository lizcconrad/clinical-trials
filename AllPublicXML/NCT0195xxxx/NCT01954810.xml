        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject who was vaccinated with 1 dose JE-CV in JEC02 and participated in 5 year
             follow-up in JEC05 trial and finished year 5 of follow-up.

          2. Provision of Informed Consent Form signed by at least one parent or other legally
             acceptable representative.

          3. Subject and parent/legally acceptable representative or guardian able to attend all
             scheduled visits and to comply with all trial procedures

          4. In good general health, based on medical history and physical examination

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Participation in another clinical trial investigating a vaccine which need to have
             vaccination or blood draw within the 4 weeks preceding the trial vaccination except
             JEC05

          2. Planned participation in another clinical trial during the Day0-Day28 period

          3. Receipt of live vaccine within 4 weeks preceding the trial vaccination

          4. Planned receipt of any vaccine in the 4 weeks following the trial vaccination

          5. Receipt of blood or blood-derived products in the past 3 months, which might interfere
             with assessment of the immune response

          6. Known systemic hypersensitivity to any of the vaccine components, or history of a
             life-threatening reaction to the vaccine used in the trial or to a vaccine containing
             any of the same substances

          7. Chronic illness or any underlying illness that, in the opinion of the investigator, is
