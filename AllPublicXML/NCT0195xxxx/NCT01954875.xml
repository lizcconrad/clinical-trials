  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The etiology of many neurodegenerative diseases is unknown. A few studies have suggested the
      role of infection in the gastrointestinal tract in the etiology and pathogenesis of
      neurological diseases such as idiopathic Parkinson. For example, infection with Helicobacter
      pylori has been suggested to play a role in Parkinson disease. In addition, bacterial
      pathogens such as spirochetes and bacterial products such as cyanobacterial toxins have been
      speculated as the contributing factors in the development of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
      (ALS). The effect of microbial composition of the gut in the pathogenesis of ALS is
      suspected. The difference in the bacterial profile of the gut has been documented in diseases
      such as inflammatory bowel disease and obesity.

      The goal of this IRB protocol is to create a human tissue bank and to obtain patients'
      demographic information for future investigation of the role of bacterial pathogens and the
      role of gut flora composition in the development of neurodegenerative diseases including but
      not limited to ALS, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis.
