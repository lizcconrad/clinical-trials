      The LOTUS Study is intended to demonstrate the usability of the MICHI Neuroprotection System
      (MICHI NPS) or MICHI Neuroprotection System with filter (MICHI NPS+f) for use in subjects who
      are candidates for Carotid Artery Stenting (CAS). It is a prospective, single arm study in
      which a maximum of 30 study subjects, and a run-in enrollment of up to 10 subjects will be
      followed immediately post-op and at 30 days.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject must be &gt; 21 years of age.

          -  Subject has the ability to understand and cooperate with study procedures and agrees
             to return for all required follow-up visits, tests, and exams.

          -  International Normalized Ratio (INR) must be ≤ 1.5 at the time of the procedure
             (subjects taking warfarin may be included if their dose is tapered prior to the
             procedure to meet the inclusion criterion. Dose may be returned to a therapeutic level
             after the procedure).

          -  The subject must sign a written informed consent prior to the procedure, using a form
             that is approved by the local medical Ethics Committee (EC).

          -  The life expectancy of the subject is at least one year.

          -  The subject has a lesion located in the internal carotid artery (ICA); the carotid
             bifurcation may be involved.

          -  The subject must have a minimum distance of 5 cm between the clavicle and bifurcation,
             as assessed by duplex Doppler ultrasound, computed axial tomographic (CT) angiography
             or magnetic resonance (MR) angiography.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject is participating in another investigational study that would interfere
             with the conduct or result of this study.

          -  The subject has dementia or a neurological illness that may confound the neurological
             evaluation.

          -  Presence of any one of the following anatomic risk factors:

               -  Previous radiation treatment to the neck or radical neck dissection

               -  Tracheostomy or tracheal stoma

               -  Laryngectomy

               -  Contralateral laryngeal nerve palsy

               -  Severe tandem lesions

               -  Inability to extend the head due to cervical arthritis or other cervical
                  disorders

          -  Total occlusion of the target vessel.

          -  There is an existing, previously placed stent in the target artery.

          -  The subject has a known life-threatening allergy to the contrast media that cannot be
             treated.

          -  Subject has history of intolerance or allergic reaction to any of the study
             medications including aspirin, clopidogrel bisulfate (Plavix®) or ticlopidine
             (Ticlid®), prasugrel heparin or bivalirudin (Angiomax™). Subjects must be able to
             tolerate a combination of aspirin and clopidogrel/ticlopidine or prasugrel.

          -  The subject has a gastrointestinal bleed that would interfere with antiplatelet
             therapy.

          -  The subject has known cardiac sources of emboli.

          -  Subject has Hemoglobin (Hgb) less than 8 gm/dL (unless on dialysis), platelet count &lt;
             50,000/mm3, or known heparin associated thrombocytopenia.

          -  Subject has documented atrial fibrillation in the prior 90 days.

          -  The subject has a history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy including
             thrombocytopenia or an inability to receive heparin in amounts sufficient to maintain
             an activated clotting time (ACT) at &gt; 250, or if the subject will refuse blood
             transfusions.

          -  The subject has atherosclerotic disease involving the ipsilateral common carotid
             artery (CCA) that precludes safe placement of the sheath.

          -  The subject has abnormal angiographic findings other than that of the target lesion
             that indicate the subject is at risk for a stroke, such as: ipsilateral arterial
             stenosis greater in severity than the target lesion, cerebral aneurysm, or
             arteriovenous malformation of the cerebral vasculature.

          -  There is evidence of a carotid artery dissection prior to the initiation of the
             procedure.

          -  There is an angiographically visible thrombus.

          -  There is any condition that precludes proper angiographic assessment or makes
             percutaneous arterial access unsafe, e.g. morbid obesity, sustained systolic blood
             pressure &gt; 180 mm Hg, tortuosity, occlusive disease, vessel anatomy or aortic arch
             anatomy.

          -  Occlusion (TIMI 0 flow), or string sign of the ipsilateral common or internal carotid
             artery.

          -  There is evidence of bilateral carotid stenosis that would require intervention within
             30 days of procedure.

          -  There is evidence of a major stroke (NIHSS ≥10) within the previous 30 days of the
             procedure or the patient is considered, by the investigator, to be at high risk for
             hemorrhagic stroke.

          -  There is a planned treatment of a non-target lesion within 30 days post procedure.

          -  There is a history of intracranial hemorrhage within the previous 3 months, including
             hemorrhagic transformation of an ischemic stroke.

          -  There is history of an ipsilateral stroke with fluctuating neurologic symptoms within
             one year prior to the procedure.

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant (negative pregnancy test is required in women of
             childbearing potential).

          -  Subjects, who the Investigator determines, to be at risk of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)
