  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blood sugar and insulin levels after a meal may be altered by the food and beverages a person
      consumes. Keeping a healthy blood sugar level may help prevent and manage type 2 diabetes and
      related diseases. This study will look at how drinking different common beverages (milk,
      low-fat milk, nonfat milk, orange juice, coffee, and water) with a meal changes blood sugar
      and insulin levels.

  <detailed_description>

      The broad aim of the proposed research is to evaluate the effects of consuming milk and
      non-milk beverages with a breakfast meal on postprandial glucose and insulin responses in
      overweight and obese adults with varying levels of glucose tolerance (normal, pre-diabetic,
      type 2 diabetes). The investigators expect the consumption of fluid milk with breakfast to
      decrease the postprandial glucose response relative to other non-milk beverages (orange juice
      and sweetened coffee). Furthermore, the investigators expect that there will be no difference
      in the postprandial glucose or insulin response between varieties of fluid milk (skim,
      low-fat, and whole).

    <description>Subjects will come to testing once a week for six weeks. Each testing day, subject will come in fasted, and a fasting blood draw will be taken. Subjects will then be fed a standard breakfast with one of the 6 beverages (coffee sweetened with sugar, orange juice, water, whole milk, skim milk, low fat milk). Blood will be taken at 30, 60, 60, 90, 120, 150,180,210,240 minutes after the meal.</description>
