        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Informed Consent Documents signed prior to screening evaluations related to this
             protocol

          -  Participation in the pivotal efficacy trial (trial 000004/ESTHER-1)

          -  Anti-FSH antibody results from baseline and at least one post-dosing assessment in the
             previous cycle(s) available.

          -  Having undergone the oocyte retrieval procedure, or having had cycle cancellation
             prior to oocyte retrieval due to poor ovarian response or excessive ovarian response,
             in the previous cycle(s).

          -  Failure to achieve ongoing pregnancy in the previous cycle(s).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Non-compliance to protocol compliance in the previous cycle(s).

          -  Having undergone any stimulation with gonadotropins since the end-of-trial /
             end-of-cycle visit in the previous cycle

          -  One or more follicles ≥10 mm observed on the transvaginal ultrasound prior to start of
             dosing on stimulation day 1

          -  Severe OHSS in a previous cycle.

          -  Any clinically relevant change to any of the eligibility criteria in the previous
             cycle(s).

          -  Clinically relevant medical history since the previous cycle which precludes
             gonadotropin stimulation or is associated with a reduced chance of pregnancy.
