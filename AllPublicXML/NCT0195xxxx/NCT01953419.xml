      This phase II trial aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of pemetrexed in patients with
      pretreated metastatic gastric cancer.

    <textblock>
      Patients enrolled in this study received pemetrexed 500mg/m2, once every 21 days, until the
      presence of progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. All patients took dexamethasone
      3.75 mg twice daily, starting from the day before and continuing to the day after the drug
      administration. Patients were instructed to take oral folic acid 400 mg daily beginning 5
      days before the first therapy and until the final therapy.Patients received Vitamin B12 very
      3 cycle of chemoherapy. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage
      colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or Erythropoietin (EPO) was not allowed, but they could be
      used when the patients suffered from bone marrow depression.
