  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Indomethacin is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) which reduces pain, fever,
      stiffness and swelling in acute skeletal musculature injuries involving joints. However, oral
      Indomethacin formulations predisposes for some systemic side effects. To avoid the systemic
      side effects of oral Indomethacin, a topical Indomethacin formulations have been developed
      and approved in some countries as an Over the counter product. Present study is to
      investigate the efficacy of the Indomethacin patch in pain relief of ankle sprain in adult
      patients.

    <measure>Sum of Pain Intensity Difference (SPID)1-3 Days</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) to Day 3</time_frame>
    <description>SPID was calculated as sum of products of Pain Intensity Differences (PID) at a given time-point (t) with the time-interval from that time-point to the previous time-point (t-1). The time-intervals used were 0 hrs (Day 1, pre treatment), 0.5 hrs, 1 hr, 2 hrs, 4 hrs, 8 hrs, 12 hrs, 24 hrs, 36 hrs and 48 hrs. Positive and higher scores indicate greater reduction in pain. SPIDt = ∑PID x (time t - time t-1).
Pain Intensity was assessed at baseline and at each time-point based on numerical rating scale (NRS) which is a horizontal line with a scale from 0-10, where 0 represents &quot;No&quot; and 10 represents the &quot;worst possible pain&quot;</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Relief Score (PRS) on Movement Over Time</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes (mins) to 144 hours (hrs) post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>PRS was assessed for pain on movement (walking 5 steps on flat surface) at 30, 60 minutes and 2, 4, 8 and 12 hrs after the first dose of treatment (indomethacin or placebo patch) and twice daily during the period from 12 hours to 24 hr, 36 hr, 48 hr, 60 hr, 72 hr, 84 hr, 96 hr, 108 hr, 120 hr, 132 hr and 144 hr between treatment groups.
Participants were asked to choose a number on a scale of 0 to 4, where, 0- No pain relief; 1- A little or perceptible pain relief; 2- Meaningful pain relief; 3- A lot of relief; 4- Complete relief. The mean PRS scores were calculated on the basis of participant's response based on the above score.</description>

    <measure>NRS for Pain on Movement Over Time</measure>
    <time_frame>30 mins to 144 hr post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>NRS was assessed for pain on movement (walking 5 steps on flat surface) at 30, 60 minutes and 2, 4, 8 and 12 hrs after the first dose of treatment (indomethacin or placebo patch) and twice daily during the period from 12 hours to 24 hr, 36 hr, 48 hr, 60 hr, 72 hr, 84 hr, 96 hr, 108 hr, 120 hr, 132 hr and 144 hr between treatment groups.
The NRS is a horizontal line with a scale from 0-10. After application of patch (indomethacin or reference patch), patients were asked to choose a number that relates to their pain intensity on the scale of 0 to 10, where 0 represents no pain and 10 represents the worst possible pain.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in NRS at Rest</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) to Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>Mean changes in pain intensity at each time point at rest twice daily (in the morning and afternoon) from treatment day 1 to day 7 between treatment groups at time points 0.5 hrs, 1 hr, 2 hrs, 4 hrs, 8 hrs, 12 hrs, 24 hrs, 36 hrs, 48 hrs, 60 hrs, 72 hrs, 84 hrs, 96 hrs, 108 hrs, 120 hrs, 132 hrs and 144 hrs was measured using NRS. The NRS is a horizontal line with a scale from 0-10. After application of patch (indomethacin or reference patch), participants were asked to choose a number that relates to their pain intensity on the scale of 0 to 10, where 0 represents no pain and 10 represents the worst possible pain.</description>

    <measure>Time to Onset of Pain Relief</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) to Day 3</time_frame>
    <description>Time to onset of pain relief was measured by the time to reach a pain relief score of &quot;1&quot; (&quot;A little or perceptible pain relief&quot;).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of Sum of Pain Intensity Difference (SPID) on Movement</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) to Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>SPID was calculated as sum of products of Pain Intensity Differences (PID) at a given time-point (t) with the time-interval from that time-point to the previous time-point (t-1). The time-intervals used were 0 hrs (Day 1, pre treatment), 0.5 hrs, 1 hr, 2 hrs, 4 hrs, 8 hrs, 12 hrs, 24 hrs, 36 hrs, 48 hrs, 60 hrs, 72 hrs, 84 hrs, 96 hrs, 108 hrs, 120 hrs, 132 hrs and 144 hrs. Positive and higher scores indicate greater reduction in pain. SPIDt = ∑PID x (time t - time t-1).
Pain Intensity was assessed at baseline and at each time-point based on numerical rating scale (NRS) which is a horizontal line with a scale from 0-10, where 0 represents &quot;No&quot; and 10 represents the &quot;worst possible pain&quot;.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sum of Pain Intensity Difference and Pain Relief (SPRID) on Movement</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) to Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>SPRID:Sum of Pain Intensity Difference (SPID) and Total Pain Relief (TOTPAR) at each post-dosing time-point.
SPRID score ranged from -5.8 (least pain relief) to 40.3 (highest pain relief). SPID and TOTPAR were calculated as weighted sums of Pain Intensity Differences (PID) and Pain Relief Scores (PRS) at each measurement time; 0 hr (Day 1, pre treatment), 0.5 hr, 1 hr, 2 hr, 4 hr, 8 hr, 12 hr, 24 hr, 36 hr, 48 hr, 60 hr, 72 hr, 84 hr, 96 hr, 108 hr, 120 hr, 132 hr and 144 hr, respectively.
PID was derived by subtracting the pain severity score at a given post-dosing time-point from the baseline [based on NRS which is a horizontal line with a scale from 0-10. where 0 represents &quot;No&quot; and 10 represents the &quot;worst possible pain&quot;]. NR scores were converted into PID scores by subtracting them from baseline pain scores.
PRS was assessed on 5-point categorical pain relief rating scale [0-no relief, 1-little relief, 2-some relief, 3-a lot of relief, 4-complete relief]</description>

    <description>TOTPAR was calculated as sum of products of pain relief (PR) at a given time-point (t) with the time-interval from that time-point to the previous time-point (t-1). The time-intervals used were 0 hrs (Day 1, baseline), 0.5 hrs, 1 hr, 2 hrs, 4 hrs, 8 hrs, 12 hrs, 24 hrs, 36 hrs, 48 hrs, 60 hrs, 72 hrs, 84 hrs, 96 hrs, 108 hrs, 120 hrs, 132 hrs and 144 hrs. Higher score indicated greater pain relief.
TOTPARt = ∑PR x (time t - time t-1). PR score was assessed at each of the above time-points based on a 5-point categorical scale [0-no relief, 1-little relief, 2-meaningful relief, 3-a lot of relief, 4-complete relief].</description>

        <title>Sum of Pain Intensity Difference (SPID)1-3 Days</title>
        <description>SPID was calculated as sum of products of Pain Intensity Differences (PID) at a given time-point (t) with the time-interval from that time-point to the previous time-point (t-1). The time-intervals used were 0 hrs (Day 1, pre treatment), 0.5 hrs, 1 hr, 2 hrs, 4 hrs, 8 hrs, 12 hrs, 24 hrs, 36 hrs and 48 hrs. Positive and higher scores indicate greater reduction in pain. SPIDt = ∑PID x (time t - time t-1).
Pain Intensity was assessed at baseline and at each time-point based on numerical rating scale (NRS) which is a horizontal line with a scale from 0-10, where 0 represents “No” and 10 represents the “worst possible pain”</description>

        <description>PRS was assessed for pain on movement (walking 5 steps on flat surface) at 30, 60 minutes and 2, 4, 8 and 12 hrs after the first dose of treatment (indomethacin or placebo patch) and twice daily during the period from 12 hours to 24 hr, 36 hr, 48 hr, 60 hr, 72 hr, 84 hr, 96 hr, 108 hr, 120 hr, 132 hr and 144 hr between treatment groups.
Participants were asked to choose a number on a scale of 0 to 4, where, 0- No pain relief; 1- A little or perceptible pain relief; 2- Meaningful pain relief; 3- A lot of relief; 4- Complete relief. The mean PRS scores were calculated on the basis of participant's response based on the above score.</description>

        <title>NRS for Pain on Movement Over Time</title>
        <description>NRS was assessed for pain on movement (walking 5 steps on flat surface) at 30, 60 minutes and 2, 4, 8 and 12 hrs after the first dose of treatment (indomethacin or placebo patch) and twice daily during the period from 12 hours to 24 hr, 36 hr, 48 hr, 60 hr, 72 hr, 84 hr, 96 hr, 108 hr, 120 hr, 132 hr and 144 hr between treatment groups.
The NRS is a horizontal line with a scale from 0-10. After application of patch (indomethacin or reference patch), patients were asked to choose a number that relates to their pain intensity on the scale of 0 to 10, where 0 represents no pain and 10 represents the worst possible pain.</description>

        <description>SPRID:Sum of Pain Intensity Difference (SPID) and Total Pain Relief (TOTPAR) at each post-dosing time-point.
SPRID score ranged from -5.8 (least pain relief) to 40.3 (highest pain relief). SPID and TOTPAR were calculated as weighted sums of Pain Intensity Differences (PID) and Pain Relief Scores (PRS) at each measurement time; 0 hr (Day 1, pre treatment), 0.5 hr, 1 hr, 2 hr, 4 hr, 8 hr, 12 hr, 24 hr, 36 hr, 48 hr, 60 hr, 72 hr, 84 hr, 96 hr, 108 hr, 120 hr, 132 hr and 144 hr, respectively.
PID was derived by subtracting the pain severity score at a given post-dosing time-point from the baseline [based on NRS which is a horizontal line with a scale from 0-10. where 0 represents “No” and 10 represents the “worst possible pain”]. NR scores were converted into PID scores by subtracting them from baseline pain scores.
PRS was assessed on 5-point categorical pain relief rating scale [0-no relief, 1-little relief, 2-some relief, 3-a lot of relief, 4-complete relief]</description>
