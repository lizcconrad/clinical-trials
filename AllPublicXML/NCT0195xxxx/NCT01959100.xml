  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The occurrence of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (SBO) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem
      cell transplantation (HSCT) is considered to be a chronic pulmonary graft versus host disease
      (GVHD) that is associated with significant mortality and morbidity. The reported incidence of
      SBO varies from 6 to 26% of allogeneic HSC recipients and is usually diagnosed within 2 years
      after transplantation. The diagnosis of SBO relies on the occurrence of a new airflow
      obstruction identified during pulmonary function testing, and the definition differs between
      studies. Currently, no curative immunosuppressive treatment is available, and recent data
      suggest that the use of these treatments, especially corticosteroids, should be limited
      because of their toxicity. The impairment of lung function parameters is likely caused by
      fibrous small airway lesions. Few data on the pathogenesis of SBO after allogeneic HSCT are
      available. Several hypotheses are based on the occurrence of SBO during chronic graft
      rejection after lung transplantation, which shares many clinical and histopathological
      similarities with SBO after allogeneic HSCT. One hypothesis is that the first step leading to
      SBO is lung epithelium injury. SBO is then identified as an alloimmune reaction with only one
      clearly identified risk factor: extrathoracic chronic GVHD. Due to their anti-inflammatory
      and immunomodulatory properties, recent data suggest that low-dose macrolides may be
      effective at preventing SBO after lung transplants. This well-tolerated treatment may be
      useful for preventing SBO after allogeneic HSCT.

      The objective of this Phase 3 multicentre randomized, double-blinded, clinical trial is to
      evaluate the efficacy of azithromycin in preventing BO syndrome after allogeneic HSCT in
      patients with malignant hematological diseases.
