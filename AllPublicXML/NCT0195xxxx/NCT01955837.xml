  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multinational, double-blind, two-arm, parallel, randomized Phase 3 comparison study
      evaluating the efficacy and safety of TAS-102 versus placebo in patients with refractory
      metastatic colorectal cancer. Patients will be randomly assigned (2:1) to TAS-102
      (experimental arm) or placebo (control arm).
