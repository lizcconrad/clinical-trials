  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The feasibility study will involve mixed methods, this means interviews as well as assessment
      of treatment with inspiratory muscle training therapy (IMT). There are two pathways within
      the study depending on whether people want to have inspiratory muscle training. People who
      accept to have inspiratory muscle training will have assessments before training, after 8
      weeks of training and at 6 month follow up in addition to interviews before and after the
      study (at 6 months). For those who choose not to have the inspiratory muscle training the
      investigators will offer them an interview so that the investigators can find out more about
      what might have made the study more appealing or what treatments they would have preferred.
      The investigators will also ask if they wish to be followed up with baseline assessments for
      the study period and if the investigators can access health records.

      Interviews

      Semi-structured interviews lasting approximately an hour will be performed at the beginning
      of the study with participants who accept the IMT pathway and those who decline IMT until no
      knew themes are raised. These interviews will be used to provide information on reasons for
      declining pulmonary rehabilitation, attitudes to exercise, attitudes to IMT, treatment
      preferences and opinions regarding study design and outcome measures (see Interview Topic
      guide). The interviews will be taped and transcribed verbatim. A follow up interview with
      study participants who have received IMT will be conducted at 6 months addressing attitudes
      to IMT and study design and whether they have decided that they wish to engage with other
      services (such as pulmonary rehabilitation and smoking cessation).

      Inspiratory Muscle Training (IMT) method

      Participants will perform 8 weeks of IMT strength training using the Powerbreathe Kinetic
      device (Powerbreathe). Training will progress to 60% maximum inspiratory pressure (PiMax).
      This means that each breath in through the device is set at 60% of the maximum force you are
      able to create when you breathe in rather than at full force. 30 breaths are performed at
      high velocity (paced initially over a period of 15 minutes to allow recovery between each
      breath through the device). Once established it is anticipated that each training session
      should take no more than five minutes. Training is performed twice a day, 5 days per week for
      the first 8 weeks. Training will be titrated (set to a level suitable for the participant)
      and supervised weekly for the first 8 weeks by a physiotherapist. After 8 weeks training the
      participants are advised to continue training unsupervised, twice a day, 3 times per week for
      a further 18 weeks.
