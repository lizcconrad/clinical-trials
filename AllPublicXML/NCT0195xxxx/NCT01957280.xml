  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the PK, safety, and tolerability of patritumab
      produced by a new manufacturing process (denoted as &quot;Process 2 patritumab&quot;). The data from
      this study will allow Process 2 patritumab to be compared to Process 1 patritumab to allow
      for any dose adjustments, if needed, and to bridge data from studies previously conducted
      with Process 1 patritumab to studies to be conducted with Process 2 patritumab. The
      hypothesis for this study is that the pharmacokinetics of Process 2 patritumab will be
      comparable to those of Process 1 patritumab.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Process 2 patritumab will be administered intravenously as a single, loading dose of 18 mg/kg
      over approximately 60 minutes at Cycle 1 Day 1 followed by 9 mg/kg administered every 21 days
      as a maintenance dose starting at Cycle 2 Day 1. This study will be conducted in 2 phases: a
      main study and an extension phase. The PK profile of Process 2 patritumab will be compared to
      historical data for Process 1 patritumab. Specifically, the PK parameters (AUC0-21d and Cmax
      as primary endpoints) for Process 2 patritumab 18 mg/kg (loading dose) will be compared to
      the PK parameters of Process 1 patritumab 18 mg/kg. Process 2 patritumab serum concentrations
      will be compared to Process 1 patritumab serum concentrations collected in the Phase 1 and
      Phase 2 studies by population PK methods and will be reported separately.
