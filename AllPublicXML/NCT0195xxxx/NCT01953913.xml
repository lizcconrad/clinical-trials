      Primary objective of the trial is to evaluate the safety of afatinib in patients with locally
      advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring EGFR (Epidermal growth
      factor receptor) mutation(s) and have never been treated with an EGFR-TKI (tyrosine kinase
      inhibitor). Secondary objective is to assess the time to symptomatic progression (as judged
      by investigator).
