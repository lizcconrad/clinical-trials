    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies radiation therapy and cisplatin with or without
      surgery in treating patients with stage III-IV oropharyngeal cancer. Radiation therapy uses
      high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, work
      in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Giving chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more tumor
      cells. It is not yet known whether radiation therapy and cisplatin are more effective with or
      without surgery in treating patients with oropharyngeal cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if primary treatment with transoral endoscopic head and neck surgery will
      improve progression free survival (PFS) for patients with human papilloma virus negative
      (HPV-) oropharyngeal cancer (OPC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare patterns of failure (local-regional relapse versus distant) and survival
      (overall and progression-free).

      II. To determine the safety and efficacy (rate of positive surgical margins) of using
      transoral robotic surgery for patients with T3 tumors of the tonsil, tongue-base, or
      glossopharyngeal sulcus.

      III. To compare head and neck cancer-specific quality of life (QOL) short-term (&lt; 6 months)
      and long-term (2 years) relating to swallowing function.

      IV. To compare subjective (patient reported) and objective (physiologic) measures of
      swallowing function short-term and long-term.

      V. To assess effect of neck dissection on shoulder function using a validated QOL instrument
      for patients undergoing neck dissection VI. To assess the correlation of physician derived
      clinical target volumes (CTV's) with locoregional control or failure.

      VII. To determine whether specific molecular profiles are associated with overall or
      progression-free survival or other clinical endpoints.

      VIII. To determine the sensitivity and specificity of pre-treatment computed tomography (CT)
      scans detecting the presence of lymph node extracapsular extension by examining the
      surgically dissected lymph nodes.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo transoral endoscopic head and neck surgery (eHNS). Depending on
      post-operative pathology findings, patients may undergo intensity modulated radiation therapy
      (IMRT) once daily (QD) five days a week for 6 weeks. High-risk patients also receive
      cisplatin intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36 during radiation therapy.

      ARM II: Patients undergo IMRT QD five days a week for 7 weeks. Patients also receive
      cisplatin IV on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36 during radiation therapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

          -  The primary tumor must be resectable through a transoral endoscopic head and neck
             surgery with anticipation of resection free margins (resection does not require total
             or subtotal glossectomy or total laryngectomy); specifically, patients must (1) not
             have trismus, (2) not have interincisor opening less than 2.5 cm, and (3) not have
             poor transoral exposure of the tumor itself nor surrounding soft-tissue margins,
             regardless of etiology

          -  Clinical stage III-IV; T1-2, N1-2b; T3, N0-2b, with only well-lateralized exophytic T3
             tumors not approaching within 1 cm of midline, and amenable to transoral eHNS

          -  p16 protein (p16) negative by immunohistochemistry (documented by the institution's

             cytoplasmic staining in less than 70% of the tumor cells

          -  Appropriate stage for protocol entry, including no distant metastases or adenopathy
             below the clavicles, based upon the following minimum diagnostic workup:

               -  History/physical examination by the treating physician (radiation oncologist,

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt; 3 x the upper
             limit of normal

          -  Patient must be able to provide study-specific informed consent prior to study entry

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior invasive malignancy (except non-melanomatous skin cancer) unless disease free
             for a minimum of 1095 days (3 years) (for example, carcinoma in situ of the breast or
             cervix are all permissible)

          -  Prior systemic chemotherapy for the study cancer; note that prior chemotherapy for a
             different cancer is allowable

          -  Prior radiotherapy to the region of the study cancer that would result in overlap of
             radiation therapy fields

          -  Severe, active co-morbidity, defined as follows:

               -  &gt; 2 based on the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status
                  classification system

               -  Unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization within
                  the last 6 months

               -  Hepatic insufficiency resulting in clinical jaundice and/or coagulation defects

               -  Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) based upon current Centers for Disease
                  Control (CDC) definition; note, however, that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
                  testing is not required for entry into this protocol; the need to exclude
                  patients with AIDS from this protocol is necessary because the treatments
                  involved in this protocol may be significantly immunosuppressive;
                  protocol-specific requirements may also exclude immuno-compromised patients

          -  Pregnancy or women of childbearing potential and men who are sexually active and not
             willing/able to use medically acceptable forms of contraception; this exclusion is
             necessary because the treatment involved in this study may be significantly
             teratogenic

          -  Prior allergic reaction to cisplatin

          -  Radiographic evidence of retropharyngeal metastasis
