  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is one of the most common inflammatory diseases in the general
      population and many cardiovascular diseases (valvular, myocardial, pericardial, coronary
      disease, stroke, heart failure etc.) have already been described in this disease. Large
      epidemiological studies have also demonstrated a higher degree of severity of atherosclerotic
      vascular disease in RA patients, to such a degree that several authors have highlighted the
      fact that, in the final analysis, the prognosis of RA is rather determined by the severity of
      atherosclerotic lesions.

      By reducing RA-related systemic inflammation, it can therefore be hypothesized that 24 weeks
      of anti-TNF therapy would improve arterial endothelial function and large artery stiffness.

      The proposed study will assess the effects of adalimumab therapy on these parameters. A group
      of 26 RA patients will be recruited from a rheumatologists association of the French PACA
      region (CONCERTO association). This study will be non invasive and will comprise:

        -  in vivo study of endothelial function by measuring the post-ischaemic dilatation by 2D
           ultrasound;

        -  study of large artery stiffness by pulse wave velocity determined by aplannation
           tonometry;

        -  study of central pulse pressure;

        -  evaluation of atherosclerosis-related parameters such as intima-media thickness.

      The results obtained should provide a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in
      RA-related vascular disease and the effects of anti-TNF therapy.

      In view of the high prevalence of RA, this study could potentially interest the medical
      community as a whole and could be largely diffused.
