  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BIBF
      1120 in patients with solid tumours by the monitoring of drug-related adverse events.
      Secondary objectives were the evaluation of safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and
      pharmacodynamics.
