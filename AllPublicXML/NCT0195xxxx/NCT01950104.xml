    <textblock>
      Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGS) is a technique that allow us to improve the results
      of assisted reproduction techniques through the selection of embryos free of chromosomal
      abnormalities.

      At present, it has not been proved that the usage of PGS really improves the live birth rate
      in IVF cycles. However, it has been stated that the reason of not having better results when
      using PGS is that the methodology applied is not adequate.

      Several authors propose that the optimal methodology for PGS includes the application of
      comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) arrays for genetic testing and carrying out embryo
      biopsy at the blastocyst stage. Nevertheless, most IVF centres still applies the day 3 embryo
      biopsy as a daily routine. Despite this fact, there is a gradual transition towards the usage
      of blastocyst-stage biopsy instead of day 3 biopsy.

      The purpose of this clinical study is analysing the results of the IVF cycles with embryo
      biopsy for PGS. Live birth rates and other parameters as the pregnancy and implantation rates
      together with embryo quality will be analysed and compared between two groups of patients
      undergoing IVF cycles with PGS. In one group the biopsy will be applied in day 3 of the
      embryo development, while in the other group the embryo biopsy will be fulfilled at the
      blastocyst stage.
