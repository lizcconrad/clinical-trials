    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (example, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; or congenital anomaly; or a medically important event. AEs included both SAE and non-SAE.</description>

          <description>Ann Arbor staging is staging system for lymphomas. The stage is determined by location of tumor. Stage I (located in a single region, usually 1 lymph node and surrounding area), Stage II (located in 2 separate regions, an affected lymph node or organ and a second affected area, and both affected areas are confined to 1 side of diaphragm), Stage III (spread to both sides of diaphragm, including organ/area near lymph nodes/spleen), Stage IV (diffuse or disseminated involvement of 1 or more extra lymphatic organs, including any involvement of liver, bone marrow or nodular involvement of lungs).</description>

        <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (example, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; or congenital anomaly; or a medically important event. AEs included both SAE and non-SAE.</description>

        <description>Metabolites of MMAE includes C4, C5, C7, C8 and C13. Amount of MMAE and its metabolites in urine were determined by multiplying the volume of urine obtained and the concentration of MMAE and its metabolites present in it, respectively.

      <desc>Serious and non-serious AEs were collected from first dose through 30 days after the last dose (Cycle 16). Beginning on Cycle 4 Day 1, only AEs with Grade 3 were recorded. Exceptions: New onset AEs of Grade 1-2 were recorded if they met criteria for SAEs or resulted in dose modification; PN events will be recorded regardless of severity grade.</desc>
