  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Falls are a serious health concern for persons with multiple sclerosis (MS). Over 50% of
      persons with MS suffer a fall over a 6-month periodwith the majority of falls resulting in
      medical attention for injuries (i.e., lacerations, bone fractures, &amp; head injuries). The
      effects of a fall are often compounded as it can lead to activity curtailment, physiological
      deconditioning, and institutionalization. Despite the importance of falls in persons with MS,
      the appropriate prevention strategies (i.e. rehabilitation approaches) are not clear. The
      purpose of this investigation is to determine whether exercise based or educational based
      interventions are more suited for fall prevention in older adults with MS.

      Falls are a serious health concern for persons with multiple sclerosis (MS). Over 50% of
      persons with MS suffer a fall over a 6-month periodwith the majority of falls resulting in
      medical attention for injuries (i.e., lacerations, bone fractures, &amp; head injuries). The
      effects of a fall are often compounded as it can lead to activity curtailment, physiological
      deconditioning, and institutionalization. Despite the importance of falls in persons with MS,
      the appropriate prevention strategies (i.e. rehabilitation approaches) are not clear.

      It is well known that causes of falls are multifactorial with over 400 risk factors
      identified. However, it is believed that these factors can be divided into two main classes:
      intrinsic (e.g. physiological factors) and extrinsic factors. For instance balance
      dysfunction, spasticity and muscle weakness are physiological risk factors for falls in MS .
      Behavioral fall risk factors in MS include choosing appropriate footwear, lighting and
      utilizing appropriate assistive device. There is evidence that both types of risk factors can
      be minimized with appropriately designed interventions in persons with MS and have been shown
      to reduce fall risk and incidence in other clinical populations. This has led to calls for
      the combination of exercise training program that targets specific, modifiable physiological
      risk factors and educational interventions targeting modifiable behavioral risk factors in
      persons with MS. However, there is minimal evidence that these interventions in isolation or
      combination actually reduce fall incidence or risk in persons with MS. This proposal seeks to
      determine the effectiveness of a combined exercise and educational rehabilitation strategy to
      prevent falls in persons with MS.

    <description>Physiological fall risk will be determined by the short form of the Physiological Profile Assessment (PPA)(Lord, 2003). The PPA is a standardized test battery which assesses vision (edge contrast sensitivity), lower limb proprioception, strength (knee extension), postural sway, and cognitive function (simple hand reaction time). The outcome of each test will be combined to generate an overall fall risk score</description>

    <measure>Mobility</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Specific measures of walking speed, endurance, coordination and self-reported walking function scale will be employed to assess overall mobility of each person. Walking speed was quantified with the Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25W), walking endurance was assessed with the 6-Minute Walk (6MW), and functional mobility was quantified with the Timed Up and Go (TUG) . The Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale-12 (MSWS-12) will be used as a self-reported measure of walking impairment.</description>

    <measure>Balance</measure>
    <time_frame>3 Months</time_frame>
    <description>To assess balance (e.g. postural control), we conducted a clinical assessment To measure balance the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and self-reports of balance confidence will be used. The BBS is a clinical assessment of balance. Scores on the BBS range from 0-56 with higher scores indicating greater balance. The Activities-Specific Balance Confidence (ABC) scale was used as a measure of balance confidence.</description>
