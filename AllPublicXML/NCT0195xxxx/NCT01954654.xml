  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether accelerated treatment with custom-made
      compression sleeve is more effective than standard procedure in the treatment of mild and
      moderate arm lymphedema secondary to primary cancer treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Use of a custom-made compression sleeve is an initial treatment of mild and moderate arm
      lymphedema secondary to primary breast cancer treatment. The compression sleeve improves the
      flow of lymph fluid out of the arm, reduces the swelling, and prevents progression of the
      lymphedema in the future.

      Early intervention is recommended though early is not well-defined in literature. The purpose
      of this study is to evaluate reduction of excess limb volume and changes in arm disability
      and clinical symptoms in accelerated treatment with compression sleeve compared to standard
      treatment.
