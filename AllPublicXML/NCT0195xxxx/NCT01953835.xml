    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase I, two-part, open-label study designed to evaluate the effect of
      repeated doses of GSK2586184 on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of Simvastatin and Rosuvastatin in
      healthy volunteers (Cohort A), and to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of a new tablet
      formulation of GSK2586184 in healthy male volunteers (Cohort B). Cohort A is a single
      sequence drug interaction study in which 28 subjects (14 female and 14 male subjects) will be
      enrolled. Each subject will receive single doses of Simvastatin and Rosuvastatin on two
      occasions, once alone and once following administration of repeated doses of GSK2586184.
      Cohort B is a 3-way crossover PK study in which 9 male subjects will be randomized (3
      subjects to each treatment sequence). Each subject will receive a single dose of the standard
      formulation of GSK2586184 with food and two doses of a new formulation of GSK2586184, once
      with food and once in a fasted state, according to their treatment sequence, with a 3-day
      wash out between doses. The primary aim of the study is to investigate the effects of
      GSK2586184 on the pharmacokinetics of the 2 statins and to assess the impact of dosing with
      and without food on a new formulation of GSK2586184 tablet.

             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).
