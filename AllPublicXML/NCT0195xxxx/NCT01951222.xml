  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent large clinical studies have demonstrated the interest of LAMA therapy in the
      management of asthma, when compared to LABA.

      V0162 is a compound with a very long lasting bronchodilator effect when compared to reference
      treatment in non-clinical models and in COPD patients. Secondary properties of V0162
      (i.e.H1/H4 and PDE IV-inhibition) could enhance the efficacy of this antimuscarinic compound
      and could bring option in the treatment obstructive lung disease. The objective of the study
      is to assess the bronchodilator properties of V0162 during 8 days in adult patients with
      asthma usually treated with ICS and LABA. The study is a randomised, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, 3-period crossover, preceded by an open-label active-control period
      before randomisation.
