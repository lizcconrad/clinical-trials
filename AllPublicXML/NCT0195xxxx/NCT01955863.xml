      Radical prostatectomy has become the gold standard treatment for prostate cancer.

      Regarding of morbidity of access on open retropubic radical prostatectomy a lot of centers
      around the world start to develop laparoscopic and robotic approach over the past years. The
      problems regarding this techniques is that the pure laparoscopic prostatectomy shows a steep
      learning curve with a high initial complication rate, and the use of robotic assistance
      surgery despite of lower learning curve is associated with higher surgical supply and
      operative room costs. These costs may have a significant impact on overall cost of prostate
      cancer care especially in Brazil.

      In Brazil, the open route for radical prostatectomy is still the most frequent approach. One
      of the disadvantages of open prostatectomy from the other surgeries is the longest hospital
      stay. However, the question of what length of stay after this operation is optimal and
      necessary is unresolved. In this trial the investigators have compared a randomized group of
      patients that had discharged on postoperative day 2, 1 and same day surgery. The
      investigators had intent to evaluate the feasibility of ambulatory open radical prostatectomy
      (patient discharge in the same day of surgery - average 12 hours of hospitalization)
      maintaining patient satisfaction and safety.

    <textblock>
      Radical prostatectomy initially described by Walsh (1982) has become the gold standard
      treatment for prostate cancer and has evolved enormously over the last 25 years. Improvements
      include the use of smaller incisions, reduced blood loss, shorter hospital stays, and
      surgical refinement. Several large series with long-term follow-up have confirmed that this
      approach results in excellent cancer control and functional results in terms of preservation
      of erectile potency and urinary continence.

      Regarding of morbidity of access on open retropubic radical prostatectomy a lot of centers
      around the world start to develop laparoscopic and robotic approach over the past years. The
      problems regarding this techniques is that the pure laparoscopic prostatectomy shows a steep
      learning curve with a high initial complication rate, and the use of robotic assistance
      surgery despite of lower learning curve is associated with higher surgical supply and
      operative room costs. These costs may have a significant impact on overall cost of prostate
      cancer care especially in Brazil where nowadays only have 3 centers with 5 robots.

      In Brazil, the open route for radical prostatectomy is still the most frequent approach,
      mainly out of large cities. One of the disadvantages of open prostatectomy from minimally
      invasive surgeries is the longest hospital stay. However, the question of what length of stay
      after this operation is optimal and necessary is unresolved. In this trial the investigators
      have compared a randomized group of patients that had discharged on postoperative day 2, 1
      and same day surgery. The investigators had intent to evaluate the feasibility of ambulatory
      open radical prostatectomy (patient discharge in the same day of surgery - average 12 hours
      of hospitalization) while maintaining patient satisfaction and safety.

    <description>The endpoint regarding the survey is the comparison with standard group discharged at postoperative day 2. The satisfaction was considered non similar when there were more than 1 negative answer for any question or any patient in comparison to standard group in these questions: Do you consider your postoperative care adequate ? / Was your understanding of the necessary postoperative care adequate before enrolling for this study? Was your pain control adequate? / Was the length of hospitalization adequate? / Would you choose to have the procedure again with the same length of hospitalization? / Did you take any analgesic postoperatively after being discharged? / Did you take any analgesic postoperatively after being discharged? / Have you received adequate medical and nurse's care during the post-operative period? / Did you consider the access to the hospital easy if you needed it? / Would you recommend other men undergo this procedure the same way you?</description>
