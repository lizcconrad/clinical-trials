  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a lifelong condition which causes the lungs and digestive system to
      become clogged with thick, sticky mucus. This leads to recurrent lung infections and reduced
      nutrients absorption from food. The average age at death is 26 years, usually from
      respiratory failure. Nonetheless, the nutritional status of people with CF (PWCF) is
      important help them live healthier and longer.

      It is recommended that adult with CF achieve a BMI of 23 for males and 22 for females.
      However, fewer than 50% adult with CF achieved that target BMI despite effective nutritional
      support to help support weight gain. There is a clear need for a behavioural intervention
      that can help PWCF use the available nutritional support.

      This is a feasibility study to try out a multi-component behavioural intervention. The
      intervention is designed to help PWCF use their nutritional support to gain weight. It will
      focus on testing the methods and procedures to be used on a larger scale, improving the
      behavioural intervention and estimating the how many people are needed for the larger trial.

      All eligible 75 PWCF in Sheffield will be invited to participate. The investigators
      anticipate recruiting 30 participants. Participants will be divided into two groups. The
      first group receive the behavioural intervention immediately. The second group receive the
      intervention after 3 months. All participants will be followed up for 6 months. Data will be
      collected every 6 weeks during clinic reviews.

      These two groups will be compared against each other to estimate the potential impact of the
      behavioural intervention. The investigators will also interview some of the participants at
      the end of the study period to improve the intervention and the study processes based on
      participant feedback.

      The investigators hypothesised that this study will recruit around 30 participants, around
      80% of the participants will complete the study, a single full-time investigator can deliver
      the intervention to 15 participants over 3 months and data collection will be thorough (with
      less than 5% missing data). The investigators also hypothesised that this feasibility study
      will help improve the intervention and help the design of a larger trial.
