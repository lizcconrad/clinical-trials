  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current treatment options for high risk localized prostate cancer include radical
      prostatectomy +/- postoperative radiotherapy, radical radiotherapy with androgen deprivation
      therapy. Evidence has emerged that prostate cancer has a low α/β ratio in the range of 1-3
      Gy. Even with high risk tumors, prostate cancer is hypothesized to have a greater sensitivity
      to large fraction sizes and high dose per fraction radiotherapy theoretically allows for
      biological dose escalation with fewer visits and no additional toxicity. Therefore, we hope
      to determine the toxicity, quality of life, biochemical and pathological control of SBRT for
      high risk prostate cancer incorporating ENI.
