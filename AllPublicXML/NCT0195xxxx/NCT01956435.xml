      This pilot study will consist of 10 adult subjects with symmetric idiopathic guttate
      hypomelanosis on the lower legs. Subjects will be randomized to which extremity (right or
      left) will be treated. Treatments with the Xtrac Excimer laser will be performed twice weekly
      for 12 weeks using the typical vitiligo protocol. Our goal is to determine the effectiveness
      of excimer laser for repigmentation of idiopathic guttate hypomelanosis. Effectiveness will
      be graded by the blinded observer scale via photographic comparisons and will be graded by
      subject via survey every 4 weeks.

      Methods: This pilot study will consist of 10 adult subjects with symmetric IGH on the lower
      legs. After enrollment, 5 lesions of IGH on each leg will be selected by either Dr. Jennifer
      Gordon or Dr. Ammar Ahmed and marked. Subjects will be randomized to which extremity (right
      or left) will be treated. Treatments with the Xtrac Excimer laser (wavelength of 308nm) will
      be performed twice weekly for 12 weeks using the typical vitiligo protocol (see Appendix C).
      Photographs of both extremities will be taken prior to initial treatment and then every 4
      weeks. The photographs will be analyzed by two separate, blinded dermatologists and rated on
      improvement from baseline using the following scale: 1= worsening of IGH; 2= no improvement
      (IGH remained stable); 3= mild improvement of IGH (some repigmentation on &lt;50% IGH); 4=
      moderate improvement (some repigmentation on &gt;50% or full repigmentation on &lt;75% IGH); 5=
      full repigmentation on &gt;75% IGH (see Appendix A). Subjects will also be asked to complete
      this survey subjectively every 4 weeks. Internal control will be represented by the marked
      lesions on the non-treated extremity of each patient. Control versus treatment groups will be
      statistically compared; however, due to the limited number of patient in this pilot study, a
      descriptive trend analysis will likely be completed. Subjects will be compensated $10 per
      visit (totaling $250). If a subject withdraws early from the study, they will be compensated
      for every completed visit. The 25th visit will consist of final photographs and surveys, and
      will not include treatment.

      Statistical Analysis: The main outcomes to be collected are the improvement of IGH from
      baseline at weeks 4, 8 and 12 by the blinded dermatologists and by the subjects. Subjects
      will be stratified by Fitzpatrick skin type for analysis as well.

    <description>Subject reported level of re-pigmentation for treated lesions was assessed by improvement from baseline using a scale from 1 - 4 with 1 being the least amount of re-pigmentation and 4 being the most re-pigmentation: 1 = Worsening of the light spots that were treated (the light spots seem to have gotten lighter or I have more light spots in the areas that were treated); 2 = No Improvement of the light spots (light spots have not changed since starting this study); 3 = Mild improvement of the light spots (there is some darkening of the light spots, but not in more than half of them); 4 = Moderate improvement (there is some darkening of the light spots in more than half of the light spots, but not more than 75% of them).</description>

          <description>Effectiveness will be graded by the blinded observer scal via photographic comparisons at the end of the study. Efficacy was assessed by improvement from baseline using the following scale: -1 = Worsening of IGH; 0 = No Improvement (IGH remained stable); 1 = Mild improvement of IGH (some re-pigmentation on &lt;50% IGH); 2 = Moderate improvement (some re-pigmentation on &gt;50% or full re-pigmentation on &lt;75% IGH); 3 = Full re-pigmentation on &gt;75% IGH.</description>
