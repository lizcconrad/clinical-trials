    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis:

      Primary hypothesis: Participants in the dialectical behavior therapy group have greater
      reductions in the frequency and severity of suicidal and non-suicidal self-injurious
      behaviors compared to participants in the alternative treatment group.

      Secondary Hypotheses: Participants in dialectical behavior therapy group have improved
      treatment outcomes compared to participants in alternative treatment, including mental health
      service utilization, symptoms of borderline personality and depression symptoms, suicidal
      thought and hopelessness, disability, and quality of life.

      This study will be a 3-year randomized control trial. Patients will be referred from any
      mental health services in Taipei area who meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
      Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision criteria for Borderline Personality Disorder.

      Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision criteria for Borderline Personality Disorder,
      18-60 years of age, sign the informed consent, have had at least two episodes of suicidal or
      non-suicidal self-injurious episodes in the past 5 years, and at least one of which is in the
      3 months preceding enrollment. The exclusion criteria include psychotic disorder, bipolar I
      disorder, severe physical illness, and mental retardation. Outcome measures will be obtained
      at pre-treatment, 4-month, 8-month and post-treatment (12-month) during 1-year protocol.
      Using semi-structured interview and a battery of self-report forms, a range of symptoms and
      behaviors associated with Borderline Personality Disorder will be assessed including suicidal
      thought, suicide attempt, depression, hopelessness, quality of life, disability, service
      utilization, and function. Measures are selected based on previous outcome studies of
      dialectical behavior therapy. Outcome variables will be evaluated by blinded assessors.
