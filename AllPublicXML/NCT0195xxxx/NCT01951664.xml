  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment for head and neck cancer can result in marked musculo-skeletal impairment (MSI).
      This study will examine the effects of Hatha Yoga as a therapeutic modality to address MSI.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of aggressive treatment for head and neck cancer (HNC) particularly combined modality
      treatment regimens has resulted in an increase in survival. Unfortunately, this improvement
      has come with a marked increase in acute and late-effects. Acute HNC treatment-related
      toxicities have been clearly and extensively documented; however, data pertaining to adverse
      late-effects, those most likely to impact the survivor's long term symptom burden,
      functionality, and overall quality of life (QOL), are limited. This pilot study will be
      conducted to examine the feasibility of tailored Hatha Yoga as a therapeutic modality to
      address MSI in patients who have survived HNC.

    <description>Following the completion of baseline study measures, participants will be randomized to either do go directly into a Yoga program or to an 8 week wait-list control group. Those in the yoga program will undergo an initial Yoga Evaluation. Patients will receive customized yoga guided practice program, a home practice plan with ongoing modifications. Instructors will assess compliance. A satisfaction assessment is conducted at study-end.</description>

    <description>Participants will undergo baseline objective and self-report study measures including: 1) ROM in the jaw, neck, and shoulders; 2) posture assessment; 3) pain, and 4) psychological distress. The study measures will take 30-45 minutes to administer.</description>

    <description>The evaluation includes an assessment of nine traditional Yoga components: energy, symptoms, emotions, posture, breathing patterns, gait, muscle/tissue quality, joint flexibility, and muscle strength. Emphasis will be placed on the assessment of jaw/neck/shoulder MSI requiring Yoga practice modification of those poses that are unsafe or not feasible for a patient to perform. Information from the evaluation will be used to establish the tailored Yoga program</description>

    <intervention_name>Yoga Program</intervention_name>
    <description>The Yoga program has 5 components: 1) Awareness Practice to enhance self-awareness, 2)Poses - 16 core poses will be modified for each patient's specific needs, 3)Breath Work - breath awareness and proper breathing for maximum benefit, 4)Relaxation - alternating between methods of relaxation, 5)Mediation - awareness and practice of inner silence</description>

    <intervention_name>Yoga Practice Plan</intervention_name>
    <description>To enhance fidelity, a standardized Yoga intervention was chosen that includes postures, meditation, relaxation, and breath work. To ensure safety, the practice plan for each patient will be reviewed prior to initiation. All MSI limitations will be discussed, and appropriate adaptive techniques will be formulated. Qualitative techniques will be used to describe and categorize the types of impairment and modifications. By developing a catalog of impairments and suitable modifications, a safe and uniform Yoga program can be further tested and widely disseminated.</description>
