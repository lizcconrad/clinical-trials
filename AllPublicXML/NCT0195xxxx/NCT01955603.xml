    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe. The aim of the trial is to investigate the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics (exposure of the trial drug in the body) and pharmacodynamics
      (the effect of the investigated drug on the body) of NNC0215-0384 administered to subjects
      with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) concomitantly treated with methotrexate
      (MTX).

    <description>A total of seven once-weekly doses of NNC0215-0384 or placebo will be administered subcutaneously (s.c., under the skin) at one of three ascending dose levels. Each cohort will consist of eight subjects randomised to either active (6 subjects) or placebo (2 subjects) treatment. Each subject will participate in one cohort only. Dose-escalation to the next dose level will be initiated when the safety data has been evaluated and if considered safe.</description>
