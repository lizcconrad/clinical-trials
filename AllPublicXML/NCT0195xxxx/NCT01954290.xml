    <textblock>
      Stroke remains the fourth leading cause of death in the United States (second worldwide) and
      a leading cause of long-term disability, resulting in total direct and indirect costs of
      approximately $73.7 billion annually. The failure of novel therapies in clinical trials
      demonstrates that the complex neural response to stroke must be targeted at multiple levels
      to improve patient outcomes. Despite significant improvements in stroke treatment and
      management, 1 year survival rate among stroke patients aged 65 years or more is around 25%,
      and 5- year survival rate amounts to approximately 50%. The highest chances of death are
      within 30 days of stroke. Mortality increases due to worsening brain dysfunction, elevated
      intracranial pressure (ICP), and other comorbid conditions.

      Treatments aimed at reducing post-stroke cytotoxic edema may reduce the risk for development
      of malignant stroke and mortality. Current treatments such as osmo-therapy and
      hemicraniectomy have substantial limitations, and mortality remains high, despite these
      measures outcomes remain unsatisfactory. There is a great need for alternative medical
      approaches which are safe, predictable, and help to ameliorate post stroke edema.

      Previous work has demonstrated the pathophysiological role of arginine-vasopressin (AVP) in
      ischemic stroke. The mechanism of action of AVP is by 3 receptor subtypes: V1a, V1b and V2
      expressed in brain, pituitary gland, myocardium, vasculature and kidneys. The role of the
      vasopressin receptors V1a and or V2 subtype in cerebral edema formation after ischemic stroke
      remains controversial. The V1a receptor antagonism causes platelet inhibition, aquaporin-4 up
      regulation; reduce infarct size and vasodilation. V1 antagonists has also been shown to
      prevent ischemia-induced cerebral edema development, suggesting that the V1 vasopressin
      receptor is important in water regulation in brain cells. Another study indicated that the
      vasopressin receptor V1 is involved in the pathogenesis of secondary brain damage after focal
      cerebral ischemia. Recently, few studies have demonstrated that a V2 receptor antagonist
      (OPC-31260), may be one of the effective drugs for the early treatment of cytotoxic edema and
      brain injury. Treatment of OPC-31260 ameliorated cerebral neurological deficit in transgenic
      (GET-1) mice after water intoxication. Treatment of OPC-31260 also significantly abolished
      water accumulation and down regulated Aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) expression level in GET-1 mice
      after water intoxication. The intensity of AQP-4 staining was almost comparable with that of
      the controls without water intoxication. It was also shown that OPC-31260 at doses of 10 to
      30 mg/kg produced a dose-dependent inhibition of subarachnoid hemorrhage-induced cerebral
      edema formation, accompanied by an increase in urinary volume and decrease in urine
      osmolality without a significant alteration of urine electrolytes. OPC-31260 is also
      effective in treating water retention diseases, such as hyponatremia caused by inappropriate
      antidiuretic hormone secretion, congestive heart failure, and liver cirrhosis. V2 receptor
      antagonism will also help in abolishing water accumulation, decreased Glial Fibrillary Acidic
      Protein (GFAP) in astrocytes and most importantly causes renal tubule-selective diuretic
      effect called aquaresis (electrolyte sparing diuresis), which may have additional benefit in
      the reduction of cerebral edema.

      This combined approach of V1a and V2 AVP receptor antagonism will lead to attenuation of
      ischemia related cerebral edema and infarct volume by modulating ischemia-evoked AQP-4
      expression. This effect should help behavior and mortality which in turn will improve outcome
      in stroke patients. The purpose of this project is to test the effect of the mixed V1a and V2
      receptor blockade on ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke outcome.

      In summary, the investigators are using the approach of mixed vasopressin antagonism on post
      stroke edema, infarct volume and outcome. This research will lead to a greater understanding
      of the roles and interactions of the different AVP receptors and pathophysiology of post
      stroke cytotoxic edema. New information on the effects of mixed blockade of V1a and V2
      receptors on the prevention of cytotoxic edema post stroke will be revealed.

    <description>The modified Rankin Scale (m-RS) is a commonly used scale for measuring the degree of disability or dependence in the daily activities of people after they have suffered a stroke.It is one of the most widely used clinical outcome measure for stroke clinical trials. The score is given according to following scale.
0- No symptoms at all
No significant disability despite symptoms; able to carry out all usual duties and activities
Slight disability; unable to carry out all previous activities, but able to look after own affairs without assistance
Moderate disability; requiring some help, but able to walk without assistance
Moderately severe disability; unable to walk without assistance and unable to attend to own bodily needs without assistance
Severe disability; bedridden, incontinent and requiring constant nursing care and attention

    <description>NIHSS is a tool used by healthcare providers to objectively quantify the degree of impairment caused by a stroke. It is composed of 11 items. Each item scores a specific ability between a score of 0-4. Usually, for each item, a score of 0 indicates normal function in that specific ability, while a higher score indicates some level of impairment. The individual scores from each item are added together to calculate a patient's total NIHSS score. The maximum possible score is 42, with the minimum score being a 0.</description>

    <description>The subjects in this arm will be given hypertonic saline and/or Mannitol.
For hypertonic saline,various concentrations are used clinically,up to 30-mL boluses of 23.4% saline.Rapid increases in sodium in this context do not appear to cause other neurologic complications observed with rapid correction of hyponatremia.Sodium levels up to 160 mmol/L may be acceptable,beyond which it may lead to worsening delirium,seizures,and overall poor outcome.
For Mannitol,every 4 hours serum osmolarity,serum glucose,urea,sodium and potassium will be measured till the therapy is given.Major complications include hypovolemia and hypotension.Strict fluid goals and volume replacement are essential.Impaired mannitol clearance may manifest as nephrotoxicity.Common practice includes repeating measurements of serum osmolarity and withholding repeat doses of mannitol when osmolarity exceeds 320 milliosmol(mOsm).Monitoring the osmole gap may be a more sensitive method for discerning mannitol clearance.</description>
