  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of an ophthalmic solution containing 0.2%
      xanthan gum in reducing symptoms and signs of dry eye as well as tear film markers of
      oxidative stress.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oxidative stress is the result of an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen
      species (ROS) and antioxidant systems . The eye is constantly exposed to solar UV radiation
      which is the major inducer of ROS production and therefore oxidative stress has been
      implicated in the pathogenesis of several eye disease, including dry eye. Xanthan gum is a
      complex exopolysaccharide utilized as a food additive. Its chemical structure shows a
      capacity to react with ROS indicating a role as an anti-oxidative molecule.

      In the present study aging patients with dry eye will be enrolled. Signs and symptoms of dry
      eye as well as levels of oxidative stress in tear will be evaluated afte 30 days of treatment
      with eye drops containing carboxymethylcellulose or xanthan gum.
