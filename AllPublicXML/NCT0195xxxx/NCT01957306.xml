      The primary goal of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 12 weeks of
      treatment of 4 grams/day of Dr. Tagliaferri's Menopause Formula (administered as 2 grams PO
      BID) in reducing the frequency of menopausal vasomotor symptoms among healthy, postmenopausal
      women, aged 40-65, with moderate to severe hot flushes.

             screening for estrogen pellet therapy or progestin injectable drug therapy.

         16. Use of herbal or dietary supplements purported to treat hot flushes or herbal/dietary
             supplements with known estrogenic or progestogenic activity within 2 weeks of
