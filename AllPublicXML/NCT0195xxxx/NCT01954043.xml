  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is being conducted to evaluate the effect of rifampin (a strong CYP3A4 inducer) and
      rabeprazole (a pH elevating agent) on the PK of dabrafenib (a CYP3A4/CYP2C8 substrate). The
      study will be conducted in subjects with BRAF V600 mutation-positive tumors. Data collected
      from this study will be used to inform recommendations regarding use of concomitant
      medications with dabrafenib and future clinical pharmacologic evaluation of dabrafenib.
