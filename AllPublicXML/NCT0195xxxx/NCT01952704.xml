  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aerobic exercise holds a multitude of health benefits. Studies in mice have shown that
      aerobic exercise improves memory, and increases the volume of the hippocampus, the brain's
      primary memory center. Only two studies have been conducted in humans, one in healthy elders,
      and the other in a schizophrenia population. So far, there has never been an aerobic exercise
      trial in traumatic brain injury (TBI) to look at hippocampal volume and memory as outcomes of
      interest. The proposed project is a randomized controlled trial of aerobic exercise in
      persons with TBI. We will conduct a 12-week (36 sessions) program of aerobic exercise
      (stationary cycling), versus a control condition of non-aerobic exercise (stretching), in
      memory-impaired TBI patients to a) increase hippocampal volume and b) improve memory.
      Importantly, we also expect benefits of aerobic exercise on the level of brain function.
      Specifically, we will look at 'functional connectivity,' which refers to how efficiently
      remote regions of the brain 'talk' to each other. TBI is an ideal population to benefit from
      aerobic exercise, given the young age at which many individuals sustain TBI, which allows for
      benefits of aerobic exercise to be maximally realized in a population with sufficient
      neurofunctional reserve. The expected benefits of aerobic exercise (increased hippocampal
      volume, improved memory) from this intervention stand to have a meaningful impact on people
      with TBI, including improved health, productivity, independence, and quality of life. And,
      unlike current treatments for memory impairment (e.g., pharmacological agents, cognitive
      rehabilitation), aerobic exercise is a cost-effective, all natural, readily-available
      treatment for memory problems.
