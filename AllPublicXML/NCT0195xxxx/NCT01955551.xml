  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evidence-based programs aimed at enhancing parenting skills are effective, and pediatricians
      identify many parents who could benefit from such programs. Low-income children have high
      rates of behavior problems and their family system and environmental exposures often lead to
      cumulative and daunting levels of risk for poor functional outcomes; their parents are highly
      likely to benefit from parenting supports. However, low-income families are the most likely
      to drop out of parenting interventions, meaning the families and children with the greatest
      need receive the least support. Fewer than 25% of low-income families recruited to parenting
      programs will participate in even one session, and only about half of these parents will
      participate in more than half of the sessions offered. The aims of this trial are:

      Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that the provision of motivational interviewing (MI), as
      compared to an attention control (AC) condition, will increase the engagement of low-income
      parents of preschoolers in an evidence-based parenting skills group (the Incredible Years
      Series (IYS)). For this study, the outcome of engagement is operationally defined as
      intention to attend IYS sessions, attendance, and satisfaction with the IYS program.

      Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that the effect of MI on engagement in IYS will be impacted by
      the following moderators: parenting self-efficacy, child behavior problems, and maternal
      depression.

      The investigators hypothesize that the effect of MI on engagement will be greater among
      parents with lower parenting self-efficacy and parents of children with more behavior
      problems, but less among parents with more maternal depressive symptoms.

      The investigators will use a stratified, randomized controlled trial (RCT) design to evaluate
      the impact of MI on parent engagement in a well-validated preventive parenting skills
      intervention, the Incredible Years Series (IYS).
