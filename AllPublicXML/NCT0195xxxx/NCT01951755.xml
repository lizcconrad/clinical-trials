        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histological or cytological documented diagnosis diagnosis of inoperable, locally
             advanced, recurrent or metastatic (Stage IIIB or IV) NSCLC.

          -  Patients must have evidence of disease but measurable disease is not mandatory.

          -  18 years of age or older.

          -  ECOG Performance Status of 0-2.

          -  Life expectancy at least 12 weeks.

          -  Patients with advanced stage IIIB/ IV NSCLC who have received at least one course of
             standard systemic chemotherapy or radiation therapy or who are in the investigator's
             opinion not medically suitable for chemotherapy or radiotherapy.

          -  No more than 2 prior chemotherapy regimens are permissible. Patients must have
             recovered from any toxic effects and at least 3-4 weeks must have elapsed from the
             last dose and prior to registration (14 days for vinorelbine or other vinca alkaloids
             or gemcitabine). Patients who, in the opinion of the investigator, have fully
             recovered from surgery in less than 4 weeks may also be considered for the study.
             Patients must have recovered (CTC ≤ 1) from acute toxicities of any previous therapy.

          -  Granulocyte count ≥ 1.5 x 109/L and platelet count &gt; 100 x 109/L.

          -  Serum bilirubin must be ≤ 1.5 upper limit of normal (ULN).

          -  AST and/or ALT ≤ 2 x ULN (or ≤ 5 x ULN if clearly attributable to liver metastasis.

          -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 ULN or creatinine clearance ≥ 60 ml/min.

          -  Able to comply with study and follow-up procedures.

          -  For all females of childbearing potential a negative pregnancy test must be obtained
             within 72 hours before starting therapy.

          -  Patients with reproductive potential must use effective contraception.

          -  Written (signed) Informed Consent to participate in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any unstable systemic disease (including active infection, grade 4 hypertension,
             unstable angina, congestive heart failure, hepatic, renal or metabolic disease).

          -  Prior therapy with systemic anti-tumour therapy with HER1/EGFR inhibitors (as small
             molecule or monoclonal antibody therapy).

          -  Any other malignancies within 5 years (except for adequately treated carcinoma in situ
             of the cervix or basal or squamous cell skin cancer).

          -  Patients are excluded if they have brain metastasis or spinal cord compression that is
             newly diagnosed and/ or has not yet been definitively treated with surgery and/ or
             radiation; previously diagnosed and treated CNS metastases or spinal cord compression
             with evidence of stable disease (clinically stable imaging) for at least 2 months is
             permitted.

          -  Any significant ophthalmologic abnormality, especially severe dry eye syndrome,
             keratoconjunctivitis sicca, Sjogren syndrome, severe exposure keratitis or any other
             disorder likely to increase the risk of corneal epithelial lesions. The use of contact
             lenses is not recommended during the study. The decision to continue to wear contact
             lenses should be discussed with the patient's treating Oncologist and the
             ophthalmologist.

          -  Patients who cannot take oral medication, who require intravenous alimentation, have
             had prior surgical procedures affecting absorption, or have active peptic ulcer
             disease.

          -  Nursing mothers.
