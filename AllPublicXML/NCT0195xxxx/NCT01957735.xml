      This is a Phase 1a/b multicenter, open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation study to
      examine the dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of BPM31510 administered as a 144-hour continuous
      intravenous (IV) infusion as monotherapy(treatment Arm 1)and in combination with chemotherapy
      (treatment Arm 2) in patients with solid tumors.In the Phase 1a portion of the trial,
      patients who meet eligibility parameters will receive 2 consecutive 72-hour infusions of
      BPM31510 twice weekly on Tuesday and Friday (i.e., Days 1, 4, 8, 11, 18, 22 and 25),
      essentially receiving BPM31510 treatment for 144 hours per week of each 28-day cycle. At each
      dose level of Arm 1 and Arm 2, patients will be treated for either 8 hours at minimum of
      outpatient monitoring or inpatient monitoring for the first 24-hrs of the first infusion of
      Cycle 1.All other treatments will be administered in an outpatient setting.Dose limiting
      toxicities will be assessed during Cycle 1.

      The study is a standard 3 + 3 dose escalation design with the dose escalated in successive
      cohorts of 3 to 6 patients each.Toxicity at each dose level will be graded according to
      National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.02).
      Safety oversight will be provided by the Cohort Review Committee (CRC).The CRC will review
      and confirm all DLTs and will continue to monitor safety throughout the study (including Arm
      2).

      Assessments of the antitumor activity of BPM31510 will be performed at the end of Cycle 2 and
      every 2 cycles thereafter using standard techniques such as computerized tomography (CT) or
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for patients with measurable disease.Response will be
      evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 .Patients who
      experience no unacceptable toxicity or disease progression, may receive additional 28-day
      cycles for up to 1 year on Arm 1 or 2. Patients on Arm 1 who progress may elect to continue
      BPM31510 treatment in combination with gemcitabine, 5-FU, or docetaxel at the treating
      physician's discretion. Once a dose level of BPM31510 monotherapy is evaluated and the CRC
      determines it safe to escalate to the next dose level, Cohort 1 of Treatment Arm 2 of
      BPM31510 in combination with chemotherapy will open to accrual. Cohort 1 of Arm 2 patients
      will be enrolled onto one of 3 chemotherapies, gemcitabine, 5-FU, or docetaxel. Cycle 1 of
      combination therapy (Arm 2) is 6 weeks in duration for patients with BPM31510 administered
      twice weekly on Tuesday and Friday for 6 weeks and chemotherapy administered on Mondays, Days
      21, 28 and 35. Cycles 2-12 are 4 weeks in duration with BPM31510 administered twice weekly on
      Tuesday and Friday for 4 weeks and chemotherapy administered on Mondays, Days 7, 14 and 21.
      Dose limiting toxicities will be assessed during Cycle 1. Response will be assessed after
      Cycle 2 (10 weeks) and responders who continue onto Cycles 2-12 will be assessed every 2
      cycles (8 weeks). Patients who progress and crossover to Arm 2 will be reconsented and must
      meet eligibility before restarting BPM31510. Crossover patients are not evaluated for DLTs on
      Arm 2 and all cycles of combination therapy are 4 weeks in duration (Cycles 1-12). BPM31510
      is administered twice weekly on Tuesdays and Fridays for 4 weeks and chemotherapy
      administered on Mondays, Days 7, 14 and 21 for all crossover patients on Arm 2. Patients will
      continue BPM31510 in combination with chemotherapy for a maximum of 12 cycles in the absence
      of intolerable toxicity and progression. Patients on Arm 2 who progress on one type of
      chemotherapy may not switch to one of the other chemotherapy agents in combination with
      BPM31510.However, if the chemotherapy component (ie, 5-FU, gemcitabine, or docetaxel) of
      combination therapy is discontinued due to chemotherapy-related toxicity, patients may
      continue to receive BPM31510 as monotherapy.

      Once the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BPM31510 as monotherapy and in combination with
      chemotherapy are established, an expansion cohort will be enrolled (a total of 12-15 patients
      for monotherapy and a total of 10 patients for each combination therapy).

    <description>standard 3+3 design will be used for Arm 2 of the study. BPM31510 will be started at one dose level below the dose that has been studied and determined to be safe in the monotherapy portion of the trial. Arm 2 patients will be enrolled onto one of 3 chemotherapies, gemcitabine, 5-FU, or docetaxel according to the dose levels below:
Gemcitabine IV once weekly at a starting dose of 600 mg/m2 ;
5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) IV once weekly at a starting dose of 350 mg/m2 with leucovorin (LV) 100 mg/m2; OR
Docetaxel IV once weekly at a starting dose of 20 mg/m2.
Note:Both BPM31510 and the chemotherapy agent can escalate simultaneously in Cohorts 3 and 4 only if there are no DLTs observed in the previous cohorts. If one or more DLTs are observed, then intermediate dose levels will be added where one agent is escalated.</description>
