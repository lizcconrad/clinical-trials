      This is a study whose primary objective is to assess the effectiveness of Neuropathy/Ulcer
      Cream in the promotion of healing skin fissures plantar foot ulcers and as a moisturizer to
      prevent dry skin turning into ulcers as compared with a placebo cream containing the same
      vehicle as Neuropathy/Ulcer Cream without the active ingredients (Control).

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Patient is 18 years old or older.

             2. Patient has a current diagnosis of diabetes (Type 1 or 2).

             3. Patient's fissure or foot ulcer is on the plantar surface of the foot.

             4. Patient's fissure or ulcer is at least a partial thickness wound extending through
             the epidermis and at least part of the dermis. The wound may extend through the dermis
             and into subcutaneous tissue (granulation tissue may be present), but without exposure
             of muscle, tendon, bone, or joint capsule (Wagner Grade 1).

             5. Patient's wound is free of necrotic debris and clinical infection, should be
             comprised of healthy, vascular tissue.

             6. Patient's Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) by Doppler is 0.7.

             7. The patient has adequate circulation to the foot to allow for healing.

        This must be demonstrated by either of the following methods:

        The patient has a palpable pulse on the study foot (either dorsalis pedis, posterior
        tibial, or peroneal artery) and has clinical signs of adequate circulation in the foot
        (e.g., toes are warm and pink).

        If either there are no palpable pulses or clinical signs of adequate circulation are
        lacking, the Investigator must perform an additional assessment to assure that there is
        adequate circulation to the foot. Transcutaneous oxygen tension (TcPo2),
        photoplethysmography (PPG), Toe-Arm Index, Doppler wave form, Cardiosynchronous Limb
        Compression (CSC), Pulse Volume Recording (PVR) or exercise Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI).
        Determination of adequate circulation must be according to generally accepted criteria for
        the particular test employed. The additional assessments must be documented in the
        patient's source document and Case Report Form.

        8. Patient's diabetes is under control as determined by the Investigator from daily
        glucometer diary entries.

        9. Patient and caregiver are willing to participate in the clinical study and can comply
        with the follow-up regimen.

        10.Patient or his/her legal representative has read and signed the Institutional Review
        Board (IRB) approved Informed Consent form before treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has clinical evidence of gangrene on any part of the affected foot.

          2. The patient's ulcer is due to a nondiabetic etiology. Ulcers of arterial, venous
             stasis, pressure, radiation, traumatic, rheumatoid, vasculitis, collagen vascular
             disease,or other nondiabetic etiologies are not to be enrolled.

          3. Patient's ulcer has tunnels or sinus tracts that cannot be completely debrided.

          4. Patient's diabetes is uncontrolled and could interfere with the completion of the
             study.

          5. Patient has one or more medical condition(s), including renal, hepatic, hematologic,
             neurologic, or immune disease that in the opinion of the Investigator would make the
             patient an inappropriate candidate for this wound healing study.

          6. Patient has or has had a malignant disease (other than cutaneous epithelioma) not in
             remission for five years or more.

          7. Patient is receiving oral or parenteral corticosteroids, immunosuppressive or
             cytotoxic agents, or is anticipated to require such agents during the course of the
             study.

          8. Patient has Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) or Human Immunodeficiency Virus
             (HIV).

          9. Patient has participated in another study utilizing an investigational drug or device
             within the previous 30 days.

         10. Patient's ulcer is infected or accompanied by active cellulitis, osteomyelitis as
             determined by the investigator

         11. Patient has any condition(s) that seriously compromises the patient's ability to
             complete this study.
