      It is a clinical randomized cross-sectional. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee
      of the Universidade Paulista - UNIP under protocol number 125 608 of 18/10/2012.

      The study included 24 subjects randomly recruited from both sexes and from four different
      ethnic groups: white, brown, black and asian with different ages, individuals intolerant to
      cold, suffering any change in skin sensitivity, illness from infectious diseases or
      previously diagnosed to respond negatively to the use of cold were excluded.

      The survey was conducted in the clinic Physiotherapy Universidade Paulista - UNIP in light
      and airy ambience, with recording of the mean daily temperature in degrees Celsius planned
      for the capital of São Paulo by newsletter Climatempo available and accessed
      http://www.climatempo.com.br/previsao-do-tempo/cidade/ Before all applications, the average
      temperature obtained in the days from the application was 21.93° Celsius.

      For obtaining of personal data and anthropometric evaluations, a data sheet prepared by the
      authors to self-fulfillment, and then calculated the BMI of subjects, if in doubt, check the
      height and body mass was performed before the application of cryotherapy. Participants were
      divided into 4 groups of different ethnicities - white, brown, black and asian; ethnicity was
      proven through the birth certificates of volunteers, according to the classification
      described by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics - IBGE.

      All participants were maintained in supine position for 20 minutes to rest and stabilization
      of body temperature, sleep after receiving an application through the cold thermal bag Thermo
      Gel ® brand size &quot;P&quot; consisting of a cellulose-based gel for subsequently receiving of
      cryotherapy in the middle third of the right thigh and left earlier, leaving 15-20 cm from
      the anterior superior iliac spine - ASIS side tested, depending on the stature of the
      individual being assessed and 5 cm away from the surface to be evaluated, according to
      manufacturer's instructions. The temperature was verified on site described before, during
      and after applications of cryotherapy which lasted for 30 minutes and then recorded. To check
      the temperature after application of cryotherapy was used a thermometer brand CASON ®
      INFRARED THERMOMETER AC 380 (- 32 º C 380 º C).

    <description>It was verified skin temperature of the subject in the supine position with them prior to the application of cryotherapy during application (at 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 min) and after the application retitrada ice and after 30 minutes of implementation. Measurements were obtained in degrees Celsius with an infrared thermometer brand CASON Model CA380 recorded in a collection daos elaborated by authors</description>
