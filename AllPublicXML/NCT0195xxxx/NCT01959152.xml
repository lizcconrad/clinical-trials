      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of preserving low-frequency
      acoustic hearing in adults with a moderate degree of hearing loss in the low frequencies and
      severe-to-profound hearing loss in the mid-to-high frequencies who are implanted with the
      HiRes™ 90K Advantage implant with HiFocus™ Mid-Scala electrode.

    <measure>Low-frequency unaided acoustic hearing thresholds pre and post implantation with the HiFocus™ Mid-Scala electrode array</measure>
    <time_frame>One month</time_frame>
    <description>Unaided low-frequency acoustic hearing thresholds (under earphones) in the implanted ear one month after device activation will be compared to baseline (pre-implant) thresholds in the same ear for audiometric frequencies 125-1000Hz. Threshold changes from baseline will be calculated as:
Complete preservation of hearing: threshold shift ≤ 15 dB
Partial preservation of hearing: threshold shift ≥ 16 dB with measurable thresholds
No preservation of hearing: no measurable thresholds at ≤ 80 dB HL</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  No previous cochlear implant experience

          -  18 years of age or older

          -  Up to a moderate sensorineural hearing loss in the low-to-mid frequencies (pure tone
             average ≤ 65 dB HL for 125, 250, 500, and 1000 Hz) and a severe-to-profound
             sensorineural hearing loss in the high frequencies (pure tone average ≥ 70 dB HL for
             2,000, 4,000, and 8,000 Hz) in the ear to be implanted

          -  Aided monosyllabic word score of 10-50% in the ear to be implanted

          -  Up to a moderate sensorineural hearing loss in the low-to-mid frequencies (pure tone
             average ≤ 65 dB HL for 125, 250, 500, and 1000 Hz) and a severe-to-profound
             sensorineural hearing loss in the high frequencies (pure tone average ≥ 70 dB HL for
             2,000, 4,000, and 8,000 Hz) in the contralateral (non-implanted) ear

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous inner ear surgery

          -  Cochlear malformation or obstruction that would preclude full insertion of electrode
             array

          -  Presence of additional disabilities that would prevent or interfere with participation
             in the required study procedures

          -  Medical or psychological conditions that contraindicate surgery or impact the ability
             to manage an implanted device or the study-related procedures

          -  Evidence of central auditory lesion or compromised auditory nerve
