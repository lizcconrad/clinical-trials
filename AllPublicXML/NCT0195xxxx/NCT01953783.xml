    <description>Part A: Patients will receive a single dose of 4-mg [14C]- IXAZOMIB oral solution containing approximately 500 nCi of total radioactivity on Day 1 and remain at the clinic for 8 days. On Days 14 and 21, patients may be administered a single 4.0-mg capsule of IXAZOMIB. Patients will return to the clinic in the evening before Days 14, 21, 28, and 35 for a 24-hour overnight clinic visit.
Part B: Eligible patients from Part A may continue into Part B once they have completed their Day 35 assessments in Part A. Patients may receive IXAZOMIB capsules administered orally at a dose of 4.0-mg once weekly on Days 1, 8, and 15 of 28-day cycles. Patients will continue in this study until disease progression of unacceptable toxicity.</description>
