      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of carfilzomib when given
      together with rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide and to see how well it works
      in treating patients with stage I-IV diffuse large B-cell lymphoma that has returned
      (relapsed) or that has not responded to treatment (refractory). Carfilzomib may stop the
      growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal
      antibodies, such as rituximab, may block cancer growth in different ways by targeting certain
      cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide, also work
      in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by
      stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving carfilzomib with
      rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide may be a better treatment for diffuse large
      B-cell lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and examine the dose-limiting toxicities of
      carfilzomib when administered in combination with rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, and
      etoposide (C-R-ICE) in patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
      (DLBCL). (Phase I) II. To assess the toxicity of dose regimen using the Cancer Therapy
      Evaluation Program (CTEP) National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for
      Adverse Events (CTCAE version 4.0). (Phase I) III. To evaluate the safety of carfilzomib
      (given at maximum tolerated dose [MTD] as determined in Phase I of this study) in combination
      with R-ICE salvage therapy in relapsed/refractory DLBCL patients. (Phase II) IV. To achieve
      an overall response rate (complete response [CR] and partial response [PR]) of 70% after 3
      cycles of C-R-ICE in patients between the ages of 18 to 75 with relapsed/refractory cluster
      of differentiation (CD)20-positive DLBCL previously treated with rituximab-based
      immunochemotherapy (e.g., rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine [vincristine
      sulfate], and prednisone [R-CHOP], rituximab, etoposide, prednisone, vincristine,
      cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin [REPOCH], rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine,
      doxorubicin, dexamethasone, methotrexate, and cytarabine [R-HyperCVAD], etc.) induction.
      (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the feasibility of successful mobilization of autologous stem cells (i.e.,
      minimum of 2 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg should be collected) to be used for autologous stem cell
      transplant (ASCT).

      II. To determine toxicities associated with C-R-ICE salvage therapy. III. To determine the
      time to progression (TTP), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS)
      followed by ASCT; disease-free survival in CR patients.

      IV. To determine the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics relationship between carfilzomib's
      degree of proteasome inhibition and response rate along with the time course of
      thrombocytopenia.

      V. To study differences in clinical outcomes between germinal center B-cell-like (GCB) and
      non-GCB relapsed/refractory DLBCL following therapy with carfilzomib and R-ICE.

      VI. Correlative translational research studies to include: phenotypic/genotypic analysis and
      functional activity (i.e., antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity [ADCC] and
      complement-mediated cytotoxicity [CMC]) of patient's peripheral blood mononuclear &quot;effector&quot;
      cells (PBMC), as well as ex vivo analysis of sensitivity of primary tumor cells to various
      combinations of carfilzomib versus bortezomib +/- rituximab; enzymatic assay for
      chymotrypsin-like activity to determine the degree of proteasome inhibition in primary DLBCL
      patient samples and patient PBMC specimens; explorative analysis to identify potential
      factors predictive of response to therapy will be performed.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of carfilzomib, followed by a phase II
      study.

      Patients receive carfilzomib intravenously (IV) over 10-30 minutes on days 1, 2, 8, and 9;
      rituximab IV over 3-8 hours on day 3; etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 4-6; carboplatin IV
      over 1 hour on day 5; and ifosfamide IV over 24 hours on day 5. Treatment repeats every 21-28
      days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 4 months for 1 year,
      every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually for 2 years.
