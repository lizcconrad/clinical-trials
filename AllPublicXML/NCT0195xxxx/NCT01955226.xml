    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Tegaderm CHG clear dressing reduces the
      number of unscheduled central catheter dressing changes compared to standard clear Tegaderm
      IV dressing in pediatric patients between the ages of 2 months to 18 years with central
      venous access. Secondarily, we will monitor contact skin irritation and central line
      associated blood stream infections.

    <textblock>
      In this prospective, randomized, cohort study, we plan on enrolling all patients 2 months to
      18 years of age admitted with a central venous catheter expected to be in place for &gt; 48
      hours. Patients will be randomized to either receive 1) Tegaderm CHG clear dressing or 2)
      standard clear Tegaderm IV dressing. All central line care will remain uniform between the
      two groups as dictated by the central line maintenance bundle currently directing central
      line care in our children's hospital. Study completion will occur at the time of central line
      removal or discharge from the hospital, whichever comes first.

    <description>The policy at our institution is to change central catheter dressings every 7 days unless they are soiled or detached. We will document dressing changes for the duration of line use and document the reason for the dressing change.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Blood Stream Infection</measure>
    <time_frame>Discharge (at 2 weeks or more)</time_frame>
    <description>Blood stream infections will be tallied and reported per 1,000 central line days. Infection is attributed to the line if a culture becomes positive when the line is in up to 48 hours after removal.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Skin irritation</measure>
    <time_frame>Study completion (Study completion will occur at the time of central line removal or discharge from the hospital, whichever comes first). On average 2 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Skin irritation will be assessed using the Scoring of patch tests according to the International Contact Dermatitis Research Group. Scores of 0 are defined as no irritation, 1/2-1+ as minor irritation whereas scores greater than or equal to 2+ will be classified as severe and will require dressing removal.
The clinical team will photograph each central line insertion site with every dressing change and save the most severe skin irritation photo for analysis. These pictures will be sequentially numbered and a master list will link them to each patient.</description>
