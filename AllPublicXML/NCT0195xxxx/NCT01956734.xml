  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase I trial, unicentric, uncontrolled. Intratumoral injection or intramural (into the
      resected tumor cavity) of DNX2401 into brain tissue will be followed by up to two 28 - day
      cycles of oral temozolomide (TMZ) in schedule of 7 days on/7 days off to evaluate safety of
      the combination. Completion of two full cycles of TMZ will be dependent upon tolerance and
      toxicity.

      The rationale in using the virus with chemotherapy begins with the lessons learned in many
      clinical trials in glioblastoma (GBM) about both the great difficulty of treating this
      disease with monotherapy and the limitations of the therapeutic virus. The best clinical
      results in recent years have been achieved with combinations of multiple therapeutics
      efforts, including, maximum resection and chemotherapy, immunotherapy and targeted therapies.

      There are very strong preclinical data about the synergy of DNX-2401 and TMZ proposed in our
      trial design. The dose-dense schemes of TMZ like the one we will use, have been developed
      with the aim to saturate o6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT). The published results
      to date have shown reasonable toxicity albeit with modest efficacy' these schemes are now in
      phase III trials. In addition, autophagy triggered by TMZ could help viral replication in the
      tumor cells 11.

      The last argument in favor of this virus + TMZ combination is the proved efficacy in killing
      GBM tumor stem cells. In vitro and animals models have shown this combination is much more
      effective that any of the treatments alone against GBM stem cells and the tumors derived from
      them.

      DNX2401 will be injected after stereotactic biopsy reveals intraoperative pathology
      confirming the presence of recurrent glioblastoma. The injection will be either intratumoral
      or intramural with injections throughout the post-resection cavity.
