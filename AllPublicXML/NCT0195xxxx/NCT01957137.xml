    <measure>Number of Urinary Urge Incontinent (UUI) Episodes Per Day - Randomized Portion</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Urinary urge incontinent episodes were collected through a diary on daily basis for approximately 4 weeks when subjects were under each cycling setting. Only the last 7-day diaries were used for the analysis. The first 3 weeks were used as an adjustment period.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Degree of Urgency - Randomized Portion</measure>
    <time_frame>4 week</time_frame>
    <description>Each UUI episode was rated on following scales: 0=None, 1=Mild, 2=Moderate, 3=Severe, which were collected through a diary on daily basis for approximately 4 weeks when subjects were under each cycling setting. The average degree of urgency per UUI episode was calculated from the last 7-day diaries were used for the analysis. The first 3 weeks were used as an adjustment period.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Global Response Assessment (GRA) - Randomized Portion</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Summary statistics of GRA at different cycling settings are provided. The GRA assessed incontinence symptoms as compared to symptoms prior to subject's entry into the study. Subjects were asked how much their incontinence changed since starting the study: markedly worse, moderately worse, mildly worse, same, slightly improved, moderately improved, or markedly improved. The responses to the symptom change were categorized into three levels for the analysis: worse (markedly worse, moderately worse, mildly worse), same (same), better (slightly improved, moderately improved, or markedly improved).
Percentages of subjects reported worse, same or better under each cycling setting since starting the study are presented.</description>

          <description>Thirty subjects were randomized to 1 of 24 sequences with 4 cycling settings: 2 subjects discontinued early with 1 due to an AE, and 1 due to consent withdrawal. Twenty-eight subjects completed the randomization sequences . After that all subjects went through no stimulation for approximately 4 weeks, which was not part of randomization.</description>

Subjects were asked how much their incontinence changed since starting the study: markedly worse, moderately worse, mildly worse, same, slightly improved, moderately improved, or markedly improved. The responses to the symptom change were categorized into three levels for the analysis: worse (markedly worse, moderately worse, mildly worse), same (same), better (slightly improved, moderately improved, or markedly improved).
Percentages of subjects reported worse, same or better under each cycling setting since starting the study are presented.</description>

        <title>Global Response Assessment - no Stimulation</title>
        <description>Summary of GRA under no stimulation setting is provided. The GRA assessed incontinence symptoms as compared to symptoms prior to subject’s entry into the study. Subjects were asked how much their incontinence changed since starting the study: markedly worse, moderately worse, mildly worse, same, slightly improved, moderately improved, or markedly improved. The responses to the symptom change were categorized into three levels for the analysis: worse (markedly worse, moderately worse, mildly worse), same (same), better (slightly improved, moderately improved, or markedly improved).</description>
