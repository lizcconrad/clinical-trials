      Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics of multiple doses of GCC-4401C in healthy male subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to investigate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of
      multiple doses of GCC-4401C in healthy male subjects.

      Forty-six subjects are planned for enrollment. The study consists of five cohorts (10 mg, 20
      mg, 40 mg, 60 mg, and 80 mg) with eight subjects per cohort. In the 20 mg cohort, six
      additional subjects will receive rivaroxaban (Xarelto®) 20 mg as an active comparator in
      open-label fashion. Within each of the five cohorts, six subjects will be randomized to
      GCC-4401C and two subjects will be randomized to placebo.

      The secondary objectives of this study are

        -  To characterize the single dose safety, tolerability, and PK after oral administration
           of GCC-4401C in healthy male subjects.

        -  To characterize the multiple dose pharmacodynamics after oral administration of
           GCC-4401C in healthy male subjects.

        -  To determine an appropriate dose range and dosing regimen of oral GCC-4401C for
           subsequent clinical trials.

        -  To compare the PK and PD of GCC-4401C with an active rivaroxaban (Xarelto®)group at 20
           mg in healthy male subjects.

The dose selection for this clinical study was based on the safety, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics results of the single dose study.
GCC-4401C was well tolerated in the single ascending dose study up to the highest single oral dose administered of 80 mg from 2.5 mg in 48 subjects.
The study consists of five cohorts (10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg, and 80 mg) with eight subjects per cohort.
In the 20 mg cohort, six additional subjects will receive rivaroxaban (Xarelto®) 20 mg as an active comparator in open-label fashion.</description>
