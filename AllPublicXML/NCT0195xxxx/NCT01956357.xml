  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to analyse the acute and chronic effects of two aerobic-training
      models performed in water and on dry land on cardiorespiratory, functional, metabolic,
      hormonal and quality-of-life parameters in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

    <description>The aquatic aerobic training had a duration of 12 weeks and adopted the interval-training method, with intensities ranging between 85 and 100% of second ventilatory threshold (VT2) and total duration of 45 minute per session.
The sessions consisted of warm up, main part and calm down. The warm-up consisted of a walk in deep water at low intensity for three minutes. The main part was intended to aerobic training in deep water, in which subjects walked and / or ran, depending on your fitness level found in pre-training test. The calm down consisted of walking in deep water at low intensity for two minutes and stretching standardized, emphasizing the muscles worked in the main part of the session, with a total duration of approximately five minutes.</description>
