  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation(Allo-HSCT) is currently an effective treatment
      for Acute leukemia (AL). Relapse after transplantation, being a main obstacle for patient
      survival, is so far treated by second transplantation and donor leukocyte infusion (DLI),
      which seems to have high risk and low survival. Need for a new medication on relapse is
      urgent. The immunotherapy using Dendritic cells (DCs) combined with cytokine induced killer
      (CIK) cells holds promise for the adjuvant treatment of AL to eradicate or control residual
      disease. This randomized study was conducted to evaluate the feasibility and effective of
      genetically modified DCs combining to CIK immunotherapy in relapse AL after allo-HSCT.

    <description>Patients received four subcutaneous injections of 2-5×10e7 cells of DCs at the groin, axilla, and neck respectively on days 7, 9, 11, and 13 and i.v. infusions of 2-15×10e9 CIK on days 11 and 13 per cycle. The cycle was repeated until Wilms' tumor 1(WT1) turned negative by polymerase chain reaction(PCR) or graft-versus-host disease(GVHD) appeared.</description>
