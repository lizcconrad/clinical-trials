  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of 3 months of continuous positive
      airway pressure (CPAP) treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in moderate to severe cases
      in patients with chronic kidney disease. The effect is evaluated on blood pressure levels,
      particularly nocturnal blood pressure, both central and peripheral, and renal function,
      including the kidneys treatment of salt and water.

      Hypothesis:

        1. Central 24-h blood pressure measuring is a reveals fluctuations in blood pressure during
           the day more accurately than peripheral 24-h blood pressure measuring because the
           measurement is painless and does not interfere with the patient activities during the
           daytime or nighttime sleep.

        2. Central blood pressure is elevated in patients with OSA and falls during treatment with
           CPAP.

        3. The renal tubular function relating to the treatment of water and sodium is abnormal in
           patients with OSA with increased tubular absorption of water via the U-aquaporin 2
           (u-AQP2) and of sodium by epithelial sodium channel (ENAC) and is normalized during
           treatment with CPAP.

      4 Quality of life is improved during treatment with CPAP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 30 patients with chronic kidney disease and obstructive sleep apnea in moderate
      to severe degree is examined with central and peripheral 24-h blood pressure monitoring, 1
      night home polygraphy to determine the degree of sleep apnea, blood and urine samples to
      determine levels of u-AQP2, u-ENAC, plasma renin concentration (PRC), s-angiotensin II
      (p-angII), p-aldosterone, p-vasopressin (p-avp) and p-endothelin, before the start treatment
      with CPAP for sleep apnea.

      After 3 month of treatment all the above described is repeated to determine effects of CPAP
      treatment on blood pressure levels during the day, changes i apnea hypopnea index (AHI) and
      the kidneys treatment of salt and water.
