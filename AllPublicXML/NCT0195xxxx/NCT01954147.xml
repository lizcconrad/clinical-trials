  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (SC) transplantation was a novel therapy for diabetes
      mellitus, with less side effects and more advantages. Clinical trials had verified that good
      metabolic control would be achieved when Liraglutide (GLP-1) was added to the conventional
      therapies. The investigators hypothesized that the combined therapy of umbilical cord
      mesenchymal stem cells transplantation and Liraglutide in type 2 diabetes mellitus will aid
      the differentiation of stem cells into insulin-producing cells, improve the survival of
      differentiated cells, protect the residual beta-cells and improve insulin secreting function,
      so as to achieve a favorable glucose homeostasis.
