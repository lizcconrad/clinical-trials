      Study of simvastatin in Iraq/Afghanistan Veterans with multiple blast exposure and mTBI. The
      study will measure substances in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that are related to dementing
      disorders.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans have experienced repetitive blast exposure mild traumatic
      brain injury (mTBI) with persistent cognitive, emotional, and neurological postconcussive
      symptoms. There is an urgent need to develop effective treatments to reduce both the
      intensity of these Veterans' current symptoms as well as their potential long-term risks for
      developing neurodegenerative dementing disorders related to repetitive mTBI: chronic
      traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Converging evidence suggests
      that statins may possess neuroprotective effects against pathologic processes related to tau
      protein metabolism that appear to be a common feature of CTE, AD, and other neurodegenerative
      sequelae of repetitive mTBI.

      The investigators propose a 12-month, double-blind, randomized, active-drug-controlled trial
      to establish proof-of-concept for use of simvastatin (40 mg/d) for decreasing CSF biomarkers
      of neurodegeneration and increasing CSF neurotrophins in 120 Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans
      with repetitive blast trauma mTBI.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males and females ages 21-50 years.

          -  Documented hazardous duty in Iraq and or Afghanistan with the U.S. Armed Forces.

          -  Exposure to one or more blast trauma events resulting in mTBI according to American
             Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine (ACRM) criteria.

          -  More than 6 months since last blast trauma exposure

          -  Ability to complete psychometric and other clinical assessments in English (i.e.,
             adequate English language skills, vision and hearing).

          -  elevated cholesterol levels, i.e. total cholesterol &gt;200 and/or LDL &gt;130. This would
             generally prompt the initiation of a lipid-lowering agent as standard care in the
             general medical community.

          -  No use of statins during the previous year and no recent (past 4 weeks) use of other
             lipid-lowering drugs (e.g., fibrates, niacin &gt; 500mg/d, or high dose omega-3 fatty
             acids) preceding randomization.

          -  No clinically significant laboratory abnormalities (electrolytes, glucose, carbon
             dioxide, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, vitamin B12, folate, albumin, thyroid
             stimulating hormone).

             severe major depressive disorder, or severe anxiety disorder except PTSD and panic
             disorder (PTSD and depressive symptoms are common co-morbid conditions for combat mTBI

          -  Exclusionary medications (used in the 4 weeks prior to screening):

          -  Fibrates and niacin due to increased risk for myopathy in combination with statins;

          -  Potential drug-drug interactions with statins via effects on CYP3A4: itraconazole,
             ketoconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, HIV protease inhibitors, nefazodone,
             amiodarone, cyclosporine, isoniazid, quinidine, or large quantities of grapefruit
             juice (&gt;1 quart daily);

          -  Selected CNS-acting medications: antipsychotics, anti-Parkinson's disease medications
             and CNS stimulants

          -  Other medications affecting coagulation and/or inflammation: coumadin, potent
             anti-inflammatory medications (hydrocortisone, methotrexate or other potent
