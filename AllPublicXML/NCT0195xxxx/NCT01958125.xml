    <textblock>
      The study will look at a non-invasive treatment for people suffering with chronic and
      episodic headaches. Study subjects will be randomized to an active treatment or an in-active
      treatment for 2 weeks. After the 2 weeks all subjects will continue to treat with an active
      treatment for an additional 2 weeks.

      The study is a prospective double blind, randomized, sham-controlled, multi-center
      investigation designed for comparison of two parallel groups, GammaCore® (active treatment)
      and a sham, (in-active) treatment. The study period begins with a 1-week run-in period,
      followed by a 2 week comparative period when the subjects are randomized (1:1) to either
      active treatment or sham (in-active) treatment. The comparative period will be followed by an
      open label 2 week period, where the subjects in the sham treatment group will switch in
      treatment assignment and receive an active treatment and the active group will continue to
      receive an active treatment.
