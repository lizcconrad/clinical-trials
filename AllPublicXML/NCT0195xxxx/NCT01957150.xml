    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study. The FF/VI inhalation
      powder once daily and VI inhalation powder once daily will be evaluated in subjects with COPD
      over 156 weeks. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of the inhaled
      corticosteroid FF on bone mineral density assessed at the total hip by comparing FF/VI
      treatment with VI treatment in subjects with moderate COPD.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Informed consent: Subjects must give their signed and dated written informed consent
             to participate.

          -  Gender: Male or female subjects. Female subjects must be post-menopausal or using a
             highly effective method for avoidance of pregnancy. The decision to include or exclude
             women of childbearing potential may be made at the discretion of the investigator in
             accordance with local practice in relation to adequate contraception.

          -  Age: &gt;= 40 years of age at Screening (Visit 1)

          -  COPD diagnosis: Subjects with a clinical history of COPD in accordance with the
             following definition by the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society:
             COPD is a preventable and treatable disease characterized by airflow limitation that
             is not fully reversible. The airflow limitation is usually progressive and is
             associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious particles or
             gases, primarily caused by cigarette smoking. Although COPD affects the lungs, it also
             produces significant systemic consequences.

          -  Tobacco use: Subjects with a current or prior history of &gt;=10 pack-years of cigarette
             smoking at screening (Visit 1). Former smokers are defined as those who have stopped
             smoking for at least 6 months prior to Visit 1. Number of pack years = (number of
             cigarettes per day/20) x number of years smoked Note: Pipe and/or cigar use cannot be
             used to calculate pack year history.

          -  Severity of Disease: Subject with a measured post-albuterol/salbutamol Forced
             expiratory volume (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio of &lt;0.70 at Screening
             (Visit 1). Subjects with a measured post-albuterol/salbutamol 50% &lt;=FEV1 &lt;=70% of
             predicted normal values calculated using National Health and Nutrition Examination
             Survey (NHANES III) reference equations at Screening (Visit 1).

             X-ray or CT scan is not available within 12 months prior to Visit 1.
