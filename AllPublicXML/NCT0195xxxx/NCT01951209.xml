  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C is the leading cause of chronic liver disease and cirrhosis in United States
      veterans. Cirrhosis is associated with impaired antibody responses and increased risk of
      bacterial infections. We have recently identified that cirrhosis is associated with
      abnormalities of memory B-cells, cells that make antibodies and help protect against
      bacterial infections. We have identified that chemicals associated with gut bacteria might
      play a role in causing these B-cell abnormalities. It is well known that gut bacteria have
      increased access to the blood in individuals with cirrhosis, a process called bacterial
      translocation. We hypothesize that reducing bacteria counts in the gut by using
      poorly-absorbed antibiotics (also known as selective gut decontamination) will partially
      reverse losses of memory B-cells in cirrhosis by reducing bacterial translocation.

      We intend to enroll 18 patients with cirrhosis who do not have hepatic encephalopathy to
      prospectively evaluate the impact of rifaximin on B-cell phenotype and function. We plan to
      employ a randomized, double-masked, prospective crossover design to minimize bias. Subjects
      will be randomized to receive either rifaximin SSD 80mg or a matched placebo once daily for
      12 weeks then crossed over to opposite therapy for 12 weeks. Serum and lymphocytes will be
      collected at baseline and every 4 weeks for in vitro assessment markers of gut microbial
      translocation and B-cell assays. Stool will be collected at baseline and every 12 weeks for
      future evaluation of changes of the gut microbiome.
