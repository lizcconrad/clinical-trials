  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of anemia in gynecologic oncology new patients has been seen in previous
      studies to be as high as 35-59%. this population includes women with several types of
      gynecologic malignancies. Therefore, it is assumed that the origin of the anemia can be due
      to anemia of chronic disease and iron deficiency anemia. No previous studies have looked at
      the efficacy of oral iron supplementation with concurrent Vitamin C in women with newly
      diagnosed gynecologic malignancies.

      Hypothesis: In newly diagnosed gynecologic oncology patients who are surgical candidates does
      treatment with 3-6 weeks of oral ferrous fumarate 300 mg once a day improve the mean change
      in hemoglobin levels, from baseline to pre-operative, in comparison to placebo.
