  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good or bad, pazopanib (GW786034),
      National Service Center (NSC) # 737754, has on children, adolescents and young adults between
      12 months and less than or equal to 18 years of age with relapsed or refractory
      rhabdomyosarcoma, non rhabdomyosarcomatous soft tissue sarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, relapsed or
      refractory osteosarcoma, neuroblastoma (measurable and/or evaluable), or hepatoblastoma. This
      is a two-stage open label phase II trial of pazopanib in children, adolescents and young
      adults with recurrent or refractory solid tumors. Eligible subjects will receive pazopanib
      daily as an oral tablet (450 mg/m^2/dose) or as a powder for suspension (225 mg/m^2/dose) in
      28 day cycles. The maximum dose to be administered daily for tablets is 800 mg and for
      suspension 400 mg. Subjects will be closely monitored with clinical and laboratory
      observations for side effects. Response to treatment will be evaluated using appropriate
      imaging studies. In the absence of severe toxicity or progressive disease, subjects may
      continue receiving pazopanib.
