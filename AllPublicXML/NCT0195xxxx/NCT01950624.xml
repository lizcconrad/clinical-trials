  <brief_summary>

      Objective: The development of a patient registry for Down syndrome (DS) was identified as a
      priority in the 2007 Down Syndrome Research Plan. Under the auspices of the Down Syndrome
      Consortium, founded in 2011 as a public-private partnership between the NIH and DS advocacy
      organizations, NICHD awarded a contract in 2012 to create a patient-focused online registry
      to facilitate research participation by individuals with DS. Two advisory boards, composed of
      advocates, family members, clinicians, researchers, and other relevant parties, have been
      involved in the development of the registry materials.

      Study Population: Individuals with DS (including those with mosaic DS and partial trisomy 21)

      Design: DS-Connect (TM) is an online survey tool designed to collect demographic data and
      health information from individuals with DS.

      Outcome measures: The purposes of DS-Connect (TM) are:

        1. To identify the various phenotypic manifestations of DS.

        2. To identify individuals with DS who may be eligible for research studies or new clinical
           trials, based on specific information about their diagnosis and health history.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Adults (at least 18 years of age) with a diagnosis of DS (including mosaic DS or
             partial trisomy 21) who are capable of providing consent to participate, or for whom a
             legally authorized representative (LAR) may give permission on behalf of the
             individual to participate. Adults with DS who cannot consent for themselves but can
             provide assent would need to provide assent to their LAR.

          -  Children (up to age 18 years of age) with a diagnosis of DS. Parents/guardians may
             enter registry information and give permission to participate on behalf of their
             child; if the child is over 7 years of age and able to provide assent, they must do
             so. (Note: Once a child has reached age 18, he or she will be prompted to re-enroll
             into the registry as an adult, if he/she is able to provide informed consent or with
             the consent of his/her LAR if unable to re-enroll themselves.)

          -  Children with DS (between the ages of 7 and 18 years) will be asked to provide their
             assent to register.

        No individuals with DS will be excluded from taking part in DS-Connect based on age, race,

        ethnicity, or gender.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  A person who does not have a diagnosis of DS (or mosaic DS or partial trisomy 21)

          -  Adults with DS who are not capable of providing informed consent or assent to
             participate and do not have a Legally Authorized Representative who can do so. In the
             case where an adults with DS is able to provide assent but does not do so, that adult
             will be excluded.

          -  A participant, parent, and/or LAR who cannot provide consent or does not read or
             understand a language that is available for the registry, either English or Spanish.

          -  A child with DS (between the ages of 7 and 18 years) who is capable of providing
             assent but does not do so.

          -  A child under the age of 18 years whose parents share joint custody and one parent
             indicates that they do not consent to the child s participation.
