      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of the Canary Breathing System (CBS)
      in treating the symptoms of panic disorder.

    <textblock>
      Panic disorder (PD) is associated with hyperventilation. The efficacy of a brief respiratory
      feedback program for PD has been previously established. The aim of the present study was to
      expand these results by testing a similar program with more clinically representative
      patients and settings. The intervention is delivered via home use following initial training
      by a clinician and provides remote monitoring of client adherence and progress by the
      clinician. Outcomes were assessed post-treatment and at 2- and 12-month follow-up.

        <description>The Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS) (Shear, 1997) is a widely used assessment tool measuring panic disorder symptom severity and impact. Seven questions are scored from 0 to 4 giving minimum and maximum scores of zero and 28 respectively. Higher scores represent more severe impact of symptoms.
A 40% decrease has been reported to be clinically significant (Furukawa et al 2009) and is defined as &quot;Response&quot; in this study.</description>
