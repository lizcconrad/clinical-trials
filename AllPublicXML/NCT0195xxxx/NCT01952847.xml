      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if glutamine can help control and
      prevent sores, blisters, or inflammation in your mouth or esophagus due to your current
      treatment.

      In this study, glutamine will be compared to a placebo. A placebo is not a drug. It looks
      like the drug but is not designed to treat any disease or illness. It is designed to be
      compared with a study drug to learn if the study drug has any real effect.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as
      in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups. You will have an equal chance of being
      assigned to either group:

        -  If you are in Group 1, you will receive glutamine.

        -  If you are in Group 2, you will receive a placebo.

      Neither you nor the study staff will know if you are receiving the study drug or the placebo.
      However, if needed for your safety, the study staff will be able to find out what you are
      receiving.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Glutamine or the placebo will be taken as a sugary drink by mouth. You will take the drink
      twice daily starting the day you first receive your anti-cancer therapy or radiation
      treatment.

      You will mix one scoop of powder with 25-100 milliliters (about 2-6 tablespoons) of water. If
      you are in the chemotherapy group, you will swish the drink for 10 seconds and swallow. If
      you are in the radiation group, you will swallow the drink in small amounts several times.

      Study Visits:

      At every visit, you will be asked about any side effects you may be having and about any
      other drugs you may be taking.

      Chemotherapy Group:

      On Days 1, 8, and 22 of Cycle 1:

        -  You will have a mouth exam.

        -  Your weight will be recorded.

      On Day 15 of Cycle 1:

        -  You will have a mouth exam.

        -  Your weight will be recorded.

        -  You will complete a quality of life questionnaire.

      On Day 1 of Cycle 2 and beyond:

        -  You will have a mouth exam.

        -  Your weight will be recorded.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine
           tests.

        -  You will complete a quality of life questionnaire.

        -  You will complete a survey about how you feel about the study drug. This should take
           about 5-10 minutes to complete.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a photograph of your mouth taken.

      After 3 months of chemotherapy:

        -  You will complete a quality of life questionnaire.

      After 6 months of chemotherapy:

        -  Your weight will be recorded.

        -  You will complete a quality of life questionnaire.

      Follow-Up:

      For your follow-up questionnaires at Day 1 of every Cycle, at 3 and 6 months, and during the
      End-of-Study visit, you may be called by the study team. This call should last about 5-10
      minutes.

      Radiation Therapy Group:

      On Weeks 1, 2, 4, and 6 of Radiation:

        -  You will be asked if you have inflammation of your esophagus.

        -  Your weight will be recorded.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine
           tests.

      On Weeks 3 and 5 of Radiation:

        -  You will be asked if you have inflammation of your esophagus.

        -  Your weight will be recorded.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine
           tests.

        -  You will complete a quality of life questionnaire.

        -  You will complete a survey about how you feel about the study drug.

      On Week 7 of Radiation:

        -  You will be asked if you have inflammation of your esophagus.

        -  Your weight will be recorded.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine
           tests.

        -  You will complete a quality of life questionnaire.

        -  You will complete a survey about how you feel about the study drug.

           1 month after your radiation has ended:

        -  You will be asked if you have inflammation of your esophagus.

        -  Your weight will be recorded.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine
           tests.

        -  You will complete a quality of life questionnaire.

        -  You will complete a survey about how you feel about the study drug.

           3 months after your radiation has ended:

        -  You will complete a quality of life questionnaire.

      Follow-Up:

      For your follow-up questionnaires at 1 and 3 months and during the End-of-Study visit, you
      may be called by the study team. This call should last about 5-10 minutes.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue taking the study drug for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest.

      You will continue taking the glutamine or placebo for 4 weeks after the completion of your
      anti-cancer therapy or radiation treatment. If you stop chemotherapy or radiation before
      completion of the intended study period, you will continue to take the study drug for 4
      weeks.

      If you develop severe sores, blisters, or inflammation in your mouth or esophagus, you will
      be removed from the study, and the doctor will give you another medication for your sores and
      blisters.

      Your participation on the study will be over 6 months after completion of your therapy.

      End-of-Study Visit:

      After you are off study, you will have an end-of-study visit. For the radiation group, this
      will be 6 months after radiation therapy. For the chemotherapy group, this is 4 weeks after
      the last dose.

        -  Your weight will be recorded.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine
           tests.

        -  You will complete a quality of life questionnaire.

        -  If you are in the chemotherapy group, you will have a mouth exam.

      This is an investigational study. Glutamine is FDA approved and commercially available for
      the treatment of short bowel syndrome. Its use to treat mouth sores and inflammation of the
      esophagus is investigational.

      Up to 180 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
