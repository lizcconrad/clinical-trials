    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies the effect of recombinant interferon gamma on tissue in
      treating patients with soft tissue sarcoma. Interferon gamma may interfere with the growth of
      tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether systemic administration of interferon (IFN) gamma (recombinant
      interferon gamma) will increase class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression in
      synovial sarcoma (SS) and myxoid/round cell liposarcoma (MRCL) tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether systemic administration of IFN gamma will increase class II MHC
      expression in SS and MRCL tumors.

      II. To examine changes in the immune response to MRCL and SS by examining changes in the
      immune infiltrates, antibody response and antigen specific T cell response before and after
      IFN gamma treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive recombinant interferon gamma subcutaneously (SC) every 7 days for 4 weeks
      before surgery or thrice weekly for 2 weeks before surgery.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 2 weeks post-surgery.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A diagnosis of synovial sarcoma and myxoid/round cell liposarcoma

          -  A superficial tumor easily and safely accessible for a research biopsy or are being
             considered for resection or biopsy of their tumor as part of standard of care and have
             recent pathology

          -  Zubrod performance status of '0-2' or Karnofsky score &gt; 60%

          -  No treatment with systemic anti-cancer treatment (chemotherapy or biologics) within 2
             weeks of starting interferon gamma

             within 180 days of starting IFN gamma

          -  Must have been off metformin for at least 2 weeks prior to starting IFN gamma
