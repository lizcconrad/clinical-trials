    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies vaccine therapy and temozolomide in treating patients with
      newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Vaccines made from a person's white blood cells mixed with
      tumor proteins may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells.
      Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth
      of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving vaccine
      therapy and temozolomide may be an effective treatment for glioblastoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and feasibility of adjuvant temozolomide plus combined allogeneic
      tumor primary tumor culture lysate / autologous dendritic cell (DC) vaccination (malignant
      glioma tumor lysate-pulsed autologous dendritic cell vaccine) in newly diagnosed glioblastoma
      patients following surgical debulking and external beam radiation therapy with concurrent
      temozolomide.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To document survival and progression-free survival in newly diagnosed glioblastoma
      patients receiving adjuvant temozolomide plus allogeneic tumor primary tumor culture lysate /
      autologous DC vaccination to historical data.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the ability of allogeneic tumor primary tumor culture lysate / autologous DC
      vaccine to generate multiple tumor-associated antigens (TAA)-specific immune responses in
      newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients.

      II. Assess the relationship between ability tumor induce TAA-specific immune responses and
      evidence of immunosuppression (peripheral blood immunophenotyping by flow cytometry)
      following allogeneic tumor primary tumor culture lysate / autologous DC vaccine in newly
      diagnosed GBM patients.

      III. Assess the relationship between efficacy endpoints (survival, progression-free survival,
      tumor response) and tumor-associated antigen immune response following combined autologous or
      allogeneic tumor lysate / DC vaccination and adjuvant temozolomide.

      IV. Assess the relationship between efficacy endpoints (survival, progression-free survival,
      tumor response) and evidence of immunosuppression at baseline and over time with combined
      autologous or allogeneic tumor lysate / DC vaccination and adjuvant temozolomide.

      OUTLINE:

      COURSE 1: Patients receive temozolomide orally (PO) daily on days 1-5.

      COURSES 2-3: Patients receive temozolomide PO daily on days 1-5 and malignant glioma tumor
      lysate-pulsed autologous dendritic cell vaccine intradermally (ID) on days 1, 3, and 5.

      COURSES 4-6: Patients receive temozolomide PO daily on days 1-5 and malignant glioma tumor
      lysate-pulsed autologous dendritic cell vaccine ID on day 1.

      COURSES 7-12: Patients receive malignant glioma tumor lysate-pulsed autologous dendritic cell
      vaccine ID on day 1.

      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
