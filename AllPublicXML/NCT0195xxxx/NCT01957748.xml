      CCTG 594 is a controlled, unblinded, two-arm, randomized (1:1) clinical trial to evaluate the
      effectiveness of a clinic-based HIV ALERT specialist on improving endpoints of retention in
      care and maintenance of ART as compared to the current standard of care (SoC) in HIV primary
      care clinics.

      Design: CCTG 594 is a controlled, unblinded, two-arm, randomized (1:1) clinical trial to
      evaluate the effectiveness of a clinic-based HIV ALERT specialist on improving endpoints of
      retention in care and maintenance of ART as compared to the current standard of care (SoC) in
      HIV primary care clinics.

      Duration: Each subject will receive follow-up of at least 48 weeks.

      Sample Size: A total of 300 subjects will be randomized, 150 per arm.

      Study Population: Eligible subjects will include 1) newly diagnosed HIV-infected individuals
      entering primary HIV care at one of the CCTG clinics, or 2) previously diagnosed HIV-infected
      individuals who are &quot;out of care&quot; defined as having no visit with a prescribing HIV provider
      in the last 180 days and not on a stable ARV regimen.

      Stratification: Subjects will be stratified based on study site and if they are newly
      diagnosed or returning to care.

    <description>The CCTG 594 primary outcome is &quot;time to lost to follow up.&quot; Lost to follow up is defined as &quot;no visit with a prescribing HIV provider in the last 180 days. All randomized subjects will be followed for a minimum of 48 weeks. Subjects that do not meet the primary endpoint by the time the study ends will be censored.</description>

    <description>The CCTG 594 secondary outcome is &quot;time to initiation of ART.&quot; All randomized subjects will be followed for a minimum of 48 weeks. Subjects that do not initiate ART will be censored at their last visit date.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Descriptive analyses</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to two years</time_frame>
    <description>Descriptive secondary analyses comparing the two randomized groups will include:
Baseline and follow-up scores on HIV and health literacy assessments, disclosure rates, adherence, and measures of self-efficacy
Number of primary care visits per year
HIV RNA &lt; 50 and &lt;200 copies/mL at years 1 and 2
CD4 cell counts and changes from baseline in CD4 at years 1 through 2
Scores on Beck Depression Index
Substance use
HIV high-risk transmission behaviors
Time to AIDS diagnosis or death</description>

    <measure>Return to Care after Primary Endpoint</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Proportions of subjects that meet the primary endpoint but subsequently return to care will be compared between the randomized groups. The times between last visit and return visit will also be compared between the randomized groups.</description>

    <description>Subjects randomized into the ALERT Enhanced Retention Intervention Arm will receive SoC at the HIV clinic where subjects are seen. In addition to SoC, the Intervention arm will receive aggressive engagement efforts by the ALERT specialist to ensure visit continuity and retention into care. The ALERT specialist will also administer an education intervention consisting of 5 retention modules designed to improve HIV knowledge and self-efficacy, and will also monitor health care visits and intervene via methods to track, find, and re-engage patients during the study.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  HIV-1 infection, as documented by any licensed screening antibody test, such as ELISA,
             and confirmed by a second antibody test, such as Western blot, or detectable plasma
             HIV-1 RNA at any time prior to study entry. If an ELISA or Western blot is not
             available, HIV infection may be documented by two HIV RNA values â‰¥2000 copies/mL,
             drawn at least 24 hours apart. The RNA assays must have been run at a CLIA-approved
             laboratory or equivalent.

          -  18 years of age or older.

          -  Able to give written informed consent.

          -  New patient to the clinic (defined as someone who has never engaged in HIV care) or a
             patient returning to care (defined as a patient previously seen at least once by a
             prescribing HIV provider who has not seen a prescribing HIV provider in the last 180
             days and is not on a stable ARV regimen).

          -  English or Spanish Speaking.

          -  Registered to receive HIV primary care services at one of the identified
             CCTG-affiliated clinic, i.e. the Owen Clinic at UC San Diego Health System,
             Harbor-UCLA Medical Center clinic or Rand Schrader clinic at USC.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unstable neurologic, psychiatric, or physical condition which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, would limit participation with study procedures for the duration of the
             study.

          -  A level of drug or alcohol use that, in the opinion of the investigator, would
             preclude safe participation in the study.

          -  Resident of nursing home or skilled facility.

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding.

          -  Patient's first primary care visit (for new patients) or return to care visit (for
             patients returning to care) occurred &gt; 60 days ago.
