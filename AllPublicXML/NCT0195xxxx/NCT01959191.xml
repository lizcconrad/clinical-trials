      Objective: To evaluate the early and late prognoses of patients according to platelet
      reactivity after clopidogrel administration and determine whether the measurement of platelet
      inhibition predicted 1-year clinical outcomes after off-pump coronary bypass (OPCAB) Study
      design

        -  Prospective, observational, single-center study

        -  Subjects with OPCAB surgery who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be
           enrolled.

        -  Platelet reactivity after 7-days clopidogrel treatment from the day of surgery will be
           measured by VerifyNow system.

        -  Dual antiplatelet therapy including aspirin and clopidogrel will be administered for 1
           year after surgery and subjects will be followed-up for 1 year about primary endpoint.

        -  Cutoff value of P2Y12 reactivity units (PRUs) for primary endpoint will be assessed and
           the cohort will be divided by the PRU cutoff value (low/high platelet reactivity
           groups).

        -  The primary and secondary endpoints will be compared between two groups

    <time_frame>1 year after off-pump coronary bypass surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint of the study was the 1-year incidence of MACEs, which included the following: (1) cardiac death, defined as death in the presence of acute coronary syndrome, sudden cardiac arrest with documented cardiac arrhythmia, or refractory congestive heart failure; 2) nonfatal MI; and (3) target vessel revascularization in relation to platelet reactivity as measured by the VerifyNow system.</description>

    <description>Platelet reactivity will be measured after 7-days treatment of clopidogrel by VerifyNow system and the cohort will be divided by two group according to P2Y12 reactivity unit (PRU) cutoff value. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves will be plotted to assess the optimal PRU cutoff value for differentiating between patients with and without subsequent MACEs after 1 year of follow-up. Low platelet reactivity indicates good response to clopidogrel and high platelet reactivity, resistance to clopidogrel. Groups will be &quot;Low platelet reactivity group&quot; and &quot;High platelet reactivity group&quot;</description>
