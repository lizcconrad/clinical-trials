    <textblock>
      This is a transversal double-centre study. Patients will be recruited from outpatient
      consultations. They will have buccal inflammation caused by periodontal disease (frequent
      oral infections, mostly with GRAM (-) bacteria). Three groups of 80 patients, corresponding
      to slight, moderate and severe periodontal disease, will be formed according to the results
      of radiological and clinical examinations.
