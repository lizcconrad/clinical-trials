    <textblock>
      Study Part I is a single-ascending dose study. Healthy male subjects to be included in the
      study and randomized in 6 dose groups, Groups A-F (8 subjects per group). Of the 8 subjects
      per group, 6 subjects receive the investigational drug and 2 subjects receive matching
      placebo. Study Part II is a 3-period, crossover, single dose study. Nine healthy male
      subjects to be enrolled in one group (Group G). Each subject to receive 2 different
      formulations of the prodrug and one formulation of the active drug in a randomized sequence.

      Study Part I is a prospective, single-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled,
      single-ascending dose, Phase 1 study. Approximately 48 healthy male subjects to be included
      in the study and randomized in 6 dose groups, Groups A-F (8 subjects per group). Of the 8
      subjects per group, 6 subjects are to receive the investigational drug and 2 subjects to
      receive matching placebo. Study Part II is a prospective, single-center, open-label,
      randomized, 3-period, crossover, single dose, Phase 1 study. Nine healthy male subjects to be
      enrolled in one group, Group G. Each subject to receive 2 different formulations of the
      prodrug and one formulation of the active drug in a randomized sequence.
