  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled study designed to determine
      the effectiveness of myo-Inositol 5% Injection to increase the incidence of survival without
      severe Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) through acute/final ROP determination up to 55 weeks
      postmenstrual age (PMA) in premature infants &lt;28 0/7 weeks' gestation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 1760 infants are to be enrolled at approximately 18 NICHD Neonatal Research
      Network (NRN) Centers (approximately 44 sites) in the United States. Infants meeting the
      study selection criteria and for whom informed consent is obtained will be randomized to
      receive either 80 mg inositol/kg/day or placebo, administered in divided doses every 12 hours
      (40 mg/kg/dose). Study drug will be administered daily, starting within 12 to 72 hours of
      birth and continued until the earliest of 34 weeks PMA, 10 weeks chronologic age, or the time
      of hospital discharge or transfer. Inositol or placebo will be administered IV until enteral
      feedings reach 120ml/kg/day (or sooner if the infant is no longer receiving IV fluids), at
      which time the same dose and formulation will be administered enterally every 12 hours.

      For publication purposes, the analysis of the primary efficacy outcome will consider the
      entire study population. In support of a new drug application (NDA) for use of myo-Inositol
      5% Injection to increase survival without severe ROP through the determination of acute/final
      ROP status, the analysis of the primary efficacy outcome will be conducted for the entire
      study population and separately within pre-specified regulatory sub-studies created by
      administratively splitting infants enrolled at each study center into two sub-studies.

      Assessments performed during the study include customary newborn intensive care procedures
      including repeat eye examinations until ROP status is final (which often extends after
      discharge), measurements of growth, cranial ultrasounds or other imaging per usual practice,
      and the collection of clinical diagnoses throughout hospitalization to evaluate other common
      morbidities of extreme preterm birth. Adverse events will be recorded from time of treatment
      initiation until 7 days after the last dose of study drug, and concurrent medications will be
      recorded from 24 hours prior to randomization until 7 days after the last dose of study drug
      or until discharge or transfer if sooner. Using the separate NICHD Follow-up protocol, longer
      term data will be collected at 22-26 months corrected age, including growth,
      neurodevelopmental testing, overall health status, rehospitalizations, surgeries and
      diagnoses, including ophthalmic diagnoses and treatments since discharge.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Survival without severe Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) through Acute/Final ROP status determination (favorable) versus development of severe ROP or death prior to reaching Acute/Final ROP status (unfavorable) followed up to 55 weeks PMA.</measure>
    <time_frame>by 55 weeks PMA</time_frame>
    <description>Death in relation to the primary variable will be defined as from any cause before Acute/Final ROP status is determined.
Favorable Acute/Final ROP status requires that no ROP, or only mild ROP has occurred in both eyes and that the eyes have matured beyond the risk of developing severe ROP.
Unfavorable ROP determination requires that one or both eyes reach ROP severity warranting intervention.
Since an estimated 5 to 8 percent of primary outcomes are expected to be missing primarily due to final acute ROP status not being determined by 55 weeks (favorable or unfavorable status), where possible, for the primary analysis for publication an adjudication process will be used to determine final acute status for those with incomplete or missing final acute ROP status. This assessment will be used in defining the survival without sROP (favorable vs. unfavorable ROP status).
Thus, information on both survival and ROP status are necessary to obtain the primary outcome</description>

          -  Age in hours up to 72 hours, although we will seek enrollment as early as feasible

          -  Congenital malformations of the eye identified prior to randomization.

          -  Overt evidence of intrauterine congenital infections (&quot;TORCH&quot;) or life threatening
             impairment of renal, hepatic, or cardiac function (considered moribund).
