  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is designed to study whether pomegranate extract benefits cognitive abilities in
      middle-aged and older non-demented volunteers. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of
      two treatment groups: either a placebo or the pomegranate extract supplement. Both the
      placebo and pomegranate extract will be packaged in 1000 milligram capsules to maintain
      blindness. Subjects will take one 1000 milligram capsule daily for twelve months.

      The investigators expect the people receiving the pomegranate extract supplement to show
      better cognitive performance compared with those receiving a placebo after one, six, and
      twelve months. The investigators believe cognitive decline and treatment response will vary
      according to a genetic risk for Alzheimer's.

      The investigators will study 212 non-demented subjects aged 50-75 years. Initially, subjects
      will undergo a clinical assessment, an MRI and a blood draw to determine genetic risk and to
      rule out other neurodegenerative disorders linked to memory complaints.

      Subsequently, subjects will undergo the first memory (or neuropsychological) assessments.
      Following the first assessment, subjects will begin taking the supplement (either the
      pomegranate extract or the placebo). Subjects will undergo a brief memory test at one-month
      mark. At six months, subjects will have a second, full neuropsychological assessment. The
      final assessment will take place at the end of the study, the 12-month mark. Additional blood
      will be drawn at baseline and at 12 months and frozen to assess inflammatory markers if
      outcomes are positive. Subjects will also be asked to come to the University of California,
      Los Angeles (UCLA) at 3 and 9 months for supplement refills.

      In total, subjects will be expected to come to UCLA for 7 visits during the course of 12-13
      months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Agreement to participate in the 12-month double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical
             trial of pomegranate extract.

          -  Nondemented subjects either those with normal cognition or with Mild Cognitive
             Impairment will be included.

          -  Age 50 to 75 years.

          -  No significant cerebrovascular disease: modified Ischemic Score of &lt; 4

             interfere with the study. If screening laboratory tests or EKG show abnormalities,
             subject must obtain written clearance from primary care physician before continuing in
