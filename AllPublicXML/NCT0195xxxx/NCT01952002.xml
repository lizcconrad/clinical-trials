      The aim of this study is evaluate the clinical, hemodynamic and electrocardiographic
      responses during an inspiratory muscle training session during a single cardiopulmonary
      rehabilitation session program. An electrocardiogram will be continuously recorded and the
      heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) will be evaluated before, during and immediately
      after a single inspiratory muscle training (IMT) session, consisting of two series of 15
      cycles, with one-minute intervals between sets and an initial load of at least 30% of the
      initial maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP).

    <description>During an IMT session, with two sets of 15 cycles at 30% of the load observed in MIP, there were no significant clinical or hemodynamic changes in patients regularly attending a supervised exercise program. In contrast, there are relatively frequent inductions of cardiac arrhythmias, mostly of low complexity, and more rarely, fleeting changes in ventricular repolarization during an IMT session.</description>

    <description>21 (16 males/5 femalesen) with a mean age of 73 ± 7.4 years were studied. Among the 21 study participants, the most prevalent clinical condition was coronary artery disease (11 cases); four individuals showing a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and/or asthma, two presented congestive heart failure and the last four had other diseases</description>

    <description>Each session The session itself consisted of the following: two sets of 15 breathe cycles without removing the breathing promoter from the mouth and with the aid of a nose clip and 1-minute interval between sets. For training, we used the breathing promoters Power Breathe® Plus Light and Medium Resistance, possessing 10 levels of load gradation ranging from 17 to 186 cm H2O, which were adjusted for each patient and allowed for the individualized prescription of IMT</description>
