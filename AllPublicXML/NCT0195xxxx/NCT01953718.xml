  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of different parameters (voltage, pulse
      width, frequency) of subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) on motor symptoms
      in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).

      In this observational study, we will retrospectively analyze the one-year follow-up data of
      27 PD patients who received bilateral STN DBS in the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen
      University in the years 2008-2012. The data, including parameter settings and severity of
      motor symptoms indicated by Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part III scores,
      was collected during the patients' annual visit to the hospital for reprogramming. A
      correlation analysis will be conducted to investigate the relationship between change of a
      specific parameter and the subsequent change of motor scores.
