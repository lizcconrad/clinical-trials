  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to quantify the biomarkers of pre-radiation therapy(RT),
      during-RT, and post-RT serum samples from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and esophageal
      cancer patients undergoing definitive or neoadjuvant RT, and to correlate them with tumor
      response, patterns of failure, survival outcome, and RT-related lung or liver toxicity. The
      secondary goal of this study is to set up the PLA platform in our institute for future
      biomarker test.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There have been many biomarkers, such as angiogenesis factors and cytokines, related to
      cancer progression or microenvironment interaction. However, the commonly used enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA) requires the certain volume of each sample for specific antigen
      or antibody. It may not be practically efficient to test a broad spectrum of biomarkers with
      limited volumes of serum from cancer patients. Proximity ligation assay (PLA), an established
      concept and platform requiring very little sample volume to quantitatively detect a variety
      of biomarkers, is being developed with multiplex versions of improved sensitivity and dynamic
      range by the Stanford group. From the three completed trials (&quot;In vivo/vitro
      radiation-induced liver disease in HBV carrier（9261700196）&quot;, &quot;Bystander effect study of
      radiation-induced viral hepatitis B reactivation（9261700196）&quot;, and &quot;Pre- and
      post-chemoradiation blood RNA-microarray analysis to predict response and outcome of locally
      advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma（200805061R）&quot;) and one ongoing trial (&quot;A phase I
      dose escalation trial of conformal hypofractionated radiation therapy for patients with
      hepatitis B virus-related Child A cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma（200906051R）&quot;), we
      have collected the pre-treatment and post-treatment serum samples of patients with
      hepatocellular carcinoma undergoing definitive radiotherapy and patients with esophageal
      cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Altered patterns of failure for
      post-radiotherapy hepatocellular carcinoma, especially intrahepatic and extrahepatic
      metastasis, and treatment response for post-chemoradiotherapy esophageal cancer upon
      esophagectomy, demands the effective biomarkers for the early prediction and appropriate
      management. The limited sample volumes form the obstacle of testing adequate number of
      biomarkers by ELISA. In this study we plan to collaborate with the Stanford group, to send
      and process these samples (100 μL each) to measure the dynamic changes of up to 56 or more
      biomarkers. We try to find the potential biomarkers correlating with treatment responses and
      patterns of failure for the future clinical practice, and wish to set up this viable PLA
      platform in our institute through this collaboration.

    <description>All statistical analyses completed in this study are executed using the R statistical computing environment. To select the discrete set of biomarkers used to fit models of HCC or esophageal cancer diagnosis, we use the R distribution of the Prediction Analysis of Microarrays statistical technique, PAMR. Logistic regression models are fit using the generalized linear model function in R.</description>

    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Survival data are fit to a right-censored model using the Survival function in the R statistical computing environment. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models are fit onto survival data using the coxph function. Hazard ratios are calculated as the ratios of risk by the increase or decrease of 1 log2 PLA unit (2-fold increase or decrease in serum concentration of a biomarker). Lung or liver toxicity is graded by Common Toxicity Criteria version 3.0. Grade of toxicity is defined as the categorical variable and is correlated with the ratios of risk by the increase or decrease of 1 log2 PLA unit.</description>
