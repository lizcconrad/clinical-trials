  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of the study is to explore whether the rehabilitation of the upper extremity
      performed in interaction with a virtual environment could improve motor function in
      post-ischemic and post-haemorrhagic stroke subjects with hemiparesis, in comparison to the
      traditional neuromotor rehabilitation treatment.

    <description>The kinematic assessment include the execution of standardised upper limb movements, such as: forearm pronation and supination, elbow flexion and extension, shoulder abduction and adduction, shoulder internal and external rotation, shoulder flexion and extension and reaching movements. The mean linear velocity (Speed), the mean duration of movements (Time) and the mean number of submovements (Peak) will be measured, by means of the Virtual Reality Rehabilitation System (VRRS). The data will be registered at the beginning and at the end of treatment, 4 weeks thereafter.</description>

    <description>During the experiment, patients in the RFVE training group (Reinforced Feedback in Virtual Environment) will receive 1 hour of virtual reality-based therapy by means of RFVE and 1 hour of TNR treatment (Traditional Neuromotor Rehabilitation). Both treatments will last 1 hour a day, five days weekly for four weeks. The treatment is focused on motor function impairment of the upper extremity.</description>

    <description>The TNR training group (Traditional Neuromotor Rehabilitation) patients will be treated totally for two hours daily by means of a TNR programme. The treatment will last 4 weeks.</description>

    <description>The patients allocated to RFVE group, will be treated using the &quot;Virtual Reality Rehabilitation System&quot; (VRRS). During the virtual therapy the subject will be seated in front of the wall screen grasping a sensorized real object with the affected hand. If the grasp is not possible the sensors will be fixed on a glove worn by the patient. The real object held by the subject, equipped with electromagnetic sensors, is matched to the virtual handling object. Thereafter, the patient moved the real object (e.g. ball) following the trajectory of the corresponding virtual object displayed on the computer screen in accordance with the requested virtual task.</description>

    <description>The patients randomized to the Traditional Neuromotor Rehabilitation group will be asked to perform exercises for postural control, exercises for hand pre-configuration, exercises for the stimulation of manipulation and functional skills, exercises for proximal-distal coordination. All the exercises will be performed with or without the assistance of a physiotherapist. The upper limb motricity will be trained with progressive complexity. To achieve the requested goal (in a horizontal or vertical plane) patients will be asked to perform various movements, for example: shoulder flexion and extension, shoulder abduction and adduction, shoulder internal and external rotation and shoulder circumduction, elbow flexion and extension, forearm pronation and supination, hand grasping-release and clenching into a fist.</description>
