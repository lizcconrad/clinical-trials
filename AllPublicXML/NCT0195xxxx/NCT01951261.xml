  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine if an early assisted discharge program for acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD),
      with telemonitoring and telephone control, is equally effective and more efficient in terms
      of use of health care resources, that a home care provided by hospital respiratory nurses and
      pulmonologists.

      This study seeks to improve the health of patients with AECOPD by home care after discharge
      from the Hospital using the technology of the information and the communication. The
      investigators want evaluate the efficiency, satisfaction (patients, keepers) and
      effectiveness of a program of early discharge with home care in patients with AECOPD with
      telemonitoring and telephone control, in relation to the traditional protocol of home care
      based on nurse and pulmonologist visits.
