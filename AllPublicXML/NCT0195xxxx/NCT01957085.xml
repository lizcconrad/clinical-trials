  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that there are approximately 3.2
      million people in the United States infected with hepatitis C and a significant percentage of
      these patients are unaware of their diagnosis. This study will attempt to determine the point
      prevalence of undiagnosed hepatitis C infection in an urban hospital population. All patients
      admitted to the hospital on two separate days will have hepatitis C testing done on leftover
      serum and plasma that was collected as part of routine inpatient lab work. Our primary goal
      is to determine the number of undiagnosed hepatitis C infected patients in our hospitalized
      population. We will also compare these rates to specific demographic characteristics, such as
      age, race, gender, zip code and type of insurance to see if any associations exist between
      these demographics and undiagnosed hepatitis C infection.
