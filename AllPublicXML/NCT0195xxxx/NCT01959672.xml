      This phase II trial studies how well combination chemotherapy with or without oregovomab
      followed by stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and nelfinavir mesylate works in
      treating patients with pancreatic cancer that has spread to nearby organs or tissues. Drugs
      used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride, leucovorin calcium, and
      fluorouracil, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Monoclonal
      antibodies, such as oregovomab, can block tumor growth in different ways by targeting certain
      cells. Stereotactic body radiation therapy is a specialized radiation therapy that sends
      x-rays directly to the tumor using smaller doses over several days and may cause less damage
      to normal tissue. Drugs, such as nelfinavir mesylate, may make tumor cells more sensitive to
      radiation therapy. Giving combination chemotherapy with or without oregovomab followed by
      SBRT and nelfinavir mesylate may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, (gemcitabine [gemcitabine
      hydrochloride], leucovorin [leucovorin calcium], fluorouracil [5-FU]) with or without
      oregovomab, followed by hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) concurrently with
      nelfinavir (nelfinavir mesylate) in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer that is
      cancer antigen (CA)125 positive (&gt;= 10) or CA125 negative (&lt; 10).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, (gemcitabine, leucovorin, 5-FU) with or
      without oregovomab, followed by SRT concurrently with nelfinavir in patients with locally
      advanced pancreatic cancer that is CA125 positive (&gt;= 10) or CA125 negative (&lt; 10).

      II. To assess the cellular and humoral immune responses to active immunotherapy with
      oregovomab/monoclonal antibody in patients with pancreas cancer with CA125 level greater than
      10 undergoing chemotherapy and radiation treatments.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate tumor and organ motion with 4-dimensional (4D) computed tomography (CT) and
      respiratory gating system.

      II. To evaluate the effect of tumor/organ motion on the dosimetry, local control and
      survival.

      III. To evaluate inter- and intra-fractional target motion with Calypso system.

      OUTLINE:

      CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously (IV), leucovorin
      calcium IV over 30 minutes, and fluorouracil IV over 24 hours on days 1 and 8. Treatment
      repeats every 3 weeks for 7 courses.

      IMMUNOTHERAPY: Patients with CA125 level &gt;= 10 receive oregovomab IV over 15-30 minutes on
      day 15. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 3 courses (weeks 1, 4, 7) and post- radiation
      therapy for 1 course (week 14). Patients may receive an additional 3 courses concurrently
      with chemotherapy upon recovery from surgery based on CA125 level. Patients also receive
      nelfinavir mesylate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 5 weeks beginning on day 15 of week 9.

      STEREOTACTIC RADIATION THERAPY: Beginning in week 11, patients undergo SBRT in 5 fractions
      over 5 consecutive days. Upon completion of radiation therapy, patients resume nelfinavir
      mesylate for 14 days (week 12-13). Patients without metastasis and with resectable disease
      undergo surgery in week 17-18.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year,
      every 4 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months thereafter.

             disease including cellular immunodeficiency's, hypogammaglobulinemia or
             dysgammaglobulinemia

          -  Patients receiving the following drugs that are contraindicated with nelfinavir (NFV)
             (VIRACEPT) will be excluded if they cannot be change or discontinued; drugs that
             should not be coadministered with Viracept:

               -  Antiarrhythmics: amiodarone, quinidine

               -  Antimycobacterial: rifampin

               -  Ergot derivatives: dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, ergotamine, methylergonovine

               -  Herbal products: St. John's wort (hypericum perforatum)

               -  3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl (HMG)-acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) reductase inhibitors:
                  lovastatin, simvastatin

               -  Neuroleptic: pimozide

               -  Sedative/hypnotics: midazolam, triazolam

          -  Patients receiving the following drugs will be clinically evaluated as to whether
             dosage/medication can be changed to permit patient on study:

               -  Anti-convulsants: carbamazepine, phenobarbital

               -  Anti-convulsant: phenytoin; phenytoin plasma/serum concentrations should be
                  monitored; phenytoin dose may require adjustment to compensate for altered
                  phenytoin concentration

               -  Anti-mycobacterial: rifabutin; it is recommended that the dose of rifabutin be
                  reduced to one-half the usual dose when administered with VIRACEPT; 1250 mg BID
                  is the preferred dose of VIRACEPT when coadministered with rifabutin

               -  Erectile dysfunction agent: sildenafil; sildenafil shall not exceed a maximum
                  single dose of 25 mg in a 48 hour period

               -  HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor: atorvastatin; use lowest possible dose of
                  atorvastatin with careful monitoring, or consider other HMG-CoA reductase
                  inhibitors such as pravastatin or fluvastatin in combination with VIRACEPT

               -  Immunosuppressants: cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus

               -  Narcotic analgesic: methadone; dosage of methadone may need to be increased when
                  coadministered with VIRACEPT

               -  Oral contraceptive: ethinyl estradiol; alternative or additional contraceptive
                  measures should be used when oral contraceptives and VIRACEPT are coadministered

               -  Macrolide antibiotic: azithromycin; dose adjustment of azithromycin is not
                  recommended, but close monitoring for known side effects such as liver enzyme
                  abnormalities and hearing impairment is warranted
