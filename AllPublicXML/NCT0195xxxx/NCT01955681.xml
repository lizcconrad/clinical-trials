      This is a retrospective, non-interventional, multicenter, observational chart review study to
      explore the clinical benefits of retreatment with TKI in the real world.

    <textblock>
      This study is designed to retrospectively review the medical and chemotherapy records of 300
      patients with EGFR mutation positive adenocarcinoma NSCLC. Eligible patients are as follows:
      histologically or cytologically confirmed NSCLC, undergone EGFR-TKI retreatment sometime
      after the failure of the initial EGFR-TKI. After initial treatment, patients had been treated
      with chemotherapy and subsequently re-treated with EGFR-TKI will be identified. The target
      population will be derived from multicentre in Taiwan. The study aim is to evaluate clinical
      effect in re-administration of EGFR-TKI using retrospectively collected data from these
      eligible patients to provide valuable information.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The treatment duration of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor re-administration</measure>
    <time_frame>From the start of re-administration of EGFR-TKI to data cut-off date, assessed approximately up to 6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The median duration of re-administration of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor will be summarized by days or months, if applicable. The range of this treatment duration will also be presented. All analyses will be performed on all eligible patients in this study.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of progression-free survival for initial, second EGFR-TKI treatment and chemotherapy between two Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor treatments.</measure>
    <time_frame>From the start of administration of EGFR-TKI to data cut-off date, assessed approximately up to 6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome of progression-free survival will be presented with median values and associated 95% CIs by Kaplan-Meier curve. PFS is defined as the time interval (in weeks) from the start date of a given treatment to the date of disease progression or death, respectively, which one is observed first. Subjects who did not progress or die without a reported progression will be censored on the date of their last tumor assessment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of overall survival for initial, second EGFR-TKI treatment and chemotherapy between two Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor treatments.</measure>
    <time_frame>From the start of administration of EGFR-TKI to data cut-off date, assessed approximately up to 6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome of overall survival will be presented with median values and associated 95% CIs by Kaplan-Meier curve. OS is defined as the time interval (in weeks) from the beginning of treatment until the date when death or lost to follow up is observed. For those subjects who have not died or lost to follow-up, survival duration will be censored at the last date the subject was known to be alive.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of response rate for initial, second EGFR-TKI treatment and chemotherapy between two Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor treatments.</measure>
    <time_frame>From the start of administration of EGFR-TKI to data cut-off date, assessed approximately up to 6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome about response rate and the proportion of response rate are estimated by all evaluable patients. The 95% exact confidence interval will be constructed around the rates. The best response during treatment sequences is determined in accordance with the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of disease control rate for initial, second EGFR-TKI treatment and chemotherapy between two Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor treatments.</measure>
    <time_frame>From the start of administration of EGFR-TKI to data cut-off date, assessed approximately up to 6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome of disease control rate are estimated by all evaluable patients. The 95% exact confidence interval will be constructed around the rates. Disease Control Rate is defined as patients who are respond to treatment (including CR-complete respond, PR-partial respond or SD- Stable Disease).</description>

    <description>If the images are available, conduct image peer review to evaluate tumour size retrospectively in different sequences of treatment: (1) initial and re-administration of EGFR-TKI therapy, (2) first time chemotherapy ever used (second-line treatment) after initial EGFR-TKI treatment. Peer review time point includes baseline, best response and progression of last image while stopping treatment at each treatment mentioned above.</description>
