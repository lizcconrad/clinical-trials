      1: SPECIFIC AIM I: To compare treatment options for neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) due to
      in-utero narcotic exposure. One hundred eighty four full-term infants with a diagnosis of NAS
      requiring medications will be studied. Infants will be randomized to receive either morphine
      or methadone. It is hypothesized that morphine treated infants will do better and require
      fewer days in the hospital compared to methadone treated infants.

      2. SPECIFIC AIM II: To evaluate the effects of NAS treatment on long-term neurodevelopmental
      outcome. Infants will be evaluated with development testing at 18 months of age. It is
      hypothesized that morphine treated infants will have better neurodevelopmental outcomes. It
      is also hypothesized that neurobehavioral abnormalities identified at two weeks of age will
      correlate with neurodevelopmental impairment at 18 months.

      3: SPECIFIC AIM III: To determine if common genetic variations in the genes involving
      narcotic action contribute to the severity of NAS. A DNA sample will be obtained from all
      infants and analyzed for differences in 3 key genes. This will then be correlated with
      short-term and long-term outcomes.

      1: SPECIFIC AIM I: To compare the short term efficacy of morphine and methadone for the
      treatment of NAS. One hundred eighty four term infants with a diagnosis of NAS requiring
      pharmacotherapy will be studied. Infants born to mothers receiving adequate prenatal care and
      maintained on opioid agonist medication during pregnancy will be eligible. Infants will be
      randomized to receive either neonatal morphine solution or methadone in a double blind,
      double dummy design. It is hypothesized that morphine treated infants will require
      significantly fewer days in the hospital compared to methadone treated infants. While the
      primary outcome is the total length of initial hospital stay (LOS), total LOS related to NAS,
      total duration of medical treatment for NAS, the need for a second drug to control symptoms,
      and infant growth will also be evaluated as important secondary outcomes by medication group
      assignment.

      2. SPECIFIC AIM II: To evaluate the effects of NAS treatment on long-term neurodevelopmental
      outcome. Infants in both treatment groups will be evaluated at 18 months of age using the
      Bayley III Scales of Infant Development. It is hypothesized that morphine treated infants
      will have better neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 months compared to methadone treated
      infants. It is also hypothesized that neurobehavioral abnormalities (from either treatment
      group) identified at two weeks of age using the NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scale (NNNS)
      will correlate with neurodevelopmental impairment detected with the Bayley III. Early
      identification of infants at highest risk for impaired development will facilitate
      therapeutic interventions to improve outcome and decrease resource utilization.

      3: SPECIFIC AIM III: To determine if single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes
      controlling opioid pharmacodynamics contribute to the severity of NAS. SNP genotyping from
      cord blood or buccal swabs will be obtained from all infants and correlated with short term
      outcomes (Aim 1) and neurodevelopment assessments (Aim 2) to confirm that genetic variation
      plays a major role in the severity and outcome of infants with NAS.

    <description>Infants randomized to this arm will receive neonatal morphine solution (0.2mg/mL) for first line therapy. Infants will be scored using the standardized Finnegan scoring system and will be initiated on treatment if they have 2 consecutive scores greater than or equal to 8 or 1 score greater than or equal to 12. Dosing will be weight and symptom based. A &quot;double dummy&quot; design will be used - each infant will be ordered for both a methadone/placebo study drug at 0.4 mg/mL and a morphine/placebo study drug at 0.2 mg/mL. Starting doses will range from 0.3mg/kg/day to 0.9mg/kg/day divided every 4 hours depending on the severity of the Finnegan scores. Doses will be increased to a maximum of 0.9mg/kg/day for continued scores generally &gt;8 caused primarily by worsening NAS. Infants will be weaned by 10% of the maximum dose once every 24 - 48 hours and the medication will be discontinued once at 25% of the maximum dose.</description>

    <description>A second line medication will be added once the infant reaches maximum doses of the study drug (morphine or methadone) for continued scores generally &gt;8. Infants will be loaded with 20mg/kg of phenobarbital with the option to re-load with 10mg/kg q8-12 hours for 2 more doses if needed for continued high scores. Maintenance therapy of 5mg/kg/day will be initiated 12 - 24 hours after the last loading dose. Phenobarbital trough levels will be monitored with goal levels of 20 - 30 mcg/mL.
Phenobarbital will be weaned only after the infant has been weaned off of the study drug. Weaning will begin 48 hours after the study drug has been stopped by 20% of the maximum total daily dose every 3 days for scores &lt;8. An infant may be discharged home 48 - 72 hours after the first wean. The remaining wean will be outlined in the discharge prescription, and followed up on by study staff with the goal of the phenobarbital discontinuation within a 2 week period.</description>
