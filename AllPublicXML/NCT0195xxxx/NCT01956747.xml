  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether the presence of a Myelodysplastic Syndrome
      (MDS) , Idiopathic Cytopenia of Undetermined Significance (ICUS) or Idiopathic Dysplasia of
      Undetermined Significance (IDUS), correlates with treatment intensity and clinical outcome in
      older patients with advanced malignancies receiving palliative chemotherapy. We will study
      the relation between sarcopenia, comprehensive geriatric assessment en pharmacokinetics with
      treatment related toxicity as well. We hypothesize that a standardized flow cytometry test to
      determine bone marrow capacity, a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment and/or measurement of
      human body composition with computerized tomography will provide an accurate tool to optimize
      treatment strategies in elderly patients with advanced malignancies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥ 70 years

          -  Diagnosis of advanced cancer of colorectum, breast or prostate

          -  Standard first line palliative treatment with cytotoxic agents will be started
             (Folfox, Xelox, capecitabine, paclitaxel or docetaxel)

          -  Estimated life expectancy ≥ 3 months

          -  Able to give informed consent

          -  WHO performance status ≤ 2

          -  Absence of any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition
             potentially hampering compliance with the treatment and follow-up schedule; those
             conditions should be assessed with the patient before registration in the trial

          -  No other severe medical or psychiatric conditions that in the judgment of the
             investigator renders the patient inappropriate for inclusion in this study.

          -  Before patient registration, written informed consent must be given and documented to
             ICH/EUCGCP, national/local regulatory requirements and the local rules followed in our
             institution

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of cytopenia due to iron-, vitamin B12 and folic acid deficiency or
             hemolysis, unless adequately supplemented.

          -  Creatinine clearance ≤ 30 ml/min

          -  Serum AST and ALT ≥ 2.5 x ULN, in case of liver metastases serum AST and ALT ≥ 5 x ULN

          -  In case of therapy with Docetaxel/Paclitaxel serum bilirubin ≥ 1.5 x ULN
