  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol explores the feasibility and acceptability of using two daily diary methods to
      analyze state-dependent variables and psychosocial health outcomes in Human Immunodeficiency
      Virus (HIV)-positive young men who have sex with men (YMSM). The study will explore the
      potential of diaries for use in feedback-based interventions.

    <measure>Number of Participants who Complete the 66-Day Structured Daily Diary</measure>
    <time_frame>66 days</time_frame>
    <description>The first primary objective of this study is to implement a 66-day structured daily diary with 90 HIV-positive YMSM to explore relationships among daily mood, stressful events, social support, substance use, sexual behavior, and adherence to ART among youth who are currently prescribed to take medication.</description>

    <measure>Rate of Completion of 66-Day Structured Daily Diary by Modality Type</measure>
    <time_frame>66 days</time_frame>
    <description>The second primary objective is to explore the feasibility and acceptability of using two daily diary modalities (IVR and IWR) as (1) a novel method of data collection in research involving HIV-positive YMSM, and (2) a potential tool to provide personalized feedback and/or assist with self-monitoring among HIV-positive YMSM.</description>

    <measure>Participant Responses to how Diary can Provide Personalized Feedback on Triggers to Risk Behaviors</measure>
    <time_frame>66 days</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary objective of this study is to obtain feedback from HIV-positive YMSM on how the diary could be used to provide personalized feedback on triggers to risk behaviors, such as substance use, unprotected sexual behavior, and poor medication adherence. These data will be obtained through debriefing interviews.</description>
