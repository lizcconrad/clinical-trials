  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Removable false teeth (called removable partial dentures (RPDs)) are commonly made for people
      with missing teeth.

      RPDs are made out of a framework and the replacement teeth/gum. The framework sits on the
      teeth and the gums and can be made out of different materials, metal or non-metal, with
      different properties. The plastic teeth and gum sit on the framework.

      A common framework material is cobalt chromium, a rigid, non-precious metal alloy. Other
      framework materials include titanium and non-metal materials such as medical grade
      polyetheretherketone (PEEK).

      A review of the literature shows that no research has been reported investigating how
      different RPD framework materials impact on a person's oral health related quality of life
      (OHQoL). The sensation that different frameworks have in the mouth can be quite varied
      between people, and it would be relevant to be able to tell patients which type of framework
      is better tolerated based on research evidence.

      We hope to conduct an un-blinded randomised crossover pilot trial investigating the
      difference in patient preference and oral health related quality of life measured by patient
      centred outcomes in a group of patients due to receive tooth supported removable partial
      dentures at the Charles Clifford Dental Hospital.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Adults from age 18 upwards:

          -  with the absence of 3 or more teeth, excluding third molars, per jaw arch,

          -  with or without previous denture wearing experience, and

          -  with a stable oral health in terms of absence of disease activity affecting the
             periodontium, dental hard tissues (caries), pulp and the structural/aesthetic
             integrity of restored teeth.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients requiring extensive treatment prior to the provision of a removable partial
             denture.

          -  Patients with active primary disease; caries, periodontal disease or symptoms of
             pulpal or apical pathology to the remaining teeth.

          -  Patients with irreversibly compromised structural/aesthetic integrity of restored
             teeth that cannot be restored as part of the provision of treatment.
