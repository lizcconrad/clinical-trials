    <textblock>
      Whole-body vibration therapy (WBVT) is a novel, non-pharmacological intervention aimed at
      improving muscle strength and endurance as well as bone density. It holds promise for
      children with neuromuscular disorders such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) since muscle
      weakness results not only from muscle breakdown but also physical inactivity and muscle
      disuse atrophy. Weak DMD patients may increasingly limit their physical activity due to fear
      of falling or loss of independence (e.g. difficulty rising to stand without assistance).
      Prolonging the length of time boys with DMD are ambulatory is important for delaying
      complications of this disease (lung hypoventilation, scoliosis) as well as maintaining bone
      health. We propose to conduct a pilot study of WBVT in young boys with Duchenne muscular
      dystrophy (DMD). The primary outcome will be to document safety and feasibility of WBVT in
      this patient population. The secondary outcomes will evaluate changes in muscle strength and
      endurance. Bone health will also be examined as part of routine clinical care. The study will
      include 20 ambulatory boys with DMD; patients will be randomized (1:1 allocation) into 2
      groups: WBVT treatment or no WBVT treatment (controls). Treatment groups will consist of 10
      boys undergoing daily WBVT in an 8-week, open-label trial.
