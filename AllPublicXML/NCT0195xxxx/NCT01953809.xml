  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to confirm that GSK1322322 has no negative impact on hormone
      levels and contraceptive efficacy when co-administered with a frequently prescribed oral
      contraceptive thereby to facilitate the use of GSK1322322 in women of child-bearing potential
      receiving oral contraceptive (OC) pre-infection. This study is designed to investigate
      steady-state plasma ethinyl estradiol (EE) and norethindrone (NE) pharmacokinetic (PK)
      following administration of Ortho-Novum (EE/NE) 1 tablet every 24 hours (q24h) fed with and
      without GSK1322322 1500 milligram (mg) q12h fed. Each subject will participate in the study
      for approximately 12 weeks: a 30 day screening period, 4-week run-in period, three 7 day
      treatment periods, and a 3-5 day follow-up period. The study is planned to enroll
      approximately 24 subjects (18 active/6 placebo).
