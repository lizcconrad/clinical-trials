  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the leading cause of physical disability, particularly due to the presence of
      spasticity. Different needling techniques, including the use of Botulinum Toxin A are
      proposed for the management of spasticity. The presence of spasticity in the lower extremity
      implies several impairments for standing and walking inducing high disability. No study has
      investigated the effects of deep dry needling inserted into the targeted spastic musculature
      in patients with stroke. The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial
      investigating the effects of a single session of deep dry needling over the musculature of
      the leg on spasticity, widespread pressure pain sensitivity and plantar pressures
      (baropodometry) in individuals with chronic stroke. The investigators hypothesize that
      patients receiving a single session of dry needling would exhibit a greater reduction in
      spasticity and pressure sensitivity than those who will not receive the intervention.

    <time_frame>Baseline and immediate after the inetrvention</time_frame>
    <description>Spasticity in the affected ankle joint will be evaluated with the Modified Modified Ashworth Scale (MMAS). The examiner passively will move the ankle in dorsal-flexion direction, back and forth at least 5 times and will evaluate the degree of resistance to the movement on a scale from 0-4. This outcome will take 1 minute approximately.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and immediate after the inetrvention</time_frame>
    <description>Pressure pain sensitivity will be bilaterally assessed with a mechanical pressure algometer (Pain Diagnosis and Treatment Inc, New York, USA) over the deltoid muscle, the second metacarpal and the tibialis anterior muscle to determine changes in widespread pressure sensitivity. This outcome will take 5 minute approximately.</description>

    <measure>Changes in baropodometry outcomes before and after the intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and immediate after the inetrvention</time_frame>
    <description>The following baropodometric data will be bilaterally collected from each patient: support surface (cm2), percentage of load (%) and force distribution (%) of both forefoot and rear foot. Additionally, we will also calculate mean and maximum pressure of each foot, affected and non-affected. This outcome will take 10 minutes approximately.</description>

    <description>The experimental group will receive a single session of DDN with disposable stainless steel needles (0.3mm x 50mm) that will be inserted into the skin over taut bands of the gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscles.</description>

    <description>Once the most painful spot is located within a palpable spastic taut band, the overlying skin is cleaned with alcohol. The needle will be inserted, penetrating the skin about 15-20mm, until the first local twitch response is obtained. Once the first local twitch response is obtained, the needle will be moved up and down (4 to 5 mm. vertical motions with no rotation) in the muscle at approximately 1Hz for 25-30 seconds.</description>
