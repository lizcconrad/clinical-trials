    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study, called MOVE-PD, is to investigate how individuals with Parkinson's
      disease (PD) and chronic constipation (CC) respond to RM-131 as compared to placebo. The
      study will look at how well RM-131 affects the frequency of spontaneous bowel movements over
      a 14-day period. The study will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of the study drug
      and evaluate whether the study drug relieves the uncomfortable GI symptoms related to chronic
      constipation in patients who are unsatisfied with other therapies they have tried for
      constipation.

             more weeks in the preceding 12 months.

          -  Regular treatment for chronic constipation during the last 6 months, and
             dissatisfaction with current treatment for CC, after treatment with at least 2
             regimens for constipation (see note at end of this section).

          -  Stable medication history defined as no changes in regimen for at least 2 weeks prior

          -  Mini-mental status exam (at screening) ≥26

          -  Female patients must have negative serum or urine pregnancy tests and must not be

             must be used throughout the study. A vasectomized partner will be allowed as one in
             conjunction with another single-barrier method.

          -  Female patients unable to bear children must have this documented in the case report
             form(i.e., tubal ligation, hysterectomy, or post-menopausal [defined as a minimum of
             one year since the last menstrual period]). Post-menopausal status will be confirmed
             by follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) in women less than 60 years of age

        Note the following medications are allowed:

          -  Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), SNRI, and tricyclic antidepressants are
