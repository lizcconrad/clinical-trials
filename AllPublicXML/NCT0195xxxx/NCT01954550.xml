      This randomized controlled trial (RCT) will investigate the effects of a 6-month,
      individualized, moderate-intensity cycling intervention on cognition and hippocampal volume
      in AD with three aims:

        -  Determine the immediate effect of the cycling intervention on cognition in AD.

        -  Examine if the cycling intervention slows cognitive decline in AD from baseline to 12
           months.

        -  Assess the effect of aerobic exercise on hippocampal volume in AD over 12 months using
           MRI.

      The investigators will randomize 90 participants to the 6-month cycling or stretching/range
      of motion exercise (20-50-minute, 3 times a week). Participants will then be followed for
      another 6 months. Cognition will be assessed at baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months and
      hippocampal volume will be measured using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at baseline, 6,
      and 12 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aerobic exercise holds great promise for treating cognitive impairment, the hallmark symptom
      of Alzheimer's disease (AD), because it may attenuate brain atrophy. AD currently affects
      more than 5 million Americans, costing $203 billion in 2013 and causing poor outcomes such as
      loss of independence, low quality of life, and nursing home placement. Available drugs have
      only modest short-term effects on reducing or slowing cognitive impairment in AD. Hence,
      there is a pressing need to develop and test aerobic exercise interventions for AD. This
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) will investigate the effects of a 6-month, individualized,
      moderate-intensity cycling intervention on cognition and hippocampal volume in AD with three
      aims:

        -  Determine the immediate effect of the cycling intervention on cognition in AD.

        -  Examine if the cycling intervention slows cognitive decline in AD from baseline to 12
           months.

        -  Assess the effect of aerobic exercise on hippocampal volume in AD over 12 months using
           MRI.

      The investigators will randomize 90 participants to the 6-month cycling or stretching/range
      of motion exercise (20-50-minute, 3 times a week). Participants will then be followed for
      another 6 months. Cognition will be assessed at baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months and
      hippocampal volume will be measured using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at baseline, 6,
      and 12 months. Transportation will be provided to participants for all study-related
      activities including exercises. Participants who could not undergo MRI can still participate.
