  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective randomised study was to determine the effect of routine
      cervical dilatation during elective caesarean section on maternal morbidity
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants with indication for elective caesarean section were randomly allocated to two
      groups. Group A (n = 200) women with intraoperative cervical dilatation; group B (n = 200)
      women with no intraoperative cervical dilatation.Patients were randomised using
      computer-generated random numbers in sealed envelopes, to place them in one of the groups:
      group A (n = 200) women with intraoperative cervical dilatation; group B (n = 200) women with
      no intraoperative cervical dilatation. The investigator was not blinded to the procedure
      allocation. The allocated envelope was opened by the clinician just before the surgery. The
      procedure allocation was recorded in the women's charts.Antibiotic prophylaxis of 1 g of
      intravenous cefazolin or clindamycin 600 mg was given to each woman when the umbilical cord
      was clamped. In group 1 patients, the surgeon inserted his or her double-gloved index digit
      in the cervical canal to dilate it and removed the outer gloves after digital dilatation of
      the cervix.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary outcome was rate of post-partum endometritis</measure>
    <time_frame>All patients in both groups were observed daily,blood count was assessed 24 h after delivery and the patients were discharged on third postoperative day if there was no infection or complication</time_frame>
    <description>The post-partum care for both groups was identical, and included vital signs every four hours, discontinuation of the Foley catheter and advancement of diet on the first postoperative day. All patients in both groups were observed daily in order to assess the following variables: any sign of wound infection (erythema, swelling, discharge or tenderness), vaginal discharge, uterine consistency and height and peritoneal reaction for peritonitis. Clinical signs of urinary tract infection were checked, and urinalysis was performed. A complete blood count was assessed 24 h after delivery. The patients were discharged on third postoperative day if there was no infection or complication.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Secondary outcomes that were analysed included wound infection, febrile morbidity and infectious morbidity.</measure>
    <time_frame>Febrile morbidity, blood loss and wound infection diagnosed at least 24 h after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Febrile morbidity was defined as a persistent fever of at least 38 celsius degree for at least 24 h after surgery and not associated with lower abdominal or pelvic tenderness and no signs of infection elsewhere. Partial or total dehiscence or presence of purulent or serous wound discharge with induration, warmth and tenderness was considered as a wound infection. Endometritis was defined here as body temperature greater than 38.5 celsius degree with concomitant foul-smelling discharge or abnormally tender uterus on bimanual examination. A diagnosis of urinary tract infection was only considered when urinary symptoms associated with significant bacteruria (&gt; 10.000.00 organisms/mL) on culture of midstream specimen of urine were noted. Blood loss was estimated using a drop in haemoglobin concentration within 24 h after the operation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>After elective cesarean section routine cervical dilatation is necessary? Change in post-partum maternal morbidities when compared with a similar group of women receiving intravenous antibiotics and no cervical dilatation at caesarean delivery.</measure>
    <time_frame>24 h after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>We hypothesised that routine intraoperative cervical dilatation during elective section in women receiving intravenous antibiotics would not significantly reduce post-partum maternal morbidities when compared with a similar group of women receiving intravenous antibiotics and no cervical dilatation at caesarean delivery.</description>
