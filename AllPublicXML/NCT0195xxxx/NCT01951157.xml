      A clinical study of lurbinectedin(PM01183) alone or in combination with gemcitabine in

    <textblock>
      A randomized-controlled, three-arm, phase II study of lurbinectedin (PM01183) alone or in
      combination with gemcitabine and a control arm with docetaxel as second-line treatment in
      unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)patients to evaluate the antitumor activity as
      progression-free survival at four months (PFS4) of PM01183 alone or in combination with
      gemcitabine as using single agent docetaxel as a reference in the control arm as current
      standard of care and to analyze overall survival (OS), overall survival rate at 1-year
      (OS12), duration of response (DR), antitumor activity, as response rate (RR), safety and
      efficacy profiles of PM01183 alone and in combination with gemcitabine, to be preliminary
      compared with docetaxel, patients' quality of life (QoL), pharmacokinetics (PK) of PM01183,
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD)correlation and pharmacogenomics (PGx)to explore
      potential correlations between clinical outcomes and molecular parameters found in tumor and
      blood samples
