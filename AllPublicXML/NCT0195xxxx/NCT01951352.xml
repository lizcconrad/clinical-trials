  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study we will test the ability of different commercially available hand soaps to
      effect the amount of anti-microbial peptides present on the surface of the human skin after
      washing with these soaps. Based on our experiments on pig skin, we expect the amount of
      antimicrobial peptide expression to decrease after using these different soaps.

      We will use tape-stripping methods to determine the level of antimicrobial peptides
      (specifically LL-37) present on the human skin after washing with different commercially
      available hand soaps. First we will do a baseline tape-stripping procedure to measure the
      amount of LL-37 on subjects' forearms. Tape stripping involves applying small, round tapes
      (CuDerm, Dallas, TX) to the skin, massaging them for about 10 second, and then removing them.
      This process is repeated 9 times for each tape. After doing baseline tape stripping samples,
      each participant's forearms will be washed with a different soap. The soap will be rinsed
      off, and the skin allowed to dry. After the forearms are dry (about 5 minutes later), repeat
      tape-stripping will be performed. This tape-stripping process will then be repeated 4 hours
      later, and then 24 hours later as well. Results of the LL-37 expression at each time point
      will then be compared between soaps.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Those who meet all of the following criteria are eligible for enrollment into the study:

          1. Age 18-60 years

          2. Male or female of any race and ethnicity

          3. Subject agrees to comply with study requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with severe medical condition(s) that in the view of the investigator
             prohibits participation in the study

          2. Dermatologic disease such as psoriasis or atopic dermatitis which may have inherently
             abnormal antimicrobial peptide levels

          3. Subject has Netherton's syndrome or other genodermatoses that result in a defective
             epidermal barrier

          4. Pregnant or nursing females

          5. Immunocompromised subjects (e.g., lymphoma, HIV/AIDS, Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome), or
             with a history of active or malignant disease (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) as
             determined by the participant's medical history.

          6. Subjects with a history of psychiatric disease or history of alcohol or drug abuse
             that would interfere with the ability to comply with the study protocol

          7. Subjects with significant concurrent medical condition(s) at screening that in the
             view of the investigator prohibits participation in the study (e.g., severe concurrent
             allergic disease, condition associated with malignancy, and condition associated with
             immunosuppression)

          8. Active viral or fungal skin infections at the target areas

          9. Previous participation in this study

         10. Ongoing participation in an investigational drug trial

         11. Use of any oral or topical antibiotic during the study and up to one week prior to
             entering the study

         12. Use of any local topical medications less than one week prior to screening

         13. Use of any systemic immunosuppressive therapy less than four weeks prior to screening.

         14. Subjects with a history of or propensity to developing reactions after use of over the
             counter cleansers

         15. History of allergy to adhesive tape
