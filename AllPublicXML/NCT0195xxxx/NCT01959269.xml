        Female and male patients ≥ 18 years of age with a diagnosis of metastatic colorectal
        carcinoma (mCRC) will be enrolled in the sites during the enrollment period. All treatment
        decisions prior inclusion of a patient as well as during the observation must be made by
        the investigator based on his regular medical practice. Patients must give written informed
