  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, it was reported that the incomplete resection rate of neoplastic large polyps after
      conventional polypectomy was markedly high in clinical practice. The incomplete resection
      rate of neoplastic large polyps after endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is not known.

      The aim of this study is to compare the incomplete resection rate of neoplastic large polyps
      after EMR or conventional polypectomy. The EMR technique is preferable to conventional
      polypectomy for the complete resection of the large polyps (&gt;15 mm in diameter)

    <description>Colorectal polyps from 10 mm to 25 mm was found. Submucosal injection of saline solution before removal was not performed for polypectomy. The snare used for polypectomy was a dual loop wire snare with a loop size of 33/16 mm (SN-3316LX, Medico's Hirata Inc., Osaka, Japan). An ERBE ICC200 (Amco, Tokyo, Japan) was used in the Endocut mode with the effect 3 current set at output limit 120W and forced coagulation current set at output limit 35W for conventional polypectomy. Prophylactic clipping after polyp removal was routinely performed.</description>
