  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rational: Imiglucerase has been used to treat Gaucher disease since 1997 but data about its
      pharmacokinetics have been partial; investigators know that imiglucerase undergoes a quick
      clearance from plasma compartment following the infusion (1/2 life: 1-6 min, from tissue:
      &lt;24h), an observation apparently contradictory with usual infusion rhythm (one infusion every
      two weeks). Furthermore, by going by GD response, the rhythm of Infusion is sometimes
      diminished (for example, every 3 or 4 wks) without pharmacological rational ; In parallel,
      investigators demonstrated that monocytes represent a satisfactory surrogate of GD target
      cells and that enzyme activity into monocytes varies between individuals.

      Our hypothesis is that enzyme activity into monocyte compartment could be different and could
      be related to GD response.

      Primary purpose: to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of Imiglucerase activity into target
      cellular compartment depending on dose and frequency of infusions.

      Secondary purposes : 1) to establish a possible relationship between the intra-monocytic
      activity of glucocerebrosidase and the clinical and biological activity of Gaucher disease
      and to define a possible threshold value of enzyme activity; 2) to establish a better
      correlation with known biomarkers of disease (routine markers and markers recently
      identified), which would better predict and / or monitor response to treatment ; 3) to
      compare the residual and natural rate of activity enzyme intra-monocytic for untreated
      patients (low severity disease).

    <description>Enzyme intra-monocyte activity (sum of endogenous enzyme activities and therapeutic enzyme) in patients treated with imiglucerase will be assessed at different times between infusions (8 to 10 time points), and just before an infusion (residual rate). The population pharmacokinetics method allows to perform this analysis in measurement windows that are not necessarily included in the period between two consecutive infusions of imiglucerase but may be spread over several cycles.</description>

- Gaucher disease status will be assessed by clinical and biological criteria defined by the HAS (Haute Autorité de Santé = High Health Authority). We will consider the two-year periods before and after treatment to identify progressive diseases (clinical or biological significant events associated with Gaucher disease in the two years before and 2 years after the enrolment time</description>
