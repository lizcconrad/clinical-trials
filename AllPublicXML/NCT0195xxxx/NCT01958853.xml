      The purpose of this open label study is to provide up to 24 active treatments of noninvasive
      cortical electrostimulation therapy only to those fibromyalgia patients who experienced
      inadequate pain reduction in a sham controlled double blinded lead in study, NPT-201
      (NCT01825954). The therapy will be provided by the NeuroPoint device using the same protocol
      as that used in active treatment arms of NPT-201. The study's primary outcome measure will be
      the patient's change from baseline in self-reported 24-hour average pain intensity. The study
      will provide active treatment to those participants who received sham therapy in NPT-201, and
      will test whether or not additional therapy applications might further improve pain in those
      participants who previously received active therapy, but did not achieve adequate pain
      relief.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient must have successfully completed study NPT-201 and had an inadequate pain
             response, defined as &lt;50% reduction in pain from baseline during participation in
             NPT-201.

          -  Patient must provide written informed consent and privacy authorization prior to
             participation in the study.

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential must be willing to use an acceptable method
             of birth control for the duration of their study participation. Acceptable birth
             control includes a vasectomized partner, contraceptives (oral, parenteral, or
             transdermal), intrauterine device, or double barrier method including condoms, sponge,
             diaphragm, or vaginal ring with spermicidal jellies or cream. Patients considered not
             of childbearing potential must be surgically sterile (total hysterectomy, bilateral
             salpingo-oophorectomy, or tubal ligation) or greater than one year post-menopausal,
             defined as a complete cessation of menstruation for at least one year.

          -  Patients must be willing to refrain from all excluded therapies for the duration of
             the study.

          -  In the opinion of the Investigator, the patient is willing and able to comply with all
             protocol-specified requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has a current significant psychological or psychiatric disorder (e.g., severe,
             unstable or poorly controlled depression, severe anxiety or obsessive-compulsive
             disorder.

          -  Patient has a score of 2 or 3 on item 9 of the BDI, or, based on the investigator's
             judgment, the patient is at risk of suicidal ideation or behavior.

          -  Patient has resumed treatment with duloxetine, milnacipran, pregabalin, gabapentin,
             sodium oxybate or prohibited narcotics.

          -  Female patient who is pregnant, planning a pregnancy, or breastfeeding.

          -  Any anticipated need for surgery that might confound results or interfere with
             patient's ability to comply with the protocol.

          -  The occurrence of a major protocol violation during the lead-in study indicating a
             lack of compliance or other significant concern that precludes the patient's ongoing
             participation.
