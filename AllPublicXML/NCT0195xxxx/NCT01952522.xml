      This study is designed to determine if adding daily weighted braces on the unaffected ankle
      may benefit to patient who have returned home compare to a placebo intervention (ankle brace
      without weight).

    <textblock>
      Improve walking ability in people after stroke is a key objective for rehabilitation. Once
      the rehabilitation period is finished, a reduction of functional and motor abilities is often
      observed in subjects when they returned home.

      This study will examine if loading daily the non paretic leg with additional weights will
      improve walking abilities. This study will enroll 100 people who had a stroke &gt; three months
      and &lt; five years and who still experienced difficulties for walking.

      Each patient will receive 3 months of intervention targeting their non affected leg. Half of
      the subjects will have to wear braces with additional weights at the non affected ankle
      during the day ( &gt; 6 hours), while the other half will wear a similar brace but without
      weight.

      A six minutes walking test will be given before and after the intervention, as well six and
      twelve months later to measure the effect of these interventions. The investigators
      hypothesize that people receiving the additional weights to the non paretic leg will show
      greater improvements in their walk abilities.
