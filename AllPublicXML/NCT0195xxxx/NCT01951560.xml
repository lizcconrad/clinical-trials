  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the first part of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of
      ascending doses of valproic acid (also known as Depacon) administered as intravenous infusion
      (IV) in doses ranging from 15 mg/kg to 250 mg/kg in healthy subjects.

      The second part of the study will also be to determine the safety and tolerability of single
      ascending doses of valproic acid administered as IV in trauma subjects with hemorrhagic
      shock.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part 1 of the study will be a single center study intended to assess the safety and
      tolerability of valproic acid dosages at 15 mg/kg, 30 mg/kg, 60 mg/kg, 90 mg/kg, 120 mg/kg,
      150 mg/kg 180 mg/kg, 210 mg/kg and 250 mg/kg. Up to 72 healthy subjects (9 dose groups of 8
      subjects) will receive single doses of valproic acid or placebo via a 60-min IV infusion in a
      ratio of 3:1 active drug: placebo.

      Part 2 of the study will be a multicenter, double blind, placebo-controlled study in trauma
      patients with hemorrhagic shock who are able to give consent or severe trauma patients with
      hemorrhagic shock in whom a legally authorized representative can give consent. Up to 12
      patients (2 dose groups of 6 patients) will receive single doses of valproic acid or placebo
      via a 60-min IV infusion in a ratio of 2:1 active drug : placebo. The dose levels in Part 2
      will be the two highest doses that are demonstrated to have acceptable safety profile based
      on the review of safety data from Part 1.

    <description>Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) will be defined as drug-related grade 2 (moderate) or higher toxicity (excluding fever, chills, nausea or other possible infusion-related effects).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female volunteers between the ages of 18 and 65 years, inclusive, in good
             health based on medical history, physical examination, ECG, and routine laboratory
             tests (blood chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, and drug screen).

          2. Female subjects must be surgically sterilized or postmenopausal. Criteria for
             menopause are surgical menopause (hysterectomy, oophorectomy) or age &gt; 45 years with

             (FSH) elevation &gt; 25m IU/mL.(mIU/mL is the unit used to measure human chorionic
             gonadotropin (hCG) in pregnancy test). Tubal ligation with menses within the past 12
             months is not considered to be surgical sterilization.
