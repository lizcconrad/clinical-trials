    <textblock>
      This study will use diffusion weighted MRI (DWI MRI) and dynamic-contrast enhanced MRI (DCE
      MRI) techniques to detect changes in sarcoma tumour vasculature. The main aims of this study
      are to correlate histological response of soft tissue sarcoma after pre-operative
      radiotherapy with several pre-treatment DCE and DWI MRI parameters and to assess the impact
      of these on early response prediction. Detected changes may reflect the sensitivity of the
      tumour to radiotherapy and may be associated with long term outcomes after treatment.

      15 patients normally having pre-operative radiotherapy as part of their sarcoma treatment
      will be recruited to this study.

      Patients will have an additional three specialised MRI scans: one prior to the start of
      radiotherapy, one during the second week of radiotherapy while on treatment and one scan a
      week before surgery but after the completion of radiotherapy.

      Post-operatively, results of the histological examination of the sarcoma will be correlated
      to both the MRI scan data and outcomes after treatment

    <time_frame>average of 9 weeks including radiotherapy up to one week before surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The hypothesis is that quantitative biomarkers from DWI and DCE MRI can not only be produced with high spatial resolution in soft tissue sarcoma, but that these imaging biomarkers will correlate with histological and histochemical features of the tumour and will provide information to support the prediction of regional response to radiotherapy.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed diagnosis of intermediate/high grade soft
             tissue sarcoma (STS)

          -  Patients must be suitable for treatment with preoperative radiotherapy and radical
             surgery

          -  Standard radiological assessments (CT or MRI) may have already been performed but must
             be done within 4 weeks of starting radiotherapy

          -  Patient must have measurable disease on CT/MRI imaging

          -  ECOG performance status 0-2

          -  Adequate pre-treatment haematological and biochemical parameters

          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years

          -  No significant co-morbidity thereby excluding patient from having radical treatment.

          -  No previous treatment for diagnosis of STS including neo-adjuvant chemotherapy

          -  Women of child bearing age MUST have a negative pregnancy test prior to study entry
             and be using an adequate contraception method unless child bearing potential has been
             terminated by surgery/radical radiotherapy

          -  Patients must have given written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with cardiac pacemakers, cochlear implants, intraocular foreign bodies or any
             other MRI incompatibility factors (e.g. recent surgery).

             after the MRI

          -  Any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases which, in the view of the
             investigator, makes it undesirable for the patient to participate in the trial

          -  Evidence of significant clinical disorder or laboratory finding which, in the opinion
             of the investigator makes it undesirable for the patient to participate in the trial
