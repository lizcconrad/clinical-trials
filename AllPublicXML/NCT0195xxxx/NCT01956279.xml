      This study will investigate the use of adjunctive pregnenolone for the following:

        1. fatigue that has limited usual activity,

        2. musculoskeletal pain involving 2 or more regions of the body and,

        3. cognitive symptoms (memory, concentration, or attentional difficulties by self-report)
           in Veterans deployed to the Gulf War theatre of operations between 1990 and 1991.

    <measure>Physical Component of the SF-36; assessing change between the baseline score (week 2), week 6 and week 10.</measure>
    <time_frame>Prospective, outcome measures collected over 10 week trial period. (Weeks 2, 6 and 10)</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 is a health survey with an 8-scale profile embedded in 36 questions that measures physical and mental components of health.
Each item is scored on a 0 to 100 range with the lowest and highest possible scores are set at 0 and 100, respectively. All of these items are scored so that a high score defines a more favorable health state.
This study will assess change between the baseline score (week 2), week 6 and week 10 of the SF-36.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief Pain Inventory; assessing change between the baseline score (week 2), week 6 and week 10</measure>
    <time_frame>Prospective, outcome measures collected over 10 week trial period (Weeks 2, 6 and 10)</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Pain Inventory is a 14-item self-report measure designed to assess the severity, frequency and daily pattern of pain as well as its perceived interference with quality of life.
Severity is measured on a 0-10 scale with 10 being the greatest pain
Interference score is measured by a mean score of 7 items (0-10 scale) with 10 being the greatest interference.
This study will assess change between the baseline score (week 2), week 6 and week 10 of the Brief Pain Inventory.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tower of London test of the Brief Assessment Checklist for Adolescents (BAC-A); assessing change between the baseline score (week 2), week 6 and week 10.</measure>
    <time_frame>Prospective, outcome measures collected over 10 week trial period (Weeks 2, 6 and 10)</time_frame>
    <description>Assesses executive functioning on a scale of 0-20. (Note, if a perfect score of 20 occurs then there is the opportunity of 2 additional points, increasing the score to 22.)
The higher the number, the higher the degree of executive functioning.
This study will assess change between the baseline score (week 2), week 6 and week 10 of the Tower of London.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFSI); assessing change between the baseline score (week 2), week 6 and week 10.</measure>
    <time_frame>Prospective, outcome measures collected over 10 week trial period (Weeks 2, 6 and 10)</time_frame>
    <description>The MFSI is an 83-item self-report measure designed to assess the principal manifestations of fatigue.
Items are rated on a 0-4 scale indicating how true each statement was for the respondent during the last week (0=not at all; 4=extremely).
This study will assess change between the baseline score (week 2), week 6 and week 10 of the MFSI.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Global Severity Index of the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90R); assessing change between the baseline score (week 2), week 6 and week 10.</measure>
    <time_frame>Prospective, outcome measures collected over 10 week trial period (Weeks 2, 6 and 10)</time_frame>
    <description>The SCL-90R is used as a screening measure of general psychiatric symptomatology. It includes dimensions measuring somatization, obsessive-compulsive, depression, anxiety, phobic anxiety, hostility, interpersonal sensitivity, paranoid ideation, and psychoticism.
Global Severity Index (GSI) of the SCL-90R is designed to measure overall psychological distress.
This is a 90 item measure with each rated on a scale of 0-4 with 4 being the highest level of psychological distress for each item.
This study will assess change between the baseline score (week 2), week 6 and week 10 of the Global Severity Index of the SCL-90R.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Veterans deployed to the Gulf War theatre of operations between 1990 and 1991.

          -  Veterans who report at least 2 of the following 3 symptoms that began in 1990 or
             thereafter, that lasted for more than 6 months, and that are present at the time of
             screening: 1) fatigue that limited usual activity, 2) musculoskeletal pain involving 2
             or more regions of the body, 3) cognitive symptoms (memory, concentration, or
             attentional difficulties by self-report)

          -  Stable on medication regimen (no change in last 4 weeks) and no anticipated change in
             medication during study.

          -  Able to provide informed consent for study participation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a history of clinically significant neurological, metabolic, hepatic,
             renal, hematological, pulmonary, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or urological
             disorders (e.g. unstable angina, seizures, cerebrovascular accident, decompensated
             congestive heart failure, central nervous system (CNS) infection, cancer [other than
             non-melanoma skin cancer], or history of HIV seropositivity), which would pose a risk
             to the patient if s/he were to participate in the study or that might confound the
             results of the study.

          -  Concurrent enrollment in another clinical trial.

          -  Pregnant women or women of child-bearing potential who are not surgically-sterile or
             not using appropriate methods of birth control.

          -  Use of oral contraceptives or other hormonal supplementation such as estrogen
             [although early studies suggested no effects on menstrual cycle, alterations in
             downstream metabolites or pregnenolone (such as estradiol) could theoretically impact
             the efficacy or oral contraceptives and/or estrogen replacement]. Similarly, it is
             theoretically possible that pregnenolone could be metabolized to other steroids such a
             DHEA, potentially resulting in hair, skin, or other steroid-related changes. Since the
             investigators' have determined in their prior study that pregnenolone administration
             does not result in downstream elevations in DHEA, DHEAS, estradiol, or testosterone,
             these possibilities may be unlikely.

          -  Women who are breast-feeding.

          -  Use of narcotic interventions.

          -  Known allergy to study medication.

          -  History of moderate or severe TBI (with loss of consciousness greater than 30 minutes)

          -  A clearly defined disease entity that accounts for the Veteran's symptoms.

          -  Current DSM-IV/DSM-IVTR/DSM-V diagnosis of bipolar I disorder, schizophrenia or other
             psychotic disorder, or dementia.

          -  Subjects with a DSM-IV/DSM-IVTR/DSM-V diagnosis of alcohol or substance dependence
             (other than nicotine or caffeine) within the last month.

          -  Subjects with a current suicidal or homicidal ideation necessitating clinical
             intervention or representing an imminent concern.

          -  If in the judgment of the PI it is not in the subject's best interest to participate.

          -  Final eligibility decisions will be determined by the PI.
