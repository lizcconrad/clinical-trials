  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effects of paclitaxel combined with phosphoinositide 3-kinase
      (PI3K) inhibitor BKM120 in patients with stage II or III breast cancer that is described as
      estrogen receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2)-negative and endocrine
      therapy resistant. Drugs such as paclitaxel stop the growth of tumors by blocking cancer cell
      division. PI3K inhibitor BKM120 inhibits some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and may
      improve the response of endocrine resistant tumors to treatment. Giving paclitaxel and PI3K
      inhibitor BKM120 before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal
      tissue that needs to be removed.

             therapy, if initiated at least 2 weeks prior to enrollment, may be continued.

          -  Currently receiving treatment with medication which carries a known risk of prolonging
             QT interval or inducing Torsades de Pointes. If treatment with this drug can be
             discontinued and the patient can be switched to a different medication prior to
             starting study drug, this is acceptable.

          -  Receiving chronic treatment with steroid or another immunosuppressive agent. Note that
             topical applications, inhaled sprays, eye drops, or local injections are allowed.

          -  Consumption of known CYP3A inhibitors such as Seville oranges, grapefruit, pummelos,

             dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), yohimbe, saw palmetto, and ginseng.

          -  Currently receiving treatment with medication known to be a moderate or strong
             inhibitor or inducer of isoenzyme CYP3A. If treatment with this drug can be
             discontinued and the patient can be switched to a different medication prior to
             starting study drug, this is acceptable. Please note that concomitant treatment with a
             weak inhibitor of CYP3A is allowed.

          -  Currently taking therapeutic doses of warfarin sodium or any other Coumadin-derivative
             anticoagulant.

          -  Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Patient must have a negative serum pregnancy test
             within 72 hours of starting treatment.

          -  Known HIV-positivity.

          -  Inclusion of Women and Minorities

          -  Because breast cancer occurs predominantly in women, men will not be eligible for this
             trial. Women and members of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial.
