        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Females or males between 18 and 60 years of age

          2. All females, regardless of childbearing potential, must have a negative serum beta
             human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) pregnancy test at Screening and Day -1

          3. Females of childbearing potential (i.e., not postmenopausal or surgically sterile)
             must agree to practice abstinence or to use a medically accepted method of
             contraception from the time of Screening through 30 days after the final study visit.
             Acceptable methods of contraception include diaphragm with spermicide; sponge with
             spermicide; condom with spermicide; or intrauterine device with condom or spermicide.
             The following contraceptive methods are acceptable only when used with a condom and
             spermicide: birth control pills, birth control patches, vaginal ring, hormone under
             the skin, or hormone injections

          4. Postmenopausal females, defined as females who have had amenorrhea for at least 12
             months either naturally or following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments,

          5. Females who have undergone surgical sterilization, including hysterectomy, bilateral
             oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, tubal ligation, or tubal essure ≥ 3 months
             prior to Screening. Tubal essure requires radiological confirmation of occlusion of
             the fallopian tubes. Subjects who cannot provide documentation may participate if they
             agree to follow the methods of contraception specified in Inclusion Criterion #3

          6. Males must agree to practice abstinence or use a condom with spermicide and refrain
             from sperm donation during the study and for 30 days after the final study visit. Note
             this does not apply to males who have undergone a vasectomy and can provide
             documentation of confirmatory sperm count 3 months post procedure.

          7. Provide written informed consent

          6. Positive test result for drugs of abuse (with the exception of medically prescribed
             drugs) at Screening or on Day -1

          7. Positive test for alcohol at Screening or Day -1

          8. Treatment with an investigational agent within 30 days or five half-lives of the
             investigational agent at Day 1 (whichever is longer)-

          9. Congenital or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome

         10. Prior solid organ or bone marrow transplant

         11. Positive test for Hepatitis B (surface antigen), Hepatitis C, or human

         13. Prior immunization with any approved or investigational anthrax vaccine or prior
             treatment with an investigational anthrax treatment (i.e., ETI-204, raxibacumab, or
             anthrax immune globulin)

         14. Military personnel deployed in 1990 or after, unless the subject can provide
             documentation demonstrating they have not previously received any approved or
             investigational anthrax vaccine

         15. Therapeutic use of systemic steroids, immunosuppressive agents, anticoagulants, or
             anti-arrhythmics within 1 year prior to Day 1; a single short course (i.e., less than
             14 days) of systemic steroid therapy is allowed provided it concluded more than 6
             months prior to Day 1

         16. Donation or loss of &gt; 500 mL of blood within 30 days or plasma within 7 days of Day 1

         17. Prior stroke, epilepsy, relapsing or degenerative CNS disease, or relapsing or
             degenerative ocular disease

             electrocardiogram (ECG) or clinical laboratory tests (hematology, clinical chemistry,
             or urinalysis) at Screening; out of range results may be repeated to confirm

         22. History of allergic or hypersensitivity reactions to other therapeutic antibodies or
             immunoglobulins

         23. History of any malignant neoplasm within the last 5 years, with the exception of
             adequately treated localized or in situ non-melanoma carcinoma of the skin (e.g. basal
             cell carcinoma) or the cervix

         24. Subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator, are not suitable candidates for
             enrollment or who may not comply with the requirements of the study
