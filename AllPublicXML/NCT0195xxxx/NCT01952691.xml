      The main aim of this study was to find the initial effects of kinesiotaping on pain and joint
      alignment used in the conservative treatment of hallux valgus.

      22 female patients diagnosed with hallux valgus participated in this study. Kinesiotaping was
      implemented after the first assessment and renewed in the 3rd, 7th and 10th days. The main
      outcome measures were the pain hallux adduction angle. Kinesiotaping may be an effective
      treatment option in decreasing pain and deformity in hallux valgus deformity who are
      conservatively treated. In future studies this method might be shown in larger sample groups
      at longer periods of treatment comparing with alternative treatment approaches like exercise
      or orthotics.

      Hallux valgus is a common pathologic entity affecting the great toe. Taping is an alternative
      method used to treat hallux valgus. The main aim of this study was to find the initial
      effects of kinesiotaping on pain and joint alignment used in the conservative treatment of
      hallux valgus.

      22 female patients diagnosed with 13 bilateral, 7 right, 2 left totally 35 with hallux valgus
      participated in this study. Kinesiotaping was implemented after the first assessment and
      renewed in the 3rd, 7th and 10th days. The main outcome measures were the change in pain was
      assessed by using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and hallux adduction angle was measured by the
      universal goniometry. Secondary outcome measures were Patients' functional status was
      measured by Foot Function Index (FFI) and AOFAS. The plain radiographic results were also
      measured before and after 1-month of treatment.

      Pain and disability was controlled by KinesioTape® implementation in patients with hallux
      valgus. Kinesiotaping may be an effective treatment option in decreasing pain and deformity
      in hallux valgus deformity who are conservatively treated. In future studies this method
      might be shown in larger sample groups at longer periods of treatment comparing with
      alternative treatment approaches like exercise or orthotics.
