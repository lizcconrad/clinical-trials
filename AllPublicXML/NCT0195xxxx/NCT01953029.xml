      The objective of our work to determine the mechanisms of myocardial infarction in women
      without obstructive coronary artery disease.

      Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death for women. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS)
      is usually characterized by a sudden erosion of the endothelial wall or rupture of a
      plaque.However, women with ACS are less likely than men to have either classic symptoms or
      obstructive coronary artery disease but paradoxically have a worse prognosis. Different data
      from the literature indicate that there may be different pathophysiological mechanisms,
      afflicting men and women somewhat differently.Between 5% and 30% of patients with ACS
      undergoing coronary angiography are found to have non visible or non obstructive coronary
      disease (NOCD). This is 2-3 times more common in women than in men. Several pathogenetic
      mechanism of myocardial infarction (MI) in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease
      (OCD) have been postulated, including among others atherosclerosis with plaque disruption
      that does not lead to luminal occlusion ,endothelial dysfunction, vasospasm , distal
      microembolization and microvascular dysfunction. However the data are extremely limited.
