  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate for any adverse effects that may be related to the administration and reception
      of autologous adipose derived stromal vascular fraction (SVF). Secondarily, the study
      monitors the results of subjective and objective findings as it applies to the non-blinded
      deployment of autologous SVF for various inflammatory and/or degenerative conditions
      including select orthopedic, neurologic, urologic and cardio-pulmonary conditions. SVF
      deployments include intra-venous, intra-articular, and soft tissue injections.

      SVF Stromal Vascular Fraction is obtained by lipoharvesting, procurement, and lipo-transfer
      as a same day operative procedure
