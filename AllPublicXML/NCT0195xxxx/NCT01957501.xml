  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression and bipolar disorder are major public health concerns for adolescents today.
      Teenage depression and bipolar disorder are associated with social isolation, family stress,
      school failure, substance abuse and suicide. Screening for depression and bipolar disorder so
      that treatment can be started early in the course of illness is an urgent public health
      priority. Many teens with bipolar disorder are incorrectly diagnosed as having unipolar
      depression. It is critical that adolescents receive proper screening and assessment that
      leads to an accurate diagnosis and treatment. An efficient, cost-effective, blood-based
      screening program could be performed on an annual or semi-annual basis to potentially detect
      depression and then differentiate between unipolar and bipolar depression. If this type of
      screening were able to detect a significant percentage of teens with depression or bipolar
      disorder, the positive impact on U.S. public health would be substantial. The purpose of this
      study is to conduct a pilot study to assess the probability of detecting adolescent unipolar
      and bipolar depression through blood samples.

    <time_frame>4 years</time_frame>
    <description>The MDDScore™ will determine the biomarker of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Bipolar Disorder. The MDDScore™ is determined using nine blood based biomarkers (inflammatory markers [4], stress related hormones [2], neuroendocrine [1] and metabolic proteins [2]) on physiological pathways related to MDD. The test results for the MDDScore™ range from 1 to 10. If the patient's score is 1, the patient has a less than 10% likelihood of having MDD. If the patient's MDDScore™ is 10, the patient has a greater than 90% likelihood of having MDD. An MDDScore™ of 5 or less is considered normal or negative and a score of 6 or more is considered &quot;diseased&quot; or positive. This same scoring system would hold true for classifying the likelihood of having bipolar disorder, as well. Test characteristics, such as sensitivity and specificity, are calculated based on this determination.</description>
