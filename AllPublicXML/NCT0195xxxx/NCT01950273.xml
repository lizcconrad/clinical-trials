      The primary objective of the study is to assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) similarity of
      Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) 695500 vs. rituximab (MabThera®) in previously untreated patients
      with low tumor burden follicular lymphoma (LTBFL).

      The secondary objective of the study is to evaluate the pharmacodynamics (PD), safety, and
      anti-tumor activity of BI 695500 vs. rituximab (MabThera®), as well as the presence of
      anti-drug antibodies (ADAs).

             dimensions; see Appendix 10.1 for further details).

          -  Adequate hematological function (unless abnormalities are related to lymphoma
             infiltration of the bone marrow) within 28 days prior to randomization, including:

          -  - hemoglobin =9.0 g/dL (=5.6 mmol/L).

             ligation) and males with female partners of childbearing potential must also agree to
