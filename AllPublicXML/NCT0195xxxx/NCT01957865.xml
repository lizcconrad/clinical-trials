      Development of Real-Time Antiretroviral Therapy Adherence Intervention in Uganda (The
      Wisepill Study).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators propose to develop a real-time adherence intervention based
      on SMS (i.e., text messages), wireless adherence monitoring (with the Wisepill device), and
      engagement of social support that is tailored to rural sub-Saharan Africa. The investigators
      will build on research by others who have shown SMS reminders improve adherence and viral
      suppression in Kenya, albeit with relatively small effect sizes and suboptimal virologic
      failure rates even in the intervention arm. Moreover, little is known about which patients
      benefit from SMS, why they benefit, and what can be done to further improve adherence and
      treatment success rates. Understanding the mechanisms of effect will make it possible to
      design and test evidence-based interventions with the highest likelihood for efficacy.

      In a cohort of HIV-infected individuals starting ART and being monitored with Wisepill, the
      investigators will test 1) daily SMS reminders, 2) weekly SMS reminders, 3) SMS reminders
      linked to real-time detection of missed doses, and 4) SMS reminders plus SMS notifications of
      48+hour gaps in adherence to members of social support networks. The investigators will
      conduct qualitative interviews to learn the experiences of participants and members of their
      social support networks with the different types of SMS. This staged approach will allow us
      to fully understand and compare the additive effects and acceptability of SMS-based
      interventions. The investigators will also determine behavioral effect mechanisms, as well as
      compare the impact of each type of SMS with a control population receiving only Wisepill
      monitoring on adherence and HIV RNA.
