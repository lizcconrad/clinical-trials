    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cohort study in which the standard verbal informed consent process for
      ketamine sedation is compared to a multimedia informed consent process. The goals include
      determining if parents prefer a multimedia consent process and evaluating the effectiveness
      of multimedia consent process.

      BACKGROUND: Informed consent (IC) is an ethical process for ensuring patient autonomy.
      Multimedia presentations (MMP) often aid the IC process for research studies. Thus, it
      follows that MMP would improve IC in clinical settings.

      OBJECTIVE: To determine if MMP for the IC process for ketamine sedation improves parental
      satisfaction and comprehension as compared to standard practice.

      DESIGN/METHODS: This two phase study compared two methods of IC for ketamine sedation of
      pediatric patients. Phase one was a randomized, prospective study that compared the standard
      verbal consent to a MMP. Phase two implemented the MMP into daily work flow. Parents
      completed a survey evaluating their satisfaction of the IC process and assessing their
      knowledge of ketamine sedation. Primary outcome measures were parental overall satisfaction
      with the IC process and knowledge of ketamine sedation.
