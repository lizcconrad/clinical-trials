  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to look at the safety of using stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS)
      and Ipilimumab together to treat melanoma that has spread to the brain or spine. Both
      Ipilimumab and SRS are used alone for the treatment of melanoma that has spread. Standard of
      care uses both of these treatments but not together. By using them together, we expect better
      treatment of melanoma, but there might be an increase in side effects.

      &quot;Ipilimumab&quot; is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of
      melanoma that has spread throughout the body. It works by activating your immune system to
      fight off cancer.

      &quot;Stereotactic radiosurgery&quot; (SRS) is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for
      the treatment of melanoma in the brain or spine. It uses radiation to treat tumors without
      needing to cut or use stitches.

      The use of combining SRS and Ipilimumab in this research study is investigational. The word
      &quot;investigational&quot; means that this combination is not approved for marketing by the Food and
      Drug Administration but is allowed for use in this research study.

    <description>A cohort of six (6) patients will be treated at Dosing Schedule 1. If the observed dose limiting toxicity (DLT) rate is less ≤33%, the dose cohort will be expended to a total of 15 patients. Brain and spine metastases will be evaluated as two separate cohorts.
If the first schedule produces DLTs in &gt;33% of patients, the Second Dosing schedule will be implemented. If the second dosing schedule produces DLTs in &gt;33% of patients, the Third Dosing schedule will be implemented.
After 6 patients were enrolled in a cohort, their safety and toxicity will be continuously monitored till 12 weeks (3 months) after the initial dose of Ipilimumab is given for evaluating dose-limiting toxicities.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have histologically confirmed diagnosis of melanoma. The pathologic
             confirmation may be from another metastatic site or from metastatic brain or spine
             lesions.

          2. Patients must have Stage IV melanoma, with newly identified brain or spine metastases.

          3. Patients must have measurable lesion in the brain or spine that is &gt; 3 mm seen on
             magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast.
