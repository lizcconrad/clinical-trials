    <description>The Subjective Well-Being under Neuroleptic Treatment - Short Version (SWN-S) is a patient-rated scale designed to measure subjective effects of neuroleptic drugs to psychopathology, quality of life, and compliance over the past 7 days. The 20 items (10 positive and 10 negative statements) are grouped in 5 subscales (mental functioning, self-control, physical functioning, emotional regulation and social integration). Each subscale contains 4 items. Each item was rated on a six-point Likert scale, from not at all to very much. A score was calculated for each subscale, and the total score ranged from 20 to 120, where the higher score indicated better well-being.</description>

    <description>The Quality of Life Scale (QLS) is a clinician-rated scale designed to assess deficit symptoms of schizophrenia and functioning during the preceding 4 weeks. The QLS consists of 21 items in 4 domains: Interpersonal Relations (eight items), Instrumental Role (four items), Intrapsychic Foundations (seven items), and Common Objects and Activities (two items). Each item was rated on a 7-point scale, from 0 (severe impairment) to 6 (normal or unimpaired functioning). Definitions were provided for 4 anchor points of the 7 points. Each item had a brief description of the judgement to be made and a set of suggested probes for the clinician. The total score was calculated as the sum of all 21 items giving a range of 0 to 126, where the higher score indicated normal or unimpaired functioning.</description>

        Patients will be recruited among those who complete treatment with aripiprazole in Study
        14724A / NCT01795547.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient is judged to potentially benefit from 24-week treatment with aripiprazole
             once-monthly according to the clinical opinion of the investigator.

          -  The patient agrees to protocol-defined use of effective contraception.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has been diagnosed with a primary psychiatric disorder other than
             schizophrenia during Study 14724A / NCT01795547.

          -  The patient has a clinically significant unstable illness diagnosed during Study
             14724A / NCT01795547.

          -  The patient is at significant risk of harming himself/herself or others according to
             the investigator's judgement or according to Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale
             (C-SSRS).

          -  The patient has a disease or takes medication that could, in the investigator's
             opinion, interfere with the assessments of safety, tolerability or efficacy, or
             interfere with the conduct or interpretation of the study.

          -  The patient has one or more clinical laboratory test values outside the reference
             range, based on the blood or urine samples taken during the conduct of Study 14724A /
             NCT01795547 that are, in the investigator's opinion, of potential risk to the
             patient's safety.

          -  The patient is, in the investigator's opinion, unlikely to comply with the protocol or
             is unsuitable for any reason.

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 24 in SWN-S Total Score</title>
        <description>The Subjective Well-Being under Neuroleptic Treatment - Short Version (SWN-S) is a patient-rated scale designed to measure subjective effects of neuroleptic drugs to psychopathology, quality of life, and compliance over the past 7 days. The 20 items (10 positive and 10 negative statements) are grouped in 5 subscales (mental functioning, self-control, physical functioning, emotional regulation and social integration). Each subscale contains 4 items. Each item was rated on a six-point Likert scale, from not at all to very much. A score was calculated for each subscale, and the total score ranged from 20 to 120, where the higher score indicated better well-being.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 24 in QLS Total Score</title>
        <description>The Quality of Life Scale (QLS) is a clinician-rated scale designed to assess deficit symptoms of schizophrenia and functioning during the preceding 4 weeks. The QLS consists of 21 items in 4 domains: Interpersonal Relations (eight items), Instrumental Role (four items), Intrapsychic Foundations (seven items), and Common Objects and Activities (two items). Each item was rated on a 7-point scale, from 0 (severe impairment) to 6 (normal or unimpaired functioning). Definitions were provided for 4 anchor points of the 7 points. Each item had a brief description of the judgement to be made and a set of suggested probes for the clinician. The total score was calculated as the sum of all 21 items giving a range of 0 to 126, where the higher score indicated normal or unimpaired functioning.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 24 in the 'Intrapsychic Foundations' QLS Domain Score</title>
        <description>The QLS is a clinician-rated scale designed to assess deficit symptoms of schizophrenia and functioning during the preceding 4 weeks. The QLS consists of 21 items in 4 domains: Interpersonal Relations (eight items), Instrumental Role (four items), Intrapsychic Foundations (seven items), and Common Objects and Activities (two items). Each item was rated on a 7-point scale, from 0 (severe impairment) to 6 (normal or unimpaired functioning). The Intrapsychic Foundations domain score was calculated as the sum of 7 items (numbers 13 to 17 and 20 and 21) giving a range of 0 to 42, where the higher score indicated less unimpaired functioning</description>

        <population>Effectiveness data is based on all patients who received at least one dose of IMP in Study 14724B (APTS). Effectiveness was measured at Weeks 0, 12, and 24. At Week 24, the analysis for 'Intrapsychic Foundations' QLS domain score was based on the 78 patients who had a measure for this outcome</population>

The WoRQ consists of 8 items: the clinician had to rate 7 statements and answer 1 question. The statements were rated on a four-point scale, from 'strongly agree', 'agree', 'disagree' or 'strongly disagree' based on all material available (for example, personal notes, medical records, input from other health professionals, family members or caregivers); and in the final item, the clinician had to indicate if the patient was ready for work or not (by indicating either 'yes' or 'no'). Possible total scores range from 4 to 28. Lower WoRQ total scores indicate better functioning.</description>

          <title>Patients Categorised As Sexually Dysfunctional Measured at Week 24 on the ASEX Scale</title>
          <description>The Arizona Sexual Experience Scale (ASEX) is a five-item, patient-rated scale that evaluates a patient’s recent sexual experiences. The ASEX is used to identify individuals with sexual dysfunction. Patients were asked to assess their own experiences over the last week (for example, “How strong is your sex drive?”, “Are your orgasms satisfying?”) and respond on a six-point scale for each item. Possible total scores range from 5 to 30. Higher ASEX total scores indicate more sexual dysfunction (hypofunction). The presence of sexual dysfunction based on the ASEX scale was defined as an ASEX total score of ≥19, or a score of ≥5 on any item, or a score of ≥4 on any 3 items.</description>
          <population>This analysis is based on all patients who received at least one dose of IMP in Study 14724B (APTS). At Week 24, the analysis for the number of patients categorised as sexually dysfunctional was based on the 75 patients who had a measure for this outcome</population>

        <description>The Subjective Well-Being under Neuroleptic Treatment - Short Version (SWN-S) is a patient-rated scale designed to measure subjective effects of neuroleptic drugs to psychopathology, quality of life, and compliance over the past 7 days. The 20 items (10 positive and 10 negative statements) are grouped in 5 subscales (mental functioning, self-control, physical functioning, emotional regulation and social integration). Each subscale contains 4 items. Each item was rated on a six-point Likert scale, from not at all to very much. A score was calculated for each subscale, and the total score ranged from 20 to 120, where the higher score indicated better well-being.</description>

        <description>The Quality of Life Scale (QLS) is a clinician-rated scale designed to assess deficit symptoms of schizophrenia and functioning during the preceding 4 weeks. The QLS consists of 21 items in 4 domains: Interpersonal Relations (eight items), Instrumental Role (four items), Intrapsychic Foundations (seven items), and Common Objects and Activities (two items). Each item was rated on a 7-point scale, from 0 (severe impairment) to 6 (normal or unimpaired functioning). Definitions were provided for 4 anchor points of the 7 points. Each item had a brief description of the judgement to be made and a set of suggested probes for the clinician. The total score was calculated as the sum of all 21 items giving a range of 0 to 126, where the higher score indicated normal or unimpaired functioning.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 12 in the 'Instrumental Role' QLS Domain Score</title>
        <description>The QLS is a clinician-rated scale designed to assess deficit symptoms of schizophrenia and functioning during the preceding 4 weeks. The QLS consists of 21 items in 4 domains: Interpersonal Relations (eight items), Instrumental Role (four items), Intrapsychic Foundations (seven items), and Common Objects and Activities (two items). Each item was rated on a 7-point scale, from 0 (severe impairment) to 6 (normal or unimpaired functioning). The Instrumental Role domain score was calculated as the sum of 4 items (numbers 9 to 12) giving a range of 0 to 24, where the higher score indicated less unimpaired functioning.</description>

        <population>Effectiveness data is based on all patients who received at least one dose of IMP in Study 14724B (APTS). Effectiveness was measured at Weeks 0, 12, and 24. At Week 12, the analysis for 'Instrumental Role' QLS domain score was based on the 81 patients who had a measure for this outcome</population>

        <description>The Readiness for Work Questionnaire (WoRQ) is a clinician-rated scale designed to measure a schizophrenic patient’s ability to work. The WoRQ consists of 8 items: the clinician had to rate 7 statements and answer 1 question. The statements were rated on a four-point scale, from 'strongly agree', 'agree', 'disagree' or 'strongly disagree' based on all material available (for example, personal notes, medical records, input from other health professionals, family members or caregivers); and in the final item, the clinician had to indicate if the patient was ready for work or not (by indicating either 'yes' or 'no'). Possible total scores range from 4 to 28. Lower WoRQ total scores indicate better functioning.</description>
