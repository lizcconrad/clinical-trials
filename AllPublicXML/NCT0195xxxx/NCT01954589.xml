    <textblock>
      A study of ACT-462206 to evaluate the tolerability, safety, pharmacokinetics, and
      pharmacodynamic of ascending single doses of ACT-462206, a novel dual orexin receptor
      antagonist in healthy male subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each dose level will be investigated in a new group of eight healthy male subjects (six on
      active drug and two on placebo). Each subject will participate in one treatment period, with
      the exception of subjects in the crossover part (i.e., almorexant reference group at the
      fourth dose level), who will participate in two treatment periods. At this dose level
      subjects on active drug (six) will receive in one treatment period ACT-462206 and in the
      other 400 mg of almorexant; subjects on placebo (two) will receive the corresponding placebos
      (double-dummy).

    <measure>Change in saccadic peak velocity from baseline up to the end of study</measure>
    <time_frame>10 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Recording of eye movements was performed in a quiet room with ambient illumination, with only 1 subject present. A microcomputer system was used for recording &amp; analysis. Disposable electrodes were applied on the forehead &amp; beside the lateral canthi of both eyes for registration of the electro-oculographic signals. Head movements were restricted using a fixed head support. The target consisted of a moving dot displayed on a computer screen, fixed in front of the head support. Saccadic eye movements were recorded for stimulus amplitudes of approximately 15 degrees to either side. Fifteen saccades were recorded with inter-stimulus intervals varying randomly between 3 and 6 s. Average values of saccadic peak velocity of all correct saccades were used as variables.Measurements were taken at 20 minutes, 45 minutes, 1 hour, 1.5 hours, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 5 hours, 6 hours, 8 hours, and 10 hours post-dose.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in performance on adaptive tracking from baseline up to the end of study</measure>
    <time_frame>10 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The adaptive tracking test was performed using customized equipment and software, following a standard protocol. Adaptive tracking is a pursuit-tracking task. The subject was asked to keep a dot inside a randomly moving circle by operating a joystick. If successful, the speed of the moving circle was increased. Conversely, the velocity was reduced if the subject could not maintain the dot inside the circle. The average performance (%) and the standard deviation of scores during a 3.5-min assessment period were used for analysis. The assessment period included a run-in time of 0.5 min, during which data were not recorded.Measurements were taken at 20 minutes, 45 minutes, 1 hour, 1.5 hours, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 5 hours, 6 hours, 8 hours, and 10 hours post-dose.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in body sway from baseline up to the end of study</measure>
    <time_frame>10 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Body sway was assessed using a body sway meter. All body movements during a 2-min period of time were integrated and expressed as mm sway on a digital display. Measurements of body sway were made in the sagittal (forward/backward) planes by positioning of the subject relative to the apparatus, with a string attached to the waist. The contribution of vision to postural control was eliminated by asking subjects to close their eyes. Subjects were instructed to wear the same pair of comfortable, low-heeled shoes in each session. Before starting a measurement, subjects were asked to stand still and comfortable, with their feet approximately 10 cm apart and their hands in a relaxed position alongside the body. Measurements were taken at 20 minutes, 45 minutes, 1 hour, 1.5 hours, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 5 hours, 6 hours, 8 hours, and 10 hours post-dose.</description>

At each time point of assessment, the subject indicated (with a mouse click on the computer screen) how he felt, on sixteen dimension horizontal VAS. Measurements were taken at 20 minutes, 45 minutes, 1 hour, 1.5 hours, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 5 hours, 6 hours, 8 hours, and 10 hours post-dose.</description>
