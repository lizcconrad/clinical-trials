    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of 12 weeks of treatment with
      once daily administration of AQX-1125 compared to placebo in subjects following exacerbations
      of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) by targeting the SHIP1 (Src Homology
      2-containing Inositol-5'-Phosphatase 1) pathway.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality
      worldwide. Acute exacerbations of COPD are usually treated with steroids and/or antibiotics.
      Currently this conventional therapy has significant side effects including osteoporosis,
      cataracts and suppression of the immune system (from the steroids) and increasing bacterial
      resistance and other side effects from the use of antibiotics. During an acute exacerbation
      of COPD, the inflammation in the airways increases.

      AQX-1125 represents a new type drug that based current data is thought decrease the
      inflammatory process and therefore may provide a therapeutic benefit in the treatment of
      COPD.

    <measure>The Primary Efficacy Variable Was the AAC for Daily EXACT Scores During the 12-week Treatment Period.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary variable (endpoint) of this study is the difference in the Area Above the Curve (AAC) for the daily EXACT score from baseline to Week 12 between subjects treated with AQX-1125 and placebo.The EXACT questionnaire is a patient reported outcome (PRO) measure designed to standardise the method for evaluating the frequency, severity and duration of acute exacerbations of COPD. The EXACT is a 14-item daily questionnaire where each item is assessed on a 5 or 6 point ordinal scale. Participants completed the EXACT questionnaire on a daily basis via an electronic diary from Day 1 (pre-dose) to Day 84 (week 12). Higher scores on the daily EXACT questionnaire indicate a more severe health state. When the post-treatment EXACT scores are lower (i.e. improved symptoms) than baseline EXACT, the AACs are positive.</description>

    <description>The secondary objective is to evaluate the treatment effect of once daily administrations of AQX-1125 compared to placebo over 12 weeks on the COPD Assessment Tool (CAT) score.The CAT questionnaire measures the impact of COPD on wellbeing and daily life. Participants answer 8 questions on a scale from 0 (best) to 5 (worst). The total score ranges from 0 to 40 with higher scores indicating more impact. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement. The change in total CAT score from Day 1, before taking study drug (baseline), to end of the 12 week treatment period was compared between the two treatments using an ANOVA model adjusting for treatment and region and including the baseline score as a covariate.</description>

        <title>The Primary Efficacy Variable Was the AAC for Daily EXACT Scores During the 12-week Treatment Period.</title>
        <description>The primary variable (endpoint) of this study is the difference in the Area Above the Curve (AAC) for the daily EXACT score from baseline to Week 12 between subjects treated with AQX-1125 and placebo.The EXACT questionnaire is a patient reported outcome (PRO) measure designed to standardise the method for evaluating the frequency, severity and duration of acute exacerbations of COPD. The EXACT is a 14-item daily questionnaire where each item is assessed on a 5 or 6 point ordinal scale. Participants completed the EXACT questionnaire on a daily basis via an electronic diary from Day 1 (pre-dose) to Day 84 (week 12). Higher scores on the daily EXACT questionnaire indicate a more severe health state. When the post-treatment EXACT scores are lower (i.e. improved symptoms) than baseline EXACT, the AACs are positive.</description>

        <description>The secondary objective is to evaluate the treatment effect of once daily administrations of AQX-1125 compared to placebo over 12 weeks on the COPD Assessment Tool (CAT) score.The CAT questionnaire measures the impact of COPD on wellbeing and daily life. Participants answer 8 questions on a scale from 0 (best) to 5 (worst). The total score ranges from 0 to 40 with higher scores indicating more impact. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement. The change in total CAT score from Day 1, before taking study drug (baseline), to end of the 12 week treatment period was compared between the two treatments using an ANOVA model adjusting for treatment and region and including the baseline score as a covariate.</description>
