      The purpose of this study is to assess patient satisfaction, the efficacy and compliance of
      granisetron patch versus ondansetron pills for radiation induced nausea and vomiting in
      malignant glioma patients receiving six weeks of radiation therapy (RT) and concomitant
      temozolomide (TMZ). Use of the patch may benefit brain tumor patients by increasing
      compliance.

      All eligible adult malignant glioma subjects should receive a planned total dose of 54-60 GY
      of radiation and 75 mg/m2 of daily TMZ for a total of six weeks. Subjects will be randomized
      to receive either granisetron patch or ondansetron for three weeks. Weeks 3-6, they will
      received the other medication. The granisetron transdermal delivery system (supplied as a 52
      cm^2 patch containing 34.3 mg of granisetron - 3.1 mg/day) is applied once per week 24 hours
      before the weekly radiation and chemotherapy, while the ondansetron 8 mg oral tablet is taken
      once a day 30-60 minutes prior to each dose of chemotherapy. Subjects will fill out
      questionnaires regarding the effectiveness of the medication and their satisfaction, and
      which anti-emetic they prefer.

      Safety will be assessed throughout the six weeks of radiation by the clinical research nurse
      using the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0. All subjects who
      receive both ondansetron and Granisetron Transdermal Delivery System (GTDS) treatment will be
      included in analyses of treatment preference. However, all other efficacy and safety analyses
      will include all subjects who received ondansetron or GTDS.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess whether malignant glioma patients receiving
      radiation therapy and concomitant TMZ are more satisfied with ondansetron or granisetron
      patch for the prevention of nausea and vomiting. The secondary objectives are 1) to compare
      the efficacy and compliance of granisetron patch and ondansetron in the prevention of nausea
      and vomiting during the 6 weeks of RT and concomitant TMZ, and 2) to assess the safety of the
      granisetron patch in preventing radiation induced nausea and vomiting in primary glioma
      patients receiving RT and TMZ.

      All eligible subjects should receive a planned total dose of 54-60 GY of radiation and 75
      mg/m2 of temozolomide daily for a total of six weeks. Subjects will be randomized to receive
      one of two treatment sequences of antiemetic therapy for the prevention of nausea and
      vomiting associated with RT and concomitant TMZ. Sequence #1 involves administration of
      ondansetron for 3 weeks followed by the use of granisetron patch for 3 weeks; whereas
      sequence #2 involves the use of the granisetron patch for 3 weeks followed by 3 weeks of
      ondansetron. Toxicity will be assessed each week of radiation therapy based on the Common
      Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0. The subject will be asked to
      complete the modified MASCC Antiemesis Tool (MAT) questionnaire at baseline, and on days 2,
      4, and 7 of each week of radiation therapy, as well as to record the use of all study
      medication and any antiemetic rescue medication taken daily. At the end of the weeks 3 &amp; 6,
      the subject will be asked to fill out a Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication
      and will be asked at the end of week 6 to choose which antiemetic they prefer.
