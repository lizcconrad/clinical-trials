  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Methylnaltrexone for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation in the setting of
      palliative or hospice care, is significantly more effective than placebo (1). However, in
      both the randomized and the open-label phase of the multi center trial showing this favorable
      outcome, the drug produced rescue-free laxation in only about half of the patients (2). There
      may be several reasons for this result, since constipation in palliative care patients often
      has multiple simultaneously occurring causes.

      Assuming that constipation of the non-responders is still opioid-induced, one of the possible
      reasons for not responding to methylnaltrexone could be that central actions of opioids
      contribute to constipation by reducing motility of the intestines through direct actions in
      the spinal dorsal horn (2). However, as methylnaltrexone is a µ-receptor antagonist and not
      all opioids are solely µ-receptor agonists another reason may well be that successful
      laxation is determined by the receptor-profile of the specific opioid the patient is using.

      Opioids do not only influence bowel functioning, but also immune system functioning and
      angiogenesis. Methylnaltrexone possibly antagonizes these changes, therefore this study will
      also investigate the influence of methylnaltrexone on immunologic and angiogenic parameters.

      From patients who also give informed consent for the second part of the study 50 ml of
      heparinized blood will be drawn before the first administration of methylnaltrexone (day 0),
      after 24 hours (day 1), at day 14 and approximately day 42 for immuno- and angiogenic
      measurements (see flow chart below).

      From this blood sample the size, phenotype and function of various leukocyte subsets, serum
      cytokine levels, VEGF levels, thrombocyte levels and circulating endothelial cell levels will
      be determined by means of fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) or enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
