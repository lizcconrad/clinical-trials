  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to examine whether a stress reduction intervention can
      improve health, mood and biological markers of cellular stress and aging in a group of
      chronically-stressed maternal caregivers and healthy maternal controls.

      This stress-reduction intervention was added into an ongoing observational study in May of
      2013. The parent study is a prospective cohort study of the effects of chronic stress in a
      group of maternal caregivers with children on the autism spectrum and healthy controls whose
      children have no diagnosis. Study participants are being invited to enroll in a 12-week
      stress reduction course based on the principles of mindfulness. They will attend four
      six-hour workshops and participate in 12 weekly hour-long web video conferencing calls to
      reinforce what is taught in the workshops.

      At the beginning and the end of the intervention, they complete self-report measures of
      psychological well-being and give saliva samples. Since the women are also participating in
      the longitudinal study, we have other before and after data for them. These include
      psycho-social measures, body measurements, psycho-physiology measurements, cognitive tests,
      actigraphy (for sleep), as well as saliva (for hormones), hair (for hormones) and blood (for
      telomeres, telomerase, gene expression, circulating hormones, inflammation and oxidative
      stress).

We will be able to assess performance pre- and post-intervention, to see if it improves after the stress-reduction training.</description>
