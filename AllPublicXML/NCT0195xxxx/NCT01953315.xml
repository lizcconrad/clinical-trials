  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the safety of muscle progenitor cells (MPCs) for the
      treatment of urinary incontinence due to incompetent outlet (bladder neck/urethra).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible subjects with a diagnosis of urinary incontinence who give consent to take part will
      undergo a biopsy of the muscle from the inner thigh under anesthesia. The muscle sample will
      be cultured and expanded for approximately 6 weeks. The product, composed of autologous, ex
      vivo-expanded muscle progenitor cells (MPCs) in suspension, will be delivered via targeted
      injection into the bladder neck sphincter region using either an endoscopic needle via a
      cystoscope or periurethral injection under ultrasound guidance. All subjects will be followed
      at 1 week, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months post-injection.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult female patients who are not pregnant or lactating/breast-feeding and must be
             either not sexually active, surgically sterilized, or must be practicing an effective
             method of birth control as determined by the investigator (e.g., oral contraceptives,
             double barrier methods, hormonal injectable or implanted contraceptives, tubal
             ligation, or partner with vasectomy)

          -  Patients between the ages of 18 and 75 years

          -  Patients with positive diagnosis of urinary incontinence due to sphincter
             insufficiency caused by acquired (e.g., stress urinary incontinence) and/or congenital
             (bilateral ectopic ureters with incompetent bladder neck; or female epispadias with or
             without bladder exstrophy) conditions.

          -  Patients with cystometric capacity of bladder &gt; 100 ml

          -  Patients with normal renal function

          -  Patients with a history of primary incontinence

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a history of hypercontractile bladder, non-compliant bladder,
             hydronephrosis or neurogenic bladder
