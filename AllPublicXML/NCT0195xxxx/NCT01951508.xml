  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate effects of methylphenidate, modafinil, and
      3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, &quot;Ecstasy&quot;) on emotion-processing and cognitive
      performance using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques. The primary
      hypothesis is that these psychostimulants differentially affect processing of emotional
      stimuli and potentially leading to alterations in social cognition and behavior.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Methylphenidate and modafinil are increasingly used as performance enhancers or &quot;smart drugs&quot;
      by students. 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, &quot;Ecstasy&quot;) is widely used as
      recreational drug to enhance emotions. We plan to investigate effects of these
      psychostimulants on emotion-processing and cognitive performance using functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques. Single doses of methylphenidate (60mg), modafinil
      (600mg), MDMA (125mg), or placebo will be administered before an fMRI scan in a
      placebo-controlled, randomized cross-over study design in 24 healthy subjects. Subjective
      emotional effects, sociability, neurohormonal, cardiovascular responses, and plasma drug
      concentrations will also be assessed and analyzed for potential brain-induced changes in
      brain activity in networks processing emotions. The primary hypothesis is that these
      psychostimulants differentially affect processing of emotional stimuli and potentially
      leading to alterations in social cognition and behavior. The work should clarify the
      neuropharmacological basis of the potentially differential effects of these drugs. This
      information will improve our understanding of the neurofunctional effects of methylphenidate,
      modafinil, and MDMA, and inform the ongoing debate surrounding brain doping with cognitive
      and mood enhancers.
