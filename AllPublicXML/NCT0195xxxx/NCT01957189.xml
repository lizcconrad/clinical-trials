      This will be an open-label, three-period, fixed-sequence study to evaluate the drug-drug
      interaction, pharmacokinetics and safety of dutasteride and tamsulosin when administered
      alone and in-combination in Chinese healthy male volunteers. The study will last
      approximately eleven weeks. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis will be taken at
      pre-specified times. Safety will be assessed by measurement of concurrent medication,changes
      in clinical laboratory values, ECG, vital signs, and collection of adverse
      events.Approximately 24 healthy adult males will be enrolled such that approximately 18
      subjects complete dosing and critical assessments.This will be an open label, single
      sequence, three-period study. Approximately 24 healthy male volunteers will be enrolled. At
      the first study period, the subjects will receive 0.5mg of dutasteride (Dut) as a single dose
      (SD) under fed conditions. Serum sampling will take place pre-dose and over the next 72 hours
      post dose (Per. A). After a 28-30 days washout, the subjects will be brought in and be given
      0.2mg tamsulosin as Harnal D tablet for 7 days with the morning meal. Serum sampling for
      pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin will take place at day 1, day 2 and day 3 pre-dose and at days
      4 for 24 hours (Per. B). On the next day (Day 5), the subjects will be given both 0.2mg
      tamsulosin Harnal D tablet and 0.5mg of dutasteride. Serum sampling will take place at Day 5
      pre-dose and followed for 72 hours (Per. C) for both dutasteride and tamsulosin. Subjects
      will participate in a follow-up visit approximately 2 weeks after the last dose of study
      drug.

             opinion of the Investigator or GSK Medical Monitor.

          -  History of myocardial infarction, coronary bypass surgery, unstable angina, cardiac
             arrhythmias, clinically evident congestive heart failure, or cerebrovascular accident
