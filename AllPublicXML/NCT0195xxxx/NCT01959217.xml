      Medication adherence rates among youth living with HIV are inadequate to effectively manage
      the disease, and novel interventions grounded in basic behavioral sciences are needed. This
      multi-site phased (3 phases) study plans to translate basic cognitive neuroscience regarding
      prospective memory (PM) into a more potent adherence intervention for youth living with HIV
      (YLH).

      The phases are:

      Phase 1: To improve PM in basic laboratory tasks in YLH with and with out substance abuse.

        -  Hypothesis 1: Manipulations in three theory-based components of PM (strategic encoding,
           self-monitoring and cue salience) will improve PM within each participant.

      Phase 2: To conduct proof of concept studies of a text-delivered PM intervention for taking
      ART in YLH with suboptimal adherence.

        -  Hypothesis 2: Using a multiple baseline across subjects design, adherence to ART will
           improve following initiation of the PM adherence intervention and will be maintained for
           6 weeks after tapering of the intervention.

        -  Hypothesis 2a: Similar feasibility, tolerability, and adherence improvement trends will
           be seen in youth with and without substance problems.

      Phase 3: To conduct a pilot randomized clinical trial of the PM intervention compared to
      traditional text message reminders (comparison condition) in non-adherent youth stratified by
      substance use.

        -  Hypothesis 3: Youth randomized to receive the PM intervention will show greater initial
           and sustained improvements in adherence and viral load compared to those randomized to
           the control condition.

        -  Hypothesis 3a: We will explore trends in the data relative to substance abuse, but we
           anticipate that the intervention will show promise for both substance using and non
           substance using YLH warranting a larger clinical trial that can test for
           substance-related mediators and moderators of the intervention.

      Medication adherence rates among youth living with HIV are inadequate to effectively manage
      the disease, and novel interventions grounded in basic behavioral sciences are needed.
      Emerging evidence suggests that prospective memory (PM) could represent an important piece of
      the puzzle. PM is defined as the neurocognitive capacity to successfully form, maintain, and
      execute an intention at a particular point in the future in response to a specific cue. This
      study plans to translate basic cognitive neuroscience regarding PM into a more potent
      adherence intervention for YLH, a population at high risk for poor cognitive function,
      substance abuse, and poor adherence. While text message reminders are an increasingly popular
      adherence support, evidence of efficacy is equivocal particularly for the maintenance of
      adherence after reminders end. By using basic cognitive neuroscience to enhance the potency
      of technology-based interventions to improve PM for adherence tasks, we hope to achieve both
      greater initial gains as well as sustained improvements in adherence for youth with and
      without substance abuse

      This multi-site phased study plans to translate basic cognitive neuroscience regarding PM
      into a more potent adherence intervention for youth living with HIV (YLH).

        -  In Phase 1, we will conduct theory-driven laboratory studies to improve three components
           of PM using a within-subjects design and traditional cognitive neuroscience tasks
           (strategic encoding, monitoring, and cue salience) in 60 youth from clinics where the
           co-PIs are based (Detroit and San Diego).

        -  In Phase 2, we will translate promising Phase 1 PM interventions to the youth's natural
           context to target adherence by combining them with text messaging, and test for signals
           of efficacy using a multiple baseline design for YLH with suboptimal adherence (N=24; 12
           with substance abuse and 12 without from Detroit).

        -  In Phase 3, we will conduct a pilot randomized clinical trial comparing the
           technology-based PM adherence intervention to text message reminders (N=60 from Detroit
           and San Diego).
