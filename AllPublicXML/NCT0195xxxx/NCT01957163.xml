  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After screening, subjects will enter a 4 week open-label run-in period with fluticasone
      furoate (FF)/vilanterol (VI) 100/25 mcg administered once daily via dry powder inhaler (DPI).
      Subjects will then be randomized to receive any one of the 3 treatments (umeclidinium bromide
      [UMEC] [62.5 mcg] administered once daily via a DPI; OR UMEC [125 mcg] administered once
      daily via a DPI; OR matching placebo administered once daily via a DPI), while continuing
      treatment with open label FF/VI 100/25 mcg during a 12-week treatment period. There will be a
      total of eight scheduled clinic visits at Pre-Screening (Visit0), Screening (Visit 1),
      blinded treatment Day 1(Visit2), 2(Visit3), 28 (Visit4), 56 (Visit5), 84 (Visit6) and 85
      (Visit7). A follow-up phone contact will be conducted approximately 7 days after the last
      clinic visit. The total duration of subject participation in the study from Screening to
      Follow-up will be approximately 17 weeks.

    <measure>Change From Baseline (BL) in Trough Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) at Day 85</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 85</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Trough FEV1 on Day 85 is defined as the mean of the FEV1 values obtained 23 and 24 hours after dosing on Day 84. Analysis was performed using a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) with covariates of treatment, Baseline FEV1, smoking status, Day, treatment, Day by baseline interaction and Day by treatment interaction, Day being nominal. Baseline FEV1 is the mean of the two assessments made at 30 and 5 minutes (min) pre-dose on Day 1. The change from baseline value is the difference between the on-treatment value and the baseline value.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Weighted Mean (WM), 0-6 Hour FEV1 Obtained Post-dose at Day 84</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 84</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. The 0-6 hour weighted mean was derived by calculating the area under the FEV1/time curve over the nominal time points of 0 hour (trough value), 15 and 30 min, 1, 3 and 6 hours, using the trapezoidal rule, and then dividing by the actual time between dosing and the 6 hour assessment. Analysis was performed using MMRM with covariates of treatment, Baseline FEV1 (mean of the two assessments made 30 minutes and 5 minutes pre-dose on Day 1), smoking status, Day, and Day by Baseline and Day by treatment interactions. Baseline FEV1 is the mean of the two assessments made at 30 and 5 min pre-dose on Day 1. The change from baseline value is the difference between the on-treatment value and the baseline value.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants ≥ 40 years of age with history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and a smoking history of ≥ 10 pack-years were enrolled in the study. Participants completed a 4-week run-in period, in which they received fluticasone furoate 100 micrograms(µg)/vilanterol 25 µg, followed by a 12-week treatment period and 1-week follow-up.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 619 participants (pars.), representing the enrolled particpants, were randomized to study treatment and comprised the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population (participants randomized to treatment who received ≥ 1 dose of randomized study medication in the treatment period).</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Change From Baseline (BL) in Trough Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) at Day 85</title>
        <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Trough FEV1 on Day 85 is defined as the mean of the FEV1 values obtained 23 and 24 hours after dosing on Day 84. Analysis was performed using a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) with covariates of treatment, Baseline FEV1, smoking status, Day, treatment, Day by baseline interaction and Day by treatment interaction, Day being nominal. Baseline FEV1 is the mean of the two assessments made at 30 and 5 minutes (min) pre-dose on Day 1. The change from baseline value is the difference between the on-treatment value and the baseline value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Weighted Mean (WM), 0-6 Hour FEV1 Obtained Post-dose at Day 84</title>
        <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. The 0-6 hour weighted mean was derived by calculating the area under the FEV1/time curve over the nominal time points of 0 hour (trough value), 15 and 30 min, 1, 3 and 6 hours, using the trapezoidal rule, and then dividing by the actual time between dosing and the 6 hour assessment. Analysis was performed using MMRM with covariates of treatment, Baseline FEV1 (mean of the two assessments made 30 minutes and 5 minutes pre-dose on Day 1), smoking status, Day, and Day by Baseline and Day by treatment interactions. Baseline FEV1 is the mean of the two assessments made at 30 and 5 min pre-dose on Day 1. The change from baseline value is the difference between the on-treatment value and the baseline value.</description>
