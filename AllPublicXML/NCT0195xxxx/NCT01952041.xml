  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a three year research project whose aims are to design and test a
      state-of-the-science smartphone Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) and sensor technologies
      to provide mobile monitoring of schizophrenia to detect early signs of relapse. The proposed
      system will be used to continuously capture multidimensional behavior as it occurs in
      real-time and in real-world environments, detect individual early warning signs, and trigger
      targeted interventions that may mitigate the severity of relapses or prevent their recurrence
      altogether. Mobile sensors include paralinguistic aspects of speech, physical activity and
      location, and sleep. The first hypothesis is that mobile sensing and EMA techniques will
      capture early behavioral warning signs. The second hypothesis is that machine learning,
      coupled with user input, will enable development of individualized predictive &quot;risk
      signature&quot; models. The third hypothesis is that automated system patient and provider
      functions will help prevent psychotic relapses.

    <description>The proportion or relapses is defined as one of the following events: psychiatric hospitalization, a significant increase in the level of psychiatric care (i.e. frequency and intensity of services), dosage or additional medication coupled with an increase of 25 percent from baseline on PANSS total score or increase of 10 points if the baseline was 40 or less, suicidal or homicidal ideation that was clinically significant in the investigators judgement, deliberate self-injury, violent behavior resulting in damage to another person or property.</description>
