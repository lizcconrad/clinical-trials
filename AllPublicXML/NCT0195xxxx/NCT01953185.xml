      Question: Does manual diaphragm release change kinematics and respiratory function of elderly
      subjects? Design: Randomized controlled trial with concealed allocation and double-blinding.

      Participants: 17 volunteers over 60 years old randomized into two groups: 09 in the Control
      Group (CG) and 08 in the Intervention Group (IG).

      Intervention: The manual diaphragm release technique was used on the IG, in two sets of ten
      deep breaths, with a one minute interval between them. The CG underwent a sham protocol
      (light touch), with same sets and time of interval.

      Outcome measures: The groups were evaluated using spirometry, manovacuometry and
      optoelectronic plethysmography (OEP), in that order, before and immediately after the
      intervention.

    <description>For this group, light touch at the same anatomical points was done without exerting pressure or traction. Positioning and duration were identical to the IG to perform the sham protocol (Licciardone &amp; Russo, 2006).</description>

    <intervention_name>The manual diaphragm release technique</intervention_name>
    <description>To perform the technique the volunteer was placed in supine position with limbs relaxed. Positioned behind the head of the volunteer, the therapist performed manual contact (pisiform, ulnar edge and the last three fingers) with the underside of the costal cartilage of the 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th rib, and guiding forearms toward the shoulders of the corresponding side. In the inspiratory phase, the therapist gently pulled the points of contact with both hands, in the direction of the head, yet slightly lateral, accompanying the elevation movement of the ribs. During exhalation, the therapist deepened contact toward the inner costal, maintaining resistance throughout the inspiratory phase. In the breaths following, the therapist sought to gain traction and smooth increase in the deepening of contacts. This maneuver was performed in two sets of ten deep breaths, with a one minute interval between them.</description>
