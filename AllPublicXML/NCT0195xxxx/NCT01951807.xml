  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects that have received medical treatment for ovarian cancer can be both physically and
      emotionally demanding for patients. The purpose of this study is to determine whether two
      common pyschological interventions (Communication Skills Intervention and Supportive
      Counseling) may improve the well-being of ovarian cancer patients compared to usual care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Very little is known in the psycho-oncology literature about why psychological interventions
      are effective or for how long these interventions exert an impact. Given many cancer patients
      experience recurrence and/or progression, it is important to know whether our relatively
      brief interventions facilitate how patients cope with this most-feared medical event. From a
      theoretical perspective, the study will advance our understanding of the mechanisms for
      change for two common treatment approaches, supportive and cognitive behavioral therapies.

      Subjects will be enrolled and upon completion of a baseline survey, randomized to into one of
      three arms - Communication Skills Intervention, Supportive Counseling, and Usual Care.
      Subjects will complete surveys during the course of the interventions.

Traumatic Stress. The Impact of Events Scale (IES) is a 15-item self-report measure focusing on intrusive and avoidant ideation related to gynecologic cancer and its treatment. Using a 4-point Likert scale, participants rated how true each statement has been for them during the past week (scale range = 0-75).
