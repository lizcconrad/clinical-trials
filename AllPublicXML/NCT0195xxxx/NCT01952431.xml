  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A comparative study to test the efficacy of a novel device - the MiniBoxPFT, in measuring TLC
      (total lung capacity) compared to TLC measured by standard body plethysmography using the ZAN
      500. The study will be conducted as a prospective two-arm, open, randomized comparative
      study.

      This study is a prospective, multi-centered, randomized, comparative study designed to
      demonstrate substantially equivalence performance of the proposed device, the PulmOne
      MiniBoxPFT, to its predicate device, the ZAN500, for the measurement of total lung capacity
      (TLC).
