      To compare the adenoma miss rate with the EndoRings™ vs. the adenoma miss rate with Standard
      view colonoscopy.

      To compare the polyp miss rate with the EndoRings™ vs. the polyp miss rate with Standard view
      colonoscopy.In addition, time measurements including time to cecum, time for withdrawal and
      overall procedure time will be analyzed and reported for each group.

      Patients who are scheduled for screening, surveillance or diagnostic colonoscopy will be
      recruited to the study and randomized to one of two groups. Each enrolled subject will
      undergo two &quot;back-to-back&quot; procedures.

      Subjects in Group A (study group) will undergo a Standard view colonoscopy followed
      immediately by an EndoRings™ colonoscopy. Subjects in Group B (control group) will undergo an
      EndoRings™ colonoscopy followed immediately by a Standard view colonoscopy.

      Results from the two groups will be analyzed and compared, with primary outcome measures
      being adenoma miss rate and polyp miss rate. Secondary outcome measures will include
      withdrawal time, total procedure time and characteristics of polyps detected, including size
      and histological results.

      Subjects will be followed through a 24 hour and a 7-days telephone interview for analysis of
      unexpected adverse events. Clinical results will be analyzed using various statistical
      measures of significance.

      Multi-center study with up to 126 patients. Up to 126 treated patients (2 groups of 57
      patients +6 drop-out patients) will be enrolled into the study.

    <description>Group A- we measured the Adenoma&amp;Polyp miss rates in the first procedure with Standard (based on what we discovered on the second procedure with the EndoRings).
Group B- we measured the Adenoma&amp;Polyp miss rates in the first procedure with EndoRings (based on what we discovered on the second procedure with the Standard).
Adenoma/Polyp Miss Rate means: total number of adenomas or polyps detected during the second procedure per Group divided by the total number of adenomas/polyps detected overall per Group]*100</description>

          <description>Follow up phone call was done 24 hours post procedure. Patients were asked the following : &quot;On a 0 to 10 scale, with “0” being no pain and “10” being pain as bad as you can imagine, how would you describe your colonoscopy experience?&quot; 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10</description>
          <population>Data was not analyzed since the patients satisfactory score was general estimation which could not be associated with either the standard colonoscopy or the EndoRings colonoscopy, therefore the intended endpoint failed.</population>
