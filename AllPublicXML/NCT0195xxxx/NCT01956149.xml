      Single-arm study to determine disease control rate in second- (or later) line treatment with
      cabazitaxel after the failure of palliative primary treatment.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      65 patients with advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the oesophagogastric junction and
      stomach will be treated with 20mg/m2 Cabazitaxel for a maximum of 6 cycles. Main objective of
      the study is the Disease Control Rate (DCR) with Cabazitaxel.

             after completion of the treatment. In these cases, neoadjuvant/adjuvant treatment is
             counted as one line.

          3. Malignant secondary disease dating back &lt; 5 years (exceptions: in situ cervical
             carcinoma, appropriately treated basal cell carcinoma of the skin)

          4. Severe secondary internal diseases, including uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or an
             acute infection

          5. Concomitant medication or planned treatment with strong CYP450 3A4/5 inducers or
             inhibitors (list of medicinal products in the appendix) or the relevant medicinal
