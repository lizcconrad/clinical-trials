    <textblock>
      This observational study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and participant
      reported quality of life of trastuzumab (Herceptin) subcutaneous (SC) therapy in participants
      with HER2-positive early breast cancer in routine clinical practice. Data from eligible
      participants will be collected for the duration of their treatment (approximately 1 year) and
      for 1-2 years of follow-up.
