    <measure>The Percentage of Patients With Drug Related Adverse Events During the Treatment Phase</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome measure presents percentage of patients with drug related adverse events during the treatment phase. Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) were defined as Adverse Events (AEs) that started or worsened in severity on or after the first dose of trial medication in this extension study [1301.4] and prior to the last date of trial medication + 180 days [inclusive]. Drug-related events were those considered by the investigator to have a causal relationship to trial medication.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Clinical Trial 1301.1 in Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) (Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate [ESR]) at Week 48 of Clinical Trial 1301.4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline in clinical trial 1301.1 up to Week 48 in clinical trial 1301.4.</time_frame>
    <description>DAS-28 (ESR)** is an index containing a 28-joint count for tenderness (TJC28), 28 joint count for swelling (SJC28), natural logarithm of ESR (inflammation) (Ln[ESR]) and a general health component (GH) which is the patient's global assessment of disease activity and was used to describe the severity of RA. The DAS28 (ESR) Score is calculated as:
DAS28(ESR) = 0.56*√(TJC28) + 0.28*√(SJC28) + 0.70*ln(ESR) + 0.014*(GH). DAS28 values range from 2.0 to 10.0 while higher values mean a higher disease activity. A clinically important change in DAS28 score is defined as an improvement in DAS28 score of at least 1.2.
The mean change from baseline (in clinical trial 1301.1) at Week 48 in the DAS28 (ESR) score is presented.</description>

    <measure>The Percentage of Patients Meeting the ACR20 [Based on Improvement Since Baseline in Trial 1301.1] at Week 48 of Trial 1301.4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline in clinical trial 1301.1 up to Week 48 in clinical trial 1301.4.</time_frame>
    <description>A subject has an ACR20 response if all of the following occur:
a &gt; 20% improvement in the swollen joint count (66 joints)
a &gt; 20% improvement in the tender joint count (68 joints)
a &gt; 20% improvement in at least 3 of the following assessments: patient's assessment of pain, patient's global assessment of disease activity, physician's global assessment of disease activity, patient's assessment of physical function, as measured by the Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index, or Acute phase reactant (CRP).
The number of subjects meeting the ACR20 response criteria at Week 48 is presented.</description>

    <measure>The Percentage of Patients Who Meet the American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Definition of Remission [Based on Improvement Since Baseline in Trial 1301.1] at Week 48 of Trial 1301.4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline in clinical trial 1301.1 up to Week 48 in clinical trial 1301.4.</time_frame>
    <description>To meet the ACR/EULAR Remission criteria*, the subject needed to satisfy the following criteria:
TCJ (68 joints) &lt; 1
SJC (66 joints) &lt; 1
CRP &lt; 1 milligrams per decilitre
patient global assessment &lt; 10. The patient global assessment for the definition of ACR/EULAR Remission was defined with a visual analog scale in millimetres (0-100).** The number of subjects meeting the ACR/EULAR Remission definition at Week 48 is presented.</description>

        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Must give written informed consent and be willing to follow this Clinical Trial
             Protocol.

          2. Male or female patients, with moderately to severely active RA who have previously
             participated in the double-blind randomized clinical Trial 1301.1.

          3. Current treatment for RA on an outpatient basis:

               1. Patients must continue to receive and tolerate oral or parenteral methotrexate
                  (MTX) therapy at a dose of 15-25 mg per week (dose may be as low as 10 mg per
                  week if the patient is unable to tolerate a higher dose).

               2. Patients must be willing to receive oral folic acid (at least 5 mg/week or as per
                  local practice) or folinic acid (at least 1 mg per week or as per local practice)
                  or equivalent during the entire trial.

               3. If receiving current treatment with oral corticosteroids (other than
                  intra-articular or parenteral), the dose must not exceed 10 mg/day prednisolone
                  or equivalent. During the 4 weeks prior to Baseline (Day 1) the dose must remain
                  stable.

               4. Intra-articular and parenteral corticosteroids are not permitted throughout the
                  trial, with the exception of IV administration of 100 mg methylprednisolone 30 to
                  60 minutes prior to each infusion as part of the trial procedures.

               5. Any concomitant non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) must be stable

                  than 250 mg/day. These doses must have been stable for a minimum of 12 weeks
                  prior to Day 1. The hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine treatment will need to be
                  continued at a stable dose with the same formulation until the end of the trial.

          4. For participants of reproductive potential (males and females), use of a medically
             acceptable method of contraception during the trial, i.e., a combination of 2 forms of
             effective contraception (defined as hormonal contraception, intrauterine device,
             condom with spermicide, etc.). Females of childbearing potential must also agree to
             use an acceptable method of contraception (see above) for 12 months following
             completion or discontinuation from the trial medication.

             uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, gastric ulcers, active

             heart failure of Class III or IV of the New York Heart Association (NYHA)
             classification; uncontrolled angina or arrhythmia; any uncontrolled or severe
             cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease; or uncontrolled hypertension.

          5. Treatment with IV or intramuscular corticosteroids. The only exception will be the
             administration of 100 mg IV methylprednisolone 30 to 60 minutes before each infusion
             as part of the trial procedures.

          6. Any condition or treatment (including biologic therapies) that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, may place the patient at unacceptable risk during the trial.

          7. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;2.5 times upper
             limit of normal (ULN).

        <description>This outcome measure presents percentage of patients with drug related adverse events during the treatment phase. Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) were defined as Adverse Events (AEs) that started or worsened in severity on or after the first dose of trial medication in this extension study [1301.4] and prior to the last date of trial medication + 180 days [inclusive]. Drug-related events were those considered by the investigator to have a causal relationship to trial medication.</description>

          <description>This outcome measure presents percentage of patients with drug related adverse events during the treatment phase. Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) were defined as Adverse Events (AEs) that started or worsened in severity on or after the first dose of trial medication in this extension study [1301.4] and prior to the last date of trial medication + 180 days [inclusive]. Drug-related events were those considered by the investigator to have a causal relationship to trial medication.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Clinical Trial 1301.1 in Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) (Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate [ESR]) at Week 48 of Clinical Trial 1301.4</title>
        <description>DAS-28 (ESR)** is an index containing a 28-joint count for tenderness (TJC28), 28 joint count for swelling (SJC28), natural logarithm of ESR (inflammation) (Ln[ESR]) and a general health component (GH) which is the patient's global assessment of disease activity and was used to describe the severity of RA. The DAS28 (ESR) Score is calculated as:
DAS28(ESR) = 0.56*√(TJC28) + 0.28*√(SJC28) + 0.70*ln(ESR) + 0.014*(GH). DAS28 values range from 2.0 to 10.0 while higher values mean a higher disease activity. A clinically important change in DAS28 score is defined as an improvement in DAS28 score of at least 1.2.
The mean change from baseline (in clinical trial 1301.1) at Week 48 in the DAS28 (ESR) score is presented.</description>
