    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess efficacy and safety data of secukinumab in Japanese
      subjects with generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP). This study is expected to support the
      filing of secukinumab in the indication of pustular psoriasis in Japan.

    <description>All subjects will be assigned to receive secukinumab 150 mg. Secukinumab 150 mg s.c. injection will be administered at BSL, Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4. Prior to receiving the Week 8 dose, all subjects will be assigned to the following treatment group based on clinical components of their CGI evaluation at Week 8.
&quot;No up-titration&quot; group will receive 1 injection of secukinumab 150 mg at Weeks 8, 12, and each visit from Week 16 until Week 48.
&quot;Up-titration&quot; group will receive 2 injections of secukinumab 150 mg at Weeks 8, 9, 12 and each visit from Week 16 until Week 48.
Subjects receiving secukinumab 150 mg can be up-titrated to secukinumab 300 mg at any visit starting at Week 16 based on clinical components of their CGI evaluation and investigator's discretion.</description>
