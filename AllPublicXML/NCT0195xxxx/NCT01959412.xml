    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of indacaterol 55µg once daily (and
      27.5 µg twice) in QVA149 compared to 75 µg indacaterol monotherapy.

    <description>Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) is the amount of air which can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs in the first second of a forced exhalation. FEV1 will be measured pre-dose and over a 24 hours post-dose period.</description>

    <description>Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) is the amount of air which can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs in the first second of a forced exhalation. FEV1 will be measured pre-dose and over a 12 hours post-dose period.</description>

    <measure>Change From Period Baseline in Peak FEV1 (L)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (24 hours)</time_frame>
    <description>Spirometry will be conducted according to internationally accepted standards. Peak Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) is the maximum FEV1 recorded between different time points.</description>

    <measure>Change From Period Baseline in Trough FEV1 (L)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (24 hours)</time_frame>
    <description>Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) is the amount of air which can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs in the first second of a forced exhalation, measured through spirometry testing. The trough in FEV1 is defined as the mean of two measurements at different time points.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Period Baseline in FVC (L) AUC (0-24h)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (24 hours)</time_frame>
    <description>Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) is the amount of air which can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs after taking the deepest breath possible. FVC will be assessed via spirometry. A positive change from baseline in FVC indicates improvement in lung function.</description>
