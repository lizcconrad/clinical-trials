  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of the trial is to compare two different Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA)
      treatment approaches: 1) an &quot;early treatment&quot; approach or 2) a &quot;conservative&quot; approach. For
      the purposes of the study infants will be enrolled if they are delivered before 28 weeks
      gestation and have a moderate/large PDA present at 5-7 days after birth.

      The hypothesis is: treatment of a moderate size patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) will decrease
      the time needed for assisted respiratory support, diuretic therapy, and gavage feeding
      assistance, in addition to decreasing the incidence of ductus ligations or need for future
      outpatient cardiology follow-up appointments. The investigators hypothesize that one or more
      of these benefits will occur without an increase in the time taken to achieve full enteral
      feedings or in the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) or spontaneous intestinal
      perforations (SIP).The investigators will be comparing the effectiveness of early
      pharmacologic treatment with a control group of conservatively managed infants who will only
      receive treatment if they meet specific criteria for &quot;rescue treatment&quot;.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prior studies showed that, if a moderate/large Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA) is still
      present at 5 days after birth (among infants delivered at 23 and 0/7 to 25 and 6/7 weeks
      gestation) or at 7 days after birth (among infants delivered at 26 and 0/7 to 27 and 6/7
      weeks gestation), it will persist for at least another 4-12 weeks if it is left untreated.

    <description>Infants randomized to the early treatment group will receive &quot;pharmacologic treatment of the PDA&quot; to produce PDA closure. Within 24-36 hr following the last treatment dose an echocardiogram will be obtained to document the degree of ductus closure or patency.
Echocardiograms will be obtained at 1) 10-14 days after study entry (if the PDA was open and of moderate size on the last echocardiogram), and 2) at the time of hospital discharge (if the PDA was open (any size) on the last echocardiogram). The echocardiogram obtained at discharge will be used to determine the need for outpatient follow-up.</description>

Echocardiograms will be obtained at 1) 10-14 days after study entry (if the PDA was open and of moderate size on the last echocardiogram), and 2) at the time of hospital discharge (if the PDA was open (any size) on the last echocardiogram).
