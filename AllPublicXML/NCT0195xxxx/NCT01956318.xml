    <description>Chronic Venous Insufficiency Questionnaire (CIVIQ 2) 20% improvement. disease-specific QOL score for patients with chronic venous disease. The total score is derived from 20 questions (items) that represent four QOL dimensions (of 3-9 items each): bodily pain, physical, social and psychological functioning. The possible scores for each item are as follows: 1, negative; 2, weak; 3, moderate; 4, strong; 5, severe. The total scores can therefore vary from 20 (no symptoms) to 100 (worse possible condition).</description>

    <description>18 days of balneotherapy session in 3 weeks. Each day, the treatment associates 4 techniques: Kneipp Therapy, walking pool, underwater massage, bath tub and finishing with 20 minutes of rest in the Trendelendburg position. Kneipp Therapy is an alternating warm (28째C) and cold (14째C) shower on the legs during 10 minutes. Walking pool is a 60 cm deep pool at 23째C with underwater shower where patients are walking without stopping during 10 minutes. Underwater massage is realized by a senior physiotherapist. It starts at the feet and gradually rises to the thighs during 10 minutes. Bath tub is underwater shower at 30째C. It also starts at the feet and gradually rises to the thighs during 20 minutes. The interventions are standardized by timers. Adherence to each technique is supervised before each session in the usual manner for each patient treated in the spa center.</description>
