      This study will evaluate the correlation between the respiratory rate derived from the Reveal
      Insertable Cardiac Monitor (ICM) electrocardiogram (ECG) with the respiratory rate obtained
      from an external respiratory band in patients previously implanted with a Reveal for
      unexplained syncope or suspected arrhythmia.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is implanted with a Reveal ICM or Reveal XT ICM for unexplained syncope or
             suspected arrhythmia

          -  Subject (or the legal representative) is willing to sign informed consent form

          -  Subject is 18 years or older or as specified minimal age per local law/regulation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Significant respiratory diseases such as COPD or pulmonary hypertension.

          -  Patients with frequent arrhythmias, including PVC's.

          -  Patients with known heart failure.

          -  Body conditions that would complicate accurate measurement of respiratory rate with
             the respiration device.

          -  Patients which are not able to take the postures as necessary for the study protocol
             and which cannot walk continuously for a period of 6 minutes.

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women, or women of child bearing potential and who are not
             on a reliable form of birth control.

          -  Subject is enrolled in one or more concurrent studies that would confound the results
             of this study
