  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the plasma pharmacokinetics of a single 125mg oral dose of
      palbociclib in the presence and absence of rifampin-mediated enzyme induction in a
      fixed-sequence two-period study.

    <measure>Area Under the Curve From Time Zero to Extrapolated Infinite Time [AUC (0 - 8)]</measure>
    <time_frame>0-120 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>AUC (0 - 8)= Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) from time zero (pre-dose) to extrapolated infinite time (0 - 8). It is obtained from AUC (0 - t) plus AUC (t - 8).</description>

    <measure>Plasma Decay Half-Life (t1/2)</measure>
    <time_frame>0-120 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma decay half-life is the time measured for the plasma concentration to decrease by one half.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Apparent Oral Clearance (CL/F)</measure>
    <time_frame>0-120 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Clearance was estimated from population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling. Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Apparent Volume of Distribution (Vz/F)</measure>
    <time_frame>0-120 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Volume of distribution is defined as the theoretical volume in which the total amount of drug would need to be uniformly distributed to produce the desired plasma concentration of a drug. Apparent volume of distribution after oral dose (Vz/F) is influenced by the fraction absorbed.</description>

    <description>Subjects will receive two different interventions in fixed-sequence two-period study. In the first period the subjects will receive a single-dose of palbociclib. In the second period, subjects will receive 12 days of rifampin and a single dose of palbociclib on day 8. In both periods, subjects will undergo pharmacokinetic sampling at prespecified time points up to 120 hours post palbociclib dose.</description>

    <description>In period 1, patients will receive a single 125mg oral dose of palbociclib alone. Subjects will undergo palbociclib pharmacokinetic sampling at prespecified time points up to 120 hours post palbociclib dose.
In period 2, subjects will receive 12 daily oral doses of 600mg of rifampin and a single 125mg oral dose of palbociclib on day 8. Subjects will undergo palbociclib pharmacokinetic sampling at prespecified time points up to 120 hours post palbociclib dose.</description>
