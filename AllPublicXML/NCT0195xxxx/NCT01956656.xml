  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to difficulties in maintenance of an effective mechanical oral hygiene regime, effective
      chemical adjunctive measures will likely significantly contribute to overall oral health, the
      function of which should be to augment mechanical plaque control. Traditionally, in Chinese
      medicine the lotus leaf has been used for treating gingival inflammation. An extract of lotus
      leaves have demonstrated significant antibacterial activity against some of the
      periodontopathogens.

      The objective of the present research is to evaluate the efficacy of a lotus leaf mouth wash
      in management of plaque induced gingivitis.

      Study design: 30 systemically healthy volunteers will be randomly allocated into two arms

      Arm A: Lotus leaf mouth wash (aqueous) group [Test group] Arm B: Placebo mouth wash group
      [Control group]

      All the volunteers are instructed to refrain from tooth brushing 24 hours before the
      examination. Clinical parameters (plaque index, bleeding index and gingival index)will be
      measured and the plaque samples are collected from subjects from each group for
      microbiological analysis. All the participants will undergo scaling, and they were instructed
      to refrain from tooth cleaning procedures and were advised to use the prescribed mouth wash
      twice daily for 4 days. All volunteers were recalled on 5th day for clinical and
      microbiological analysis. Statistical analysis and results are awaited
