  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is to assess the safety and tolerability of Sym004, administered weekly or
      biweekly as monotherapy in Japanese subjects with advanced solid tumors.This study consisted
      of two parts, a dose-escalation part (&quot;Part-A&quot;) and a dose-expansion part (&quot;Part-B&quot;). In
      Part-A, Sym004 will be administered weekly or biweekly as monotherapy in Japanese subjects
      with advanced solid tumors. In Part-B, Sym004 will be administered weekly as monotherapy to
      Japanese subjects with advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) as dose-expansion.
      A subject will receive Sym004 administration weekly at a dose that will determined to be the
      MTD or a dose that will lower than the MTD and determined to be appropriate with
      recommendation by Safety monitoring committee (SMC). The dose going to used in Part-B will be
      determined after safety confirmation of weekly regimens in Part-A of this trial.

    <time_frame>Week 1 up to Week 4 (Part A)</time_frame>
    <description>DLT: any of the following National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) Grade 4 hematologic or Grade 3/4 non-hematologic toxicities that occurred during DLT observation period of Part A, and were considered by Investigator to be at least possibly related to study treatment, and confirmed by Safety Monitoring Committee. Hematological toxicities: Grade 4 neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, Grade 4 thrombocytopenia, Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding episodes. Nonhematological toxicities: Grade 3 or higher non-hematological toxicity with exception of Grade 3 fatigue/skin toxicity; Grade 3 nausea/vomiting without appropriate prophylactic therapy; Grade 3 diarrhoea recovered within 2 days with adequate treatment or did not accompany fever/dehydration; Grade 3 or 4 laboratory liver parameter abnormalities with duration of less than 3 days.</description>

    <measure>Number of Subjects With Treatment-emergent Adverse (TEAEs), Serious TEAEs, TEAEs Leading to Discontinuation or TEAEs Leading to Death</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 4 weeks after the last Sym004 administration, up to a maximum of 41.1 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE was any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect or was otherwise considered medically important. AEs were considered treatment emergent if they started on or after the day of first administration of the Sym004 or if they started prior to administration but worsened after receiving the first dose of treatment.</description>

    <description>IHC is a staining process performed on fresh/frozen cancer tissue. IHC is used to show whether or not the cancer cells have Human Epidermal Growth Receptor (HER2) and/or hormone receptors on their surface. A value designated the IHC score was derived by summing the percentages of cells staining at each intensity multiplied by the weighted intensity of staining (0, 1+, 2+, 3+: 3+ indicates the strongest staining, 2+ indicates medium staining, 1+ indicates weak staining, and 0 indicates no staining). Minimum score of 0 to a maximum score of 300; the maximum score indicates the strongest expression.</description>

        <title>Number of Subjects With Treatment-emergent Adverse (TEAEs), Serious TEAEs, TEAEs Leading to Discontinuation or TEAEs Leading to Death</title>
        <description>An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE was any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect or was otherwise considered medically important. AEs were considered treatment emergent if they started on or after the day of first administration of the Sym004 or if they started prior to administration but worsened after receiving the first dose of treatment.</description>

        <description>Percentage of subjects with best overall response (defined as confirmed CR or PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST Version 1.1) was reported. CR was defined as disappearance of all target and all non-target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 millimiter (mm). PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. Confirmed CR or PR was defined as the response that was confirmed at an interval of at least 4 weeks.</description>

          <description>Duration of disease control measured from the time measurement criteria were first met for CR, PR, or SD (whichever was first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease was objectively documented. CR: disappearance of all target and all non-target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. PR: at least a 30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. PD: at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study) or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. SD: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.</description>
          <population>Efficacy Analysis Set consisted of all subjects (from Parts A and B) who received at least 1 administration of Sym004 and who had baseline tumor assessment and at least 1 tumor assessment according to RECISTv1.1 after first dose of trial medication.
