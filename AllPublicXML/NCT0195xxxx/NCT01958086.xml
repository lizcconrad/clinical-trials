  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators objective is to run human clinical trials in which brain activity recorded
      through a &quot;brain-chip&quot; implanted in the human brain can be used to provide novel
      communication capabilities to severely paralyzed individuals by allowing direct brain-control
      of a computer interface. A prospective, longitudinal, single-arm early feasibility study will
      be used to examine the safety and effectiveness of using a neural communication system to
      control a simple computer interface and a tablet computer. Initial brain control training
      will occur in simplified computer environments, however, the ultimate objective of the
      clinical trial is to allow the human patient autonomous control over the Google Android
      tablet operating system. Tablet computers offer a balance of ease of use and functionality
      that should facilitate fusion with the BMI. The tablet interface could potentially allow the
      patient population to make a phone call, manage personal finances, watch movies, paint
      pictures, play videogames, program applications, and interact with a variety of &quot;smart&quot;
      devices such as televisions, kitchen appliances, and perhaps in time, devices such as robotic
      limbs and smart cars. Brain control of tablet computers has the potential to greatly improve
      the quality of life of severely paralyzed individuals. Two subjects will be enrolled, each
      implanted with the NCS for a period of 53 weeks. The study is expected to take two years in
      total.

    <description>The Serious Adverse event (SAE) rate will be calculated as the number of SAEs per implant-days. The SAE rate will be continuously compared to the 1% threshold level. CT scan; inspection of patient's scalp for evidence of reddening or discharge; review of new symptoms including possible fever, headache, visual or auditory changes, or change in mood or behavior; serial neurologic exams. The condition of the area will be compared with its condition on previous visits. History will be obtained regarding new symptoms.

    <description>The Neural Communication System consists of two Neuroport Arrays, which are descried in detail in the intervention description. Both Neuroport Arrays are inserted into Brodmann's Area 5 in the posterior parietal cortex, an area of the brain used in reach planning. The arrays are inserted and the percutaneous pedestal is attached to the skull during a surgical procedure. Following surgical recovery the subject will participate in study sessions 3-5 times per week in which they will learn to use thought to control a simple computer environment or a tablet computer.</description>

    <description>NeuroPort Arrays allow for the local recording of cerebral cortex. Key features include sterile, single use electrodes that provide access to a localized population of individual cells. The Neural Communication system is primarily composed of two NeuroPort Arrays. The main component of the NeuroPort Array is an array comprised of 100 microelectrodes (1.5 mm in length) uniformly organized on a 4 mm x 4 mm silicon base that is 0.25 mm thick. Each microelectrode is insulated with Parylene-C polymer and has a platinum tip that is 100-200 microns in length. The Patient Pedestal is made from titanium and is 19 mm wide at the skin interface.</description>
