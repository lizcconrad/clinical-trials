      Hormone receptor-positive tumors are the most common breast cancers in postmenopausal women,
      and drug therapies, which block the production or effects of estrogen, are the mainstay of
      treatment in these patients. Due to their effectiveness in postmenopausal women, aromatase
      inhibitors (AIs) are the standard of care for long-term estrogen suppression in these
      patients. Estrogen deficiency, however, results in multiple side effects. Some of the most
      common side effects in women taking AIs are joint and muscle aches, which promote physical
      deconditioning. Because of the long term use of AIs in postmenopausal breast cancer patients
      and the improvements in cancer-related outcomes that are observed with their use, identifying
      methods to reduce these side effects to maintain adherence to treatment is important.
      Exercise interventions in breast cancer patients also improve quality of life and reduce
      fatigue. Understanding the role of exercise in AI side effect prevention will allow us to
      translate these findings into therapy guidelines.

      Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women in the United States and is the second
      leading cause of cancer deaths. In 2013, an estimated 230,000 women in the United States will
      be diagnosed with invasive breast cancer and approximately 40,000 with die.1 Women with
      breast cancer frequently experience significant functional and metabolic declines during and
      after treatment due to cancer-related fatigue (CRF), stress and depression.2,3 Cancer-related
      fatigue is associated with side effects from treatment, pain, functional disability, sleep
      disturbances, mood disturbances and co-morbid conditions.4 Patients with CRF have declines in
      physical activity and function, which significantly impacts quality of life (QOL).5 The
      mechanisms underlying functional declines and fatigue in breast cancer patients are likely
      multifactorial, but deconditioning, sarcopenia, increases in inflammatory cytokines, insulin
      resistance, and changes in muscle and fat metabolism seem to play important roles.4,6

      Hormone receptor-positive tumors are the most common breast cancers in postmenopausal women,
      and endocrine therapies, which block the production or effects of estrogen, are the mainstay
      of treatment in these patients. Due to their superior efficacy in postmenopausal women,
      aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are the standard of care for long-term estrogen suppression in
      these patients.7 Estrogen deprivation, however, results in multiple side effects which may
      worsen fatigue and the functional and metabolic declines associated with cancer treatment.8
      Some of the most common side effects in women taking AIs are musculoskeletal symptoms,
      including arthralgias and myalgias, which promote deconditioning and sarcopenia and their
      associated side effects.9 Because of the prolonged use of AIs in postmenopausal breast cancer
      patients and the improvements in cancer-related outcomes that are observed with their use,
      great efforts are taken to reduce AI induced musculoskeletal symptoms (AIMSS) to maintain
      adherence to treatment. While multiple strategies are used to manage AIMSS, current therapies
      mainly focus on interventions in patients who develop symptoms (tertiary prevention) rather
      than primary prevention.9 Exercise interventions in breast cancer patients also improve QOL,
      decrease fatigue, and increase physical function and strength.10,11 Understanding the role of
      exercise in AI side effect prevention will allow us to translate these findings into therapy
      guidelines.
