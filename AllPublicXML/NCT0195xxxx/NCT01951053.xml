  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of JNJ-40411813 on rapid eye movement
      sleep and deep sleep; safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (what the body does to the
      study medication) of JNJ-40411813.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind (neither physician nor participants knows the treatment that the
      participant receives), placebo-controlled (effect of the study medication will be compared
      with the effect of placebo [inactive substance]), comparator-controlled (effect of the study
      medication will be compared with the effect of FDA approved and marketed active substance
      [citalopram]), and 3-way crossover (method used to switch participants from one treatment arm
      to another treatment arm) study. This study will be double-blinded for treatment with placebo
      and JNJ-40411813; however, it will be open label (all people know the identity of the
      intervention) for treatment with citalopram. This study will consist of screening phase
      (within 28 days prior to the start of study medication), treatment phase, and follow-up phase
      (approximately 14 days after the last administration of study medication). Participants will
      be randomly assigned to 1 of 6 sequences (Sequences 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6) to receive
      JNJ-40411813, citalopram, and placebo. Each sequence consists of 3 treatment periods (Period
      1, Period 2, and Period 3) and each subsequent treatment period will be separated by a wash
      out period (no treatment) of at least 7 days. Approximately, 18 participants will be enrolled
      in this study (3 participants in each sequence). Safety will be evaluated by the assessment
      of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, vital signs, and physical
      examination which will be evaluated throughout the study duration. The total duration of
      study participation for a participant will be approximately 10 Weeks.

    <description>REM sleep is a normal stage of sleep characterized by the rapid and random movement of the eyes. REM sleep latency is the time from sleep onset until first period of REM sleep. Polysomnographic recordings will be used to determine the time spent in different sleep stages (S1: light sleep, S2: light sleep, S3: deep sleep, and S4: REM sleep).</description>
