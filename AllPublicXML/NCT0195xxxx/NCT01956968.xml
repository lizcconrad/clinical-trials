  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder pain may result from abnormal arm or shoulder blade (scapular) movement. These
      abnormal movements may result from a variety of flexibilty, motion or strength impairments.
      Therefore identifying any abnormal arm or scapular movement, as well as any impairments that
      are associated with them can help clinicians plan a proper management strategy for patients
      presenting with shoulder disorders. Our hypothesis is that specific impairments will be
      associated with abnormal arm movement, while other impairments will be associated with
      abnormal scapular movement among patients with shoulder pain.
