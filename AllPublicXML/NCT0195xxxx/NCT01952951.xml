  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current standard treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer (clinical stage II or III)
      is preoperative radiation with chemotherapy (CRT) followed by surgery. But this approach can
      be suboptimal for patients with high risk features (more deeply-seated tumor or many regional
      lymph nodes involved)that are associated with recurrence. This study test a hypothesis that
      CRT followed by chemotherapy before surgery can improve efficacy of preoperative treatment.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Downstaging rate with CRT using fluoropyrimidine monotherapy is usually 30-40%.In MRI-defined
      high-risk patients, downstaging rate with conventional fluoropyrimidine-based monotherapy
      with radiation has not been shown. We assume that the downstaging rate of chemoradiation arm
      (control arm) would be 30%, and that addition of CapOx after CRT (experimental arm) may
      increase downstaging rate 30% to 50%. A sample size of 52 patients per group is needed have
      85% power to detect downstaging rate = 50% as compared to 30% with type I error rate of 15%.
      We will perform one interim futility analysis when half of the patients are recruited and
      evaluated for the primary endpoint. O'Brien-Fleming boundary will be considered. Therefore,
      when 26 patients per arm are evaluated, the interim futility analysis will be performed, and
      when the Z score at the interim is less than -0.09192 (one-sided p-value greater than
      0.5366192), the study will be stopped for futility. Considering 5% follow-up loss, a sample
      size of 55 per arm (a total of 110 patients) will be studied.
