      This study is being done to understand metformin's mechanisms of action regarding glucose
      production, protein metabolism, and mitochondrial function.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is believed that Metformin antagonizes the action of glucagon through different pathways.
      In mice, Metformin leads to inhibition of adenylate cyclase, reduction of levels of cyclic
      AMP and protein kinase A (PKA) activity, therefore blocking glucagon-dependent glucose output
      form hepatocytes. Glucagon plays an important role in the increased catabolic state seen in
      insulin deficiency. Hyperglucagonaemia states have been shown to accelerate proteolysis and
      leucine oxidation in insulin-deficient humans. Patients with insulin resistance and increased
      levels of glucagon have an increased in energy expenditure which may contribute to the
      catabolic state associated with this condition. We hypothesized that treatment with Metformin
      for 2 weeks will significantly inhibit glucagon-induced endogenous glucose production in
      insulin resistant individuals. We also hypothesized that glucagon-induced alterations in
      whole body protein metabolism and the increases in O2 consumption associated with
      hyperglucagonaemia states will be significantly inhibited by Metformin in these individuals.
      This would open the door for the development of other antidiabetic drugs with antagonism of
      glucagon as their principal mechanism of action.

    <measure>Change in Glucagon-induced endogenous glucose production.</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at week 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the effect of Metformin on glucose metabolism, at baseline and during a period of hyperglucagonemia, endogenous glucose production will be measured using a stable isotope tracer during the application of a somatostatin-based pancreatic clamp. Participants will be assessed before and following two weeks of consuming either metformin or placebo.</description>

    <measure>Change in glucagon-induced alterations in whole body protein metabolism and resting energy expenditure.</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at week 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8</time_frame>
    <description>Alterations in whole body protein metabolism will be measured by using leucine as a tracer that measures leucine flux, and leucine transamination and oxidation as measures of leucine catabolism. Whole body oxygen consumption will be assessed by open circuit indirect calorimetry with a ventilated hood system. Skeletal muscle biopsies will be obtained at baseline and four hours after a high fat, high glycemic meal. Mitochondria will be isolated from the muscle samples to assess mitochondrial oxygen consumption and hydrogen peroxide emissions using high-resolution respirometry and spectrofluorometry, respectively. In addition, we will measure skeletal muscle intracellular AMP-activated protein kinase activity.</description>
