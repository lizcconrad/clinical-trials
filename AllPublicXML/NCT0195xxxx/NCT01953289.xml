    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the frequency of positive free fluid cultures in
      both perforated and non-perforated appendicitis. In addition predictors of positive free
      fluid cultures will be analyzed.

      Prior to surgery, all patients will receive antibioprophylaxis. In case of free peritoneal
      fluid, a sample is aspirated and sent for microbiology. A lavage with saline is not
      necessary. The decision to start postoperative antibiotic is left at the discretion of the
      surgeon. The decision to leave an abdominal drain is left at the discretion of the surgeon.

      The use of a preoperative single dose administration of antibiotics has been extensively
      studied and found beneficial in the prevention of SSI in appendicitis. However, the use of
      continued postoperative antibiotics has barely been studied. The sparse evidence that exist
      does not seem to support its systematic use. During appendectomy the surgeon frequently
      encounters turbid free fluid, even in non-perforated appendicitis. It is common practice in
      Belgium to continue antibiotic prophylaxis for 5 days after aspiration and lavage. Although
      the aspect often seems purulent, it is unknown in what percentage this fluid is contaminated.
      Also, it is unknown whether after aspiration and lavage intra-abdominal drains are necessary.
