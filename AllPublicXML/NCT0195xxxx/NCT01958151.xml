  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy is an outpatient procedure performed frequently as a screening test for diagnosis
      and treatment of a wide range of gastrointestinal problems. It is often viewed as an invasive
      procedure with the potential for embarrassment, discomfort, and worry. Such fears can result
      in anxiety that may decrease the tolerance and cooperation of the patient, limit the success
      of the procedure, and increase the likelihood of complications. Therefore, colonoscopy is
      frequently performed under sedation. The anxiety level of the patient before the procedure
      may increase the requirement for sedation. It is important for the anesthesiologist to
      predict the effective dosages of sedation before the procedure to ensure rapid and
      comfortable sedation as well as prompt recovery and discharge of the patient.

      This prospective cohort study is planned to evaluate the effects of pre-procedural anxiety
      level on the dose of propofol needed for patient and surgeon satisfaction during colonoscopy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients scheduled for elective colonoscopy for screening are enrolled. On the day of the
      procedure, demographic data are collected and all patients are asked to complete the
      Spielberger State-trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-I and STAI-II) in an isolated, calm room
      before being transferred to the procedure room.

      All patients are monitored with electrocardiogram, pulse oximetry, noninvasive blood pressure
      and bispectral index measurement at 5-min intervals.

      Oxygen is administered at 4 L/min via a face mask, Propofol 2% infusion is started via an
      effect-site target controlled infusion system (Marsh model).

      Once the patient reaches the desired level of sedation as determined by BIS value of 60, the
      procedure is started.

      This monitorization and sedation protocol is the routine management of outpatient
      colonoscopies and gastroscopies in our institution.

      For this study the patients' anxiety levels are evaluated with the STAI score. This is not an
      intervention but an evaluation of the patients. Drug dosing or sedation management are not
      adjusted according to the anxiety scores but are calculated with the patients' weight.

      During the procedure:

        -  hemodynamic parameters

        -  the total propofol dosage

        -  the number of TCI interventions

        -  complications (respiratory depression, need for ventilation, nausea, vomiting,
           laryngospasm, and agitation)

        -  the procedure duration

        -  surgeon satisfaction with sedation instrument scores are recorded.

      These collected data are studies to determine a correlation between the propofol dose and the
      pre-procedural anxiety of the patients.

    <time_frame>The anxiety of all patients is evaluated at the day of the procedure. The procedure is then performed under sedation. Once the procedure is ended and all patients are fully awake, study data are collected and patients are discharged home.</time_frame>
    <description>The sedation protocol applied in this study is our routin approach for all outpatient colonoscopies and endoscopies. All patients are informed about the procedures and monitorized (EKG, spO2, Bispectral index, blood pressure). After that, the sedation protocol is started and once the appropriate BIS value is reached the procedure is started. For this study all patients were asked to complete the STAI scores to evaluate the pre-procedural anxiety. This is not an intervention but an evaluation of the patients' anxiety. The primary outcome measure is to evaluate the dose of propofol used in each patient and to find out if there is a correlation between the pre-procedural anxiety and the dose of propofol.</description>
