  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of vintafolide alone compared
      to vintafolide plus paclitaxel and paclitaxel alone in participants with with 100% positive
      folate receptor (FR) triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).

      The primary hypothesis of this study is the vintafolide alone and/or vintafolide + paclitaxel
      will improve progression free survival (PFS) in participants with FR (100%) TNBC compared to
      paclitaxel alone.

      During the screening stage, participants will be required to have a diagnostic computed
      tomography (CT) scan with etarfolatide (EC20) to identify target lesions and determine
      eligibility for treatment. After successful screening, during the treatment stage,
      participants will receive study drug (vintafolide, vintafolide + paclitaxel, or paclitaxel)
      for approximately four 28-day cycles.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female with histologically or cytologically confirmed estrogen receptor negative,
             progesterone receptor negative, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2)

             chemotherapeutic regimens for breast cancer, which was administered for treatment of
