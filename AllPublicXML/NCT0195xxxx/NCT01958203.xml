      Study Title:Assessment of Adherence to Guidelines for Thromboprophylaxis in a Tertiary United
      Arab Emirates (UAE) hospital

      Study Site: Al Qassimi Hospital, United Arab Emirates

      Study Objectives:

      The primary objective of this study is assessment of appropriateness of VTE prophylaxis
      administered to critically ill and surgical patients for whom pharmacologic treatment is
      indicated according to the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) 2012 guidelines.

      The secondary objective is to:

      1.Identify some causes of inadequate VTE prophylaxis in different patient populations, such
      as prescribing problems and errors at the level of administration.

      Study Design: Cross sectional retrospective observational study

      Sample size: Approximately 400

      Study Population:

      Inclusion criteria

      Patients who meet the following criteria will be included:

        1. Patients aged 18 and above.

        2. Patients admitted to any of the critical care units, or the general or orthopaedic
           surgical wards.

        3. Patients who have been in hospital more than 24 hours.

        4. Caprini score &gt; 1 (see procedure)

      Exclusion criteria

      Patients with any of the following criteria will be excluded:

        1. Patients who have been admitted to a critical care unit and transferred out to a non
           surgical unit within 24 hours of admission.

        2. Patients receiving oral anticoagulant therapy for indications other than VTE prophylaxis
           or treatment, such as atrial fibrillation and prosthetic heart valves.

      Study Outcome Measurements:

      The main outcome measure of interest is to determine the proportion of patients who have
      received inappropriate or inadequate VTE prophylaxis considering their calculated risk factor
      compared to the recommended prophylactic measures for that risk.

      Secondary outcome measures are to identify whether there is inadequate VTE prophylaxis
      because of medication errors such as missed doses or wrong doses given.

      Study Duration: 4 months

      Statistical Analysis Data was entered into Microsoft Excel® and subsequently checked to
      ensure accurate data entry and correct any errors. It was subsequently exported into SPSS
      version 20 where it will be analysed.Quantitative data such as age was expressed mean (±
      standard deviation). Categorical data such as gender, risk factors for bleeding, type of
      mechanical and pharmacologic prophylaxis, missed doses and wrong doses were expressed as
      number and percentage of population.The student's t-test was used to analyse parametric data.
      The Pearson Chi-Square Test and Wilcoxon Rank sum test were used to analyse non parametric
      data. Simple and multiple logistic regression analysis was done to identify factors that are
      associated with inappropriate VTE prophylaxis. Factors that were included in the analysis
      included: age, type of admission (medical or surgical), area of admission (critical care,
      general surgery, orthopaedic surgery), Caprini score, and inappropriate VTE prophylaxis as
      the outcome. A p-value of less than 0.05 was be considered statistically significant.

        The targe sample is paients in critical care wards and orthopaedic surgery patients. All
        patients will be screened at discharge. Those who fulfill the inclusion/exclusion criteria
        will go on to have a thromboembolism risk assessment using the CapriniRisk Assessment
        Model. Those who have a score &gt; 1 will be included for assessment of their VTE prophylaxis
        (from medical records). Approximately 60 patients are admitted into critical care units and
        40 general and orthopaedic surgical patients are admitted to the surgical wards per month,
        giving a total sample of around 400 patients.
