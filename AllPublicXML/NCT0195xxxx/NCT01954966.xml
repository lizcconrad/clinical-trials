  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn whether a sex hormone called progesterone is helpful in
      reducing cigarette smoking and craving for cigarettes. This study also includes brain imaging
      to measure possible effects of progesterone on certain neurochemicals. These neurochemicals
      are called gamma-aminobutyric acid (or GABA for short) and glutamate. Both nicotine and
      progesterone affect these brain chemicals.

      Individuals wishing to participate in this study must be medically healthy men or women who
      smoke at least 10 cigarettes per day or greater. Participants must not suffer from a mental
      illness or use drugs other than nicotine and marijuana. Participants cannot have any
      implanted metallic devices such as pacemakers, orthodontic braces, or shrapnel. Participants
      must not have peanut allergies and must never have had a reaction to progesterone. Finally,
      participants cannot be taking any medications for anxiety, depression or insomnia.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Occipital Cortex GABA Pre and Post Placebo Administration</measure>
    <time_frame>Test Day #2 and Test Day #5 - 6 total scans over the period of 2-3 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Occipital cortex GABA and glutamate concentrations pre and post placebo administration. GABA and glutamate concentrations will be obtained using the non-invasive neuroimaging method of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) both before and after placebo administration and smoking abstinence. In total subjects will undergo 6 1H-MRS scans.
The 6 1H-MRS scans take place over a period of approximately 1-2 months. Each paradigm (placebo/progesterone) takes approximately one week, with an approximately two-week wash in between paradigms for men and an approximately 1-month wash in between paradigms for women. The subject will undergo a smoking session on Test Day #1 and Test Day #5, MRS scans are conducted on Test Day #2 (2 scans) and Test Day #5 (1 scan).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Symptoms during nicotine abstinence</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, on the day of scans, at each abstinence screening visit (4 times over a 2 day period between Test Day #2 and Test Day #5).</time_frame>
    <description>Withdrawal symptoms will be measured using the Nicotine Withdrawal Symptoms Checklist (NWSC). Craving will be assessed using the Brief Questionnaire on Smoking Urges (BQSU) and the Tiffany Questionnaire for Smoking Urges and mood will be assessed using a variety of ratings including the Profile of Mood States (POMS), the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and the Positive and Negative Affect Scales (PANAS). Effects of nicotine will be assessed using the Nicotine Effects Questionnaire (NEQ). Premenstrual syndrome symptoms will be assessed daily during the screening and study phases using the Daily Record of Severity of Problems (DRSP).</description>
