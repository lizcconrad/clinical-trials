    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter, randomized, open-label Phase II trial that compares reduced dose
      erlotinib 100mg daily and standard dose gefitinib 250mg daily in patients with advanced
      non-small cell lung cancer who harbor EGFR mutations. The primary endpoint is disease control
      rate (DCR) and the key secondary endpoint is progression free survival (PFS). A total of 224
      eligible patients will be randomized to receive either erlotinib 100mg daily or gefitinib
      250mg daily in a 1:1 ratio until patients experience disease progression. Independent
      assessment of the major endpoints will be completed in a treatment-blinded manner.
      Randomization will be stratified based on treatment-lines (first-line vs. maintenance vs.
      second-line therapy). Tumor response and progression will be assessed according to RECIST
      1.1.

                  times the institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) (if related to liver
                  metastases&lt;five times institutional ULN).
