  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Telemedicine (TM) offers an alternative titration procedure allowing the start of Duodopa
      infusion at home. The study evaluated the use of resources, measured as the number of
      contacts and time spent by health care professionals (Duodopa nurse specialists and the study
      Investigators) and the TM technician, during Duodopa infusion at home. Data was collected
      from four (4) clinical centers in Sweden. Data collection period for each participant started
      at the decision to administer Duodopa treatment (Baseline) and ended when the Duodopa
      titration period was complete. Post-titration, the participants and caregiver were
      interviewed and the investigators and nurses answered a web based questionnaire on their
      experiences.

        <description>Participant’s daily free time was a maximum 24 hours, and was defined as the time spent on activities (e.g. work, household, chores, leisure time, travel, sleep, etc.) other than time spent on health care professional (the DNS and the Investigator) communication, dose adjustments and pump handling. Time for dose adjustments, health care professional communication via TM and pump handling were subtracted from the amount of participant’s daily free time. The participant was asked to note the time used for independent dose adjustments and pump handling in a participant diary. Participant’s total free time was calculated as the sum of participant’s daily free time for all days during the titration period. Data are presented as time in minutes per participant with a minimum and maximum range.</description>

          <description>Participant’s daily free time was a maximum 24 hours, and was defined as the time spent on activities (e.g. work, household, chores, leisure time, travel, sleep, etc.) other than time spent on health care professional (the DNS and the Investigator) communication, dose adjustments and pump handling. Time for dose adjustments, health care professional communication via TM and pump handling were subtracted from the amount of participant’s daily free time. The participant was asked to note the time used for independent dose adjustments and pump handling in a participant diary. Participant’s total free time was calculated as the sum of participant’s daily free time for all days during the titration period. Data are presented as time in minutes per participant with a minimum and maximum range.</description>

        <title>Participant Experience of Duodopa Home Titration Using TM Assessed by Question Number 1: How Satisfied Were You With Using TM When Starting Duodopa?</title>
        <description>The experience of Duodopa home titration using TM was assessed using a sixteen item questionnaire via semi-structured interviews with the participant and caregiver (if applicable). The experience of Duodopa home titration using TM was measured by the participant on a scale from 1 to 7 for question number 1 (How satisfied were you with using TM when starting Duodopa?) where 1 was 'very dissatisfied' and 7 was 'very satisfied'. Data are presented as percentage of participants, calculated based on the number of participants in FAS with complete information.</description>

        <title>Positive Participant Experience of Duodopa Home Titration Using TM Assessed by Question Number 2: Did You do Things When at Home That You Could Not Have Done if You Were Hospitalized During the Titration?</title>
        <description>The experience of Duodopa home titration using TM was assessed using a sixteen item questionnaire via semi-structured interviews with the participant and caregiver (if applicable). The experience of Duodopa home titration using TM was measured by the participant as ‘yes’ or ‘no’ for question number 2 (Did you do things when at home that you could not have done if you were hospitalized during the titration?) where ‘yes’ indicated a positive answer. Data are presented as percentage of participants with positive experience, calculated based on the number of participants in FAS with complete information.</description>
        <time_frame>From Baseline (Investigator’s decision to start Duodopa treatment) until End of Titration (Investigator’s decision to terminate Duodopa treatment) or up to approximately 14 days</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis was performed using FAS with non-missing information.</population>

        <title>Participant Experience of Duodopa Home Titration Using TM Assessed by Question Number 9: How Satisfied Were You With the Technician’s Visits to Set up and Dismantle the TM Equipment?</title>
        <description>The experience of Duodopa home titration using TM was assessed using a sixteen item questionnaire via semi-structured interviews with the participant and caregiver (if applicable). The experience of Duodopa home titration using TM was measured by the participant on a scale from 1 to 7 for question number 9 (How satisfied were you with the technician’s visits to set up and dismantle the TM equipment?) where 1 was 'very dissatisfied' and 7 was 'very satisfied'. Data are presented as percentage of participants, calculated based on the number of participants in FAS with complete information.</description>
        <time_frame>From Baseline (Investigator’s decision to start Duodopa treatment) until End of Titration (Investigator’s decision to terminate Duodopa treatment) or up to approximately 14 days</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis was performed using FAS with non-missing information.</population>

        <title>Positive Participant Experience of Duodopa Home Titration Using TM Assessed by Question Number 12: Knowing What You Know Now, Would You Rather Have Stayed in the Hospital to Start Duodopa Treatment?</title>
        <description>The experience of Duodopa home titration using TM was assessed using a sixteen item questionnaire via semi-structured interviews with the participant and caregiver (if applicable). The experience of Duodopa home titration using TM was measured by the participant as ‘yes’ or ‘no’ for question number 12 (Knowing what you know now, would you rather have stayed in the hospital to start Duodopa treatment?) where ‘No’ indicated a positive answer. Data are presented as percentage of participants with positive experience, calculated based on the number of participants in FAS with complete information.</description>
        <time_frame>From Baseline (Investigator’s decision to start Duodopa treatment) until End of Titration (Investigator’s decision to terminate Duodopa treatment) or up to approximately 14 days</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis was performed using FAS with non-missing information.</population>

          <title>Positive Participant Experience of Duodopa Home Titration Using TM Assessed by Question Number 16 for Caregiver: Knowing What You Know Now, Would You Rather Have Had Your Spouse in the Hospital to Start Duodopa Treatment?</title>
          <description>From Baseline (Investigator’s decision to start Duodopa treatment) until End of Titration (Investigator’s decision to terminate Duodopa treatment) or up to approximately 14 days. The experience of Duodopa home titration using TM was measured by the caregiver as ‘yes’ or ‘no’ for question number 16 (knowing what you know now, would you rather have had your spouse in the hospital to start Duodopa treatment?) where ‘No’ indicated a positive answer. Data are presented as percentage of participants with positive experience, calculated based on the number of participants in FAS with complete information.</description>

        <title>Investigator and DNS Experience of Duodopa Home Titration Using TM Assessed by Question Number 3: How Satisfied Were You With Using TM for Clinical Assessments?</title>
        <description>The experience of Duodopa home titration using TM was assessed using multiple web-based questionnaires by the Investigator and the DNS. The experience of Duodopa home titration using TM was measured on a scale from 1 to 7 for question number 3 (How satisfied were you with using TM for clinical assessments?) where 1 was 'very dissatisfied' and 7 was 'very satisfied'. Data are presented as percentage of participants, calculated based on the number of participants in FAS with complete information.</description>
        <time_frame>From Baseline (Investigator’s decision to start Duodopa treatment) until End of Titration (Investigator’s decision to terminate Duodopa treatment) or up to approximately 14 days</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis was performed using FAS, defined as all participants that started Duodopa titration.</population>

        <title>Investigator and DNS Experience of Duodopa Home Titration Using TM Assessed by Question Number 5: How Satisfied Were You With the Sound Quality for Your Assessment of the Participant?</title>
        <description>The experience of Duodopa home titration using TM was assessed using multiple web-based questionnaires by the Investigator and the DNS. The experience of Duodopa home titration using TM was measured on a scale from 1 to 7 for question number 5 (How satisfied were you with the sound quality for your assessment of the participant?) where 1 was 'very dissatisfied' and 7 was 'very satisfied'. Data are presented as percentage of participants, calculated based on the number of participants in FAS with complete information.</description>
        <time_frame>From Baseline (Investigator’s decision to start Duodopa treatment) until End of Titration (Investigator’s decision to terminate Duodopa treatment) or up to approximately 14 days</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis was performed using FAS, defined as all participants that started Duodopa titration.</population>

        <title>Investigator and DNS Experience of Duodopa Home Titration Using TM Assessed by Question Number 7: How Satisfied Were You With the Setup and Maintenance of the TM Equipment?</title>
        <description>The experience of Duodopa home titration using TM was assessed using multiple web-based questionnaires by the Investigator and the DNS. The experience of Duodopa home titration using TM was measured on a scale from 1 to 7 for question number 7 (How satisfied were you with the setup and maintenance of the TM equipment?) where 1 was 'very dissatisfied' and 7 was 'very satisfied'. Data are presented as percentage of participants, calculated based on the number of participants in FAS with complete information.</description>
        <time_frame>From Baseline (Investigator’s decision to start Duodopa treatment) until End of Titration (Investigator’s decision to terminate Duodopa treatment) or up to approximately 14 days</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis was performed using FAS, defined as all participants that started Duodopa titration.</population>

        <title>Investigator and DNS Experience of Duodopa Home Titration Using TM Assessed by Question Number 9: How Satisfied Were You With the Participant Contact When Using TM?</title>
        <description>The experience of Duodopa home titration using TM was assessed using multiple web-based questionnaires by the Investigator and the DNS. The experience of Duodopa home titration using TM was measured on a scale from 1 to 7 for question number 9 (How satisfied were you with the participant contact when using TM?) where 1 was 'very dissatisfied' and 7 was 'very satisfied'. Data are presented as percentage of participants, calculated based on the number of participants in FAS with complete information.</description>
        <time_frame>From Baseline (Investigator’s decision to start Duodopa treatment) until End of Titration (Investigator’s decision to terminate Duodopa treatment) or up to approximately 14 days</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis was performed using FAS, defined as all participants that started Duodopa titration.</population>

        <title>Investigator and DNS Experience of Duodopa Home Titration Using TM Assessed by Question Number 12: Compared to Classic Titration at Hospital - How Much Time Did You Spend on TM Communication Based on Booked Communication Time for Participant Contact?</title>
        <description>The experience of Duodopa home titration using TM was assessed using multiple web-based questionnaires by the Investigator and the DNS. The experience of Duodopa home titration using TM was measured as ‘more’, ‘equal’ or ‘less’ for question number 12 (Compared to classic titration at hospital - how much time did you spend on TM communication based on booked communication time for participant contact?) where ‘more’ indicated the most negative answer and ‘less’ indicated the most positive answer. Data are presented as percentage of participants, calculated based on the number of participants in FAS with complete information.</description>
        <time_frame>From Baseline (Investigator’s decision to start Duodopa treatment) until End of Titration (Investigator’s decision to terminate Duodopa treatment) or up to approximately 14 days</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis was performed using FAS, defined as all participants that started Duodopa titration.</population>
