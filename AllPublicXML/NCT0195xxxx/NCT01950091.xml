  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nonspecific low back pain (NLBP) is the diagnosis for 85% of low back pain sufferers with no
      underlying medical cause (e.g., herniated disc, spinal stenosis) that requires physician
      care. Treatment, however, is impractical for many physicians to implement during office
      visits, and there are relatively few providers for NLBP treatment that follow national pain
      control guidelines. This study evaluated the efficacy of an on-line intervention using
      desktop computers or mobile technology to help users self treat NLBP occurrences and to
      engage in activities to decrease future occurences.

      Methods. A total of 606 adults, 18 years of age and older were recruited, screened, and
      consented online. They were assessed on-line at baseline, at two months weeks, and at four
      months After the baseline assessments, participants were randomized into NLBP treatment (TX),
      alternative website control (AWC), and no-contact control groups. The TX and AWC groups
      received 8 weekly emails prompt to visit their respective experimental websites.
