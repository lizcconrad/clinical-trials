  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric patients with sickle cell disease are at greater risk for exhibiting nocturnal
      enuresis (bedwetting) compared to the general population. This increased risk has been
      attributed to a decreased ability to concentrate urine caused by sickling-induced
      nephropathy. The sociodemographic, psychosocial, and medical factors associated with
      nocturnal enuresis are not well defined. In addition, the impact of these behaviors on
      emotional and behavioral functioning, along with health-related quality of life are not
      clear. Despite the availability of evidence-based interventions for nocturnal enuresis, very
      few families with a child with sickle cell disease have utilized these methods. The reasons
      for this underutilization of interventions are not clear.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: To examine differences between those who do and those who do not exhibit
      nocturnal enuresis in regard to health-related quality of life, emotional and behavioral
      functioning, family functioning, stressful life events, sociodemographic factors and medical
      factors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE: To identify barriers to intervention implementation for nocturnal
      enuresis.

      In this study, children and adolescents with sickle cell disease ages 6-18 years and their
      parents/guardians will each complete an interview with questionnaires assessing nocturnal
      enuresis, health-related quality of life, emotional and behavioral functioning, family
      functioning, and stressful life events. Participants who report nocturnal enuresis will
      identify interventions they have used in the past, along with barriers to intervention
      implementation.

      The future goal will be to use this information to develop an effective intervention strategy
      for nocturnal enuresis specific to the needs of children and adolescents with sickle cell
      disease.

    <description>Health-related quality of life, emotional and behavioral functioning, family functioning, stressful life events, sociodemographic factors and medical factors will be examined from questionnaire responses. Classification will be based on the criteria outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, text revision (DSM-IV-TR). Data will be stratified by age (6-11 years and 12-18 years) and genotype (HbSS/ HbSβ0 thalassemia and HbSC/ HbSβ+ thalassemia). The sample will be dichotomized using the binary response (by nocturnal enuresis/no nocturnal enuresis). Pearson's chi-square or Fisher's Exact test for categorical data and the two-sample t-test for continuous data will be performed to examine the group differences. Logistic regression will be performed using the binary response to examine the effect of these factors with covariates selected by Bayesian information criterion (BIC) with age group indicator and genotype included in the regression.</description>
