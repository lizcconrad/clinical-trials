  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to learn the opinion of patients and their caregiving
      about a couple-based Hatha Yoga program during treatment for cancer. Researchers also want to
      learn the effect of this program on lung function, distress, and quality of life.

      If you agree to take part, your medical history and demographic information (such as your
      age, sex, and race) will be recorded. By signing this consent, you also agree that your
      caregiving partner will be approached to take part in this study.

      Questionnaires:

      You will complete about 10 questionnaires before your first radiation treatment and again
      after you complete your treatment schedule (usually 6 weeks later). The questionnaires ask
      about your health, any symptoms you may be having, your mood, your level of fatigue, your
      sleeping habits, your relationship, and your quality of life. It should take about 45 minutes
      to complete these questionnaires.

      You will complete about 5 questionnaires again halfway through your radiation treatment
      schedule. These questionnaires ask about your quality of life. These should take about 20
      minutes to complete.

      During each week of radiation therapy, you will also complete a questionnaire asking your
      feelings about the Hatha Yoga sessions. You will be asked to list what you liked or disliked,
      what you found most and least useful, and how you would rate the instructor. You will also be
      asked about how often you practice outside of class and if you think you are benefitting from
      the Hatha Yoga program. It should take about 5 minutes to answer this questionnaire. Your
      answers to the questions will not be shared with your caregiving partner.

      Hatha Yoga Sessions:

      You will take part in up to 18 sessions of Hatha yoga over the course of radiation therapy.
      Each 45- to 60-minute session will be guided by an instructor. You should attend each session
      together as a couple.

      During the yoga sessions, you will be asked to do deep-breathing exercises and perform
      different stretching and movement exercises. The movements are designed not to be difficult,
      and you will sit on the floor or in a chair while you do them. You can move through the
      exercises at your own pace. The instructor will be available to answer any questions you may
      have about the practice of Hatha yoga. Most of the yoga sessions may be videotaped. This is
      so the researchers can keep track of the quality of the sessions. Only the study staff will
      be able to view this videotape. The video files are digital and will be deleted after all the
      data are studied.

      At your first session, you will be given a CD and instructions for practicing Hatha yoga at
      home. While you are receiving radiation therapy, you will be asked to practice at home 1 time
      a day either with your caregiving partner or alone on the days you do not have a session at
      the clinic.

      Length of Study:

      Your participation on this study will be over when you have completed the questionnaires
      during your last week of radiation therapy.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 15 patients and their caregiving partners, for a total of 30 participants, will take
      part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
