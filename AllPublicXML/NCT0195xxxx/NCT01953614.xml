  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the abundance of theories concerning the effects of chiropractic adjustments on brain
      function, this remains an understudies area for the profession.

      Quantitative Electroencephalography (qEEG)is a technique that allows for an in-depth analysis
      of brain function. A normative database will be used to compare before, during and after
      effects of chiropractic adjustments on brain function. This will include usage of Low
      Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography (LORETA).

      This study seeks to objectively document effects of chiropractic adjustments on brain
      function.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in quantitative EEG values as compared to a normative database</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, during adjustment, after adjustment, follow up in 7 days</time_frame>
    <description>There will be a baseline measurement. There will be measurements during the adjustment. There will be measurements immediately after the adjustment. There will be measurements 7 days after the adjustment.
Data will then be analyzed comparing values to a normative database. This database is adjusted for age. This will generate z-score values in addition to raw EEG values. Statistical analysis of P-values will then be run to test significance of changes.</description>

    <description>Subject will be asked to complete the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment. This assessment asks questions about subjects adaptive and maladaptive functioning. This information is comparing the subject to other people their age.</description>

    <description>Ten people. Participants will receive what appears to be a chiropractic adjustment but which actually is not. This is the sham adjustment. Participants will also fill out Achenbach questionnaire. There will be a follow up in 7 days.</description>
