  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Whether preoperative transarterial chemoembolization can prolong survival for the resectable
      hepatocellular carcinoma remains controversial, particularly in patients with portal vein
      tumor thrombi. This study designs to systematically identify and summarize the effect of
      preoperative TACE for resectable HCC with portal venous invasion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With various improvements in interventional radiology, since the 2005 practice guidelines
      issued by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases , transcatheter arterial
      chemoembolization has become one of the available locoregional therapies for HCC.
      Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization, which generally performed in intermediate-stage HCC
      patients, involves injection of an embolizing agent into the hepatic artery to deprive the
      tumor of its major nutrient source via embolization of the nutrient artery, resulting in
      ischemic necrosis of the tumor. To prevent intrahepatic recurrence due to portal vein
      invasion of the HCC tumor, therapeutic strategies such as preoperative TACE, and
      postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy have been tried. According to the latest and the most
      powerful evidence, however, preoperative TACE is not routinely recommended for patients
      undergoing hepatectomy to treat resectable HCC , and TACE may delay surgical treatment or
      decrease the resection volume of the liver, or it also may create a missed opportunity for
      surgical treatment.

      Rather than subject all these patients to such an invasive procedure and put them at risk for
      missing opportunity for surgical treatment, it may be better to select optimal candidates to
      receive surgical resection. Recent studies have even shown favorable long-term survival
      outcomes of HR in well-selected cases of HCC with PVTT. About whether preoperative
      transarterial chemoembolization is available for the resectable hepatocellular carcinoma with
      portal vein tumor thrombi, so far, has hardly been reported.
