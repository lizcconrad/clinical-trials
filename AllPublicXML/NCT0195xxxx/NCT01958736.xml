    <textblock>
      This pilot study intends to evaluate whether stroke patients can complete ballistic strength
      exercises for thirty minutes, three times per week over a six week training period in
      addition to their existing rehabilitation program.

      It will evaluate whether using ballistic training principles, is superior in improving
      mobility compared with usual care exercises to improve mobility and leg strength in stroke
      patients.

      In this study there will be 15 participants per group, a total of 30 participants. The
      control group will receive usual care consistent with existing rehabilitation practice and
      literature. The experimental group will perform task specific strength training in a
      ballistic fashion.

      Research Aims:

        1. To establish the feasibility of ballistic strength training in stroke and

        2. To evaluate the effects of ballistic strength training exercises on mobility outcomes,
           strength and quality of life when compared with usual care.

      Methods:

      This wil be a prospective, randomized, controlled, assessor-blinded pilot study. It will be
      conducted 3 x per week for 6 weeks (i.e. a total of 18 sessions lasting 30 minutes).

        -  Recruitment

        -  Retention/Attrition

      Secondary outcome measures - measured at baseline and completion

        -  Ten metre walk test (10MWT) comfortable pace

        -  10MWT maximum safe pace

        -  High level mobility assessment tool (HiMAT): Only in participants where 10MWT is &lt;12.5s
           at baseline

      Description of intervention:

      Control Group:

      The control group will complete a suite of exercises based upon existing rehabilitation
      practices that aim to improve mobility after stroke. The supervising physiotherapist will
      select and progress the exercises, recording the performance of exercises in an exercise log
      and detailing incidence of adverse events. Exercise selection will include: gait retraining,
      cardiovascular fitness, lower limb strengthening, static and dynamic balance

      Experimental group:

      The experimental group will complete jump squats on the leg sled, single leg toe push offs
      (or bilateral where unable to complete single), alternating legs (i.e. bounding), mini tramp
      jumping, progressing to jogging, quick hip flexion and bounding on land.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>10 metre walk test comfortable pace</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be measured at comfortable gait speed. The middle 10metres of a 14 metre track will be recorded. The participant will be asked to walk at their own comfortable speed. There will be a cone at the start and finish of the 14metre track to guide participants and the middle 10 metres will be recorded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>10 metre walk test, maximum safe pace</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Same set-up as 10MWT comfortable pace, however the participant will be asked to walk as fast as they safely can without breaking into a run.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>High level mobility assessment tool (HiMAT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The HiMAT is a 13 item assessment tool designed to assess high level walking tasks, the ability to negotiate stairs and the ability to run, hop, skip and jump. The HiMAT will be used to evaluate performance for higher level participants in the study where their 10MWT result may have a ceiling effect (where participants complete 10MWT in under 12.5seconds).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed up and go test (TUG)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The TUG is highly reliable in stroke populations and correlates with walking performance and incidence of falls. Participants will be measured on the TUG from a 45cm chair. The will be asked to complete the test at their own comfortable speed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Ambulation Category (FAC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The FAC is a simple tool which uses an ordinal scale of 1 to 6 to measure the level of assistance a person requires to walk, and the different types of terrain they can manage such as indoors vs. outdoors, slopes and inclines.</description>

    <measure>Assessment of quality of life 4D</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Health related quality of Life will be measured using the Assessment of quality of life 4D. This has been shown to be a valid and sensitive measure in stroke, and has been used to determine the effects of mobility on HRQoL in neurological populations.</description>
