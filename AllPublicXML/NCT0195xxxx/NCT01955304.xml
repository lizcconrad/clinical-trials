      This study will determine the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single dose of
      4mg fruquintinib in normal healthy subjects.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be an open-label, randomized, two-period, crossover PK food effect study of
      fruquintinib administered orally at 4mg. Subjects will be screened for eligibility up to 14
      days prior to entry into the study.

      For each of 2 study periods, subjects will be admitted to the clinical research unit (CRU) on
      the day before dosing and fast overnight (approximately 10 hours). On the morning of dosing
      for each of the 2 study periods, subjects will receive a single oral dose of 4 mg
      fruquintinib in either the fasted or fed state. Subjects will remain at the CRU for at least
      120 hours after administration of study drug for collection of serial blood samples for
      pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis and safety monitoring. Subjects will return to the CRU for
      safety assessment for up to 336 hours postdose.
