  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterized clinically by abnormalities of both
      upper motor neurons (UMN) and lower motor neurons (LMN). The presence of UMN signs is not
      always easy to establish. The only technique used in routine to assess the corticospinal
      dysfunctions is based on transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). However, this technique is
      largely dependent on LMN state and is based on artificial motor cortex activation.

      The main objective of our study project is to evaluate a new method assessing functional
      changes in motor system in ALS patients. By using cortico-muscular and cortico-cortical
      coherences, it could be possible to show modifications in both cortico-muscular relationship
      and in cortical activity coordination which could be related to clinical state in ALS
      patients. We notably expect a decrease in cortico-muscular coherence in ALS patients.
      Furthermore, these analyses could provide new insights in motor system plasticity phenomena.
      We expect a partial covering of voluntary motor command by cortical areas adjacent to primary
      motor cortex. Lastly, the hypothesis that an increased proportion of voluntary motor control
      may be assumed by ipsilateral corticospinal tract could be tested by coherence analyses.

      Coherence analysis might be a useful method to detect corticospinal tract dysfunctions. This
      method has the advantage to be painless and not to use artificial stimulations as it is used
      in TMS.
