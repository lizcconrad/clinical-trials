      To evaluate if somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) and motor evoked potentials (MEPs)
      obtained with electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) can be used to detect
      changes in cortical plasticity in responders to a single IV infusion of ketamine as compared
      to non-responders.

      This study will be conducted in patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and divided
      into 2 sequential cohorts. Cohort 1 will be conducted in 12 patients at a single center. For
      each patient, there will be up to 4 sequential phases: a screening phase of up to 6 weeks, an
      open-label treatment phase of up to 4 weeks, an optional open-label treatment phase of up to
      1 week, and a follow-up phase of up to 1 week (if applicable). Cohort 2 will be conducted in
      20 patients and will be a multicenter, double-blind (neither physician nor patient knows the
      treatment that the patient receives), randomized (the study drug is assigned by chance),
      placebo-controlled (an inactive substance that is compared with a drug to test whether the
      drug has a real effect in a clinical trial) design. For each patient, there will be up to 4
      sequential phases: a screening phase of up to 6 weeks, a double-blind treatment phase of up
      to 4 weeks, an optional open-label treatment phase of up to 1 week, and a follow-up phase of
      up to 1 week (if applicable). The total study duration for each patient will be maximally
      about 12 weeks. Participant safety will be monitored throughout the study.

    <measure>Comparison of Ketamine Responders and Ketamine Non-responders in the Change From Baseline in Somatosensory Evoked Potential (SEPs) Amplitudes at 4 Hours Postdose on Day 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 1 (4 hours postdose)</time_frame>
    <description>SEPs are the electrical signals generated by the nervous system in response to somatosensory stimuli - typically through electrical stimulation of the median nerve. SEPs are read on the skull with electroencephalography (EEG). SEPs was recorded using a 64-channel EEG system at baseline (predose) and regularly after study drug administration. The change from baseline was calculated as post-baseline value minus baseline value for each participant. Since the number of participants at baseline differ from the number of participants at post-baseline measure (that is [i.e.] not all baseline values are paired), the mean change is not equal to the difference between the means at the two time points.</description>

    <measure>Comparison of Ketamine Responders and Ketamine Non-responders in the Change From Baseline in Motor Evoked Potential (MEPs) Amplitudes at 4 Hours Postdose on Day 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 1 (4 hours postdose)</time_frame>
    <description>MEPs are generated when stimulation of the brain on the motor cortex (with Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation [TMS]) causes the spinal cord and peripheral muscles to produce neuroelectrical signals. MEPs are typically measured in the hand muscles. The Motor Evoked Response to Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS MEPs) was evaluated at baseline and regularly after study drug administration. Intracortical inhibition and facilitation was also evaluated using TMS. A figure-of-eight coil with external loop diameters of 9 cm was used to elicit motor responses in the contralateral first dorsal interosseus.</description>

        <title>Comparison of Ketamine Responders and Ketamine Non-responders in the Change From Baseline in Motor Evoked Potential (MEPs) Amplitudes at 4 Hours Postdose on Day 1</title>
        <description>MEPs are generated when stimulation of the brain on the motor cortex (with Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation [TMS]) causes the spinal cord and peripheral muscles to produce neuroelectrical signals. MEPs are typically measured in the hand muscles. The Motor Evoked Response to Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS MEPs) was evaluated at baseline and regularly after study drug administration. Intracortical inhibition and facilitation was also evaluated using TMS. A figure-of-eight coil with external loop diameters of 9 cm was used to elicit motor responses in the contralateral first dorsal interosseus.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and Day 1 (4 hours postdose)</time_frame>
        <population>Efficacy analysis set included all participants who received a dose of ketamine and who had at least 1 postbaseline value of MEP.</population>
