      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of 5-fluorouracil + Mitomycin for the
      patients with pulmonary metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma who had progressive disease
      with sorafenib.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Extrahepatic metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma has recently been paradoxically
      increasing due to increased survival with effective locoregional therapies. Sorafenib is the
      first systemic agent that has demonstrated a significant survival benefit in patients with
      advanced HCC; however, the modest improvement of 3 months is far from satisfactory. There is
      no convincing evidence, to date, that systemic chemotherapy when tumor progresses after
      sorafenib therapy improves overall survival. The combination of anticancer agents is
      important to achieve favourable clinical results. For patients with metastatic liver cancer
      or HCC, some studies have discussed the effectiveness of 5-fluorouracil/mitomycin(FM).
      However, few studies have examined the actual FM regimen for HCC.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of 5-fluorouracil/mitomycin for the
      patients with pulmonary metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma who had progressive disease
      with sorafenib.
