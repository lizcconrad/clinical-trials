  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a complex systemic disease that mainly involves the respiratory and
      gastrointestinal (GI) tracts. The polymicrobial community composition of respiratory and GI
      tracts is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Children with CF may harbor
      an abnormal intestinal microflora, because of altered cystic fibrosis transmembrane
      conductance regulator (CFTR) function and heavy drug load (antibiotics, pancreatic enzymes
      and acid suppressors). The investigators have previously demonstrated that intestinal
      inflammation is highly frequent in CF children, being a major feature of intestinal
      involvement. In addition, specific probiotics significantly improved airway and GI
      inflammation in a preliminary trial. The investigators aim to characterize intestinal and
      respiratory microflora in CF patients and to investigate the effects of daily Lactobacillus
      GG (LGG) supplementation on both GI and airway microflora and the eventual relationship
      between probiotic assumption and clinical and inflammation markers. The investigators aim is
      to eventually improve the quality of life of CF patients, who often suffer from intestinal
      and respiratory progressive disease, through a non invasive intervention consisting in the
      supplementation of probiotic bacteria.
