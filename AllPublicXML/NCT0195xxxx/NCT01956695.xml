  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Because Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL) are mainly diffuse large B-cell
      lymphoma of the activated B cells (ABC) type, the investigators hypothesize that the synergy
      of lenalidomide with rituximab shown in systemic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) could be
      observed in PCNSL.

      This study will assess the efficiency of the the combination of lenalidomide and rituximab in
      relapsed/refractory PCNSL, and the efficiency of a maintenance treatment with lenalidomide
      alone in maintaining the response.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators use a two-stage Fleming's design based on the following hypotheses under
      treatment: 10% (null hypothesis, minimal clinical benefit rate), 30% (alternative hypothesis,
      acceptable clinical benefit rate), 3% type I error rate, 5% type II error rate. Under these
      hypotheses, a total of 45 assessable patients will be necessary: 22 for the first stage + 23
      for the second stage.

      Stage 1: following the inclusion of the first 22 assessable patients, if 0 or 1 patient has
      an objective response (CR, Complete Response + uCR, unconfirmed Complete Response + PR,
      Partial Response) at the end of induction treatment, the study would be terminated early and
      the treatment will be considered ineffective. If 2 or more patients have an objective
      response at the end of induction treatment, then the treatment will be considered as
      effective in this indication. Otherwise, the second group of 23 patients will be recruited.

      Stage 2: if at the end of recruitment, 8 or less patients have an objective response, the
      investigators will conclude to inefficacy, and if 9 or more patients have an objective
      response, then the treatment will be considered as effective and need further exploration.
