  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mesquida, J et al showed there was a significant linear correlation between pulse pressure
      variations under tidal volume 6 ml/kg and 8 ml/kg in patients after the resuscitation phase
      of severe sepsis and septic shock. No study revealed the actual relationship between various
      PPV under different VT. So we hypothesized that there were relationship between various PPV
      in different tidal volume settings. The objective of this study was to examine the
      relationship between various PPV.
