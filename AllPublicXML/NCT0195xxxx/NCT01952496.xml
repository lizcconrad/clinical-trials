  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to design and validate a force-measuring platform that will
      measure the magnitude and duration of the load experienced by the lower extremities of
      individuals with a neuromuscular disability who use a stationary assisted standing device to
      increase their Bone Mineral Density.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-ambulatory children with a neuromuscular disability are at significant risk for poor bone
      health as reflected by low bone mineral density (BMD) and increased propensity to fracture.
      In large part, this is due to abnormally low levels of load experienced by the skeleton. A
      common approach for increasing BMD is to stimulate the musculoskeletal system by increasing
      the amount and duration of weight-bearing in the lower extremities. For non-ambulatory
      individuals, this typically takes the form of using an assisted standing device to enable the
      child to spend time in a standing position so that their lower limbs can experience some
      degree of body weight. Some of these physical interventions result in varying degrees of
      improvement in BMD, and some do not. This lack of clarity in outcomes may result from a
      failure to objectively measure the magnitude and duration of the load experienced by the
      lower extremities. A lack of change in BMD may be due to the extremities experiencing only a
      fraction of the body weight due to load-sharing with the assistive device, or to an
      inadequate duration of standing time. The goal of this project will be to design and validate
      a force-measuring platform that will measure the magnitude and duration of the load
      experienced by the lower extremities of individuals with a neuromuscular disability who use a
      stationary assisted standing device to increase their BMD.

    <measure>Caregiver Priorities &amp; Child Health Index of Life with Disabilities (CPCHILD) questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The CPCHILDÂ© measures caregivers' perspectives on the health status, comfort, well being, functional abilities and ease of caregiving of children with severe developmental disabilities. It was developed to measure the effectiveness of interventions intended to improve or preserve these outcomes for children with severe disabilities, including non-ambulant children with severe cerebral palsy, and traumatic or other acquired brain injuries. This will help determine if care-givers perception of health status changes with changes in standing magnitude and duration.</description>
