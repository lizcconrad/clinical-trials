  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke associated pneumonia (SAP) affects a fifth of stroke survivors annually, tripling the
      risk of death at 30 days and contributing to poorer rehabilitation outcomes, prolonged
      hospital stays and dependency at discharge. Systematic review evidence indicates that
      enhanced oral health care (OHC) has a preventative effect on the incidence of pneumonia
      amongst nursing home populations (absolute risk reductions 6.6% to 11.7%; numbers needed to
      treat 8.6 to 15.3 individuals). There are strong theoretical reasons to suggest similar
      benefits might be observed in stroke care settings but current empirical evidence is weak -
      trial quality (randomisation, blinding, sample size, reporting), intervention description and
      thus feasibility of translation into clinical practice is very poor. Following an extensive
      pre-clinical programme of work, investigators now plan the pilot phase (Phase II) of a
      stepped-wedge cluster RCT of a well-developed and defined complex OHC intervention versus
      usual OHC. Investigators aim to establish a robust web-based randomisation process, refine
      the proposed intervention (training, tools, equipment), recruitment, adherence, record
      linkage and sampling methodologies. Investigators also aim to establish the relationship
      between SAP and plaque and any diversity between sites.

      SOCLE II is the pilot phase (Phase II) of a stepped-wedge cluster randomised controlled trial
      (RCT) of a complex oral health care (OHC) intervention versus usual OHC.

      SOCLE II aims to evaluate the feasibility of a full scale pragmatic trial of the clinical and
      cost effectiveness of a complex OHC package of care versus usual care for people in stroke
      care settings. Ward level cluster randomisation will progress in a stepped wedge manner where
      after a period of baseline data collection each ward in a randomly allocated order will
      'convert' from usual care to an enhanced oral health care intervention.

      This pilot trial will assess the feasibility of delivering this enhanced OHC intervention
      across four sites and will inform the trial design of a full scale phase III trial including
      refining the proposed intervention (training, tools, equipment), recruitment, adherence,
      record linkage, sampling methodologies, sample size calculations and pilot our health
      economic evaluation. Investigators also aim to establish the relationship between SAP and
      plaque and any diversity between sites. Our proposed pilot work will support an application
      for a planned Phase III definitive trial.

      Principal Research Questions:

      (i) Are the SOCLE intervention and data collection process viable across multiple sites? (ii)
      Can sample size calculations and estimates of recruitment and retention be refined? (iii) Can
      pneumonia event rates across several sites and distribution over time post stroke onset be
      determined? (iv) Can the association between dental and denture plaque and SAP be
      established? (v) Can the predetermined criteria for progression to Phase III definitive
      multi-centred stepped wedge cluster RCT with economic evaluation be met?

    <description>Oral health care (OHC) will be provided in the standard manner, with no change to usual care.
Provision of this standard OHC will be sampled monthly. Surveys suggest that standard oral health care (OHC) in stroke care settings comprise poorly supported OHC interventions delivered by staff that lacked access to specialist training, products, equipment, assessments, protocols and dental services.</description>

    <description>Our proposed complex oral health care (OHC) intervention (SOCLE intervention) comprises 3 levels of intervention:
Patient Level: An individualised OHC assessment on admission and individualised OHC plans for patients, which may involve staff-led OHC support, access to OHC equipment, products and specialist support services and OHC health promotion components.
Staff Level: Specialist web-based OHC educational training, including information on the oral cavity and structures; oral health problems (e.g. decay, gum disease, dry mouth); instruction on OHC techniques, equipment and products; use of the SOCLE assessment and protocol tools.
Service Level: Processes to facilitate access to specialist dental support services (e.g. dentist, hygienist, denture repair laboratory). Essential OHC equipment (toothbrushes, denture marking kits) and products (e.g. toothpaste, oral balance gel) on the ward will be available.</description>
