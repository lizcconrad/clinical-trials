      The overall aim of this study is to determine the optimal dose, 3-session exposure
      intervention versus 1-session exposure intervention compared to no treatment, for the
      delivery of exposure therapy in the immediate aftermath of trauma for preventing the
      development of posttraumatic stress disorder.

      The precipitant for adult posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a known event, which allows
      for immediate intervention and presents the potential to prevent the occurrence of this
      serious condition. However, there currently are no accepted interventions for the early
      intervention and prevention of PTSD in the immediate aftermath of trauma. This study will
      determine whether providing exposure therapy to people who have recently experienced trauma
      will significantly reduce the severity of PTSD symptoms post-trauma and if delivery of three
      exposure sessions will result in larger reductions in the symptoms of PTSD post-trauma than
      one exposure session. This study will also examine predictors for treatment response.

      Participation in this study will last 12 months. Participants will first undergo an
      evaluation session that will include an interview and questionnaires. They will then be
      randomly assigned to one of the following three conditions: 1-session exposure therapy,
      3-session exposure therapy, or assessment only. Participants receiving 1-session exposure
      therapy will complete one treatment session in the emergency department (ED). Participants
      receiving 3-session exposure therapy will complete three weekly treatment sessions, with the
      first occurring in the ED. Treatment will involve reviewing memories of a recent trauma out
      loud with a therapist and audio-recording these discussions for review at home. All
      participants will undergo assessments 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the initial evaluation
      session.
