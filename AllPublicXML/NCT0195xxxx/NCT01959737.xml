  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The first hours after birth are a sensitive period for promotion of optimal
      mother-child-interaction and secure attachment. Maternal sensitivity and responsivness are
      high in the first hours after birth due to high oxytocin levels. Developing optimal
      mother-child-interaction is more difficult for preterm mothers because mother and child are
      separated after birth and the preterm infant is not able to show strong signs to promote
      maternal sensitivity. We hypothesize that promoting skin-to-skin contact of VLBW infants and
      their mothers for 60 minutes within the first hours after birth improves
      mother-child-interaction at 5 to 6 months corrected age. We also hypothesize that reactivity
      of HPA axis and molecular patterns of stress signaling pathways differ in preterm infant with
      or without SSC after birth.

At the infants corrected age of 4 to 6 months a videotape of the mother changing the infants diapers and playing with the infant is used for analysis.</description>
