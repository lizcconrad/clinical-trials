      <textblock>
        Subjects will be eligible for the study if they meet the following inclusion criteria:

          1. Cirrhosis. Diagnosis of cirrhosis will be based on either liver biopsy OR clinical
             characteristics (e.g. history of ascites or encephalopathy or esophageal varices or
             gastric varices or splenomegaly or spider angioma or any clinical sign of portal
             hypertension/cirrhosis), laboratory (e.g. history of thrombocytopenia or history of
             APRI (Reference: Wai CT, Greenson JK, Fontana RJ, Kalbfleisch JD, Marrero JA,
             Conjeevaram HS, Lok AS. A simple noninvasive index can predict both significant
             fibrosis and cirrhosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Hepatology
