  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a motor neuron disease characterized by progressive
      degeneration of motor neurons, muscle atrophy and paralysis. There is no reliable early
      diagnostic test for ALS, making identification of the disease difficult at its earliest
      stages. Early detection is critical to the initiation of early neuroprotective therapy. By
      the time a reliable diagnosis can be made, substantial damage to motor neurons and muscle has
      already occurred. The purpose of the current project is to establish a bank of blood samples
      (serum and protein/RNA/DNA from blood cells) and CSF for use in the development of an early
      diagnostic test for ALS and for better understanding the progression of this disease. The
      main idea of the current study is to examine samples from patients that have a suspected
      diagnosis of motor neuron disease, including patients with ALS who have not progressed far
      enough to be definitively diagnosed as having ALS. Normal and disease control samples will be
      collected for comparison. The investigators will examine various biochemical and metabolic
      markers from these samples, in hopes of finding differences in their expression between
      control subjects and ALS patients and during disease progression. Ultimately, the
      investigators would like to have a panel of markers from the blood that would allow us to
      diagnose and follow the progression of ALS from the earliest possible moment. The data
      collected from this project would give us a basis for a fairly non-invasive, quick and
      clinically relevant test for the early diagnosis of ALS. This in turn would allow us to
      provide earlier intervention for these patients, possibly slowing the damage and improving
      prognosis.
