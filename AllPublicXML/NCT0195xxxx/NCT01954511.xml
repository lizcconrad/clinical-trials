    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of a manual therapy and exercise
      program, focused on the rehabilitation of cervical function, on clinical signs and mandibular
      function in subjects with TMD.

      Temporomandibular disorder (TMD) is a general term that refers to disorders associated with
      the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and the masticatory muscles. Among the main symptoms are
      pre-auricular pain (in the region of the TMJ) and/or pain in the masticatory muscles.

      It's usual to observe that subjects with TMD also present cervical alteration. Beside this,
      cervical postural alterations produced by muscle tension can influence mandibular position.

      The intervention protocol was based on manual therapy, stabilization exercises and
      stretching.

      The technique are:.

        1. Upper cervical flexion mobilization;

        2. C5 central posterior-anterior mobilization;

        3. Stabilization exercise: Cranio-cervical flexor stabilization exercise

        4. Stretching of muscles: upper trapezius, scalenes, semispinalis capitis; splenius
           capitis, sternocleidomastoid

    <description>The clinical signs was based on Research Diagnostic Criteria protocol and it was measured maximum mouth opening pain free using a caliper ((Somet, 150mm, Inox, Czechoslovakia)</description>

    <measure>Changing of Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and 5 days follow-up intervetion</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate pain it was applied a scale from Research Diagnostic Criteria protocol, that consists of a line scored from 0 to 10, where 0 represents no pain and 10 the worst pain that the subject has experienced, allowing it to check the number that features their pain at the moment.</description>

    <description>The patient was supine with the cervical spine in a neutral position. The therapist brought about a contact of the occipital bone with the ﬁrst ﬁnger and medial aspect of the hand, and other hand over the frontal region of the patient's head. The mobilizing force was delivered by ﬂexing the upper cervical region using a combination of cephalic traction with the occipital hand and caudal pressure with the frontal hand. This technique was applied for 10 minutes</description>

    <description>The patient was prone with the cervical spine in a neutral position. The therapist placed the tips of his thumbs on the posterior surface of the C5 spinous process, while the other ﬁngers rested gently around the patients' neck. This technique was applied for 9 minutes</description>
