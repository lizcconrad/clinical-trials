  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose a pilot study to assess safety and benefit of renal artery ablation at the time of
      planned atrial fibrillation ablation.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Symptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF) refractory to anti-arrhythmic drugs is commonly treated
      with ablation therapy. Pulmonary vein isolation along with additional substrate medication is
      commonly performed during ablation procedures is associated with 60-80% success rate for
      maintenance of sinus rhythm. After AF ablation hypertension (HTN) is a strong predictor for
      recurrence of atrial fibrillation. Drug resistant hypertension can be effectively treated
      with catheter based renal denervation therapy. Our primary hypothesis is concomitant renal
      denervation therapy along with AF ablation is associated with improvement in success rates of
      AF ablation along with adequate control of blood pressure. The specific objectives of this
      study are to prospectively compare success rates, time to AF recurrence, AF burden and blood
      pressure controls in patients randomized to concomitant renal denervation arm when compared
      to patients with AF ablation alone.

    <description>After 3 months of blanking period, time to recurrence of atrial arrhythmia lasting more than 30 seconds is measured during follow up. (Atrial fibrillation)AF burden is assessed on a 7 day duration event monitor. Electrocardiogram (EKG) or Event monitor strips will be evaluated by independent board certified physicians.</description>

    <description>Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) is performed as per operator preference by previously described techniques. Both mapping and ablation are performed under general anesthesia. The use of standard electrophysiology ablation catheter to perform renal artery ablation in hypertensive patients has been previously described. UP to 2 minutes of RF energy (10W with irrigation flow of 17 ml/min) are delivered at each location and up to 6 lesions for each artery on the longitudinal and rotational axis. Renal denervation is performed on both vascular pedicles after clinical AF ablation in patients assigned to the intervention arm.</description>
