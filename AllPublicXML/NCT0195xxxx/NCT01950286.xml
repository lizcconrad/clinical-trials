    <textblock>
      Hyper-CVAD (a chemotherapy regimen) has shown promising results in adult T-cell Acute
      Lymphoblastic Leukemia (T-ALL). Patients with T-ALL diagnosis were reported to the Swedish
      Adult Acute Leukemia Registry between October 2002 and September 2006. Hyper-CVAD was
      recommended to all patients without severe comorbidity. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation
      was recommended for patients with high-risk disease. The aim of this population-based study
      was to assess the efficacy of Hyper-CVAD treatment.

    <textblock>
      Patients with T-ALL diagnosis were prospectively reported to the Swedish Adult Acute Leukemia
      Registry between October 2002 and September 2006. Missing data were complemented
      retrospectively. Hyper-CVAD (fractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and
      dexamethasone alternating with cycles of high-dose methotrexate and cytarabine) was
      recommended to all patients without severe comorbidity. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation
      (SCT) was recommended for patients with high-risk disease: white blood cell count &gt;100×109/L,
      complete remission (CR) achievement after more than two courses, high minimal residual
      disease level, and relapsed disease (after CR2 achievement). In patients without high-risk
      factors maintenance therapy was given with per oral mercaptopurine and methotrexate for two
      years including reinduction courses: daunorubicine, vincristine and prednisolone every second
      month (1st year) and cytarabine, thioguanine and prednisolone every third month (2nd year).
