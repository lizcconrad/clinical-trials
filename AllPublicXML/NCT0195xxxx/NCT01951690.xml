  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, open-label, multicenter, multi cohort, study of VS-6063 (defactinib), a
      focal adhesion kinase inhibitor, in patients with KRAS mutant non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC). NSCLC with a KRAS mutation is required for study entry and subjects will be enrolled
      into 1 of 4 cohorts based on the status of their INK4a/Arf and p53 mutations. The purpose of
      this study is to demonstrate if VS-6063 (defactinib) improves PFS within each cohort. The
      safety and tolerability of VS-6063, tumor response rate, progression free survival and
      overall survival will also be assessed. The pharmacodynamic effects of VS-6063 (defactinib)
      will be examined in a tumor biopsy and a blood sample.

      Eleven subjects will be enrolled into one of four cohorts: Cohort A (KRAS mutation, wild type
      INK4a/ARF and wildtype p53), Cohort B (KRAS mutation, INK4s/ARF mutation and wild type p53),
      Cohort C (KRAS mutation, wild type INK4a/ARF and p53 mutation), and Cohort D (KRAS mutation,
      INK4a/ARF mutation and p53 mutation). If &gt;/= 4 patients demonstrate PFS at 12 weeks in each
      cohort, an additional 23 subjects will be enrolled.

    <time_frame>Baseline PD biomarkers will be associated with the RR (collected every 6 weeks) and PFS, both with expected average of 4 months from first treatment to progression, and OS (expected average of 12 months from first treatment to date of death)</time_frame>

    <description>Adverse events (AEs) include the incidences of all treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) and all Serious Adverse Events (SAEs); by severity, relationship to study drug, and discontinuation of patients from study therapy due to AEs and due to deaths. Safety endpoints for AEs, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, ECGs and physical examinations will be summarized using descriptive statistics as determined based on CTCAE (Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects) 4.03</description>
