    <textblock>
      Congestive heart failure is a common disorder in which the heart cannot pump enough blood to
      meet the needs of the rest of the body. Poor sodium handling by the kidneys is a damaging
      effect of heart failure, and it leads to symptoms of congestion such as shortness of breath
      or ankle swelling. Recent studies suggest that reducing the nerve activity to a kidney could
      reduce sodium retention and blood pressure. An improvement in the way the kidneys handle
      sodium may reduce disease progression and decrease symptoms for heart failure patients.

    <textblock>
      Over the past decades, clinical trials in HF have been unable to alter the natural history of
      cardio-renal compromise. Fluid retention accounts for the majority of admissions for acute
      decompensated heart failure, and salt and water removal using intravenous (IV) diuretics has
      been the mainstay of therapy applied to this population.1 Over 20% of hospitalized patients
      in the Acute Decompensated Heart Failure National Registry (ADHERE) had serum creatinine
      values greater than 2.0 mg/dL2 with the majority of congested patients presenting with
      significantly elevated systolic blood pressures rather than low-output states.1
      Administration of IV loop diuretics further produces intravascular volume depletion and
      reduction in glomerular filtration rates3 as well as an increase in neurohormonal
      activation.4 This is true regardless of whether LVEF is impaired or preserved.5 However,
      despite relieving symptoms, acute drug administrations (such as adenosine receptor
      antagonists or natriuretic peptide analogues) for short durations have not changed the
      long-term cardio-renal outcomes in large clinical trials.

      Recent recognition of different phenotypes of cardio-renal syndrome has provided better
      characterization of patient populations to evaluate specific treatment approaches or
      interventions.6 There is now greater appreciation that patients with congestive HF depend not
      only on an adequate glomerular function for renal glomerular filtration, but also on adequate
      tubular function for effective sodium handling that may or may not be dependent on glomerular
      filtration.7 Despite optimizing intracardiac filling pressures, many patients with August 28,
      2013 Page 10 of 58 cardio-renal compromise remain symptomatic, complaining of breathlessness
      and fatigue often associated with concomitant increase in neurohormonal up-regulation (e.g.
      natriuretic peptides) and poor outcomes.8 Since the majority of patients present with
      hypertension, it points to the possibility that congestive HF is precipitated by heightened
      sympathetic drive.

      Animal models have demonstrated that both blood pressure control and renal tubular
      function/glomerular filtration (as a function of renal blood flow) can be directly influenced
      by renal sympathetic nerve activity,9-12 which has evolved to provide cardiovascular support
      in the setting of hypovolemia or profound cardiovascular collapse. Specifically, HF animal
      models with denervated kidneys have demonstrated improvement in renal blood flow and
      natriuresis (with restoration of Na+-K+ ATPase at the loop of Henle, as well as epithelial
      sodium pumps at the distal tubules). However, our understanding of how persistently activated
      renal sympathetic outflow can lead to exaggerated neurohormonal up-regulation and
      chemoreceptor regulation in humans is still evolving. As heightened cardio-renal compromise
      leads to disease progression and congestive HF, it is conceivable that an approach to
      selectively modulate renal sympathetic outflow may improve cardio-renal compromise as well as
      the target mechanism leading to symptomatic improvement in at-risk patients.

      By establishing the mechanistic role of renal sympathetic outflow in patients with impaired
      sodium handling as a contributor to congestion in HF, we may better understand why patients
      with HF develop symptoms, retain salt and water, and activate neurohormonal systems. This
      trial will be hypothesis generating and will serve to inform a larger clinical trial in
      patients with congestion related to HF.

      The Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB), an independent committee assigned by the sponsor
      to oversee the conduct and safety of this study, met on May 12, 2014 to review information
      that had become available from another study of the renal artery denervation procedure using
      the same investigational catheter as the PRESERVE study. Even though there were no concerns
      for the safety of subjects that had the renal artery denervation, the DSMB decided to stop
      the PRESERVE study.

      Based upon agreement with the FDA, the protocol was amended to reduce subject participation
      from 52 weeks to 13 weeks and to only collect limited safety information.
