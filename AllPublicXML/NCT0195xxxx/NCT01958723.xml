  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The emergence of electronic documentation has led to multiple new challenges for physicians.
      Despite positive expectations, many physicians have received electronic health systems with
      mixed results. Review of current literature has identified the following reasons for concern:
      increased time required for documentation, deteriorating quality of notes, mindless use of
      copy-and-paste functions, and fragmentation of clinical work from poorly designed computing
      workflows. The study of template use has not been done in a large scale or with clear outcome
      measurements. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of Problem Specific
      Templates on quality, accuracy, and efficiency of physician documentation practices.

      This is a prospective cohort study, which will examine the effects of Problem Specific
      Templates on quality, accuracy, and efficiency of physician documentation practices. The
      Hospitalist physicians will be the subjects. All physicians of the Hospital Medicine Service
      will be invited to participate. For the intervention, participating Hospitalists will be
      trained on the use of templates for 20 common hospital problems. Once trained, the
      Hospitalists will be asked to use these templates for a one-month period. Pre-intervention
      and post-intervention medical records will be compared using chart reviews, validated
      document assessment instruments, physician surveys, and electronic medical record time
      auditing.
