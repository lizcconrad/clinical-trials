      The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of diet and physical exercise program on
      pregnancy rate and live birth in obese women who undergo an IVF cycle.

      The objective of this study is showing that obesity significantly affects the in vitro
      fertilization cycles lowering the reproductive capacity. The study is been performed in
      Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau and Fundació Puigvert of Barcelona. Patients recluted
      are obese women with sterility problems that require in vitro fertilization (IVF) with a body
      mass index BMI between 30-35. It´s a randomised study in which half of the patients undergo
      to a 6 weeks program of diet and exercice. We will analyse the response to ovaric
      stimulation, the results of the egg retrieval (ovocyte number and quality), rates of
      fecundation, embryo implantation and clinical gestation.
