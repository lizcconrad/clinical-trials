    <textblock>
      This study is a regulatory post-marketing surveillance in Japan and it is a local prospective
      and observational study of patients who have received Fosrenol.

      The objective of this research is to collect information on the safety of Fosrenol after its
      launching, which means collecting information on adverse events, especially adverse events in
      the digestive system including constipation and serious adverse events, and adverse drug
      reactions when the drug is administered to the below-mentioned target patients for six
      months.

      The secondary objective is to collect information on the safety of the drug when administered
      for more than six months, which means collecting information on the safety of the drug when
      administered for up to 12 months to the target patients who have already been treated with
      the drug for six months. And also if at the time of 12 months after administration of
      Lanthanum carbonate the dialysis is not conducted, extending its' administration will be
      continued until conduction of dialysis, or until Sept. 30, 2015. The efficacy of fosrenol is
      evaluated by observing the serum P(phosphorus) level and serum PTH (parathyroid hormone)
      level change.
