  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent past years, regulatory agencies such as FDA and EMA have outlined and recommended
      adoption of a risk-based approach to evaluating and mitigating immune responses to
      therapeutic proteins that may adversely affect their safety and efficacy. In their
      recommendations, both transient and persistent antibody responses should be combined to
      determine the overall immunogenicity of a product in a given condition. In particular,
      persistent antibodies are of high importance, since patients with persistent antibodies are
      more likely to experience clinical sequelae in terms of safety and efficacy, while a
      transient antibody response can resolve without further consequence.

      The present study will provide information on immunogenicity of AMG504-1 with regards to the
      potential development of high antibody titers or neutralizing antibody activity which may
      lead to loss of efficacy or an increased risk of an adverse reaction.

      AMG105 is a single center, randomized, single dose, laboratory-blinded, parallel design
      study. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the immunogenicity of repeated single
      doses of glucagon following intranasal (IN) and intramuscular (IM) administration in adults
      with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes (T1D or T2D). The secondary objective is to evaluate the
      safety and tolerability of glucagon following IN and IM administration in adults with T1D or
      T2D. A total of seventy-five (75) adult patients with T1D or T2D will be included in the
      study.

      Male and female patients of at least 18 years of age but not older than 70 years with a
      history of type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes of at least 2 years duration, and with a body
      mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to 18.5 and below or equal to 35 kg/m2 will be
      selected according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. They will be in general good
      health, without late severe complications, according to medical history, physical examination
      (including vital signs), nasal examination, bilateral anterior rhinoscopy and laboratory
      tests (biochemistry, hematology, urinalysis) including negative screening of ethanol and
      drugs of abuse in urine. A 12-lead ECG will be performed. For female patients, a HCG beta
      serum pregnancy test must be negative.

      A single dose of glucagon will be administered in the morning after a 10-hour overnight fast,
      either by intranasal or intramuscular route, on 3 occasions. The random allocation of each
      treatment to each subject will be generated using a 2:1 stratification.

      Safety and tolerability will be evaluated through the assessment of adverse events, clinical
      and laboratory examinations.

      Descriptive statistics comprising the sample size, mean, median, SD and 95% confidence
      intervals (CI) of the mean will be used to describe the titer of anti-glucagon antibodies in
      each treatment group by period. In addition, the number, proportion and associated 95% CI of
      patients in each treatment group with anti-glucagon antibodies above the limit of detection
      will be described.
