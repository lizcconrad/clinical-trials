  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently little is known about the health beliefs and behaviors of pregnant adolescents. The
      goal of this pilot study is to educate pregnant adolescents via social media about nutrition
      and fitness during pregnancy and to evaluate their health beliefs and behaviors before and
      after receiving this information. Data collected will provide new information on which to
      base subsequent research and can be used to inform nutritional guidelines or public health
      programming for this vulnerable age group.

      The purpose of this pilot study is to find out if receiving electronic health information
      (e.g. text messages and Facebook posts) during pregnancy changes how pregnant teens think
      about their prenatal health and if fetal and maternal health outcomes can be improved. This
      study aims to:

        1. Assess the impact of providing health information to pregnant adolescents (through
           Facebook and text messages) on fetal and maternal health outcomes across pregnancy.

        2. Assess maternal nutrition knowledge using a brief questionnaire before and after the
           social media intervention.

        3. Evaluate adolescent beliefs, attitudes and influences on dietary, physical activity, and
           life choices by asking teens to participate in interviews and focus groups.

        4. Evaluate adolescent beliefs, attitudes and influences on dietary, physical activity and
           life choices through the perspective of healthcare providers by interviewing allied
           health workers at the adolescent pregnancy clinic.

    <description>Teens will receive text messages from study staff and health information will be posted to a private Facebook group page. They will be able to interact with one another and discuss further the topics that are posted to their group page or that they have received via text message. Before they receive any of these messages, they will complete a baseline nutrition knowledge survey and participate in a focus group/interview. Midway through the study, teens will complete a survey about their digital media usage. Close to delivery, the teens will complete a second nutrition knowledge survey and participate in a final focus group/interview. All discussions will be related to diet, physical activity and general behaviors that teens engage in independently for prenatal care. All interviews and focus groups will be recorded so that transcripts can be made and common themes identified.</description>

    <measure>Healthcare provider views</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of enrollment, up to 40 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Healthcare providers will be interviewed individually or in focus groups as key informants in order to gain a different view of pregnant adolescent health behaviors. Health professionals will complete a short demographic survey and participate in one interview in which they will be asked about general health advice they share with teens and how they perceive pregnant adolescent health behaviors. All interviews will be recorded so that transcripts can be made and common themes identified.</description>
