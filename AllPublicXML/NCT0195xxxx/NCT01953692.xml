  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of
      pembrolizumab (MK-3475, KEYTRUDA®) in hematologic malignancies. The primary study hypotheses
      are that treatment with pembrolizumab will result in a clinically meaningful improvement in
      Objective Response Rate (ORR) or Complete Remission Rate (CRR).

      With Protocol Amendment 08, enrollment in the Multiple Myeloma arm (Cohort 2) has been
      completed and no further enrollment will be allowed and enrollment in the Non-Hodgkin
      Lymphoma Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma arm (Cohort 5) has been discontinued and no further
      enrollment will be allowed.
