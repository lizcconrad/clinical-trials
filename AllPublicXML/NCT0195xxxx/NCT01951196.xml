  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A new study have shown that high nighttime blood pressure (BP) and/or non-dipping (lack of
      fall in blood pressure during nighttime) is a strong predictor for the risk of cardiovascular
      disease and mortality in patients with hypertension. Three factors seem to affect the night
      time blood pressure: chronic kidney disease, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or the way
      ambulatory blood pressure is monitored.

      The aim of this study is to analyse the importance of these three factors on nighttime
      bloodpressure.

      Hypothesis:

      Central 24 hour blood pressure monitoring provides another measure of daily fluctuations in
      blood pressure than peripheral 24 hour blood pressure monitoring, because measurement is
      painless and does not interfere with activities during the daytime or night-time sleep

      In chronic kidney disease and OSA the decrease in nocturnal BP is lower than in healthy
      subjects.

      In chronic kidney disease the decrease in the nocturnal BP is inversely correlated to the
      severity of OSA, the severity of kidney disease, and blood pressure during daytime.

      150 patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD III-IV) and 75 healthy subject is examined with
      both central and peripheral 24 hours blood pressure monitoring, 1 night home polygraphy to
      determine whether the subject has obstructive sleep apnea, and if so the degree (AHI), blood-
      and urine samples to determine levels of u-AQP2 og u-ENaCɣ, PRC, p-AngII, p-Aldosterone,
      p-Avp og p-Endothelin.

        Group 1: Patients with chronic kidney disease, CKD stage III-IV. The patients is followed
        for their kidney disease at Holstebro Regional Hospital, Denmark, Medical clinic, and the
        are chosen to participate in the study because of this relation.

        Group 2: Healthy subjects. They arerecruited through postings on public and private
        companies as well as advertising in local medier.
