    <measure>Change From Baseline in Genant-modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The mTSS is a measure of joint damage that combines scores for bone erosion and joint-space narrowing (JNS). Erosion score: A total of 14 locations in each hand and wrist and 6 joints in the foot were evaluated for erosion using an 8-point scale where 0=normal to 3.5=very severe erosion. JNS score: A total of 13 locations in each hand and wrist and 6 joints in the foot were evaluated for joint narrowing score using a 9-point scale where 0=normal to 4.0=definite ankylosis (stiffness or fixation of a joint). mTSS scores ranged from 0 (normal) to 292 (worst possible total score). Change from baseline = mTSS score at Week 24 minus score at baseline. An increase in mTSS from baseline represents disease progression and/or joint worsening, no change represents halting of disease progression, and a decrease represents improvement.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Positive American College of Rheumatology 20/50/70 (ACR20/50/70) Responses</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>A positive ACR20 response requires at least 20% improvement compared to baseline in SJC (66 joints) and TJC (68 joints) as well as at least 20% improvement in 3 of the following 5 assessments: 1) PGA pain VAS, 2) PGA VAS; 3) physician's global assessment of disease activity VAS, 4) Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) with 20 questions consisting of 8 components: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and activities, 0=without difficulty to 3=unable to do; and 5) acute phase reactant (C-reactive protein [CRP] - if not available, ESR was used). ACR50 and ACR70 responses are defined in a similar way except that they required a 50% and 70% improvement from baseline, respectively. VAS range for all assessments was 0=no disease activity to 100=maximum disease activity.</description>

    <measure>Safety: Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 32 (end of follow up: 8 weeks after end of treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Genant-modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS)</title>
        <description>The mTSS is a measure of joint damage that combines scores for bone erosion and joint-space narrowing (JNS). Erosion score: A total of 14 locations in each hand and wrist and 6 joints in the foot were evaluated for erosion using an 8-point scale where 0=normal to 3.5=very severe erosion. JNS score: A total of 13 locations in each hand and wrist and 6 joints in the foot were evaluated for joint narrowing score using a 9-point scale where 0=normal to 4.0=definite ankylosis (stiffness or fixation of a joint). mTSS scores ranged from 0 (normal) to 292 (worst possible total score). Change from baseline = mTSS score at Week 24 minus score at baseline. An increase in mTSS from baseline represents disease progression and/or joint worsening, no change represents halting of disease progression, and a decrease represents improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Patient’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity Visual Analog Scale (PGA VAS)</title>
        <description>PGA VAS is the participant's overall assessment of their current disease activity. The disease activity is displayed on a 100-mm horizontal VAS. The left-hand extreme (0 mm) of the line is described as &quot;no disease activity&quot; (symptom free and no arthritis symptoms) and the right-hand extreme (100 mm) is described as &quot;maximum disease activity&quot; (maximum arthritis disease activity). The change in PGA VAS is determined as the difference in values from baseline. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>The SDAI is a combined index for measuring disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis and calculated as SDAI = TJC28 + SJC28 + PGA VAS (in mm) + Physician Global Assessment of Disease Activity VAS (in mm) + C reactive protein (CRP) in milligrams/deciliter (mg/dL) with a total SDAI score ranging from 0 to 86. Higher scores indicate greater disease activity. The SDAI scale is divided into the following categories: Clinical remission = score ≤ 3.3; Low disease activity = score &gt; 3.3 and ≤ 11.0; Moderate disease activity = score &gt; 11.0 and ≤ 26.0; Severe disease = score &gt; 26.0.

          <description>The SDAI is a combined index for measuring disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis and calculated as SDAI = TJC28 + SJC28 + PGA VAS (in mm) + Physician Global Assessment of Disease Activity VAS (in mm) + C reactive protein (CRP) in milligrams/deciliter (mg/dL) with a total SDAI score ranging from 0 to 86. Higher scores indicate greater disease activity. The SDAI scale is divided into the following categories: Clinical remission = score ≤ 3.3; Low disease activity = score &gt; 3.3 and ≤ 11.0; Moderate disease activity = score &gt; 11.0 and ≤ 26.0; Severe disease = score &gt; 26.0.

          <description>Cartilage loss was assessed by MRI at baseline and Week 24. Scans of 25 joints were read and scored in pairs for each participant by 2 assessors. Scores for each location ranged 0-4 on a 9-point scale, with 0= no cartilage loss and 4= complete cartilage loss. Total score was the sum of the 25 individual scores and ranged 0-100 with 0= no cartilage loss and 100= most severe cartilage loss. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>
