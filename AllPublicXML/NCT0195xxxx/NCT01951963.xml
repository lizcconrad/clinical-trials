    <textblock>
      The proposed trial is a prospective, double blinded, randomized control trial with the
      primary aim of determining whether a single, sub-dissociative dose of ketamine will decrease
      the total narcotic requirements of pediatric patients requiring intravenous analgesia in an
      urban emergency department (ED) compared to a group of patients who receive morphine alone
      for pain management. Patients are randomized to receive either a single bolus of ketamine
      (0.3 mg/kg) or a single bolus of morphine (0.05mg/kg). All subsequent pain management will be
      accomplished using morphine. Patient, family member, and research staff pain scores will be
      recorded, until 3 hours post study medication administration. Family members are contacted
      via telephone 24 hours post-ED discharge, and again at 7 days post-hospital discharge, for
      evaluation via Post Hospitalization Behavior Questionnaire. Narcotic equivalents will be
      calculated for up to 3 hours post study medication administration and compared between the
      ketamine and morphine groups.

The final sample included 40 subjects, 20 in the Ketamine group. The baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups. These patients were randomized to receive a single bolus of ketamine (0.3 mg/kg). These are standard recommended pediatric weight-based analgesic doses of Ketamine. Patient weight was obtained by the treating RN using a scale or Broselow tape. A blinded 10mL syringe containing study drug was prepared and delivered to the bedside by a pharmacist. After administration of study drug all future analgesic doses were restricted to morphine and were given at the discretion of the treatment team.</description>
