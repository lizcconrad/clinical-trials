  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of two parts, Part I and Part II. The purpose of Part I of the study is
      to assess the efficacy and safety of verubecestat (MK-8931) compared with placebo
      administered for 104 weeks in the treatment of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) due
      to Alzheimer's Disease (AD), also known as prodromal AD. Participants will be randomized to
      receive placebo, or 12 mg or 40 mg verubecestat, once daily. The primary study hypothesis for
      Part I is that at least one verubecestat dose is superior to placebo with respect to the
      change from baseline in the Clinical Dementia Rating scale-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) score at 104
      weeks. Participants who complete Part I of the study may choose to participate in Part II,
      which is a long term double-blind extension to assess efficacy and safety of verubecestat
      administered for up to an additional 260 weeks. In Part II, all participants will receive
      either 12 mg or 40 mg verubecestat, once daily.

      As a result of protocol amendment, Study Part II will contain a Positron Emission Tomography
      (PET) imaging substudy to assess regional neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) expression utilizing
      the PET tracer [18F]MK-6240.
