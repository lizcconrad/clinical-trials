  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to advances and increased practice of interventional therapy for coronary artery disease,
      the rate of high-risk patients with severe coronary disease and reduced left ventricular
      function among patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting surgery (CABG) is
      increasing. The perioperative mortality in these patients is â‰¥ 5%. The perioperative and
      operative management for these patients has to be optimized in order to reduce their
      perioperative morbidity and mortality. One of the central aspects is perioperative
      maintenance of hemodynamic stability. The use of prophylactic IABP is a partly established,
      but not sufficiently evidence-based measure to reduce ventricular afterload and improve
      coronary perfusion pre-, intra- and postoperatively. Yet, it is an invasive procedure with
      potential complications. The planned trial should give an explicit answer, whether
      preoperative prophylactic IABP decreases 30-day all-cause mortality (primary endpoint) and
      long-term mortality (3, 6, 12 months; secondary endpoints) compared to preoperative
      conservative treatment in high-risk patients undergoing CABG.
