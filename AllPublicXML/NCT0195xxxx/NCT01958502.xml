  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Because the rate of non union of long bone in lower extremities specially in tibia in this
      two last decade due to malnutrition and smoking and other risk factors was increased, so many
      patient in our country suffer from non union. On the other hand it seems that the use of the
      mesenchymal stem cells can irritate the union rate. Also for better result we used the
      mesenchymal stem cells with BMP2 in collagenic scaffold. The collagen has a osteoconductive
      effect and BMP2 and stem cells has a osteoinductive effect therefore this combination is
      useful in filling the gap in non union site and irritate the union rate.

      Mesenchymal stem cell derived from iliac bone marrow after centrifuge with ficoll procedure.
      Then the investigators will follow the patient with monthly radiography and evaluate the
      callus volume and clinical union and any side effect of this treatment. Clinical union
      consider to relief pain in non union site and be stable in examination.
