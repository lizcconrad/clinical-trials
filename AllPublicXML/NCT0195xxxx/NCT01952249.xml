  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b/2 study of paclitaxel plus demcizumab in subjects with platinum resistant
      ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects must not have received prior weekly paclitaxel or more than 3 prior chemotherapy
      regimens in the Phase 1b portion of the study and more than 2 prior chemotherapy regimens in
      the Phase 2 portion of the study. Prior to enrollment, subjects will undergo screening to
      determine study eligibility. In the Phase 1b portion of study, 3 subjects will be treated at
      each dose level if no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) are observed. If 1 of 3 subjects
      experiences a DLT, that dose level will be expanded to 6 subjects.

      If 2 or more subjects experience a DLT, no further subjects will be dosed at that level and 3
      additional subjects will be added to the preceding dose cohort unless 6 subjects have already
      been treated at that dose level. Subjects will be assessed for DLTs from Days 0-28. Dose
      escalation for newly enrolled subjects, if appropriate, will occur after all subjects in a
      cohort have completed their Day 28 DLT assessment. After the final patient in the Phase 1b
      portion of the trial has completed their Day 28 DLT assessment, 50 subjects will be enrolled
      in the Phase 2 portion of the study and treated with demcizumab at the highest dose level
      that had &lt; 2 DLTs in the 6 subjects.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects must have cytologically or histologically confirmed ovarian, primary
             peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer.. In addition, subjects must have a tumor that is
             at least 1 cm in a single dimension and is radiographically apparent on CT, PET-CT or
             MRI (i.e., RECIST version 1.1 measurable disease).

          2. Subjects must have platinum resistant disease (i.e., which is defined as disease
             progression in less than 6 months after receiving a minimum of 4 cycles of a platinum
             containing regimen).

          3. Subjects with the following histologic epithelial cell types are eligible: Serous
             adenocarcinoma, endometrioid adenocarcinoma, mucinous adenocarcinoma, undifferentiated
             carcinoma, clear cell adenocarcinoma, mixed epithelial carcinoma, transitional cell
             carcinoma, malignant Brenner's Tumor, or adenocarcinoma N.O.S.

          4. Age &gt;21 years

          5. ECOG performance status &lt;3

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects receiving any other investigational medicinal product or anti-cancer therapy.

          2. Prior therapy with weekly paclitaxel for recurrent disease (administration of weekly
             paclitaxel as part of an upfront treatment strategy is acceptable as long as the
             patient had not progressed while receiving weekly paclitaxel or recurred within 4
             months of receiving weekly paclitaxel)

          3. Non-epithelial ovarian carcinoma, including malignant mixed Mullerian tumors.

          4. For the Phase 1b portion of the study, more than 3 prior chemotherapy regimens and for
             the Phase 2 portion of the study more than 2 prior chemotherapy regimens. Maintenance
             therapy following induction chemotherapy does not count as a separate regimen. In
             addition, hormonal therapy (e.g., tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor) does not count
             as a separate regimen.

          5. Prior radiotherapy to the pelvis or abdomen

          6. Subjects receiving heparin, warfarin, or other similar anticoagulants. Note: Subjects
             may be receiving lowdose aspirin and/or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents.
