    <textblock>
      The investigators previously identified three novel HLA-A*2402-restricted epitope peptides,
      which were derived from three cancer-testis antigens, URLC10, CDCA1, and KIF20A, as targets
      for vaccination against lung cancer. In this clinical study, the investigators examine using
      a combination of these three peptides the safety, immunogenicity, and antitumor effect of
      vaccine treatment to prevent relapse of the disease for HLA-A*2402-positive advanced
      non-small cell lung cancer patients whose disease are controlled after any standard
      therapies.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, immune response and
      clinical efficacies of HLA-A*2402 restricted epitope peptides URLC10, CDCA1, and KIF20A
      emulsified with Montanide ISA 51 for disease controlled advanced non-small cell lung cancers.
