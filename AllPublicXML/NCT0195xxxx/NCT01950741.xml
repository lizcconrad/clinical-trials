      Effects of VEGF Trap-Eye (aflibercept) in treatment-naive polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy
      (PCV) will be evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Efficacy of VEGF Trap-Eye (aflibercept, Eylea) for exudative age-related macular degeneration
      (AMD) was demonstrated in the phase III VIEW study. Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV)
      is considered as a subtype of exudative AMD, however it is reportedly different from
      choroidal new vessels based on the histologic studies. The aim of this study is to evaluate
      effects of VEGF Trap-Eye in treatment of PCV, which was diagnosed using indocyanine green
      (ICG) angiography. VEGF Trap-Eye will be injected intravitreally bimonthly after 3 monthly
      loading dose for 12 months in treatment-naive PCV patients. The efficacy will be evaluated on
      preserving visual acuity and improving angiographic features at 12 months.

    <description>Visual acuity was assessed using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart. The ETDRS chart includes 100 letters as the maximum possible score, and 0 letters read as the minimum possible score. Visual acuity of 85 letters is equivalent to 20/20. Higher scores represents better functioning.</description>
