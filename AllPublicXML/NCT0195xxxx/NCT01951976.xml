  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether it might be practical and useful to
      investigate the effectiveness of yoga classes in relieving joint pain associated with the use
      of a class of medications known as aromatase inhibitors.

      The study uses a single-arm design. All study participants will be assigned to an
      intervention condition in which they participate in group Iyengar yoga classes for 90 minutes
      twice per week for 12 weeks (total of 24 classes). Study outcomes are assessed: 1) following
      recruitment but prior to the first yoga class; and 2) within two weeks post-intervention
      (follow-up). Additionally, a brief assessment of pain will be conducted four weeks and eight
      weeks after the start of yoga classes.
