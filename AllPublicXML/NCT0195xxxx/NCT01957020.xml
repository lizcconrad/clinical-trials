  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stereotactic directional vacuum-assisted breast biopsy (ST DVAB) is a standard biopsy
      procedure for suspicious findings on mammograms in Western countries for more than 10 years
      [1-3], it has replaced the needle localization (NLOC) excisional biopsy for the lesions alike
      and was reported to feature a high sensitivity, very low delayed false-negative rate (less
      than 2%)[4,5]. Moreover, it causes less scarring, less psychologic stress to patients and
      less morbidity compared with needle localization excisional biopsy [6,7]. However, its
      sensitivity, accuracy has seldom been reported in Asian countries [8] , since most Asian
      women have different breast parenchyma pattern, different breast cancer prevalence.
      Therefore, we retrospectively reviewed outcomes of the two groups of patients receiving
      either ST DVAB or NLOC excisional biopsy, trying to investigate if ST DVAB can be an
      effective alternative to NLOC excisional biopsy in our country.

    <measure>The sensitivity of stereotactic vacuum assisted breast biopsy for breast cancer diagnosis</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 5 years ( July 2008 to June 2013)</time_frame>
    <description>the aforementioned outcome measure-&quot;sensitivity&quot;- is the probability of the stereotactic vaccum assisted breast biopsy can correctly diagnose the breast cancer. And according to statistical definition, it is defined as- for those breast cancer cases, how many of them can be correctly diagnosed by stereotactic breast biopsy.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The indication for ST DVAB was lesions with suspicious nature for malignancy seen on
             mammograms which biopsy is necessitated for tissue proof, or probably benign or benign
             appearing lesions seen on mammograms but patients or clinicians requested biopsy
