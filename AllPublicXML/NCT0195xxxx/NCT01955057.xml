  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Persistent smoking after lung cancer has been the subject of medical, therapeutic and
      epidemiological publications for twenty years of research. Continued persistent smoking is
      all the more a problem for oncologists as there is evidence that smoking cessation, with lung
      cancer, gives therapeutic benefit. Quitting smoking can improve the response to treatments
      (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery), quality of life and overall survival. However many
      patients refuse adhesion to tobacco cessation. Daily practice leads us to the hypothesis that
      adhesion differences aren't related to the denial of medical information, nor to resignation
      or to nicotine dependence. Patients who continue smoking seem to face a form of impossibility
      to wean. Cigarette seems to be felt as a part of their body in their narration and
      description of their body image.

By analysing the content of the speech of the patient previously noted during the various interviews The investigator will classify each subject in &quot;disturbance&quot; or not for each of the three parameters. The presence of at least one disturbance gives the &quot;yes&quot; value in the indicator variable, &quot;no&quot; in the absence of the three disturbances.</description>
