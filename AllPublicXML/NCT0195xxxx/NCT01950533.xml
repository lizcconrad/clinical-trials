  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Food allergy is on the rise within the pediatric population. Having food allergy can cause
      medical, nutritional and psychological issues in those who suffer with it. Although making
      the appropriate diagnosis of food allergy is very important, properly diagnosing food allergy
      has been a challenge. Skin prick testing and food-specific IgE testing of the blood can give
      positive results that are false. Currently, Oral Food Challenges are the best way to diagnose
      a food allergy. Unfortunately, Oral Food Challenges are time consuming and may not be readily
      available to suspected food allergy sufferers. This study is designed to examine the
      effectiveness of an allergy-detecting blood test called IMMULITE 2000 manufactured by the
      study sponsor, Siemens.
