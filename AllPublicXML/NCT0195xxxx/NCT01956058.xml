  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After a curative treatment by radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer, between 20% and 50%
      of patients may have a biological relapse as a progressive re -rise of PSA. After prostate
      brachytherapy with low flow, this rate is between 2% and 6%. Depending on risk factors
      initially present, some patients will have a micro metastatic disease at the time of re-rise,
      but others will have a true local recurrence purely intra-prostate. Local recurrence after
      radiotherapy is associated with a high incidence of distant metastatic relapse and poor
      overall survival. For these reasons, the possibility of offering a local treatment for this
      selected population of patients can have a major therapeutic interest and allow changing a
      situation often considered palliative to the possibility of a second curative treatment.

      Currently, there is no consensus regarding the optimal management of patients with purely
      local recurrence after prostate irradiation at first intention. When an external radiotherapy
      or brachytherapy is performed as first choice in a patient with prostate cancer, several
      remedial treatments have been proposed, with controversial results the decision-making for
      clinicians and for difficult patients. These main therapeutic options remedial (surgery,
      cryotherapy and brachytherapy) have the potential for complications such as rectal injury,
      impotence or incontinence Brachytherapy is a new salvage treatment being evaluated in the
      United States (Phase II study of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group No. 0526). Several
      retrospective trials have shown very encouraging results in terms of acute toxicity and
      biochemical control in the short term. Thus, a team from Mount Sinai in New York recently
      published for the first time 10 years retrospective results with this approach. In their
      experience after treatment failures with external beam radiotherapy or brachytherapy, a dose
      of 122 Gy was delivered over 90% of the prostate gland. Doing this they observed biochemical
      control rates and survival specific of 54 % and 96 %, respectively at 10 years, with an
      hormone treatment associated (median 6 months) in 84 % of cases. Four patients had grade 3
      toxicity or higher (11%). To reduce the rate of late toxicities the team from the University
      Of California San Francisco (UCSF), tested focal brachytherapy guided by functional MRI (MRI
      spectroscopy) to re-treat local recurrence after initial brachytherapy as monotherapy or
      boost. By delivering 144 Gy on recidivism objectified on MRI, the authors observed that a
      minimal dose of 37Gy covered 90 % of the prostate gland to treat the risk of microscopic
      disease. Doing this, the rate of observed toxicities and biochemical control appeared
      encouraging, with a median follow-up of 2 years, since no grade 3 toxicity was observed and
      74% of patients achieved a PSA nadir &lt;0.5 ng / mL without associated hormone. In case of
      external radiation or brachytherapy, several attempts proposed to associate an injection of
      hyaluronic acid gel to the prostate - rectum interface to spare healthy tissue irradiated and
      thus reduce the rate of radiation proctitis. The feasibility of implementing this gel has
      been demonstrated in patients with non- irradiated tissues. No inherent toxicity of the
      injection of hyaluronic acid gel has been described after prostate brachytherapy first line.
      The feasibility of this injection remains unproven to date on patients previously irradiated
      externally or by brachytherapy. We hypothesize that the risk of radiation proctitis and
      fistulas front prostate could be reduced using this technique in this indication.

      We propose to carry out a French prospective multicenter phase II trial combining
      brachytherapy remedial with an injection of hyaluronic acid after surgery to reduce the risk
      of radiation proctitis and / or recto -urinary fistula in a patient population hyper-
      selected with a high probability of isolated local recurrence.
