      Bioequivalence of propafenone hydrochloride capsules manufactured at two different sites

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a Phase 1, randomized, open-label, single-dose, three-period, crossover study to
      assess the bioequivalence of propafenone hydrochloride manufactured at two different sites in
      healthy adult volunteers. Approximately 36 subjects will receive a 3 single doses of
      propafenone hydrochloride 425mg, each administered separately, in the fasted state with a 7
      day washout period between doses. Propafenone hydrochloride is an antiarrhythmic indicated to
      prolong the time to recurrence of symptomatic atrial fibrillation in patients with episodic
      (most likely paroxysmal or persistent) atrial fibrillation who do not have structural heart
      disease. A follow-up visit will occur 7-10 days after the final dose of study drug.

             bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin
             &lt;35%).

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she postmenopausal or on a stable

             result within 3 months of screening.

          -  Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities
             (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones).
