  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this randomized pilot study, a nutritional consultation combining exercise program is
      planned for 25 locally advanced esophageal cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant
      chemoradiation. The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of nutritional and
      exercise intervention in locally advanced esophageal cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant
      chemoradiation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with esophageal cancer are often malnourished at presentation due to the primary
      symptom of dysphagia. Treatments for esophageal cancer are commonly multimodal, incorporating
      polychemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery. These treatments frequently cause or exacerbate
      poor nutritional status. Recent literature has proved that malnutrition is associated with
      longer hospital stays, reduced responses to and increased complications from therapies,
      increased costs, worse quality of life and lower survival rate. The aim of this study was to
      investigate the effectiveness of an intensive nutritional consultation and exercise program
      on nutritional status and outcomes in patients undergoing chemoradiation for esophageal
      cancer.

    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measure tools included patient-generated-subjective global assessment score, hand-grip strength, body weight, body composition analysis, and 6-mim walk test were used to define the general nutritional status of esophageal cancer patient. The study measures were chosen on the basis that they had been utilized in previous cancer trials examining the effects of various interventions on weight loss, endurance and strength, and simple enough to be administered in the clinical setting.</description>

    <measure>Treatment tolerance</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the treatment tolerance, the following data were assessed: number of treatment breaks or delay for toxicity, grading of acute chemoradiation-related toxicity, number of unplanned hospitalization for adverse effects.</description>

    <description>The protocol involved 20-30 minutes of individual-based nutrition consultation every week during the 8-week chemoradiation therapy. The exercise program consisted of upper extremity muscle training and walking exercise at 45%-65% of maximal heart rate reserve, 3 times per week, 20-30 minutes per session.</description>
