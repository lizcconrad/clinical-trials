  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study to collect blood and bone marrow samples from patients with SM
      and MGUS. About 100 subjects will be enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania and followed
      for 2 years. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate CMMCs as a biomarker to
      detect patients at high risk of progression to multiple myeloma in patients with MGUS and
      SMM.

      The primary objective is to evaluate CMMCs as a biomarker to detect patients at high risk of
      progression to multiple myeloma in patients with MGUS and SMM. The secondary objective are to
      correlate CMMCs with the Mayo Clinic prognostic models in MGUS/SMM, to compare bone marrow
      genomic findings with genomic findings in CMMC (utilizing multiple myeloma FISH panel), to
      perform immunophenotyping of bone marrow plasma cells, to perform gene expression profiling
      on CD138+bone marrow plasma cells and correlate with progression, to perform serum microRNA
      profiling and correlate with progression, to correlate bone marrow immunohistochemical
      studies evaluating the microenvironment with CMMC, to perform proteomic profiling on
      peripheral blood to evaluate serum biomarkers of progression and to establish a biorepository
      of samples of peripheral blood for future studies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18 or greater

          -  Capable of informed consent

          -  A monoclonal gammopathy detected in the serum, including intact immunoglobulin (IgG
             and IgA) and light chain only gammopathies. Light chain only gammopathy is defined as
             an abnormal light chain ratio and increased involved light chain).44, 45

          -  Absence of myeloma related organ or tissue impairment (&quot;CRAB&quot;) as defined by:

               -  Hypercalcemia (calcium greater than or equal to 11)

               -  Renal failure (creatinine &gt;2.0)

               -  Anemia hemoglobin &lt;10 gm/dl)

               -  Bone disease (Osteolytic lesions, fractures)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A secondary B-cell neoplasm or other active malignancy aside from non-melanoma skin
             cancer or localized prostate cancer. An active malignancy is any malignancy requiring
             therapy within the past 3 years. Patients with monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis are not
             excluded.

          -  IgM monoclonal gammopathy
