  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study seeks to test whether it is feasible and acceptable for both women and providers
      (in this context the Lady Health Visitor) to use the semi-quantitative pregnancy test (SQPT)
      as a tool for follow up after MR services. The study is planned at 11service delivery points
      (primary health clinics) in Punjab province where consenting women will be asked to take a
      baseline test at the clinic the morning they present for the MR procedure. Women will be
      asked to complete a second test at home the morning of their scheduled follow up visit and
      return to the clinic for follow-up care later that day. The results of the at home test will
      be compared to the baseline to determine the outcome of the MR. This is of particular
      importance because to-date no research has documented the accuracy of the test in detecting
      MR outcomes with misoprostol only regimens.

      We hypothesize that women and providers will find the test easy and acceptable to use thereby
      improving follow up and simplifying MR service provision. In addition, the simple pictorial
      instructions will enable most women to use the test and interpret the results correctly on
      their own.
