    <textblock>
      In this study, investigators will evaluated the long-term efficacy and safety (two years) of
      Tacrolimus-Rituximab (RTX) therapy compared to Methylprednisolone-Cyclophosphamide (CYC)
      therapy in patients with primary Membranous Nephropathy (MN).

      PRINCIPAL OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether sequential therapy with tacrolimus leads to a greater
      increase in the proportion of primary MN patients with Complete or Partial Remission when
      compared with patients receiving standard treatment. It will be assessed 24 months after the
      beginning of treatment.

      Phase of the trial: and design: Phase III study, open label, randomized, and active
      controlled trial.

      This study will have 3 stages: screening and recruitment of patients for 18 months, treatment
      period for six months in corticosteroids plus CYC group and 9 months in Tacrolimus-RTX group,
      and finally post-treatment follow-up period until to complete 24 months of follow-up since
      initial treatment.

      This study will compare the standard therapy for primary MN patients with nephrotic range
      proteinuria (active control of steroids plus CYC) with a novel sequential therapy of
      tacrolimus and RTX, an approach of potential high efficacy, low toxicity and more acceptable
      safety profile.

      PRIMARY AND SECONDARY ENDPOINTS/OUTCOME MEASURES

      Primary end-point:

      The proportion of patients reaching CR defined as a reduction of proteinuria since baseline
      level to a value equal or lower than 0.5 g/24 h proteinuria plus stable renal function (eGFR
      ≥ 45 ml/min/1.73m2) or PR defined as a reduction of proteinuria since baseline level to a
      value less than 3.5 g/24 h and 50% lower than baseline proteinuria plus stable renal function
      (eGFR ≥ 45ml/min/1.73m2) at 24 months of study treatment.

      Secondary end-points

        -  The proportion of patients with Limited response (LR) defined as a reduction of
           proteinuria since baseline level &gt; 50% but to a value &gt; 3.5g/24 h. at 12, 18 and 24
           months of study treatment..

        -  The number of patients with an increase ≥ 50% of serum creatinine (SCr) from baseline at
           12, 18 and 24 months (end of the follow-up).

        -  The time of renal survival (status free of increase ≥ 50% of baseline SCr) in both arms
           overall after the study.

        -  The proportion of patients with preserved renal function (estimated GFR ≥ 60 ml/min) in
           both treatment arms after the treatment period.

        -  The proportion of patients with relapse (defines as the reappearance of proteinuria &gt;
           3.5 gr/24h and at least 50% increase over the lowest baseline value in at least three
           consecutive visits in those patients who previously presented a PR or CR) and the time
           to relapse after the treatment period.

        -  Serum levels of anti-phospholipase A2 receptor antibodies (anti-PLA2R), before of
           treatment and at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months of study, in both treatment arms.

        -  The proportion of patient with drug-related adverse events and serious adverse events.

      STUDY POPULATION

      Patients with biopsy-proven idiopathic or primary membranous nephropathy with nephrotic
      proteinuria and normal or slight decrease of renal function will be enrolled.
