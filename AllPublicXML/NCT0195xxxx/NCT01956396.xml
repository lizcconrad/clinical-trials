      The protocol, approved by the Medical Research Council, was issued to assess the safety and
      efficacy of the non-surgical device for applying it to the national scale up of adult male
      circumcision in Zimbabwe

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Models show that to have the highest impact on the HIV epidemic, circumcision of up to 80% of
      men in high prevalence countries, where MC rates are low, needs to be achieved (UNAIDS 2009;
      Manicaland HIV/STD Prevention Project, 2008; Bollinger, et al, 2009). Hallett and colleagues
      in 2008 showed that for Zimbabwe specifically, HIV incidence could be reduced between 25% to
      35% if about 50% of men are circumcised. All modelings conducted show that MC programs must
      be part of a comprehensive HIV prevention package as MC alone will not tip the HIV epidemic
      into a terminal decline.

      The PrePex Device offers hope for rapid scale up of adult male circumcision in resource
      limited settings.

      Once the safety and efficacy have been established, it is important to conduct operations
      research to determine how best to implement both device and surgical circumcisions in the
      national program. Thus, the Zimbabwe MOHCW is planning a three phase trial in order to
      determine the safety of the PrePexTM device, its performance and the ease of use in an
      implementation roll out.
