  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In cases of Plantar Fasciitis not responding to conservative management, minimally invasive
      techniques may be used. These include platelet rich plasma injections and corticosteroid
      injections. Corticosteroids have long been used for symptomatic relief. However there are
      growth factors present in PRP injections that contribute to the healing of the pathology, and
      not just symptom control.

      A single blind, prospective, randomized, comparative, control study will be performed. The
      study population consists of a total of 80 participants. They will be randomly assigned to
      receive either a corticosteroid injection, or a platelet rich plasma injection. Data will be
      collected through questionnaires and ultrasound findings. Patients will have a follow up at
      3, 6, 12, and 24 weeks after they receive their injection.

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Pain will be measured using the visual analogue score (VAS). The score is a 10cm line, where each centimeter is marked between 0-10. Patients will mark the number that corresponds to their pain, where zero is no pain and 10 being the most severe pain.
Every patient must at least have a pre and post intervention score recorded. Subsequent follow-ups will also require patients to fill out a VAS score. A 30% reduction between baseline and endpoint score over a period of 6 months, without the use of analgesia beyond what is allowed according to protocol, use of adjunctive conservative therapy (excluding physiotherapy), or the patient seeking alternative therapy, will deem the treatment successful. The reduction is calculated by subtracting the baseline value from the endpoint value. The percent change is determined by multiplying the reduction by 100 and dividing by 10.</description>

    <measure>Ultrasound findings</measure>

    <description>All patients will have an ultrasound pre and three and six months post intervention. The thickness of the plantar fascia will be measured.
Any decrease in the thickness will be taken into account and contributed to a successful intervention</description>

    <description>The use of corticosteroid injections to treat heel pain has been a relatively common practice. They are mainly used in conjunction with other modes of conservative therapies. With a 10cc syringe, 3 mL of 0.5% Bupivacaine and 2 mL of 80mg Depo Medrol are injected into the medial calcaneal tubercle using an aseptic technique.</description>

    <intervention_name>Platelet rich plasma injection</intervention_name>
    <description>10-15cc of patient's blood is drawn and centrifuged in a Rotofix 32A at 1500 cycles/minute for 5 minutes to separate the platelets from the other components of blood. 4-6cc of concentrated platelets are then re-injected into the medial calcaneal tuberosity using an aseptic technique. Sterile techniques are very important in this procedure to decrease the risk of infection.</description>
