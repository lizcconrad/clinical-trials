      Introduction

      Modern treatment of peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) combines an aggressive cytoreductive
      surgery (CRS) of all macroscopic disease and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy
      (HIPEC) performed at the time of surgery. It is considered a high risk procedure and
      post-operative intra-abdominal bleeding is a major issue as it can delay recovery and promote
      intra-abdominal infections. In most severe cases (10 to 20% of patients), a second surgery to
      control the bleeding will be necessary. Major causes of bleeding are : radical resection,
      extensive peritonectomy, length of surgery, massive transfusion and use of HIPEC.

      To reduce the risk of intra-abdominal hemorrhage, many strategies have been tried and one of
      these is the liberal use of FloSeal, but there is no data in this particular field of
      interest. Over the last 18 months, the investigators have started to use FloSeal in all their
      cases with large PC and they have observed a dramatic reduction in the rate of reoperation
      for bleeding and probably secondarily, in the use of blood products, but this has not been
      measured.

      Hypothesis

      FloSeal can reduce the risk of bleeding after CRS and HIPEC procedure.

      Primary objective

      To evaluate if the use of FloSeal can reduce the risk of reoperation after CRS and HIPEC
      procedure in the treatment of PC.

      Secondary objectives

        -  To evaluate if the use of FloSeal can reduce operative blood loss.

        -  To evaluate if the use of FloSeal can reduce the need of blood products after CRS and
           HIPEC procedure.

        -  To evaluate if the use of FloSeal can have an impact on other common surgical
           complications (which can be indirectly bleeding related).

        -  To evaluate if the use of FloSeal can have an impact on length of hospital stay.
