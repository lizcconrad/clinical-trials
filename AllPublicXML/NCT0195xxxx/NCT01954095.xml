  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to analyze how the body handles and responds to progesterone
      treatment in parous and nulliparous women at risk of pre-term birth.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      17-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17-OHPC) has recently been shown to reduce the rate of
      recurrent preterm birth while intravaginal progesterone has been shown to reduce the rate of
      preterm birth in women with short cervix. While these interventions have reduced the rate of
      preterm birth, the mechanisms of action of these medications are unknown. The objective of
      this study is to collect and analyze blood and cervicovaginal fluids from pregnant women
      receiving these medications or other interventions such as cerclage, pessary, NSAIDs, and
      combinations thereof. The goal of the analyses is to assess the impact of these interventions
      on the cervical proteome, cervical cytokines and cervical structure and to identify potential
      biomarkers of response and non-response thus providing insights into the mechanisms of action
      of these drugs.

        This study consists of 4 groups of women who are between 16 0/7 - 23 6/7 weeks gestation.
        The allocation of a subject to a group is based on two objective assessments (history of
        preterm birth and cervical length) and the joint clinical decision of the woman and her
        physician regarding treatment options.

        Study participants who have no prior preterm births and a normal cervical length will be
        assigned to Group 1. If the participant has no prior preterm births and a short cervical
        length, she will be assigned to Group 2 regardless of treatment or no treatment. Group
        assignment for women with a prior preterm birth and normal cervical length is based on
        17-OHPC use. Participants who elect to use 17-OHPC will be assigned to Group 3 and those
        who choose not to receive any treatment will be assigned to Group 4.
