  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The object of this study is to compare &quot;100g Standard Noodles &quot; with traditional
      carbohydrates including 75g glucose solution in 300ml water and 100g steamed bread in the
      diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.

      In this study, we will compare the different effects of &quot;100g Standard Noodles Tolerance
      Test&quot;and &quot;75g Oral Glucose Tolerance Test&quot;on plasma glucose, insulin, c- peptide level and
      the relevant hormones level including glucagon-like peptide-1( GLP-1) and glucagon. Besides,
      in part of the subjects, the difference between &quot;100g Steamed Bread Tolerance Test&quot;, &quot;100g
      Standard Noodles Tolerance Test&quot; and &quot;75g Oral Glucose Tolerance Test&quot; will be further
      evaluated.
