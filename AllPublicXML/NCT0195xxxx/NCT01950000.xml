  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Few studies have addressed the situation of procedural pain and the use of
      preemptive analgesia for turning in patients under mechanical ventilation.

      Aim: Evaluation effect of preemptive fentanyl on the incidence of pain during turning
      maneuvers in critically ill patients under mechanical ventilation.

      Design: Single-center clinical trial, national, randomized, double-blind, with a parallel
      group, and two arms of treatment: saline placebo and fentanyl.

      Primary Endpoint: Incidence of pain during the turning procedures that are carried out by
      nurses measured by means of the Behavioral Pain Scale (BPS).

      Study Population: Critically ill patients, age &gt; 18 years, admitted to ICU and expected to
      require mechanical ventilation for at least 24 h.

      Sample Size: 80 patients divided into the two groups (40 patients each). Statistical
      Analysis: A preliminary descriptive analysis will be carried. Later, results of primary end
      point will be comparing after the eventual corrections of corresponding variables using a
      multivariable approach. The AUC variable will be analyzed by a t-test for unpaired data. A
      second analysis using a multivariate approach will be carried out for those factors
      considered as clinically relevant in relation to pain and therefore a logistic regression
      will be used.

      Ethical Considerations: The study will be strictly conducted following the Declaration of
      Helsinki and the protocol and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to ensure compliance with
      the Good Clinical Practice (GCP) standards. It is the responsibility of the researcher to
      obtain the valid informed consent from the guardian / legal representative, as the patient's
      condition will not allow to consent. Before obtaining the consent the investigator will
      explain to each guardian / legal representative the nature of the study, its purpose, the
      procedures, the estimated duration, the potential risks and benefits associated with the
      participation, as well as any inconvenience that this may involve.

      Duration of Treatment: The treatment has a maximum duration of 60 min for each patient. The
      follow-up includes visits and has duration of 6 consecutive days.

      Safety Assessment: Potential side effects of treatments will be recorded. Frequent adverse
      effects of fentanyl administration include respiratory depression, apnea, muscle rigidity,
      bradycardia and transient hypotension.

    <description>For this study Fentanest doses were adjusted based on published guidelines from the values recommended media to a whole number and differentiating two groups of patients (multiple trauma / surgical or medical) The maximum dose is 100 mcg Fentanest. The multiple trauma patients / surgical 1.5 mcg / kg and in medical patients 1.0 mcg / kg were given a single bolus Fentanest / Placebo by type of patient (surgical / multiple trauma or physician) 5 'before turning mobilization with personal hygiene.
The bolus is given slowly (30'') intravenously, to be preferred by a peripheral without vasoactive drugs (only with fluid therapy).
Pharmaceutical form:
Sterile solution for injection. Each mL of injectable solution contains the equivalent of 0.05 mg of Fentanest; Excipients: sodium chloride and water for injection.</description>
