    <textblock>
      Diagnosis of late-onset sepsis is difficult in the absence of specific clinical signs and
      biological markers in the infection initial phase .The aim of this study is to determine the
      performance of a new infection marker : Neutrophil CD64 for early diagnosis in nosocomial
      infection (NI) in preterm newborns.

      METHODS :

        -  Monocentric prospective study including preterm newborn infants (&lt;37 weeks of
           gestationnal age ) with clinical suspicion of nosocomial infection in a neonatal
           intensice care unit (Neonatal intensive care unit of Montpellier, France).

        -  Patients will be enrolled in the study after informed consents. Rapid and automated CD64
           measurment will be realized during the conventional blood sample including C-Reactive
           Protein (CRP), Procalcitonin (PCT) and blood culture.

        -  Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy can be started on the advice of clinician and blinded
           the result of CD64. Patients will be then classed in three groups using CDC criteria
           (center for disease control) : 1-no infection, 2-infection, 3-possible infection during
           the multidisciplinary staff. Specificity, sensitivity, negative and positive value of
           CD64 will be calculated and the performances of CRP, PCT and CD64 will be compared.

           153 patients are needed in the study enrolled during a period of 12 months.

      PERSPECTIVES Neutrophil CD64 monitoring might be help clinicians to manage nosocomial
      infections in neonates.CD64 allow to integrate in a decision algorithm with the determination
      of the best cut-off value to faster processing nosocomial infections and could help to reduce
      unnecessary antibioc therapy. A rapid technique for determination of CD64 should be readily
      available in our unit.

    <description>blood sample in newborn preterms suspected of nosocomial infection (neoCD64 arm)
When late-onset sepsis is suspected, blood samples are obtained from peripheral veins for a complete blood count, measurement of CRP and PCT concentration and one bacterial culture acording to the current recommendation of the CDC. CD64 concentration measurement require 0.2 ml aditionnal blood.</description>
