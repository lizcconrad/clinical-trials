      This study aims to verify if patients with nerve-related leg pain benefits from neurodynamic
      treatment over two weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nerve-related leg pain (NRLP) although less prevalent than low back pain itself, is
      associated with higher economic and social burden, and has been considered a predictor of
      chronicity and disability among subjects with low back pain.

      Numerous approaches are proposed for its management; however, evidence regarding the best
      therapeutic approach is lacking. Neurodynamic techniques are proposed to be effective to
      manage NRLP.

      Thus, this study aims to verify, through a randomized controlled trial, the effectiveness of
      a two-week program of neurodynamic techniques on pain and disability in individuals with
      NRLP.

    <description>Patients allocated to this group will receive three different neurodynamic techniques: a lumbar foramen dynamic opener; a side-lying slider and a slider in the slump position. Patients will be asked to perform home exercises (a slider and a tensioner technique). Treatment will receive four treatments during two weeks (two sessions/week).</description>

    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients allocated to Control Group (CG) will receive no intervention and will be advised according to the best evidence available; i.e, advice to remain active and to resume activities of daily living
Upon trial completion, treatment will be offered.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Procedure</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Neurodynamic Group</intervention_name>
    <description>All techniques will be executed in a pain-free way (grade III). Mild discomfort will be accepted, but it must subside as soon as the technique ends.
In the dynamic opener technique, patient will be positioned in side-lying, with the affected side upwards. The therapist will then perform grade III oscillations aiming to open the lumbar foramen;
In the side-lying slider, the patient will be in side-lying with the affected side upwards. A combination of knee and hip flexion and extension movements will produce sliding in the neural structures;
In the slump slider, the patient will be seated in slump position. Combinations between neck and knee movements will produce greater nerve excursion than the side-lying slider. Patients will perform the slump slider in a pain-free manner.</description>
