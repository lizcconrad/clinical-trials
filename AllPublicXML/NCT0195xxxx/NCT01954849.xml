    <textblock>
      This study investigates the efficacy of a proprietary probiotic formulation comprising 6
      strains of bacteria in reducing inflammation and gingivitis in pediatric patients between 11
      and 18 years old undergoing orthodontics treatment. Patients will be recruited based on a
      prior diagnosis of mild to moderate gingivitis by gingival index score. Participants in this
      study will be randomly assigned to receive either the probiotic treatment or a placebo, both
      in the form of a dissolving lozenge; for which the placebo is exactly the same shape,
      texture, taste, and composition as the probiotic treatment, but does not contain the active
      probiotic ingredients. The lozenges are to be taken orally at a certain prescribed regimen
      for 28 days. Participants will be assessed for gingivitis scores, gum bleeding scores, plaque
      scores, overall periodontal health, and for precarious areas at baseline, 14, and 28 days.
      They will also be assessed for the same measures at day 56, following a 28-day wash-out
      phase. Plaque and saliva samples will be collected at all timepoints for in vitro analyses of
      changes in microbial pathogens and/or inflammatory cytokines.

    <time_frame>0, 14, 28, and 56 days</time_frame>
    <description>Gingivitis will be assessed by gingival index:
0 - Absence of gingival inflammation
- Mild inflammation: slight change in colour, little change in texture of any portion of but not the entire marginal or papillary gingival unit
- Mild inflammation: criteria as above, but involving the entire marginal or papillary gingival unit
- Moderate inflammation: glazing, redness, edema, and/or hypertrophy of the marginal or papillary gingival unit
- Severe inflammation: marked redness, edema, and/or hypertrophy of marginal or papillary gingival unit; spontaneous bleeding, congestion or ulceration.</description>

    <measure>Reduced plaque</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 14, 28, and 56 days</time_frame>
    <description>Reduction in levels of plaque as measured by a plaque index:
0 - No plaque in the gingival area
- A film of plaque adhering to the free gingival margin and adjacent area of the tooth, which can not be seen with the naked eye. Only seen by running a probe across the tooth surface
- Moderate accumulation of plaque deposits within the gingival pocket, on the gingival margin and/ or adjacent tooth surface, which can be seen with the naked eye
- Abundance of soft matter within the gingival pocket and/or on the gingival margin and adjacent tooth surface</description>
