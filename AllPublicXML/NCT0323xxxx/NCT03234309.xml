    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies ferumoxytol in the magnetic resonance imaging of pediatric
      patients with brain tumors. Magnetic resonance imaging using ferumoxytol may help in viewing
      a brain tumor and blood vessels in and around the tumor in a different way than the standard
      gadolinium-based contrast agent. Imaging with this experimental contrast agent may give
      doctors more information about tumor blood supply and the extent of the tumor itself.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Testing the superiority of ferumoxytol-based steady state (SS)-cerebral blood volume (CBV)
      maps over gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA)-based dynamic susceptibility weighted
      (DSC)-CBV maps in visualizing pediatric brain tumor blood volume maps.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Correlation of relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) with histology and genetic markers.

      II. Assessment of therapeutic response. III. Assessment of late ferumoxytol enhancement at
      various stages of disease.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with GBCA per standard of care over 45-60
      minutes and then receive ferumoxytol intravenously (IV) followed by MRI over 10 minutes on
      day 1. Patients may optionally undergo MRI over 30 minutes without any contrast agent on day
      2. Each study visit consisting of 2 days may repeat no more frequently than 4 weeks for up to
      5 study visits at different stages of the disease as determined by the investigator.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 2 and 6 weeks and then periodically
      for 5 years.

    <description>For the assessment of therapeutic response, enhancing areas will be categorized as active tumor or therapy related changes based on relative cerebral blood volume values. Different cutoff points (e.g. 1.5, 1.75 and 2) will be tested for relative cerebral blood volume value from both steady state and dynamic susceptibility weighted maps, and disease status will be confirmed with subsequent magnetic resonance imaging results as recommended by Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Criteria or histopathology from additional surgeries (?gold standard?).</description>
