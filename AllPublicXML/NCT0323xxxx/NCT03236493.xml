    <textblock>
      This study is a phase 1 study of PF-06700841. PF-06700841 is being developed for treatment of
      inflammatory bowel disease. The goal of the study is to assess the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of PF-06700841 after multiple oral doses of PF-06700841
      in Japanese healthy volunteers.
