      This study is a randomized controlled parallel arms trial. The purpose of this study is to
      evaluate if prescribing exercise in pregnancy can change maternal behavior towards exercise.
      Once screened and consented, participants will be randomized to either the intervention or
      control group in a 1:1 fashion. The intervention group will receive the PARMED-X prescription
      and the control group will receive routine care as usual. Physical activity will be monitored
      with a Polar fitness tracking device.

      Maternal and neonatal outcomes will be collected from the electronic medical record. Maternal
      outcomes include demographics, total gestational weight gain, pre-pregnancy body mass index
      (BMI), BMI at the time of delivery, mode of delivery, glucose screen value, presence or
      absence of gestational diabetes and presence or absence of hypertensive disorders of
      pregnancy. Neonatal outcomes include gestational age at delivery, birth weight, Apgar scores,
      arterial cord blood gases.

      Psychological outcomes will also be assessed using several validated scales in pregnancy
      including The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and The State Trait Anxiety
      Inventory (STAI).
