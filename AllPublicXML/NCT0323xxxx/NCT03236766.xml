  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will enroll 100 Samoan and 100 Marshallese adults to discuss mental health, mental
      disorders, and approaches for engaging Pacific Islander adults with mental illness into
      mental health services.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite enduring high mental health burden, Pacific Islanders have received minimal research
      or clinical attention in the US. Due to our poor understanding of the issues surrounding
      Pacific Islander mental health, engaging Pacific Islanders in mental health services has been
      very difficult.

      This study draws from the Cultural Determinants of Help-Seeking Model to address this
      research and clinical gap by conducting focus groups and citizens' panels to obtain public
      input from 50 Samoans in LAC and 50 Marshallese in Arkansas on their unique mental health
      perspectives, needs, barriers and facilitators to services, and strategies to overcome these
      barriers. The citizens' panels will bring together lay public members, present multiple
      viewpoints about various mental health issues, and have members deliberate and reach a
      collective decision on these issues. All group materials will be translated into English,
      Samoan, and Marshallese, and interpreters will be present during the sessions. The groups
      will be audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed by the Research Team for themes.
      Numerical data will also be collected about levels of public awareness about mental illness,
      mental health stigma, acculturation, and underutilization of mental health services from 100
      Samoan and 100 Marshallese community members to better understand these possible service
      barriers.

      Analyzed data will be used to develop a set of intervention components that are likely to
      increase service engagement among both Samoans and Marshallese. These components will provide
      the foundation for a universal service engagement intervention for Pacific Islanders that
      will be developed and tested in future research.
