      Admission CTG for 20 minutes Settings on a CTG machine was standardised to enable a
      consistent approach of interpretation of traces. Paper speed of 3cm per minute will be
      adopted. Maternal heart rate was recorded and noted on CTG. Following birth date, time and
      mode of delivery will be labelled on CTG.

      Magnesium sulphate was administered by continuous intravenous infusion according to our
      hospital protocol as follows:

        -  Loading dose: 4-6 gm of magnesium sulphate diluted in 100 mL of IV fluid administered
           over 15-20 min.

        -  Maintenance dose: 2 gm/hr in 100 mL of IV infusion to be continued for 24 hours after
           delivery.

      Another 20 minutes CTG strip will be performed 20 minutes after administration of IV loading
      MgSO4, 7H2O and thus ensuring that MgSO4 has reached peak serum levels

      Admission CTG:

      Admission CTG will be performed for 20 minutes

      I-Settings:

        1. Settings on a CTG machine will be standardised to enable a consistent approach of
           interpretation of traces.

        2. Paper speed of 3cm per minute will be adopted.

        3. CTGs will be labelled with mother's name, hospital number.

        4. Date and time settings on machines will be labelled at commencement of tracing.

        5. Maternal heart rate will be recorded and noted on CTG.

        6. Following birth date, time and mode of delivery will be labelled on CTG.

      Magnesium Sulphate hepatahydrate administration:

      Magnesium sulphate will be administered by continuous intravenous infusion according to our
      hospital protocol as follows:

        -  Loading dose: 4-6 gm of magnesium sulphate diluted in 100 mL of IV fluid administered
           over 15-20 min.

        -  Maintenance dose: 2 gm/hr in 100 mL of IV infusion to be continued for 24 hours after
           delivery.

        -  Magnesium toxicity was monitored by hourly assessment of:

             1. Patellar reflexes should be present.

             2. Respiratory rate not &lt; 16/min.

             3. Urine output not &lt; 100ml / hr. Another 20 minutes CTG strip will be performed 20
                minutes after administration of IV loading MgSO4, 7H2O and thus ensuring that MgSO4
                has reached peak serum levels
