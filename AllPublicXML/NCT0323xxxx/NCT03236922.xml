  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is clear from multiple accounts in the literature that patients with a vesico-vaginal
      fistula (VVF) involving the bladder neck and/or proximal urethra have a high likelihood of
      residual incontinence. Performing subsequent surgeries after the initial VVF repair risks
      additional complications. Therefore, placement of an autologous sling at the time of initial
      VVF repair would not only assist in covering the fistula, but would also imitate the
      physiologic support that would theoretically improve urethral function. A rectus fascia sling
      would most naturally provide this support and warrants testing against the success of the PC
      sling.

      Using the Goh scoring criteria, Goh class 3 and 4 VVF's are the type most involving the
      urethra. Therefore, this group of patients is the target population for this study. As there
      is currently no standard of care for repairing large urethral defects, this procedural
      technique combined with otherwise standardized fistula repair would not introduce any
      foreseeable harm to patients.
