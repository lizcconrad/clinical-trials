      sixty participants will be divided in to two groups (n=30) of patient treated by partial
      caries removal according to the capping material (A),where (A1)represents calcium silicate
      group,(A2)represent calcium hydroxide group.Apply light activated calcium silicate for group
      (A1) in deep occlusal caries and taking the base line image after restoring the cavity with
      composite restoration and apply light activated calcium hydroxide for(A2)group in deep
      occlusal caries and taking the base line image after restoring with composite
      restoration.Take follow up image after one year to measure the calcific bridge formation for
      both groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Management of deep carious lesion may constitute a real challenge for the operator.The basic
      idea for treating deep caries is to enhance calcific reparative capacity.Calcium hydroxide
      has been the gold standard as a capping material but there are some drawbacks like
      solubility,gaps formation and mechanical instability so a need for a capping material such as
      calcium silicate has shown several advantages.

      Sixty participants will be divided in to two groups (n=30) of patient treated by partial
      caries removal.The first group(A1) will be treated by light activated calcium silicate and
      the second group(A2) will be treated by light activated calcium hydroxide after partial
      caries removal of deep occlusal caries then restore by composite restoration.Paralleling
      technique using film holders and custom made bite blocks will be used to standardize the
      serial radiographs and to prevent the distortion of the radiographic image.An increase in
      dentin thickness will be measured through sequential imaging by soft ware named Digora
      (Digora Optime,Soredex,Helsinki,Finland) will be used for measurements by digitalizing the
      scanned image.All images will be studied carefully for an increase in dentin thickness
      keeping the reference point constant from the furcation area.

    <description>for the first group light activated calcium silicate can be easily placed by a 20 second light cure and ability to be syringed directly on to the cavity preparation and restore the cavity by composite restoration.
for the second group using light activated calcium hydroxide is placed by placing a disposable tip securely on to the syringe then light cure for 20 seconds depending on the light cure unit and restore the cavity with composite restoration.</description>
