      Objectives Validate the OncAlert RAPID Test, with an NPV ≥(1-prevalence).

      Evaluate the independent and associated contribution of readily available clinical variables
      including age, race, gender, HPV status, socioeconomic level, tobacco, and alcohol use with
      the biopsy and test results.

      Evaluate OncAlert RAPID Test results in patients without immediate biopsy, both at baseline
      and scheduled follow-up visit (approximately 1-3 months), to assess impact on outcome.

      Planned Number of Subjects 800 patients will be followed until pathology of clinically
      directed incisional / diagnostic biopsy pathology report is received.

      An additional 200 'non-biopsy subjects' will be followed then re-evaluated during a 1-3 month
      clinic visit.

      Additional follow up of subject data may continue for up to 2 years. Patient Population

      Cohorts 1a and 1b:

      Subjects with a clinical suspicion of oral potentially malignant disorders, oral or
      oropharyngeal cancer, or both based in part on clinical examination, symptoms, clinical
      history, suspicious lesion(s) in mouth without history of a prior biopsy.

        -  Cohort 1a: oral cavity

        -  Cohort 1b: oropharynx

      Cohort 2:

      Subjects with clinically indicated suspicion of disease but without immediate biopsy, both at
      baseline and scheduled follow-up visit (approximately 1-3 months), Screen Fail Rate A 20%
      Screen Fail Rate is anticipated. Investigational Product Name OncAlert Oral Cancer RAPID Test
      (OncAlert RAPID) Methodology Overview Prospectively collect 5cc of normal saline after a
      combination of swish, gargle and spit into the provided collection specimen cup. Specimens
      will be collected at baseline (time of biopsy) as per standard practice at each site. The
      OncAlert RAPID Test cassette is inserted into the specimen cup and read directly from the
      cassette in 10 minutes. In addition, comprehensive clinical - pathology and patient
      demographic features including age, gender, race, ethnicity, and all pathology biopsy results
      will be collected. Any pertinent additional clinical data including HPV status, socioeconomic
      status, smoking, drinking history, and pertinent features related to oral health will be
      obtained. A central pathology review for all biopsy results will be performed and
      incorporated into the final analyses.

      Overview

      The OncAlert Oral Cancer RAPID Test (OncAlert RAPID) is a qualitative point-of-care lateral
      flow assay to aid in the decision to biopsy in patients with clinical features associated
      with oral potentially malignant disorders and or oral/oropharyngeal cancer (i.e. head and
      neck squamous cell carcinoma).

      Proposed Intended Use Statement

      The device measures soluble CD44 and total protein in saliva samples collected in saline. The
      test is an adjunct to the biopsy decision process, and not intended as a screening or
      stand-alone diagnostic assay. To be used in adults 23 years and older. Not intended for use
      in pregnant women.

      STUDY OBJECTIVES

      The principal objectives of this study are to:

        -  Validate the OncAlert RAPID Test, with an NPV ≥ (1-prevalence),

        -  Evaluate OncAlert RAPID Test results in patients without immediate biopsy, both at
           baseline and scheduled follow-up visit (approximately 1-3 months), to assess impact on
           outcome,

        -  Evaluate the independent and associated contribution of readily available clinical
           variables including age, race, gender, HPV status, socioeconomic level, tobacco, and
           alcohol use with the biopsy and test results.

      STUDY OVERVIEW

      Study Approach

      Prospectively collect 5cc of normal saline after a combination of swish, gargle and spit into
      the provided collection specimen cup. 1cc will be removed and sequestered for subsequent
      downstream analyses (Section 7). Specimens will be collected at baseline (time of biopsy) as
      per standard practice at each site. The OncAlert RAPID Test cassette is inserted into the
      specimen cup and read directly from the cassette in 10 minutes. In addition, acquire
      comprehensive clinical - pathology and patient demographic features including age, gender,
      race, ethnicity, and all pathology biopsy results. Also, obtain any pertinent additional
      clinical data including HPV status, socioeconomic status, smoking, drinking history, and
      pertinent features related to oral health. It is presumed that some patients within the
      current biopsy protocol will undergo treatment as a result of the biopsy diagnosis. The
      clinical-pathology data, when accessible, for these patients will be collected for subsequent
      secondary analyses. A central pathology review for all biopsy results will be performed and
      incorporated into the final analyses.

      Study Duration

      Cohorts 1a and 1b patients will be followed until pathology of clinically directed incisional
      / diagnostic biopsy pathology report is received.

      Cohort 2 patients not having an initial incisional / diagnostic biopsy will have an
      additional OncAlert RAPID test performed within 1-3 months of initial visit as per clinical
      indications and followed as per 7.2.1, specifically if a biopsy is performed.

      It is anticipated that the study will continue up to 1.5-years to collect all pertinent
      clinical information on enrolled subjects.
