  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess barriers that prevent obesity patients from receiving adequate care
      for their condition. The non-interventional study will be administered in the form of a
      30-minute, cross-sectional, online survey to various respondents. There is no experimentation
      involved in the process of data collection, and each survey poses minimal human risk.

      The study will evaluate lifestyle habits and weight management strategies perceived and/or
      practiced by each of 3 stakeholders in obesity: Patients (People with obesity), Providers,
      and Employers. A customized survey will be administered to each of the 3 stakeholders, and
      data will be analyzed based on respondents' answers.

        join with the understanding they would complete periodic surveys. Members of this panel are
        not associated with any specific site or organization. Recruitment of these respondents is
        based on voluntary participation; invitations are sent to the personal e-mail accounts of
        each respondent.
