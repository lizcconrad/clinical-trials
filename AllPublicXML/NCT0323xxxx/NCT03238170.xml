  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the feasibility of acquiring an MR scan in the radiotherapy treatment position as
      part of the patient's radiotherapy pathway and incorporating the data into our radiotherapy
      planning systems, so that it can be potentially used to reduce healthy tissue exposure to
      radiation. Subsequently, the protocols and procedures established can be used to put the
      technique into routine clinical practice.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Conventional radiotherapy treatment planning uses computed tomography (CT) scans to provide
      an accurate 3-D picture of the local anatomy. This helps the planners to maximise the
      radiation dose delivered to the prostate, whilst minimising the dose to surrounding normal
      tissue. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning is an established diagnostic imaging
      technique that provides even clearer images of the local anatomy. However, until recently the
      technology hasn't existed to allow us to perform MRI scans with patients &quot;set-up&quot; in the
      position required to plan and deliver radiotherapy to the prostate. This study is being
      performed to assess methods that may allow us to incorporate MRI scans into the radiotherapy
      planning process, which may further increase the accuracy of the treatment, reducing the
      irradiation of surrounding normal tissue and minimising toxicity.
