      The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) is a test used to detect cognitive impairments. This
      test is available in different languages including french. A short version (the 5 minutes
      MOCA) has also been validated through a phone call use that allows to develop some
      epidemiological approaches. Nevertheless, this short version has not been validated in
      french.

      The main aim of the study is to validate the french translation of the short version of the
      MOCA as compared the the full french version of the test.

      To validate the short version, several groups of subjects will be included : healthy
      subjects, Alzheimer disease patients, Parkinson or Huntington diseases patients as well as
      diabetic patients.

      The inclusion of both healthy subjects and patients with different types of cognitive
      impairments will allow to validate the short version of the test.

      All subjects and patients will first be submitted to the full version of the MOCA during a
      face to face procedure. Thirty to forty days later, they will be submitted to the short
      version of the test through a phone call performed by an independent rater.

      Subgroups of healthy subjects and patients will also be used to determine the test-retest and
      inter-rater reliability of the short version of the MOCA.
