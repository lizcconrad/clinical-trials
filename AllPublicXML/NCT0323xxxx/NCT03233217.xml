      This phase I/II, randomized, modified double-blind, multi-center study will assess the safety
      and immunogenicity of a high-dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV-HD) in older adults
      (≥65 years).

      This phase I/II, randomized, modified double-blind, multi-center study will be conducted in
      175 healthy Japanese adults aged 65 years and older to describe the safety profile and immune
      responses (geometric mean titers and seroconversion for the 4 common strains at 28 days
      post-vaccination) of the QIV-HD administered by IM and SC methods. A local QIV-SD
      administered by SC method will serve as a control arm.

    <intervention_model_description>Safety and tolerability will be initially assessed in the first 10 participants in a smaller cohort (Cohort 1). Participants will be randomized 1:1 into 2 groups in Cohort 1: QIV-HD by intramuscular (IM) route (n=5) and QIV-HD by subcutaneous (SC) route (n=5).
After review of the local and systemic adverse events, the remaining 165 participants will be enrolled (Cohort 2). Participants will be randomized 1:1:1 into 3 groups in Cohort 2: QIV-HD by IM route (n=55), QIV-HD by SC route (n=55), and standard-dose Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine (QIV-SD) by SC route (n=55).</intervention_model_description>

The participants and the Investigator/Sub-investigator in charge of the safety assessment will be blinded in order to decrease the potential bias in safety assessment.</masking_description>
