  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human immuno deficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infections continues to be a serious health threat
      throughout the world and development of medicines with new mechanism of action have an
      important role to play. GSK3640254 is a maturation inhibitor (MI) and can be effective in
      HIV-1 treatment. This randomized, 2-part, single and repeat increasing dose study will
      collect information on safety, tolerability and drug levels in the body of in healthy
      subjects for GSK3640254. The information collected in this study will help in further
      clinical development of GSK3640254, including a Phase IIA Proof of Concept (PoC) study in
      HIV-infected subjects. Approximately 16 healthy subjects will be randomized to receive single
      oral dose of GSK3640254 and placebo in Part 1 and approximately 56 healthy subjects will be
      randomized to receive repeat oral dose of GSK3640254 or placebo in Part 2. All doses will be
      given immediately after a moderate fat meal. Maximum duration of study participation will be
      approximately 12 weeks.
