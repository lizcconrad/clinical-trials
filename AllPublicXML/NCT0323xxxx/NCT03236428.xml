  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a drug as a possible treatment for Monoclonal Gammopathy of
      Unknown Significance (MGUS) or Smoldering Multiple Myeloma (SMM).

      The drug involved in this study is:

      -Daratumumab
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial, which tests the effectiveness of an
      investigational drug. Preliminary experience suggests that daratumumab may prevent or
      postpone SMM from becoming active multiple myeloma. The purpose of this research study is to
      determine if the this drug may improve the rate of prevention of multiple myeloma.

      Multiple myeloma is a cancer of the plasma cell, which is an important part of the immune
      system. Patients with active multiple myeloma generally require treatment. There are
      currently no approved therapies for smoldering multiple myeloma or Monoclonal Gammopathy of
      Unknown Significance.

      Daratumumab is a drug that may kill or stop cancer cells from growing through a variety of
      mechanisms by attaching to the CD38 molecule, which is over-expressed in multiple myeloma
      cells. This type of drug is called a monoclonal antibody. The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration) has not approved Daratumumab for the participant specific disease but it has
      been approved for use in active Multiple Myeloma.

             positive for hepatitis B core antibody or hepatitis B surface antigen must have a
             negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result before enrollment. Those who are PCR
             positive will be excluded.

          -  Major surgery within 4 weeks before enrollment.

          -  Subject is known or suspected of not being able to comply with the study protocol (eg,
             because of alcoholism, drug dependency, or psychological disorder). Subject has any
             condition for which, in the opinion of the investigator, participation would not be in
             the best interest of the subject (eg, compromise the well-being) or that could
             prevent, limit, or confound the protocol-specified assessments.

             administration

             months before randomization, a history of additional risk factors for torsades de
             pointes (eg, electrolyte abnormalities, family history of Long QT Syndrome), or a
             family history of sudden cardiac death before age 40.

          -  Participation in other therapeutic clinical trials, including those with other
             investigational agents not included in this trial, within 30 days of the start of this
