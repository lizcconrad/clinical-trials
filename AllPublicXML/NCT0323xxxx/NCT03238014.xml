  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High-intensity noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV), which can well improve the
      gas exchange and reduce the work of breathing of patients, is a new strategy targeted at
      maximally reducing arterial carbon dioxide. However, no definitive conclusions have been
      drawn to decide whether high-intensity NPPV is the best setting for treating patients with
      chronic hypercapnic COPD. For now, no unified method for setting up high-pressure NPPV has
      been established. Most of the trials utilized gradually increased inspiratory positive airway
      pressure depending on the patient's tolerance. However, from a respiratory physiology point
      of view, excessive inspiratory positive airway pressure may lead to lung hyperinflation,
      increased intrinsic positive end expiratory pressures, increased oxygen consumption, and
      ineffective work of breathing.Therefore, seeking a method to establish individualized
      high-intensity NPPV is of vital importance.
