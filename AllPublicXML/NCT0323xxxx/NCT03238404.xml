      Patients with advanced gastric cancer received neoadjuvant chemotherapy undergo enhanced
      recovery after surgery (ERAS) programs.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) programs were applied in gastrectomy
      in areas with a high prevalence of gastric cancer, such as China and Japan, confirming that
      ERAS programs accelerate the postoperative rehabilitation of gastric cancer patients without
      increasing the occurrence rate of postoperative complications. However, in most studies on
      ERAS for gastric cancer, patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy were excluded.
      Investigators designed this study aimed to evaluate whether patients who receive neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy can enrolled into enhanced recovery after surgery programs for locally advanced
      gastric cancer.

    <description>NAC is the name of a procedure. NAC doesn't mean different interventions are used. Patients in this group need receive this NAC procedure instead of one drug before the gastrectomy and ERAS. The program consists of an intravenous injection of 130 mg/m2 oxaliplatin on day 1, followed by oral administration of 50 mg tegafur gimerac (the name of an anticarcinogen) twice daily on days 1-14, every 3 weeks.</description>
