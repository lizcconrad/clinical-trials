  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has two aims: 1) to characterize the effects of intravenous ketamine on
      neurocognitive markers in depressed patients; 2) to test the efficacy of a synergistic
      intervention for depression combining intravenous ketamine with neurocognitive training.

          2. have not responded to one or more adequate trials of FDA-approved antidepressants
             within the current depressive episode, determined by Antidepressant Treatment History
             Form

          3. score ≥ 25 on the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)

          4. score &gt;1SD above the normative mean on the Cognitive Triad Inventory &quot;self&quot; subscale
             *OR* &lt;1SD below the normative mean on the Rosenberg self-esteem scale

          5. possess a level of understanding sufficient to agree to all tests and examinations
             required by the protocol and must sign an informed consent document

          6. agree to sign a release of information (ROI), identifying another individual [friend,

             objects in their body, especially in the eye. Dental fillings do not present a
             problem. Plastic or removable dental appliances do not require exclusion. History of

         13. Past intolerance or hypersensitivity to ketamine or midazolam.

         14. Patients taking medications with known activity at the NMDA or AMPA glutamate receptor
             [e.g., riluzole, amantadine, lamotrigine, memantine, topiramate, dextromethorphan,
             D-cycloserine], or the muopioid receptor.
