    <textblock>
      Survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is time critical and diminishes rapidly without
      appropriate intervention. Bystander CPR at least doubles the chances of survival and the
      additional use of a public access defibrillator (PAD) can again double overall survival
      rates. PADs are designed to be easy and simple to use, but whether untrained bystanders can
      use them safely and effectively is unknown. This study will aim to assess the ability of
      untrained bystanders to deploy a PAD in a simulated cardiac arrest.

    <textblock>
      Survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is time critical and diminishes rapidly without
      appropriate intervention. Overall survival is no more than 10% in the UK.

      Bystander CPR at least doubles the chances of survival and the additional use of a public
      access defibrillator (PAD) can again double overall survival rates. Because PADs can make
      such a dramatic increase in chances of survival, public health programmes have encouraged the
      deployment of PADs in areas of high public density in order to deliver early defibrillation
      prior to ambulance arrival. Where this can be achieved, survival rates as high as 50% have
      been reported.

      PADs are designed to be easy and simple to use, and in addition to graphical instructions on
      the device, give verbal instructions to a rescuer in order to ensure the PAD is used
      correctly. Most bystanders who are first on scene at a cardiac arrest have no first aid
      training and it is not always possible to wait for someone with first aid training to be
      available to use a PAD. Several guidelines, such as those from the Resuscitation Council
      (UK), state that untrained bystanders can use a PAD, but there has been little evaluation to
      understand whether this can safely and effectively be achieved without specific PAD training.

      This study will aim to assess the ability of untrained bystanders to safely and effectively
      deploy a PAD in a simulated cardiac arrest, specifically aiming to identify differences
      between the features of different devices that improve their ease of use in order to
      understand what design features are required for optimal design.
