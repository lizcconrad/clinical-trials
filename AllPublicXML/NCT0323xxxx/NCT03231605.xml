    <textblock>
      Hepatitis A is the most prevalent hepatitis which account for approximately 45% . The
      susceptible population is Children and adolescence, also the morbidity in adult presented
      rising trend in recent years. Therefore, vaccination of Hepatitis A Vaccine play an important
      role in National Immunisation Program(China). The aim of this experiment is to verify the
      effects of experimental group non-inferior than control group. The experiment methods is
      compared the difference of seroconversion rate and Antibody geometric mean titer (GMT)between
      experimental and control Hepatitis A Vaccines. In addition, evaluating the safety of two
      Hepatitis A Vaccines in 18-24 months Chinese Children.
