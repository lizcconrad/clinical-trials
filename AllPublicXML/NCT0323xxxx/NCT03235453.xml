  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The randomized clinical trial will aim to analyze the influence of binary and quaternary
      rhythm through a protocol on motor symptoms, sleep, fatigue and quality of life in
      individuals with Parkinson's disease. The study design with a randomized clinical trial,
      including individuals diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease, will be divided into two groups: 1)
      Control group 2) Experimental group. Cognition, balance, gait freezing, functional mobility,
      quality of life, sleep, daytime sleepiness and fatigue will be evaluated. Through the
      application of binary and quaternary rhythm protocol for a period of 12 weeks. First, the
      descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation and percentage) will be used to know the
      data, then the normality calculation using the Kolmogorov Smirnov test will be used to choose
      the statistical tests. All information will be collected before and after the intervention
      period. For statistical analysis, use the SPSS statistical package, version 20.0.
      (Kolmogorov-Smirnov or Shapiro-Wilk test) for the selection of statistical tests.

      The project includes two protocols: (1) Dance binary rhythm and (2) Dance quaternary rhythm.
      Each session will last 45 minutes for each modality, twice a week, over a period of 12 weeks.
      Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate will be seen at the beginning and end of each class. In
      addition to the Effort Perception Scale - Borg Scale used to assess the intensity and / or
      discomfort during physical activity practice in both protocols. In both modalities of
      intervention, the evolution of the movements will always respect the limit of each patient.
      The binary rhythm protocol will be performed through forró, meringue and bolero rhythms, this
      type of methodology was selected, because it is a stimulating rhythm that brings harmony of
      the movements, being able to be associated to improvements in the mobility, balance and
      quality of life of the individuals who Practice it, benefiting patients directly.

      The binary protocol classes will be divided into: heating (10 minutes) focused on dance
      styles that contemplate the binary rhythm, with walks in the marking of the musical rhythm,
      muscular release, breathing, movements for upper and lower limbs, always working musicality .
      The main part (30 minutes) will be divided into two moments, first individually so that the
      teacher can show and teach in a clear way the steps that will be performed then the
      participants will form pairs and perform the steps that were taught them. Every 5 minutes the
      participants will change their pair, so that everyone can have the experience of dancing with
      their colleagues. And to finish it will be carried out a calm return (5 minutes) to provide
      muscular relaxation with stretches and massages.

    <description>The Mini-BESTest test is a 14-item test that focuses on dynamic balance, specifically anticipated transitions, postural responses, sensory orientation, and dynamic gait. Each item is scored from (0-2); A score of 0 indicates that a person is unable to perform the task while a score of 2 is normal.</description>

    <description>Timed Up &amp; Go (TUG), The TUG measures the time it takes an individual to perform some functional maneuvers, such as getting up, walking, taking a walk, and sitting down.
A) less than 20 seconds to perform, corresponds to low risk for falls. B) from 20 to 29 seconds, at medium risk for falls. C) 30 seconds or more at high risk for falls</description>
