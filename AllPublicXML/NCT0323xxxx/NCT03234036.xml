  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in two Parts to confirm the acceptability/selection of a tablet
      formulation for future clinical development of GSK2838232. Part 1 of the study will assess
      single ritonavir (RTV)-boosted doses of a new tablet formulation given with food (containing
      approximately 30% fat) against the reference capsule formulation also given with food and
      then will assess the impact of fasted conditions on the tablet performance. In Part 2,
      non-boosted GSK2838232 will be given as once-daily tablet doses for 11 days in a separate
      group of subjects, assuming the tablet performance is considered acceptable from Part 1.
      Approximately 16 healthy subjects will be enrolled to provide at least 12 evaluable subjects
      through the three study periods in Part 1. 10 healthy subjects will be enrolled to provide at
      least 8 evaluable subjects through the single study period in Part 2. The maximum duration of
      study participation will be approximately 9 to 10 weeks for Part 1; and 8 to 9 weeks for Part
      2.

    <masking_description>Part 1 of the study will be open label and thus not be blinded. Part 2 of the study will be single blinded because of the unavailability of matching placebo tablets.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Between 18 and 55 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent.

          -  Healthy as determined by the Investigator or medically qualified designee based on a

             consultation with the medical monitor, if required, agree and document that the

             the study procedures.

          -  A creatinine clearance (CLcr) &gt; 80 milliliter per minute (mL/min) as determined by
             Cockcroft-Gault equation: CLcr = (140 minus age) multiplied by weight divided by (72
             multiplied by serum creatinine) (times 0.85 if female) where age is in years, weight
             in kilogram (kg), and serum creatinine is in units of milligram per deciliter (mg/dL).

        be enrolled if they are using two forms of complementary contraception, which must include
        at least one barrier method. They will be counseled on safer sex practices. Fertile
