      The aim of our study was to assess the effectiveness of contemporary knee arthroplasty in
      working-age patients (&lt; 65 years) by conducting a prospective cohort study with 2-year follow
      up. Outcomes were measured comprehensively using various patient-reported outcome measures
      (PROMs) to provide information on the effect of knee arthroplasty on pain, satisfaction,
      physical activity, activities of daily living, and quality of life.
