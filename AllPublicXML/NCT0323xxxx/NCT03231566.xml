      To determine if a preoperative pain neuroscience education (PNE) program would result in
      superior outcomes compared to usual preoperative education for total knee arthroplasty (TKA).
      Patients will receive traditional hospital preoperative TKA program (usual care group) or
      receive the same program plus an additional 30-minute PNE program (experimental group). Pre
      and post measurements at 1, 3 and 6 months for pain, function, fear of movement and pain
      catastrophization. We will also compare opioid usage, healthcare expenses and patient
      satisfaction between groups.

    <description>The CG received the traditional hospital preoperative program, which was consistent with current preoperative TKA protocols. The CG received education covering anatomy of the knee joint, information about the joint replacement surgery, what to expect when they were admitted for surgery, what to expect immediately after surgery, pain medications, postoperative rehabilitation/physical therapy, etc. The CG received a hospital-based booklet with this information.</description>

    <description>The EG underwent an additional 30-minute group PNE program, followed by the usual preoperative education program from the hospital. The PNE program used in this TKA study was an adaptation of the PNE program developed for LS. The educational program was designed to be delivered by a physical therapist in a group session to patients prior to their TKA.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  be scheduled to have a TKA and their standard preoperative TKA education program,
             indicate their willingness to participate in the study, ability to read and understand
             English, as the study included the use of an educational booklet, and be able and
             willing to complete outcome data for 6 months after TKA

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Because all potential participants for this study had been screened and cleared for
             their orthopedic surgery, the only exclusion criterion was an unwillingness to
             participate in the study and having had a previous TKA or scheduled for a bilateral
             TKA.
