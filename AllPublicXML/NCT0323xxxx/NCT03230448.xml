  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a strong link between the alcohol consumption and the suicidal risk. Indeed there is
      an increase of the risk of suicide in case of chronic or acute alcohol consumption. However
      why the alcohol consumption increase the suicidal risk is unknown.

      The hypothesis of this study is that the alcohol consumption induced disinhibition and
      facilitates the suicide attempt without premeditation
