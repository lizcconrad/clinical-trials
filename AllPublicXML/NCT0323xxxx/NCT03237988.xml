  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a Phase 1, open-label, randomized, 3-way crossover study to evaluate PK, safety,
      and tolerability of a new tablet formulation of CPI-444 and to evaluate the effect of food on
      single oral doses of CPI-444 tablets in healthy male and female subjects. Potential subjects
      will be screened to assess their eligibility to enter the study within 28 days prior to the
      first dose administration.

          4. Females will be nonpregnant and nonlactating, and females of childbearing potential
             and males will agree to use contraception.

          5. Able to comprehend and willing to sign an Informed Consent Form (ICF) and to abide by
             the study restrictions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             within 30 days prior to first dose.

          3. Females of childbearing potential who are pregnant or lactating. Females of
             non-childbearing potential are defined as permanently sterile or postmenopausal.
             Postmenopausal status will be confirmed with a screening serum follicle-stimulating
             hormone (FSH) level greater than 40 mIU/mL.

          4. A history or evidence of clinically significant gastrointestinal disease, including
             ulcers, gastro-esophageal reflux disease, or gastritis.

          5. A history of alcoholism or drug/chemical abuse within 2 years prior to Period 1
             Check-in.

          6. Regular alcohol consumption of &gt;21 units per week for males and &gt;14 units for females.
             One unit of alcohol equals 12 oz (360 mL) beer, 1½ oz (45 mL) liquor, or 5 oz (150 mL)
             wine.

          7. Positive urine drug screen (confirmed by repeat) at Screening (does not include

          9. Use of tobacco, smoking cessation products, or products containing nicotine
             (including, but not limited to, cigarettes, e-cigarettes, pipes, cigars, chewing
             tobacco, nicotine lozenges, or nicotine gum) within 6 months prior to Period 1

             bilirubin &gt;1.5 × institutional ULN.

         15. A history of seizures (not including simple febrile seizures in childhood);

         16. Multiple drug allergies or allergies to any of the components of CPI-444 tablets or
