  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exposure-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (i.e., &quot;exposure therapy&quot;), which entails
      repeated and prolonged confrontation with feared situations/stimuli, is the most effective
      treatment for anxiety disorders (e.g., arachnophobia). Safety behaviors are actions performed
      to prevent, minimize, or escape a feared catastrophe and/or associated distress (e.g.,
      wearing thick shoes or gloves when around areas where there might be spiders). It is
      understood that safety behaviors contribute to the development and maintenance of anxiety
      disorders; accordingly, patients' safety behaviors are traditionally eliminated as soon as
      possible during exposure therapy (i.e., &quot;response prevention&quot;). Unfortunately, not everyone
      who receives exposure therapy benefits from this approach. To address the limitations of
      exposure's effectiveness, some experts have questioned the clinical convention of response
      prevention during exposure therapy. Specifically, they propose the &quot;judicious use of safety
      behaviors&quot;: the careful and strategic incorporation of safety behaviors during exposure
      therapy. The controversial role of permitting safety behaviors during exposure has garnered
      substantial research attention, yet study findings are mixed. The current study, therefore,
      was designed to improve upon the methodological limitations of previous related research and
      examine the relative efficacy of traditional exposure with response prevention (E/RP) and the
      experimental exposure with the judicious use of safety behaviors (E/JU) in a sample of adults
      with arachnophobia. In light of previous related research, several hypotheses were made
      regarding the short- (posttreatment) and long-term (1-month follow-up) treatment effects:

        1. Primary outcomes: E/RP participants will demonstrate greater improvement in spider
           phobia than the E/JU participants along behavioral and self-report symptom measures at
           follow-up.

        2. Secondary outcomes: Treatment acceptability and tolerability will be higher for E/JU
           participants, relative to E/RP participants, before beginning exposures and at
           posttreatment, but not at follow-up. In addition, hypothesize that E/RP participants
           will report greater reductions in peak distress and greater improvements in distress
           tolerance relative to E/JU participants at follow-up.

        3. Additional outcome: Exploratory analyses will be conducted to compare the relative rate
           of behavioral approach and exposure goal completion between treatment conditions.

    <intervention_model_description>The current study follows a two-arm, parallel group RCT study design. Participants are randomized to either the active control arm (Exposure and Response Prevention) or the experimental arm (Exposure with Judicious Safety Behaviors). Participants are not offered the opportunity to choose their study condition, nor are they provided with an explanation of the difference between their assigned treatment arm and the alternative treatment arm. Randomization was achieved prior to initial participant recruitment via a random number generator with the condition that an equal number of participants be randomized to each condition.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Pre-determined condition allocation was listed in an Excel spreadsheet and concealed with black cell masking color. Interested individuals who met initial eligibility criteria during a pre-enrollment phone screening were entered in the order of screening in the assignment Excel spreadsheet (that was already masked to conceal condition assignment). Only the participant's therapist viewed the allocated condition immediately prior to the first treatment session by temporarily lifting the cell mask.</masking_description>

    <measure>Change from baseline Fear of Spiders Questionnaire Score at 1-month follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Fear of Spiders Questionnaire (FSQ; Szymanski &amp; O'Donahue, 1995) is an 18-item self-report measure of spider phobia. Participants rate their agreement with each statement (e.g., &quot;If I saw a spider now, I would think it will harm me&quot;) on a scale of 0 (totally disagree) to 7 (totally agree). Possible total scores range from 0 to 126, such that higher scores indicate greater spider fear.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline Spider Behavioral Approach Task Score at 1-month follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Spider Behavioral Approach Task (BAT) includes 13 rank-ordered steps ranging from standing at the opposite end of a room containing a tarantula enclosed in a closed terrarium covered with a sheet to allowing the tarantula to crawl up one's bare arm. A participant must perform a BAT step for 10 consecutive seconds for the step to count as completed. BAT scores are recorded as the number of the highest step completed.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Treatment Acceptability and Adherence Scale (TAAS) is a 10-item self-report measure of treatment acceptability and predicted adherence. Participants rate each statement (e.g., &quot;If I participated in this treatment, I would be able to adhere to its requirements&quot;) on a 1 (disagree strongly) to 7 (agree strongly) scale. Possible total scores range from 10 to 70, with higher scores indicating greater treatment acceptability/anticipated adherence.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline BAT Peak Distress Score at 0-48 hours post-treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Within approximately 48 hours post final treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Immediately after completing each step of the BAT (at the baseline and post-treatment assessments), participants are asked to verbally report their (a) anxiety and (b) disgust, using a scale of 0 (not at all) to 10 (maximum). The highest self-reported values are separately recorded as peak BAT anxiety and peak BAT disgust, which are summed together to form a single peak BAT distress value. The post-treatment assessment is administered immediately post-treatment (at the end of the fourth/final treatment session), although participants with scheduling conflicts may complete the post-treatment assessment during another visit as long as it occurs within 48 hours of the final treatment (4th overall) visit.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Within approximately 48 hours post final treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Immediately after completing the BAT, participants are asked: &quot;Regardless of how intense your distress was, how well did you tolerate your distress? That is, how well were you able to manage whatever emotions and sensations came up during the exercise, even if they were very strong?&quot; Participants verbally report ratings of state distress tolerance using a 0 (not at all able to tolerate my distress) to 10 (completely able to tolerate my distress) scale. The post-treatment assessment is administered immediately post-treatment (at the end of the fourth/final treatment session), although participants with scheduling conflicts may complete the post-treatment assessment during another visit as long as it occurs within 48 hours of the final treatment (4th overall) visit.</description>

    <description>Exposure therapy (i.e., exposure-based cognitive behavioral therapy) for spider phobia according to condition-specific, scripted treatment manuals inspired by evidence-based exposure programs for anxiety/phobias (for both arms: Abramowitz, Deacon, &amp; Whiteside, 20011; Antony, Craske, &amp; Barlow, 1995) as well as the seminal account of the &quot;judicious use of safety behaviors&quot; thesis (for the experimental arm only: Rachman, Radomsky, &amp; Shafran, 2008). Exposure and response prevention involves confronting a live spider while resisting safety-seeking behaviors; exposure with judicious safety behaviors involves strategically using safety behaviors while confronting a live spider.</description>
