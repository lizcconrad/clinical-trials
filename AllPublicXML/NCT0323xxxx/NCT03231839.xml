      This study investigates the influence of red meat and fibers on glucose metabolism and body
      fat composition in subjects at increased risk for type 2 diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The epidemiologic evidence for increased red meat intake and decreased fiber intake as risk
      factors for T2D is solid. However, few intervention studies have been performed in order to
      investigate the role of whole-grain intake or the consumption of red meat in glycemic control
      and prevention of diabetes, yielding contradicting results. Thus, in order to prove
      causality, further identify potential underlying mechanisms and be able to improve lifestyle
      modification programs, we performed a randomized, controlled intervention study over six
      months. The participants are individuals at increased risk for tyoe 2 diabetes. They were
      randomised to 3 interventions groups: 1) caloric restriction of 400 kcal/day (control group),
      2) caloric restriction plus no red meat consumption 3) caloric restriction and increase in
      fiber intake. Subjects where thoroughly phenotyped by anthropometric parameters, oral glucose
      tolerance tests, and MRI measurements of body fat composition and iron content in the liver.
      In this study, we want to compare the effectiveness of reduced caloric intake only versus
      reduced caloric intake with an additional modification of diet composition in terms of red
      meat and fiber consumption.
