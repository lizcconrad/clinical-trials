  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety of GDC-0134 in healthy female
      volunteers of non-childbearing potential. The first part of the study will compare the
      bioavailability of a prototype capsule of GDC-0134 relative to an existing GDC-0134 reference
      capsule (Periods 1 and 2). The second part of the study will assess the effect of
      GDC-0134-in-applesauce preparation under fasting conditions, the effect of low and high fat
      foods as well as the effect of elevated stomach pH via pre-treatment with rabeprazole, a
      proton pump inhibitor (PPI), under fasted and high-fat meal conditions (Periods 3 and 4).

    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline until 21 days after the last dose of study drug up to approximately 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events.</description>

             investigator;

          -  History of significant hypersensitivity, intolerance, or allergy to any drug compound,
             food, or other substance, unless approved by the investigator;
