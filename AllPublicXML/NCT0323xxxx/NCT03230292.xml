    <description>Subjects in this cohort will receive dose 1 every four weeks (Q4W) subcutaneously (sc) during the 48-week open-label Treatment Period. There will be an option to increase the dose to dose 2 Q4W at the discretion of the Investigator if the subject's Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) response is &gt;=50% to &lt;75% reduction from the Baseline of PS0016 at Week 12 or later. If the subject's disease is adequately controlled on dose 2 Q4W, they may return to dose 1 Q4W at the discretion of the Investigator.</description>
