  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators compared advantages and disadvantages of two forms of noninvasive
      respiratory support —bi-level positive airway pressure(BiPAP) or nasal continuous positive
      airway pressure (nCPAP) —as a primary mode of ventilation in preterm twins infants with
      respiratory distress syndrome

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Invasive ventilation is related to development of adverse pulmonary and nonpulmonary outcomes
      in ventilated infants. Various modes of noninvasive respiratory support are being
      increasingly used to minimize the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The aim of
      this trial to compare the effects of bi-level positive airway pressure(BiPAP) and nasal
      continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) in preterm twins infants as the primary mode.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Gestational age (GA) is from 26 to 37 weeks;

          -  2. Diagnosis of respiratory distress syndrome. The diagnosis of respiratory distress
             syndrome will be based on clinical manifestations (tachypnea, nasal flaring and or
             grunting) and chest X-ray findings;

          -  3. Respiratory distress syndrome Silverman score &gt;5;

          -  4. Informed parental consent has been obtained.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Severe respiratory distress syndrome requiring early intubation according to the
             American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines for neonatal resuscitation;

          -  2. Major congenital malformations or complex congenital heart disease;

          -  3. Group B hemolytic streptococcus pneumonia, septicemia, pneumothorax, pulmonary
             hemorrhage;

          -  4. Cardiopulmonary arrest needing prolonged resuscitation;

          -  5. transferred out of the neonatal intensive care unit without treatment.
