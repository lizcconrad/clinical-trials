    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of a new critical pathway (use of
      guideline-based patient identification criteria and for those who meet these criteria, use of
      dalbavancin) compared to usual care for the treatment of ABSSI (Acute Bacterial Skin and Skin
      Structure Infections)
