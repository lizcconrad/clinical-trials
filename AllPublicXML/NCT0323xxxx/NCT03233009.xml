    <measure>Visual assessment of cutaneous irritation at 30 minutes post patch removal</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 minutes post patch removal</time_frame>
    <description>Trained evaluator will assess product tolerability through visual assessment of cutaneous irritation at 15-30 minutes after patch removal. Product tolerability will be assessed on the basis of Skin Irritation Scoring System: Scale 1: Dermal Response score from 0 to 7; 0= No evidence of irritation, 1= Minimal erythema, barely perceptible, 2= Definite erythema, readily visible; minimal edema or minimal papular response, 3= Erythema and papules, 4= Definite edema, 5= Erythema, edema and papules, 6= Vesicular eruption, 7= Strong reaction spreading beyond test site. Effects on superficial layers of the skin should be recorded as follows: A (0)= Slight glazed appearance, B (1)= Marked glazed appearance, C (2)= Glazing with peeling and cracking, F (3)=Glazing with fissures, G (3)= Film of dried serous exudate covering all or portion of the patch site, H (3)= Small petechial erosions and/or scabs.</description>

    <description>Trained evaluator will assess product tolerability through visual assessment of cutaneous irritation at 24 ±2 hours after patch removal. Product tolerability will be assessed on the basis of Skin Irritation Scoring System: Scale 1: Dermal Response score from 0 to 7; 0= No evidence of irritation, 1= Minimal erythema, barely perceptible, 2= Definite erythema, readily visible; minimal edema or minimal papular response, 3= Erythema and papules, 4= Definite edema, 5= Erythema, edema and papules, 6= Vesicular eruption, 7= Strong reaction spreading beyond test site.

    <description>Trained evaluator will assess product tolerability through visual assessment of cutaneous irritation at 48 ±2 hours after patch removal. Product tolerability will be assessed on the basis of Skin Irritation Scoring System: Scale 1: Dermal Response score from 0 to 7; 0= No evidence of irritation, 1= Minimal erythema, barely perceptible, 2= Definite erythema, readily visible; minimal edema or minimal papular response, 3= Erythema and papules, 4= Definite edema, 5= Erythema, edema and papules, 6= Vesicular eruption, 7= Strong reaction spreading beyond test site.
