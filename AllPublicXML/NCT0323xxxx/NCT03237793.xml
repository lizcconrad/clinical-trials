      The present study was designed as a randomised controlled clinical trial which was unicenter,
      double-blinded, parallel designed study, according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting
      Trials (CONSORT) criteria, 2010. The study period was from July 2014 to September 2015.

      90 Patients visiting the Out Patient of Department of Periodontology, Krishnadevaraya College
      of Dental Sciences and Hospital, Bengaluru, India, presenting with a chief complaint of
      dentinal hypersensitivity were enrolled in the study. Patients' age ranged from 18-60 years.
      The subjects interested in participating were explained in detail the treatment protocol. A
      verbal consent as well as a written informed consent was obtained from each patient Treatment
      of dentinal hypersensitivity with a combination of diode laser and potassium nitrate
      desensitising agent was considered as the test group and this was compared with diode lasers
      alone and desensitising agent alone as the positive control groups. The study was conducted
      in full accordance with the declared ethical principles (World Medical Association
      Declaration of Helsinki, version VII, 2013)13 and was approved by the Institutional review
      board of Krishnadevaraya College of Dental Science and Hospital, under the registration
      number of (ACA/DCD/SYN/KCODS - B/PG/2013-2014).
