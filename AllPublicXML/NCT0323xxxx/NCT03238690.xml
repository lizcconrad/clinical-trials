  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the potential recovery of heart function in
      end-stage heart failure patients supported with a Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD)
      through applying a myocardial conditioning protocol. During myocardial conditioning, LVAD
      speed is reduced gradually in order to increase the work load of the heart. Multiple previous
      studies have shown that interventions like this may improve heart function and give patients
      the opportunity for a better quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure can be caused by various disorders, such as myocardial infarction,
      hypertension, viral infection, exposure to toxins, chemotherapy, or genetically transmitted
      muscular diseases. Regardless of the etiology, these disorders initiate ventricular
      remodeling, an adaptive, compensatory process which becomes progressively maladaptive and the
      cause of functional and clinical deterioration, eventually leading to heart failure. Local
      and systemic compensatory responses that initially allow surviving muscle to maintain
      hemodynamic function continue over time and due to this persistent compensatory over-activity
      the initially unaffected myocardium becomes dysfunctional. These compensatory responses to an
      abnormal cardiac load or myocardial injury involve several pathophysiological adaptations in
      the cardiac structure at the genetic, molecular, cellular, and tissue levels. Furthermore,
      left ventricular pressure and volume overload has shown to alter metabolic substrate
      utilization, decrease mitochondrial function and reduce energy production in the failing
      heart.

      Mechanical circulatory support with LVAD has become a standard bridge to cardiac
      transplantation, and has also been approved in the United States as permanent (destination)
      therapy for selected patients presenting with end-stage heart failure. Clinical experience
      with LVAD support has shown that it can reverse the complex process of chronic left
      ventricular remodeling to a point where a subset of patients could be weaned from the device
      after restoration of basic cardiac function. LVAD-induced mechanical unloading of the failing
      heart leads to reduced mitochondrial density, structure and function, and interventions that
      enhance mitochondrial biogenesis, function and structure, such as controlled cardiac
      reloading may enhance LVAD-induced myocardial reverse remodeling and cardiac recovery. This
      study is designed to investigate gradual reduction in LVAD speed within the range defined by
      the assist device manufacturer's manual as appropriate for regular clinic use, to determine
      the effect on reverse remodeling and myocardial recovery in end-stage heart failure patients.
