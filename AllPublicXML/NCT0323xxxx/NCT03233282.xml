  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Identify, characterize and then validate electrophysiological markers linking
      electrophysiological cerebral activity and performance in cognitive and physical fatigability
      in humans. To do this, noninvasive explorations of electroencephalography (EEG) and
      magnetoencephalography (MEG) will be carried out under two conditions of different
      experiments, the first one that induces a cognitive fatigability and the second one that
      induces physical fatigability.
