  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polymethyl methacrylate have been used since 1937 as a gold standard for a denture base
      material because of its several advantages as; good esthetics, adequate strength, easy repair
      and simple processing techniques. As any material it has some problems as polymerization
      shrinkage, low impact and flexural properties and low fatigue resistance2. So polyamide was
      introduced into dentistry to be used as a denture base material in order to solve these
      problems. Polyamide denture base materials have some superior properties than PMMA as; High
      impact &amp; flexural strength, excellent esthetics and less release of residual monomers4.
      Although being an advantage from the point of patient satisfaction, flexural property
      considered to be a contraindication for a denture base material.

      The invistigators' trial is done in order to improve rigidity of a polyamide material as well
      as to improve oral health related quality of life in comparison to heat cured polymethyl
      methacrylate.
