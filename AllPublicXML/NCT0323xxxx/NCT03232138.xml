  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study involves taking an experimental anti-cancer dietary supplement called
      Sulforaphane (SF) or a placebo (product without any supplement content) over a period of
      twelve months in order to determine if it is a useful dietary supplement for prevention of
      lung cancer in humans.

      The main goals of this research study are:

        1. To learn about the effects of giving Sulforaphane (SF) to former smokers who are still
           at high risk of developing cancer due to their smoking history and whether or not their
           condition improves, stays the same or becomes worse after Sulforaphane (SF) is given.

        2. To learn whether Sulforaphane (SF) might reverse some of the lung cell changes
           associated with future development of lung cancer.

          1. Man or woman 55-75 years of age.

             baseline will be eligible for the study. Pre-cancerous lesions include (a) reserve
             cell hyperplasia, (b) squamous metaplasia, (c) mild dysplasia, (d) moderate dysplasia,
             and (e) severe dysplasia.
