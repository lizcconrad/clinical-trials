  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators propose to assess the validity in measuring physical
      activity (PA) of a new PA monitor system the MOTIONPODTM, that coupled a hip-worn
      multi-sensor device (associating a tri-axial accelerometer, a magnetometer and a gyroscope)
      with an automatic activity/posture recognition algorithm and an activity-specific multilinear
      prediction model. The MOTIONPODTM performances in predicting mean daily PA energy expenditure
      (PAEE) will be calculated against the reference PAEE gold standard measure, using the doubly
      labeled water method (DLW). The MOTIONPODTM performances in predicting PAEE and PA patterns
      will be compared to those of two existing activity or movement monitors: the triaxial
      accelerometer ActigraphGT3X+TM and a device combining cardiofrequencemetry with
      accelerometry, the ActiheartTM. This latter has demonstrated fair performances but at the
      cost of a calibration of the heart-rate/EE relationship that limits its use in large
      population samples. Briefly, this open study will include 120 subjects, aged 18 to 75 years
      of both gender and with broad range of body mass index and physical activity level. The
      subjects will carry a MOTIONPODTM, an ActigraphGT3X+TM, an ActiheartTM and a GPS for a total
      of 14 days in everyday life conditions and complete a physical activity diary. In half of the
      subjects, PA will be evaluated on a period of 14 days, with standard PAEE measured by DLW.
      The other 60 subjects will be studied twice, one month apart, to test the reproducibility of
      the measures.

    <description>MotionPodTM predictions will be calculated with the newly developed algorithms to evaluate the concordance between the physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE) estimated by the MOTIONPODTM and that of 2 physical activity monitors: the Actigraph GT3X+TM and the ActiheartTM. The estimation of PAEE by MotionPodTM will be compared with the measure of PAEE by DLW (gold standard measure, primary outcome 2/), with the measure of PAEE by Actiheart TM (primary outcome 3/), and with the measure of PAEE by ActigraphGT3X+ TM (primary outcome 4/).</description>

    <time_frame>PAEE measurement will be measured over the 14-day study-period (Modality A)</time_frame>
    <description>Daily Total Energy Expenditure (TEE) and PAEE standards will be measured with the DLW reference method. Briefly Resting metabolic Rate (RMR) will be measured via indirect calorimetry using a ventilated open-hood metabolic cart after a 12h-overnight fast. TEE will be determined using a 14-day multipoint DLW protocol. After providing a baseline urine sample, subjects will ingest a premixed dose of H218O (10% enriched) and 2H2O (99.85% enriched) DLW. Equilibration will be assessed in urine samples collected at 4h and 5h post dose. Subsequent urine samples will be collected every two days of the 14 days of the protocol. 2H2 and 18O isotopic enrichment will be analyzed in quadruplicate by pyrolysis on an elemental analyzer (Flash HT; ThermoFisher) interfaced with an IRMS (Delta V, ThermoFisher).</description>
