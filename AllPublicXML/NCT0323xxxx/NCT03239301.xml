      Study design: Controlled Trial Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of robotic-assisted
      training of forearm and hand functions in spinal cord injury patients Setting: Ankara
      Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Training and Research Hospital, Turkey Methods: Forty
      patients were allocated into robotic and control groups. Both groups received conventional
      rehabilitation program for four weeks. Moreover, robotic group received robotic
      rehabilitation program tailored to the patient five times a week (each session of 30 min).

      Baseline data and post-intervention data was compared.

    <description>The Armeo Spring HocomAG Inc. (Volketswil, Switzerland) device was used in robot assisted upper limb rehabilitation program. Assistive component of the robotic arm was adjusted in accordance with motor level of each patient. Variety and difficulty of games were chosen according to the ability and functional status of the patients. Variety and difficulty level of the games were modified according to progress of patients by the same physiotherapist.</description>
