  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tennis is situational sport in which the result of the game is directly influenced by the
      interaction with the opponent. In fact, athletes have to respond in a short-time period to
      change the way of playing by fast analyzing speed, rotation and direction of the tennis ball.
      Therefore, it is extremely complicated to predict exactly what will happen during games and
      matches. According to literature goof visual skills, players can receive and process
      information quickly and can optimize the performance with extreme precision and dexterity.
      For this reason, visuomotor training aims to improve reaction times, but its efficiency
      during playing tennis has not yet been investigated. Therefore, the aim of this study is to
      investigate how this training method could affect the improvement of visuomotor performance
      in young people between 12 and 18 years old.

    <description>The visual training will be performed 3 times a week for 40 minutes, at the end of warm up and before the technique training. The subjects will be performed a progression of exercise to improve their visual ability, their velocity of interpretation and transformation. The training will be performed with specific panels approved for visual training (S.V.T.A., Torino, Italy).</description>
