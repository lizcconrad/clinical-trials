      The MANAGE-HF study is a multi-center, global, prospective, open label, multi-phase trial
      intended to evaluate the clinical efficacy of the HeartLogic heart failure diagnostic
      feature.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase I of the MANAGE-HF trial is not randomized, and is intended to evaluate the clinical
      integration of HeartLogic for managing patients with heart failure. There are no endpoints.

      Phase II of the MANAGE-HF trial will assess the clinical effectiveness of remote monitoring
      of heart failure patients with implanted CRT-D or ICD cardiac devices that contain the
      diagnostic feature HeartLogic. This feature uses S1 and S3 heart sounds, night time heart
      rate, thoracic impedance, and respiration to alert clinicians when a patient's heart failure
      is worsening. The MANAGE-HF study will compare remote monitoring using HeartLogic alerts to
      drive heart failure care against patients with remote monitoring but without HeartLogic
      alerts.

An endpoint event for each subject will be determined by the first occurrence of a heart failure hospitalization or death. A total of 864 endpoint events are needed to detect a difference between the two groups (alpha=0.05; power=90%; hazard ratio of 0.8).</description>
