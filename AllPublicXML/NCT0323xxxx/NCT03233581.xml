  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Primary Goal is to conduct a 12 week pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the
      Fitbit Flex, a popular, affordable, wearable physical activity tracking device, and the
      Fitbit mobile health (mHealth) app. The target population will be cancer survivors 18-39
      years old recruited from the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance. For the intervention group, peer
      influences will be engaged via a private, social network (e.g. a Facebook group) customized
      for survivors. Measurements will be completed (1) at baseline, prior to randomization, and
      (2) during the final week of the intervention period (follow-up measure). This pilot study
      will provide initial proof of concept and allow for further customization of the intervention
      for cancer survivors in anticipation of a future, larger proposal to study physical activity
      and related outcomes over a multi-year period.

      Besides conducting exploratory analyses of primary and secondary outcomes for this pilot RCT,
      we also specify feasibility criteria including: (1) recruiting 50 cancer survivors ages 18-39
      years and between 1.0-5.0 years from the completion of active cancer therapy, (2)
      intervention participants wear the Fitbit Flex on the majority of all intervention days
      during the 12-week intervention period, and (3) â‰¥75% of all participants complete online
      questionnaire data collection at Time 1 and Time 2.
