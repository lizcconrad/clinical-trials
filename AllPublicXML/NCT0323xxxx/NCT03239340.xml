      A multicentre, open-label, single-arm, molecular profiling study of patients with EGFR
      mutation-positive locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC treated with osimertinib

  <detailed_description>

      Study design This is a phase II, open-label, single-arm tissue and plasma acquisition study
      assessing the efficacy, safety and underlying resistance mechanisms of osimertinib (80 mg
      orally, once daily) as first-line treatment in patients with locally advanced or metastatic
      EGFR mutation positive non-small cell lung cancer who are EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor
      treatment-naïve and eligible for first-line treatment. Participants with EGFR
      mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer will be required to consent to at least 2
      mandatory tumour biopsies to be considered for enrolment in this study. The first biopsy will
      be done prior to initiating treatment with osimertinib and the second biopsy will be obtained
      any time between Investigator assessed, Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours version
      1.1 (RECIST 1.1)-defined progression and up to 7 days after the discontinuation of
      osimertinib. A third optional biopsy may be taken during the course of treatment at the
      Investigator's discretion if the patient consents and if clinically feasible. Tumour tissue
      and plasma samples will be collected and examined for genetic and non genetic aberrations
      that may be important in determining response and resistance to the treatment that
      participants will receive as a part of their cancer care. Patients should continue on
      osimertinib until progression or until other treatment discontinuation criteria are met.
      However, if patients continue to show clinical benefit to treatment as judged by the
      Investigator, patients may continue to receive osimertinib beyond RECIST 1.1-defined
      progression. Therefore, there is no maximum duration of treatment. Tumour assessments are to
      be performed at baseline and then every 8 weeks until progression. Patients will be followed
      up for a period of 28 days following discontinuation of osimertinib. Target patient
      population Male and female patients aged 18 years and over with locally advanced or
      metastatic pathologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the lung, not amenable to curative
      surgery or radiotherapy. Patients will have a tumour that harbours one of the EGFR mutations
      known to be associated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor sensitivity, either alone or in
      combination with other EGFR mutations (EGFR mutation status determined by a local
      laboratory). Patients must be EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment-naïve and eligible to
      receive first line treatment with osimertinib. Investigational product, dosage and mode of
      administration Osimertinib is an oral, potent, selective, irreversible inhibitor of both EGFR
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor sensitizing and resistance mutations in non-small cell lung cancer
      with a significant selectivity margin over wild type EGFR. Osimertinib (80 mg orally, once
      daily) will be administered. Doses may be reduced to 40 mg if needed.
