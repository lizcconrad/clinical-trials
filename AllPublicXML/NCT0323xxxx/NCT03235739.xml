  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether oral Naloxegol can reduce the side effects
      of opioid painkillers following surgery. This study aims to explore whether Naloxegol can
      similarly reduce opioid-induced side effects in post-surgical patients. About 130 surgery
      patients will participate in this study which is being conducted at Cleveland Clinic Main
      Campus.

    <textblock>
      Opioids are the gold standard for postoperative pain management, but they have been shown to
      produce uncomfortable side effects such as urinary retention (an inability to completely
      empty the bladder), constipation and nausea/vomiting. Clinical evidence demonstrates that
      Naloxegol can safely and effectively block these undesirable side effects while maintaining
      the painkilling effects of opioids in outpatients suffering from opioid-induced constipation.
