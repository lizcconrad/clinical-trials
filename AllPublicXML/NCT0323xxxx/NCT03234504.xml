      This prospective study investigated the validity and test-retest reliability of stereopsis
      test using head-mount display (HMD). Contour-based circles (crossed disparity: 1,960 to 195
      arc of seconds(arc secs)) were generated as separate images on a high resolution phone
      display (Galaxy S7; Samsung, Suwon, Korea) using a HMD (Galaxy Gear VR; Samsung, Suwon,
      Korea). Two images were independently projected to each eye as graded circles with random dot
      background. While the position of the stimulus changed from among 3 possible locations, the
      subjects were instructed to select the circle with disparity by pressing the corresponding
      position on a keypad. The results of the new HMD stereotest were compared to those from
      standard Randot and TNO stereotests.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        1. The subjects who want or need to visual acuity test or to test for a prescription for
        glasses visited the hospital. 2. The Subjects' ages ranged from 19 to 60 years in the
        study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          3. Foreigners or subjects who are unable to understand informed consent were excluded.

          4. Subjects with a history of eye problems, including infection, inflammation, cataract,
             vitreous opacity or retinal diseases were excluded.

          5. Subjects with corrected visual acuity of 20/32 in bad eye were excluded.

          6. Subjects with significant refractive error considered to be ≥2.00 diopters of
             anisometropia were excluded.

          7. A female who is pregnant, may be pregnant, or is lactating was excluded.
