    <textblock>
      Transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis (A-TTR) is a rare protein misfolding, autosomal dominant
      inherited disease with variable penetrance. It presents with a wide spectrum of clinical
      manifestations. TTR, the protein implicated in A-TTR, is a tetrameric transport protein.
      Misfolded TTR protein forms amyloid fibrils causing tissue damage by direct compression and
      obstruction. In the earliest stages of the disease the symptoms comprise autonomic and/or
      sensory symptoms. The clinical spectrum of A-TTR (Amyloidosis TTR) varies widely from an
      exclusive neurological involvement to a predominant cardiac presentation. In the first case,
      the disease is called TTR familial amyloid polyneuropathy (TTR-FAP). In the second case, the
      disease is called TTR amyloid cardiomyopathy (TTR-CM). Most likely this classification does
      not really make sense furtheron, since the clinical picture is in the majority of the
      patients (&gt;62%) overlapping.TTR-FAP is a fatal illness resulting from autosomal dominantly
      inherited single-point mutations on the TTR gene. This disease typically strikes people in
      their 30s to 50s. TTR-CM may occur alone or in conjunction with TTR-FAP. TTR-CM is often
      associated with genetic variants of TTR but may also occur in the absence of a specific
      mutation, what is known as wild-type A-TTR (A-TTRwt). A-TTR is probably widely
      underdiagnosed, mainly because the disease can mimic other causes of left ventricular (LV)
      hypertrophy (LVH), including hypertensive heart disease and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
      (HCM).In an adult, HCM is defined by the presence of a LV wall thickness ≥15 mm in one or
      more LV myocardial segments that is not explained solely by abnormal loading conditions. Five
      to ten percent of adult cases are caused by genetic disorders including inherited metabolic
      and neuromuscular diseases, chromosome abnormalities and genetic syndromes. Some patients
      have non-genetic disorders that mimic genetic forms of the disease, for example, senile A-TTR
      (which is a A-TTRwt) and light chain amyloidosis (AL).The diagnosis of HCM is based on the
      detection of increased LV wall thickness by any imaging modality.Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) is
      a manifestation of several systemic diseases known as amyloidosis. Clinical features are
      varied, and although heart failure symptoms predominate, suspicion of CA can also be prompted
      by syncope, arrhythmias, or unexplained LV wall thickening on echocardiography (ECHO). The
      three most frequent and clinically challenging types of systemic amyloidosis are acquired
      monoclonal immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis (AL), the hereditary mutant A-TTR (A-TTRm),
      and the non-mutant A-TTR, also known as systemic &quot;senile&quot; amyloidosis or A-TTRwt (TTR wild
      type Amyloidosis). AL and A-TTRm can affect the heart in isolation or with multiorgan
      involvement, whereas A-TTRwt predominantly affects the heart and the carpal tunnel
      ligament.The diagnosis of TTR-CM remains challenging. The electrocardiograms (ECGs),
      transthoracic ECHO (TTE) and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) of TTR-CM show similar findings
      to cardiac AL. The diagnosis strategy for A-TTR combines pathology and molecular genetic
      testing. TTR is a gene of small size (7 kB), including four exons, and its screening by full
      sequencing of the coding parts is now easily accessible. In asymptomatic A-TTR carriers, CMR
      may detect early cardiac involvement by focal myocardial late gadolinium enhancement
      (LGE).Routine laboratory testings are helpful. High levels of brain natriuretic peptide
      (BNP), N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and high sensitivity cardiac
      troponin T (hs-cTnT) are associated with cardiovascular events, heart failure and death.
      Despite comparable values of LV wall thickness, plasma BNP values are three to five folds
      higher in patients with TTR-CM than in patients with other causes of HCM.

      Non-invasive techniques have been developed in the last years to assist in the diagnosis of
      TTR-CM, One of the imaging techniques is the bone scintigraphy that has been shown to have
      excellent results in the diagnosis of TTR-CM. Several studies have suggested that TTR-derived
      fibrils show avidity for bone tracers, in particular 99m
      Technetium-3,3-diphosphono-1,2-propano-di-carboxylic acid (99mTc-DPD). For this reason,
      99mTc-DPD scintigraphy should be considered in patients in whom TTR-CM is suspected,
      supporting the diagnosis when histology is not or hardly achievable. The TTR-FAP has a very
      heterogeneous phenotype which can manifest starting at the age of 18 and may lead to death
      within 10 years. The symptoms can be categorized in three groups:

      Dysfunction of peripheral nerves:

        -  Dissociated anesthesia

        -  Muscle paresis and atrophy

        -  Dysaesthesia and paraesthesia

        -  Reduced skin temperature

        -  Coldness

        -  Hoarseness

      Autonomic dysfunction:

        -  Dysuria

        -  Diarrhea

        -  Constipation

        -  Orthostatic dysregulation

        -  Erectile dysfunction

        -  Nausea

      Constitutional conditions

        -  Anemia

        -  Weight loss

        -  Arrhythmia

        -  Edema

        -  Acroparaesthesia

      The currently available therapeutic approaches are either liver transplantation (as the liver
      mainly produces transthyretin this is a feasible approach) or as of more recently also a
      TTR-tetramer stabilizing agent (Tafamidis). Tafamidis (Vyndaqel®) gained the European
      approval under &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot; in November 2011 for treating FAP in adults with a
      symptomatic polyneuropathy. Further products are actually under development and in market
      access stages.

      In light of the different potential therapies being available in the market this analysis
      aims to determine the frequency of TTR based hereditary transthyretin-related amyloidosis in
      a selected, clinical subpopulation.
