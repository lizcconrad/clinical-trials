  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      the study is about the prevalance of molar incisor hypomineralization and its severity among
      a group of Egyptian children aged 8-12 years old in Giza Governorate schools.

        -  Participants will be randomly selected from primary and preparatory schools in Giza
           governorate, seated in the school lap or an empty classroom.

        -  Clinical examination will be made in the daylight using disposable diagnostic sets
           (mirror, and explorer). No diagnostic radiographs will be taken.

        -  Prior to performing dental examination, index teeth including incisors and 1st permanent
           molars will be cleaned using a cotton roll.

        -  A dental explorer will be further used for cleaning molar fissures.

        -  The examiner carefully inspect the coronal part of the 1st permanent molars and
           permanent incisors for demarcated opacities.

        -  A specially made examination chart will be taken for the child including his name, age,
           address, gender, school, date, medical health and any previous dental treatment.

      prevalance of molar incisor hypomineralization is measured by presence or absence.

      severity is measured by Modified index based on European Academy of Paediatric Dentistry
      (EAPD) criteria
