  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most common vestibular disorder in adults
      and the treatment of choice is by particle repositioning manoeuvres (PRM). This study aims to
      compare the treatment efficacy of two home-based exercises, self-Epley manoeuvre (SEM) and
      Brandt-Daroff exercise (BDE) in patients with posterior canal BPPV based on vertigo
      resolution, reduction of vertigo intensity, the Dizziness Handicap Inventory scores and the
      conversion of a positive to negative Dix-Hallpike test.

      Study Objective:

      To compare the efficacy of the self-Epley manoeuvre to the Brandt-Daroff exercise in
      resolving vertigo symptoms in patients with unilateral posterior canal BPPV.

      Study Design:

      Single-blind randomized controlled study

      Sample Size:

      Fifty patients were recruited in the study and were divided with 25 patients in each
      treatment arm.

      Study Method:

      Patients who satisfy the inclusion criteria and have given informed consent were randomized
      into the 2 treatment groups. A dedicated physiotherapist will demonstrate the selected
      exercise (either SEM or BDE) and observed the patient performing the exercise twice to ensure
      the ability of the patient to perform it correctly at home. A diary was provided for the
      patients to chart the therapy sessions performed at home as well as a pamphlet with simple
      illustrated instructions of the chosen exercise. The patients were asked to perform the
      home-based exercise for 2 weeks.

      Primary Outcome Measure

      - Resolution of vertigo symptoms in patients with unilateral posterior canal BPPV.

      Secondary Outcome Measures

        -  Vertigo resolution at 1 and 6 months;

        -  The conversion of positive to negative Dix-Hallpike test between both groups after 1
           month;

        -  Vertigo intensity in unresolved vertigo patients at 1 &amp; 6 months;

        -  The Dizziness Handicap Inventory between both groups at 1 and 6 months.

    <description>The patient has to position himself long sitting on the bed, then turn his head 45 degrees to the problematic side. When in this head position, he will rapidly lie himself supine with a pillow under his shoulders. He then turns his head 90 degrees to the opposite direction followed by turning of his body to the same side before returning to a sitting position at the edge of the bed. Each position should be kept for 30 seconds each, and the patient is required to perform 3 cycles of this manoeuvre just prior to going to bed daily for 2 weeks.</description>

    <description>The patient has to sit at the edge of the bed, turn his head laterally 45 degrees to one side and move rapidly into the side lying position, keeping his head in the same position. He then returns upright and turns his head to the opposite direction and the same movement is repeated on the other side. Each position is held for at least 30 seconds and the patient is required to perform it for 5 repetitions, three times a day, daily for 2 weeks duration.</description>
