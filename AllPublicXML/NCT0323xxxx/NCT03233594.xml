  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Central nervous system (CNS) changes associated with pain have been difficult to measure
      until the development of functional neuroimaging techniques such as positron emission
      tomography (PET). We have previously observed asymmetry in the thalamus associated with
      chronic pain that altered during acupuncture therapy. Imaging studies of therapeutic
      techniques for chronic pain in animals and humans have been quite limited. This study will be
      the first to utilize FDG PET-MRI imaging of both the brain and body in order to assess CNS
      changes and peripheral body changes related to chronic pain and its potential management.

      The proposed study is based on our growing understanding of chronic pain and our ability to
      use functional brain imaging to study in vivo neurophysiologic processes. It is important to
      understand the brain and body mechanisms of chronic pain in order to better determine
      therapeutic interventions to reduce pain. Part of the difficulty in treating chronic pain is
      to determine how better to diagnose what specific issues are affecting the brain and body
      that result in chronic pain. Participants will undergo a small battery of diagnostic tests
      that include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET). A
      secondary goal of this study is to determine if undergoing chiropractic care alters body or
      brain physiology in patients with chronic pain.

    <description>The Profile of Mood States (POMS) is a validated questionnaire of 65 single word items that asks &quot;How have you been feeling in the past week including today.&quot; The subjects will select their response to each word that describes a mood or feeling on a Likert scale from 1= Not at All, 2= A Little, 3=Moderately, 4=Quite a lot, to 5=Extremely. The responses are scored to generate values for Tension, Anger, Confusion, Depression and Vigor. The higher scores indicate a greater presence of that mood or state.</description>
