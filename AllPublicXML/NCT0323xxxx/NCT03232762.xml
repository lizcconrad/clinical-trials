  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare 3 different diets in pregnancy, equal in calories, and
      fats, different in refined grains compared to whole grains as a source of carbohydrates, and
      in calories from carbohydrate, compared to protein as a source of calories.The hypothesis is
      that there will be differences in the specified outcomes because the proportions of
      macronutrients are significant. The primary objective is to detect differences in weight
      gain.

  <detailed_description>

      There will be randomized sequential assignment of pregnant women at the initial clinic visit
      to Diet A, a high proportion of calories from refined grains as a carbohydrate source, and
      Diet B, a high proportion of calories from whole grains. Random number assignment is
      impractical for counseling purposes and blinding not possible. Therefore, randomization by
      diet assignment by day of initial visit via random number was chosen. If the random number is
      odd Diet A would be selected, if the random number is even Diet B will be selected for that
      day.
