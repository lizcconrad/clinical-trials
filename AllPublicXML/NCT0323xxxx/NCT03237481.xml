          -  Female subjects are eligible only if not pregnant, not lactating, not planning to
             become pregnant during the study, sterile; or using acceptable contraceptives.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Had any prior inguinal hernia repair.

          -  Has a planned concurrent surgical procedure.

          -  Has other pre existing concurrent acute or chronic painful physical/restrictive
             condition expected to require analgesic treatment in the postoperative period for
             pain.

          -  Has a contraindication or a known or suspected history of hypersensitivity or
             clinically significant idiosyncratic reaction to required study medications.

          -  Has known or suspected daily use of opioids for 7 or more consecutive days within the
             previous 6 months.

          -  Has taken NSAIDs within 10 days prior to the scheduled surgery.

          -  Has taken opioids within 24 hours prior to the scheduled surgery (3 days for

          -  Has been administered bupivacaine within 5 days prior to the scheduled surgery.

          -  Has initiated treatment with medications within 1 month prior to study drug
             administration that can impact pain control.

          -  Has been administered systemic steroids within 5 half-lives or 10 days prior to
             administration of study drug.

          -  Has a medical condition such that, in the opinion of the Investigator, participating
             in the study would pose a health risk to the subject or confound the postoperative
             assessments.

          -  Has a known history of Hepatitis B, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or active
             Hepatitis C.

          -  Has uncontrolled anxiety, psychiatric, or neurological disorder that, in the opinion
             of the Investigator, might interfere with study assessments.

          -  Had a malignancy in the last year, with the exception of nonmetastatic basal cell or

          -  Has a known or suspected history of drug abuse, a positive drug screen on the day of
             surgery, or a recent history of alcohol abuse. Note: Subjects with a positive drug
             screen who are taking an allowed, prescribed medication that is known to result in a
             positive drug test (eg, amphetamine and dextroamphetamine for attention
             deficit/hyperactivity disorder) may be eligible for participation in the study.
             Subjects taking medical marijuana are not allowed to participate in the study.

          -  Received an investigational product or device in a clinical trial within 30 days or
             within 5 elimination half lives.
