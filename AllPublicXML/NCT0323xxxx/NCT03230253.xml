      The purposes are to: (1) examine and compare the effects of two hybrid interventions on brain
      plasticity, physiological biomarkers and behavioral outcomes, including cognitive and
      physical functions, from pre- to post-training; (2) understand the neural mechanisms of
      cognitive recovery following two hybrid interventions using the functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI); (3) examine the long-term benefits of the two hybrid therapies; (4) to
      identify the correlations between brain activity, biomarkers and behavioral measures.

      Background and Purpose: Cognitive decline in stroke survivors is associated with functional
      deficits, and poses a significant personal, societal, and economic burden. Directing
      interventions towards stroke survivors with cognitive decline may provide the greatest
      benefits. Risk factors for cognitive deficits are multifactorial; some are stroke
      characteristics many are cardiovascular disease risk factors. Growing evidence suggests that
      physical activity combined cognitive training provide cognitive and functional benefits that
      extend beyond what can be achieved from cognitive or physical activity training alone.
      Nevertheless, scientific evidence is lacking for the efficacy of a sequencing comprehensive
      exercise program with computerized cognitive training, as well as the underlying mechanism of
      the association between brain activity and the combined training. We propose this study to
      (1) evaluate the efficacy of sequencing comprehensive exercise program with computerized
      cognitive training on both neuroplasticity and health related outcomes in stroke survivors
      with cognitive decline, and (2) identify therapeutically relevant brain mechanisms using
      electroencephalography (EEG). Methods: At least 90 stroke survivors with cognitive decline
      will be recruited and randomly assigned to three groups (1) Comprehensive exercise training
      (ET); (2) Computerized cognitive training (CT); (3) Sequencing comprehensive exercise program
      with computerized cognitive training (ET+CT). Each participant will undergo 36 training
      sessions with one hour per day, three days per week for 12 weeks. The primary outcomes are
      the changes in cognitive function and electrophysiology (EEG) measurements (neural activity
      and functional connectivity between brain areas in the frontal, parietal and occipital
      lobes). Secondary outcomes include physical functions, outcomes in activities of daily living
      and quality of life. All the outcome measures will be administered at baseline, 3rd month
      immediately after training, and 9th month follow-up. Brain activities will be also assessed
      by EEG during the training to understand the time-course of neural changes within and between
      training. Mixed-factorial analysis of variance will be used to evaluate the changes in the
      outcome measures at different time points for the three groups.
