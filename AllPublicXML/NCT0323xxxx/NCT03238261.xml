  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Compare the use of radiotherapy and concomitant chemotherapy, with the single use of
      radiotherapy in the treatment of patients with stage IIIB uterine cancer, having as an
      outcome the three year survival rate, the disease free survival rate, the locoregional
      control of the disease and the security of the treatments provided.

      Specific objectives

        1. Describe and compare the demographic and clinical characteristics of both groups.

        2. Compare the three year survival rate in both groups.

        3. Compare the response to treatment in terms of locoregional control of the disease.

        4. Compare the appearance of severe and non severe adverse events directly related to the
           treatment in both intervention groups.

      Inclusion criteria Women between 18 and 80 years old, diagnosed with uterine squamous cell
      cancer or stage IIIB adenocarcinoma (FIGO) with ECOG equal 1 or less and a Karnofsky equal or
      more than 70%.

      Exclusion criteria Having a concomitant or previous neoplasia, except for patients with skin
      tumors not associated to melanomas, platelet count under 100.000, hemoglobin levels of 10
      gr/dl or above before starting the first radiotherapy session, patients with recurrent
      invasive uterine carcinoma, patients with compromised para aortic lymph nodes, patients with
      active and non controlled pelvic infection by the beginning of the treatment, creatinine
      depuration less than 45 ml/min confirmed with glomerular filtration rate less than 45 ml/min,
      neutrophils count less than 1,500/ml, and pregnant or nursing woman.

      Analysis The descriptive statistical analysis will be made with proportions for the
      categorical variables, and for numerical variables will be made with averages, medians,
      standard deviations and ranges. The comparison between categorical variables will be made
      with square Ji proof or exact Fisher's proof when square Ji proof doesn't meet the criteria.
      The comparison among continuous variables with normal distribution will be established with T
      student distribution proof or ANOVA, and Mann-Whitnew or Kruskall proofs will be used for
      variables that doesn't have this type of distribution.

      For the three survival rate, the Kaplan Meier method will be applied, and the survival curves
      will be compared with the logarithmic range proof. The Cox proportional hazard model is going
      to be used for the multivariate analysis and to stablish reasons. Additionally 5 interim
      analysis will be made.
