  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this clinical experiment is to compare, in terms of pain relief measured
      using the 10-cm visual analog scale (VAS) pain score (5-7), the clinical results of
      ultrasound-guided injection (USGI) versus anatomic topography-guided injection (ATGI) of
      corticosteroid for the treatment of proximal PF. Secondary aims will be to compare
      foot-related quality of life, as measured using the Foot Function Index (FFI)and the Bristol
      Foot Score (BFS), between the injection groups, and also to compare the pre-injection to
      late-term post-injection thickness of the plantar fascia as measured in the nested USGI
      group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinically, proximal PF causes plantar heel pain, which may extend into the proximal portion
      of the plantar longitudinal arch. Typically, the pain is most notable upon initial weight
      bearing ambulation (post-static dyskinesia, PSD), such as the first step in the morning or
      following a period of non-weight bearing or rest. This can be attributed to walking on hard
      surfaces or barefoot, prolonged weight bearing activity, inadequate stretching and use of
      poor footwear, as well as increased amounts of walking. Standard treatment of PF includes the
      use of foot orthotics, both pre-fabricated and custom molded, physical therapy and
      myotendinous stretching, splinting or strapping the foot, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
      drugs, ice, and corticosteroid injections. Ultrasonography (US) can be useful for examining
      the plantar fascia, which typically measures between 2 mm to 4 mm in thickness, and findings
      indicative of PF include diffuse hypoechogenicity at the calcaneal attachment of the plantar
      fascia, loss of definition between the plantar fascia and the surrounding soft tissues,
      peri-insertion edema, and thickness over 4.5 mm. Local infiltration of corticosteroids has
      been used to treat PF since the 1950s. Despite this being a well established treatment, there
      are still unexamined features of this form of intervention, including the method of
      injection, type of steroid used, concurrent use of localanesthetic agents, concurrent use of
      orthoses and/or supportive arch strapping, concurrent physical therapy, and the use of
      ultrasonographic guidance of the corticosteroid injection. The primary aim of this clinical
      experiment is to compare, in terms of pain relief measured using the 10-cm visual analog
      scale (VAS) pain score (5-7), the clinical results of ultrasound-guided injection (USGI)
      versus anatomic topography-guided injection (ATGI) of corticosteroid for the treatment of
      proximal PF. Secondary aims will be to compare foot-related quality of life, as measured
      using the Foot Function Index (FFI)and the Bristol Foot Score (BFS), between the injection
      groups, and also to compare the pre-injection to late-term post-injection thickness of the
      plantar fascia as measured in the nested USGI group.

We anticipate that it will take approximately 23.5 months to execute the clinical experiment and to prepare the report for publication.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Participants that do not experience at least a 50% reduction in pain following phase 1 will undergo randomization to either USGI or ATGI, both injections consisting of 0.5 ml 0.25% bupivacaine plain, 0.5 ml dexamethasone phosphate, and 0.5 ml triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg/ml. Execution of the USGI will employ an actual diagnostic US machine (Voluson E8 Expert, General Electric Company, Boston, MA) and a plantarmedial approach, whereas execution of the ATGI will employ a sham diagnostic US machine and a plantarmedial approach. The patients will be randomized into these groups by a specialized statistical computerized system that randomly selects a number to the participant. An even or an odd number represents which form of injection the patient is to receive.</masking_description>

    <description>Once patient has been randomized, if placed in the anatomically-guided injection group, the medial band of the plantar fascia origin on the calcaneus will be palpated and marked approximately. In the clinical setting, a sham ultrasound machine will be utilized to &quot;locate&quot; the plantar fascia keeping the patient blinded to the treatment modality. The area will then be prepped with alcohol to the medial heel and utilizing a medial approach, an injection of 0.5 cc 0.5% bupivacaine, 0.5 cc dexamethasone and 0.25 cc triamcinolone acetamide 40 mg/mL will be administered into the area surrounding the plantar fascia. The area will then be cleaned will alcohol and dressed with a small elastic bandage.</description>
