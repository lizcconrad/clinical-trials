    <textblock>
      Clinical guidelines recommend the use of Botulinum Toxin-A (BoNT-A) for localized/segmental
      spasticity in children with cerebral palsy. At the Kocaeli University (KOU) Department of
      Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PMR) more than 800 patients have been injected with the
      two approved toxinA types; OnabotulinumtoxinA or AbobotulinumtoxinA.

      With this study investigators would like to evaluate retrospectively if switching from one
      toxin to another is safe as well as to evaluate if the efficacy when switching from one toxin
      to another was maintained.

      A data base was designed to capture all data that were considered relevant to the treatment
      evaluation. The data were transcribed directly from participants medical records. For the
      purpose of the study, data from the two subsequent visits where a different type of toxin was
      given will be collected and evaluated . In order to collect the pre and post status in terms
      of safety and efficacy, for each participant, data corresponding to the 6 previous and
      posterior months after the switch of the toxin will also be collected or data corresponding
      to the previous and posterior visit after the switch of the toxin will also be collected.

        No active study treatment will be given as this will be a retrospective study. Information
        on children with at least two subsequent injection of two different types of toxinA for the
        treatment of spasticity will be collected and analysed
