  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter randomized, single-blind, controlled study. The primary objectives of
      this study are to obtain the pharmacokinetic profile and the relative bioavailability of the
      INL-001 matrix during and after open hernioplasty compared to Marcaine™ 0.25% infiltration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter randomized, single-blind, controlled study. Prior to surgery on Day 1,
      48 subjects who continue to meet study entry criteria will be randomized just prior to
      surgery in a 2:1 ratio to receive either 3 x 100 mg INL-001 bupivacaine HCl collagen-matrix
      implants (total bupivacaine HCl dose 300 mg) or Marcaine 0.25% (bupivacaine HCl) 175 mg
      infiltration. Subjects will then undergo open hernioplasty according to standard procedure.

      Subjects will remain in the clinic at least until after the 72 hour blood sample has been
      collected for PK analysis on Day 4. Subjects discharged after the 72 hour blood draw will be
      instructed to return to the clinic to complete the 96 hour PK blood draw on Day 5. Follow-up
      safety assessments will include clinic visits on Day 7, Day 15 and Day 30.

      Pharmacokinetic blood samples will be collected from subjects before surgery and at
      predetermined time points up to 96 hours after administration of study drug. Safety
      assessments will include frequent assessment of vital signs through 72 hours, continuous
      electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring for at least 24 hours, oxygen saturation levels, and
      adverse events (AEs) reporting with particular emphasis on the signs and symptoms of CNS and
      cardiovascular bupivacaine toxicity. The surgical wound will be assessed frequently for
      adverse events associated with altered wound healing.

          -  Be eligible for unilateral inguinal hernioplasty with mesh (open laparotomy,
             tension-free technique) performed according to standard surgical technique under
             general anesthesia. Repair of multiple hernias through a single incision is permitted.
             If female of childbearing potential, have a negative pregnancy test at screening and
             before randomization on Day 1 AND be using an effective contraception method (ie,
             abstinence, intrauterine device [IUD], hormonal [estrogen/progestin] contraceptives,
             or barrier control) for at least one menstrual cycle prior to study enrollment and for
             the duration of the study, OR be surgically sterile, OR be a postmenopausal female (no
             menses for at least 1 year or hysterectomy).

          -  Has the ability and willingness to comply with the study procedures.

          -  Be willing to use only permitted medications throughout the study.

          -  Be willing to use opioid analgesia.

          -  Be able to fluently speak and understand either English or Spanish and be able to
             provide meaningful written informed consent for the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        A subject will be excluded from study participation if prior to surgery he/she:

          -  Has a known hypersensitivity to amide local anesthetics, morphine, acetaminophen, or
             bovine products.

          -  Is scheduled for bilateral inguinal hernioplasty or other significant concomitant
             surgical procedure.

          -  Has undergone major surgery within 3 months of the scheduled hernioplasty or plans to
             undergo another laparotomy procedure within the 30 day postoperative period.

          -  Has known or suspected history of alcohol or drug abuse or misuse within 3 years of
             screening or evidence of tolerance or physical dependency on opioid analgesics or
             sedative-hypnotic medications.

          -  Has any clinically significant unstable cardiac, neurological, immunological, renal,
             hepatic or hematological disease or any other condition that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, could compromise the subject's welfare, ability to communicate with the
             study staff or otherwise contraindicate study participation.

          -  Has venous access difficulties that may preclude the frequent pharmacokinetic sampling
             requirements of the study.

          -  Has participated in a clinical trial (investigational or marketed product) within 30
             days of surgery.
