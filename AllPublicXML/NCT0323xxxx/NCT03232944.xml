  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Post-Approval Study (PAS) is to evaluate the effectiveness of MPP to
      improve CRT response in the non-responder patient population when used in &quot;real-world&quot;
      clinical practice, following commercial release. This evaluation is based on the Clinical
      Composite Score which summarizes the proportions and frequencies of CRT non-responder
      patients who are &quot;improved&quot;, &quot;unchanged&quot; or &quot;worsened&quot; after receiving MPP therapy. Patients
      will be followed for the duration of the PAS. This study is required by FDA as a condition of
      approval of the MPP feature and is integrated within the Product Surveillance Registry (PSR).
