  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) are essential nutrients that the body obtains from
      proteins found in food, especially meat, diary products, and legumes. Data from rodent
      studies suggest that reduction of dietary BCAAs will promote fat mass loss and improved
      control of blood glucose. The purpose of this study is to test if reduction of dietary BCAAs
      without reducing calorie intake will lead to similar metabolic benefits in humans. Here the
      investigators test the feasibility of reducing dietary BCAAs using BCAA-free meal replacement
      beverages for two months.

      This study, which will be completed over three months, involves replacing two meals a day
      with meal replacement beverages for two months, with a one month follow-up visit. These
      beverages will be made up by subjects using either a complete protein powder or BCAD2, a
      BCAA-free medical food. Subjects will complete food diaries at baseline and at one month
      intervals during the study, and compliance will be assessed via food diaries, weekly
      telephone contact, and measuring returned food powder.

    <description>The principle outcome of this study is to determine if replacing 2/3rds of the subjects baseline protein intake with BCAA-free meal replacement beverages are a feasible method of selectively reducing BCAA consumption. Our principle outcome is to reduce BCAA intake by 50% or more in the Experimental Arm (BCAD2) of the study as compared to baseline intake.</description>
