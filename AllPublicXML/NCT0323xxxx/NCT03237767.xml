  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A great medical success is the increase in the median survival age associated with cystic
      fibrosis (CF). However, this success has led to a new era of research aiming to maximise the
      quality of life (QoL) of the aging CF population. Over recent decades, exercise training has
      become an integral part of CF management by improving ones aerobic exercise function and QoL.
      However, the effects exercise training has upon other aspects of the disease, e.g. metabolic
      and vascular abnormalities, remains largely unknown.

      The increased survival age associated with CF means the non-pulmonary co-morbidities are
      becoming increasingly prevalent and clinically important. For example, CF-related diabetes
      (CFRD) is one of the most common non-pulmonary co-morbidities of CF, and is associated with
      patients having a poorer pulmonary function and nutritional state, which ultimately leads to
      a worsened prognosis. Despite the efficacy of exercise training to manage dysglycaemia in
      other populations (e.g. type 2 diabetes mellitus only a single study has investigated its
      efficacy in patients with CF, whereby authors reported various encouraging findings (e.g. an
      improved OGTT score and insulin sensitivity).

      The present study aims to build on previous trials by comparing the therapeutic effects of a
      single session of high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE) and moderate intensity exercise
      (MIE) upon the 24 hour, ambulatory glycaemic profile of patients with CF. Additionally, the
      present study will identify whether HIIE and/or MIE can mediate the consequences of transient
      hyperglycaemia when considering: biomarkers of inflammation, oxidative stress and nitric
      oxide (NO2) bioavailability, as well as functional measures of microvascular endothelial
      function.

      The present study supports the top 10 research priorities set by the CF Trust, by further
      investigating the potential for exercise training to prevent/manage multiple aspects of CF,
      including dysglycaemia.

      Participants and recruitment The present study will be a pilot, counter-balanced, cross-over
      trial in individuals with CF (n = 16). Furthermore, the present protocol is an extension of
      the CFit_BL protocol (Clinical Trials ID to be confirmed). Specifically, 16 participants with
      CF will be invited to complete 2 visits (5 in total) within the same 14 day time period.
      Briefly, participants will be recruited from adult and paediatric CF outpatient clinics
      within the Southampton CF network, and will be tested at a laboratory within the Southampton
      General Hospital or the Department of Sport and Exercise Sciences (University of Portsmouth),
      depending on participant convenience.

      The present study will comprise 2 visits which will be in a randomised, counter-balanced
      order.

      Visits 1 and 2 A session of moderate intensity exercise (MIE) training and high-intensity
      interval exercise (HIIE) training visit will be conducted in a randomised, counter-balanced
      order. Participants will be required to arrive to the laboratory ~ 96 hours following the
      previous visit, at 0800 ± 2 hours, following an overnight fast (&gt; 10 hours). Furthermore,
      participants will be instructed to avoid nitrate rich foods, caffeine, alcohol and exhaustive
      exercise for 24 hours prior to arrival, as well as mouthwash for the entirety of the study.

      Upon arrival, CGM's will be fixed to the interior surface of the upper arm and worn for the
      subsequent 14 days. In addition to this, hip worn accelerometers, as well as hourly specific
      physical activity and food diaries will be distributed and completed for 14 days alongside
      the CGM.

      Upon arrival participants will undergo the acetylcholine (ACh) and insulin iontophoresis
      protocols described below, including 5 resting blood pressure measurements and a cannula will
      be inserted into a vein by a trained phlebotomist, prior to the 3 hour OGTT and a baseline
      blood sample will be taken. The participant's pulmonary function will be assessed via
      spirometry. Participants will then be asked to complete either a single session of either MIE
      or HIIE.

      Pulmonary function will then be assessed immediately post-exercise. 1 hour following
      exercise, the iontophoresis procedures will be repeated. Blood samples will be drawn
      immediately pre- and post-exercise for the analysis of plasma TNF-α, soluble vascular cell
      adhesion molecule (sVCAM)-1, IL-6, [NO-(₂)] and ET-1. Samples for nitrotyrosine (NT), total
      glutathione (tGSH) and total cysteine (tCys) will be drawn pre-exercise only. Subsequently,
      participants will partake in either 30 minutes of MIE or a work-matched period of HIIE.
      Thirty minutes following the completion of the exercising procedures, the iontophoresis
      procedures will be repeated and blood samples will be drawn for the analysis of plasma
      glucose, insulin, TNF-α, sVCAM-1, IL-6, [NO-(₂)] and ET-1. NT, tGSH and tCys. Following this,
      1.75 g/kg body mass (maximum of 75 g) of anhydrous glucose will be consumed to instigate the
      3 hour OGTT, whereby blood samples will be drawn at 30, 60, 90, 120 and 180 minutes
      post-glucose ingestion for the analysis of glucose and insulin. Samples for TNF-α, sVCAM-1,
      IL-6, [NO-(₂)] and ET-1 will be drawn at 60, 120 and 180 minutes post-glucose ingestion. NT,
      tGSH and tCys will be analysed at 120 minutes post-glucose ingestion. The total volume of
      blood collected over each 5 hour visit will be approximately 232 mL. Additionally, the
      iontophoresis procedures will be repeated at 30, 90 and 150 minutes post-glucose ingestion.

      Follow-up CGM's, accelerometers and physical activity/food diaries will be completed
      throughout this 14 day period. A member of the research team will collect these from the
      preferred location of the participant.

Additionally, verbal encouragement will be given depending on the participant's preference, and kept consistent between visits.
The MIE bout will be in coherence with the physical activity guidelines for people with CF (150 min/week of moderate to vigorous physical activity). For the MIE, participants will cycle for approximately 30 minutes at 90% of their gas exchange threshold.</description>
