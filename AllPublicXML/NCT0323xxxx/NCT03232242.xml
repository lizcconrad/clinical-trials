  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infectious disease leads to deaths that accounted for more than 25% of all causes of human
      mortality. But the traditional microbiological diagnostic methods such as specimen culture
      are sometimes time-consuming, and have limited sensitivity. And some bacteria, anaerobes and
      viruses may be difficult to cultivate and isolation. Therefore, the accurate identification
      and rapid classification of pathogenic microorganisms is very important for the patient's
      precise diagnosis and timely treatment.

      Small-scale studies on the diagnostic efficacy and prognosis of infection in the next
      generation have been shown to provide early diagnosis and targeted medication guidance for
      bloodstream infections and respiratory infections, but the larger-scale validation of
      next-generation sequencing Technology in the diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases
      in the human body is relatively rare.

      The purpose of this study is to provide rapid etiological diagnosis of patients by means of
      next-generation sequencing, to change the way of treatment of patients under the existing
      traditional pathogen detection by means of accurate description of pathogens and monitoring
      their dynamic changes, and to provide patients with more accurate treatment.

    <description>We aim to collect samples from patients with fever, bacteremia and bloodstream infections, respiratory infections, central nervous system infections, and abscesses, including blood, cerebrospinal fluid, serous effusion, pus, sputum, alveolar lavage fluid, throat swab. Next-generation sequencing will be performed on the collected samples. Our analysis of the sequencing results will focus on the analysis and identification of pathogen genes and will compare the diagnostic performance of next-generation sequencing with conventional etiological diagnostic methods. We anticipate that next-generation sequencing in infectious patients will show a greater diagnostic value than the traditional methods (including culture, special pathogen serology, PCR detection of nucleic acids, etc.).</description>
