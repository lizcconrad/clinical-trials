  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational study is to assess the efficiency of an e-learning in order
      to put into practice some preventive measures to avoid medication errors during anesthesia.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Before the study, the investigators selected 15 preventive measures to avoid medication
      errors during anesthesia. These measures were learned to the entire anesthesia team (nurse,
      resident and anesthesiologist) during conventional meetings. An initial evaluation of the
      application of these measures will be carried out before the introduction of e-learning. This
      assessment will be conducted by nurses without the knowledge of the anesthetic team
      evaluated. After this initial evaluation, e-learning will be broadcast on the hospital
      intranet. Then a second evaluation of the application of the preventive measures will be
      carried out 6 month and 1 year after the introduction of e-learning.
