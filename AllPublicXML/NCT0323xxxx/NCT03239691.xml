          -  Signed informed consent in the local language prior to any study-mandated procedure

          -  Male and female subjects aged between 18 and 60 years (inclusive) at screening

          -  Photosensitive epilepsy and a generalized PPR in response to IPS of at least 4 units
             on a SPR in at least 1 condition (eye closure, eyes closed, or eyes open) on 2
             occasions at screening with at least 1 hour interval and reproducible on Day -1 (less
             than 3 units difference in SPR between screening and Day -1)

          -  Healthy on the basis of physical examination, cardiovascular assessments and
             laboratory tests

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening
             and a negative urine pregnancy test on Day -1. They must consistently and correctly
             use a reliable method of contraception with a failure rate of &lt;1% per year, be
             sexually inactive, or have a vasectomized partner. Hormonal contraceptives must be
             initiated at least 1 month before first study treatment administration

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Lactating women

          -  Known hypersensitivity to any of the excipients of the study treatment formulation

          -  History or clinical evidence of any disease other than epilepsy and/or existence of
             any surgical or medical condition, which might interfere with the absorption,
             distribution, metabolism, or excretion of the study treatment (appendectomy and
             herniotomy allowed, cholecystectomy not allowed)

          -  Relevant history of a suicide attempt or suicidal behavior. Any recent suicidal
             ideation within the last 6 months (categories 4 or 5), or any suicidal behavior within
             the last 2 years, except for &quot;Non-Suicidal Self-Injurious Behavior&quot; (item also
             included in the Suicidal Behavior section), as judged by the investigator using the
             Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) at screening

          -  History of status epilepticus during the last 12 months

          -  History of non-epileptic seizures that cannot be differentiated from the participant's
             epileptic seizures

          -  History of generalized tonic-clonic seizures triggered by IPS

          -  Previous history of repeated fainting, syncope, orthostatic hypotension, or vasovagal
             reactions in the past 5 years

          -  Any circumstances or conditions, which, in the opinion of the investigator, may affect
             full participation in the study or compliance with the protocol
