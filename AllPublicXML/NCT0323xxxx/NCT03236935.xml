  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase Ib study is to test the safety of NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA)
      and pembrolizumab when used together in participants with melanoma, non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), classical Hodgkin lymphoma
      (cHL), urothelial carcinoma, or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H)/mismatch repair
      deficient (dMMR) cancer. Pembrolizumab is a type of treatment that stimulates the immune
      system to attack cancer cells. The immune system is normally the body's first defense against
      threats like cancer. However, sometimes cancer cells produce signals like programmed death-1
      (PD-1) that prevent the immune system from detecting and killing them. Pembrolizumab blocks
      PD-1 so your immune system can detect and attack cancer cells. To help further boost the
      cancer-fighting ability of your immune system, L-NMMA will be used along with pembrolizumab.
      L-NMMA is a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor. The presence of nitric oxide synthase in the
      area around the cancer cells blocks the cancer-fighting ability of the immune system. Thus,
      the use of L-NMMA and pembrolizumab together may make the immune system work harder to attack
      and destroy the cancer cells.

      L-NMMA is a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor. The presence of nitric oxide synthase in the
      area around the cancer cells blocks the cancer-fighting ability of the immune system. Thus,
      the use of L-NMMA and pembrolizumab together may make the immune system work harder to attack
      and destroy the cancer cells.

      In this study, up to 3 different doses of L-NMMA will be studied (12.5, 15, and 17.5 mg/kg).
      Participants will only receive one of the three L-NMMA doses. The first several study
      participants will receive the 15 mg/kg dose. If the 15 mg/kg dose of L-NMMA causes serious
      side effects, L-NMMA will be given to other study participants at the lower dose of 12.5
      mg/kg. If the 15 mg/kg dose of L-NMMA does not cause serious side effects, L-NMMA will be
      given to other study participants at the higher dose of 17.5 mg/kg. All study participants
      will be given the same dose of pembrolizumab (200 mg). This study will allow us to see the
      highest dose of L-NMMA that can be used safely with pembrolizumab in participants with
      melanoma, NSCLC, HNSCC, cHL, urothelial carcinoma, or MSI-H/dMMR cancer.

    <description>L-NMMA and pembrolizumab will be administered for 6 cycles. Cycle length will be 21 days. L-NMMA will be administered as a 2-hour intravenous (IV) infusion on Days 1−5 at each cycle. The dose levels of L-NMMA are as follows: Dose Level -1, 12.5 mg/kg; Dose Level 0 (starting dose), 15.0 mg/kg; and Dose Level 1, 17.5 mg/kg. L-NMMA dose will escalate/de-escalate based on the occurrence of dose-limiting toxicities. Pembrolizumab at a fixed dose of 200 mg will be IV infused over 30 minutes on Day 5 at each cycle. Pembrolizumab will be administered 1 hour after L-NMMA infusion on Day 5 at each cycle. Subjects without disease progression after 6 cycles of L-NMMA and pembrolizumab will continue pembrolizumab until disease progression or unacceptable AEs.</description>
