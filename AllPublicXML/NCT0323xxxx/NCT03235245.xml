  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, 2-arm open-label, randomized comparative phase II study. The objective
      of this trial is to prospectively evaluate whether a sequential approach with an induction
      period of 12 weeks with encorafenib + binimetinib followed by combination immunotherapy with
      nivolumab + ipilimumab improves progression free survival compared to combination
      immunotherapy nivolumab + ipilimumab alone in patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive
      unresectable or metastatic melanoma.
