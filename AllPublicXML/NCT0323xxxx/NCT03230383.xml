  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be an investigator- and subject-blinded (sponsor open), randomized, placebo
      controlled, sequential, ascending, multiple oral dose study, with 5 planned cohorts (optional
      sixth and seventh cohorts). A total of approximately 50 (if 5 cohorts), 60 (if 6 cohorts),
      and up to 70 (if 7 cohorts) subjects will be randomized in this study. Subjects in each
      cohort will be randomized to receive PF-06865571 or matching placebo with approximately 10
      subjects dosed in each cohort.

      For a given subject in any cohort, the total study duration from screening to follow-up phone
      call will be between approximately 7 to 11 weeks.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or
             allergic disease (including drug allergises, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic,
             seasonal allergies at time of dosing);

          -  Subjects with fasting LDL-C level &gt;190 mg/dL following an overnight fast of at least
             10 hours, at the Screening visit, confirmed by a single repeat, if deemed necessary.

          -  Subjects with fasting TG level &gt;400 mg/dL following an overnight fast of at least 10
             hours, at the Screening visit, confirmed by a single repeat, if deemed necessary.

          -  Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (eg, gastrectomy).

          -  A positive urine drug test.

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption exceeding 7 drinks/week for female subjects or
             14 drinks/week for male subjects (1 drink = 5 ounces [150 mL] of wine or 12 ounces
             [360 mL] of beer or 1.5 ounces [45 mL] of hard liquor) within 6 months before
             screening.

          -  Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days (or as determined by the local
             requirement) or 5 half lives preceding the first dose of investigational product
             (whichever is longer).

          -  Use of tobacco- or nicotine-containing products in excess of the equivalent of 5
             cigarettes per day or 2 chews of tobacco per day.

          -  Pregnant female subjects; breastfeeding female subjects; male subjects with partners
             currently pregnant; fertile male subjects who are unwilling or unable to use a highly
             effective method of contraception as outlined in this protocol for the duration of the
             study and for at least 28 days after the last dose of investigational product.

          -  Unwilling or unable to comply with the criteria in the Lifestyle Requirements section
             of this protocol.

          -  Other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the
             past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior or laboratory abnormality that may
             increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product
             administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the
             judgment of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this
             study.
