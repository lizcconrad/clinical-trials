      The Primary Objective of this study:

      -To assess the effects of SAR407899 on coronary vasomotor function using the coronary flow
      reserve (CFR) in patients with microvascular angina and/or persistent stable angina despite
      angiographically successful elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

      The Secondary Objectives of this study are:

        -  To assess the effects of SAR407899 on quality of life using Seattle Angina Questionnaire
           physical limitation domain (SAQ-PL) in patients with microvascular angina and/or
           persistent stable angina despite angiographically successful elective PCI.

        -  To assess the safety of SAR407899 in patients with microvascular angina and/or
           persistent stable angina despite angiographically successful elective PCI with a focus
           on identified risks such as hypotension and orthostatic hypotension.

        -  To assess SAR407899 plasma concentrations in microvascular angina patients and/or
           persistent stable angina despite angiographically successful elective PCI.

             orthostatic hypotension with a decrease in SBP equal or greater than 30 mmHg at Minute
             3 or Minute 5 when changing from the seated to the standing position.
