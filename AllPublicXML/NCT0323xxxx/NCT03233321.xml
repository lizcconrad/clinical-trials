    <textblock>
      The study evaluate the effectiveness of dry cold application on pain intensity and bruise at
      the subcutaneous injection site among patients admitted in medical I.C.U. Purposive sampling
      technique was used to select 60 hospitalized patients (30 in experimental and 30 in
      comparison group). Dry cold was applied to the subcutaneous injection site using ice bag
      filled with crushed ice with half table spoon of salt for 20 minutes after the administration
      of injection and no intervention was given in comparison group.

      Setting was randomized by lottery method. Subjects were selected by purposive sampling
      technique. Self-introduction was given to the subjects. Rapport was developed with subjects.
      Nature and purpose of the study was explained to the subjects. Subjects were assured about
      the confidentiality of their responses and informed written consent was taken prior to the
      data collection. Subjects in the experimental and comparison group were administered low
      molecular weight heparin injection subcutaneously by the researcher itself. After
      administration of subcutaneous injection of low molecular weight heparin, dry cold
      application using ice bag (Crushed ice was filled in ice bag with ½ table spoon of salt and
      then covered by clean linen to prevent moisture) was placed over the injection site for about
      20 minutes in experimental group and no intervention was given in comparison group. Pain was
      assessed using numerical pain rating scale after 20 minutes of subcutaneous injection in both
      the groups (experimental and comparison). At 12 hr, 48 hr and 72 hr after the subcutaneous
      injection, bruise was assessed in both the groups using bruise assessment scale.

    <description>To assess pain at subcutaneous injection site. It is a standardized and well established pain scale.
Description of the tool: The 0-10 pain rating scale is a tool commonly used to describe the intensity of pain. The person is asked to identify how much pain he/she is having by choosing a number from 0(no pain) to 10 (worst pain). Pain scoring is further classified into none (0), mild(1-3), moderate (4-6 )and severe (7-10).</description>

    <description>Bruise score was checked according to its length in terms of mm2, which was measured by bruise assessment scale. Bruise was checked at different time points i.e. 12 hrs, 48 hrs and 72 hrs after subcutaneous injection. The millimeter ruler was used to measure the size of the bruise as under:
Scoring of bruise assessment scale is as follows:
Bruise Assessment Scale
&lt;2mm2 0
