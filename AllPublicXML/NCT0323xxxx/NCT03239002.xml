  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the first study with a real diagnostic and prognostic focus in prenatal. In addition
      to this innovative aspect, the identification of cryptic imbalances in fetuses with
      malformative syndrome would be an invaluable resource for the identification of new genes
      involved in development, as is already the case for postnatal studies.

      This research aims to:

        1. to test the feasibility of this protocol, ie the practical application of this new
           technology in the context of prenatal diagnosis,

        2. demonstrate and evaluate the possible involvement of cryptic chromosomal abnormalities
           in fetuses with a thick neck associated with other malformations and recruited on the
           strict criteria mentioned above,

        3. assist in the diagnosis of these fetuses and genetic information for their families,

        4. identify new regions of the genome potentially involved in the occurrence of congenital
           malformations.

             echographic sign (s).

          -  2) At least two ultrasound call signs involving the following organs (heart, kidney,
             brain, limbs, digestive tract, face) or intrauterine growth retardation (less than 3rd
