      People who eat diets low in choline (LC) should deplete their choline (Cho) stores, and
      measurements of Cho pool size using isotope dilution should reflect this depletion.
      Investigators will identify a biomarker panel that correlates well with measured Cho pool
      size across the range of different degrees of depletion.The investigators propose that, as
      body stores of Cho diminish, cells and organs will reach the point when metabolism/function
      in the cell is altered, and that this will result in a progression of changes in biomarkers
      that reflect Cho status.

      Choline (Cho) is an essential nutrient and most Americans' diets do not achieve the
      recommended intake. Diets low in Cho are associated with liver and muscle disease and with
      suboptimal fetal development, while diets too high in choline may be associated with
      increased risk for heart disease. Cho has several important functions. It is (i) a source of
      methyl-groups needed to make the primary methyl donor, S-adenosylmethionine; (ii) a part of
      the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (acetylCho); and (iii) a component of the major
      phospholipids in membranes (phosphatidylCho and sphingomyelin). The Cho derivative,
      phosphatidylCho (PtdCho) is a main constituent of very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and is
      required for VLDL secretion and the export of fat from liver. Cho also is important for
      normal fetal development. Cho is a required nutrient and in 1998, an Adequate Intake (AI) and
      a Tolerable Upper Limit (UL) for Cho was established In 2016, the US Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) set a Recommended Daily Intake (RDI) for Cho based on the AIs as part of
      the new Nutrition Facts label for packaged foods (published in the Federal Register on May
      27, 2016; FDA-2012-N-1210-0875, Federal Register Number:2016-11867). The AI/RDI varies by age
      and gender, but is 550 mg/d in adolescent and adult men and 425 mg/d in adult women (more in
      pregnant and lactating women) and 400 mg/day for adolescent women. Self-reported dietary
      intake is very hard to measure accurately, and for Cho this research group have demonstrated
      that self-report can significantly underestimate actual intake. There is no validated
      biomarker for choline status (the availability of the various forms of Cho needed to sustain
      optimal cellular function); measurement of plasma Cho concentrations is not adequate plasma
      choline is homeostatically regulated. Based on extensive preliminary and published data this
      group identified a panel of potential biomarkers that could be used to assess Cho status, and
      now they propose studies to validate this biomarker panel against measures of Cho pool size
      using isotope dilution. The largest stores of Cho are located in the liver, and mass
      resonance spectroscopy of liver has been used in the past to assess Cho status in humans.
      This method is not practical for use as a biomarker in clinical or public health practice as
      it is expensive and the availability of the instrumentation is limited. Liver biopsy is risky
      and not practical, making measurement of hepatic Cho and Cho metabolites concentrations a
      poor choice for assessing Cho status. Measurement of Cho concentrations in plasma alone is
      not an adequate marker for Cho status because Cho concentrations drop quickly to 70% of
      normal when a person is fed a low Cho diet, but do not decrease further with more severe
      depletion even in people starved for 7 days. The concentrations of PtdCho and sphingomyelin
      also decrease in people fed a low Cho diet, but these phospholipids alone are not adequate
      biomarkers for Cho status because they are carried as part of plasma lipoproteins, and vary
      in concentration with changes in fat and cholesterol transport by these particles. Thus, such
      measurements are useful but not sufficient as biomarkers for Cho status. Perhaps there is a
      panel of biomarkers that together will more accurately and reliably reflect Cho status. By
      making measurements in people fed incrementally reduced amounts of Cho, and comparing the
      biomarker measures to body total Cho pool size assessed using isotope dilution (a proxy for
      the availability of the various forms of Cho), investigators will be able to identify the
      combination of biomarkers and algorithm for calculating a Cho status score that best predicts
      total Cho pool size, and therefore predicts choline nutritional status (the availability of
      the various forms of Cho needed to sustain cellular function). In this pilot study, they are
      seeking to test a method for using stable isotope dilution to measure body choline stores,
      and then ask how this measure correlates with a panel of biomarkers in plasma and with liver
      fat measured using Fibroscan®. Using isotope dilution can provide an estimate of the size of
      the body pool of Cho. Our proposed method is conceptually similar to the method for measuring
      total body water from a bolus dose of labeled water. Similar methodology was used recently in
      studies of metabolic flux of Cho in pregnant women. Isotope dilution is a well-established
      method used to estimate pool size for other nutrients, such as vitamin A. Similar to vitamin
      A, the major storage pools for Cho are in the liver, and ingested Cho is rapidly absorbed and
      accumulated by liver. This pilot study tests a method for using stable isotope dilution to
      measure body choline stores, and it correlates this measure with a panel of biomarkers in
      plasma and with liver fat measured using Fibroscan®. People who eat diets low in choline
      should deplete their choline (Cho) stores, and measurement of Cho pool size using isotope
      dilution should reflect this depletion. The investigator will identify a biomarker panel that
      correlates well with measured Cho pool size across the range of different degrees of
      depletion

    <intervention_model_description>Healthy volunteers (n=20), will consume meals, provided by the investigator, containing 100% of the recommended intake of Cho (400- 550 mg Cho/day depending on age and gender) for 2 weeks. Subjects then will be switched to a diet containing 10% of the recommended intake of Cho (approximately 50 mg Cho/day) for 2 weeks. On day 12 of each diet period, subjects will consume 250mg of Cho in the form of Cho- chloride-(trimethyl-d9) as a bolus. This bolus is less than the amount in 2 large eggs and has been utilized with good results. On day 12, participants will provide plasma samples for biomarker assays and isotopic dilution estimation of Cho pool size, before bolus and 30 min, 60 min, 3 hours and 6 hours after taking the bolus. In addition, a transient elastography of liver to asses liver fat, will be performed.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The experimental diets, delivering 100% or 10-36% of the recommended intake of choline (in all forms) (550 mg Cho/70 kg body weight/d), are identical except for the bread offered. Cho in the bread will be varied to deliver normal choline or low choline. A non invasive assessment of liver function, liver transient elastography (Fibroscan®), will be performed for all volunteers before the diets and at the end of normal choline and low choline diet. Also the investigator will evaluate using genotyping, how single nucleotide polymorphisms can alter choline pool size.
All volunteers will receive multivitamin pills</description>
