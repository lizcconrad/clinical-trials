  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) is a potentially life-threatening thrombotic
      microangiopathy caused by a severe deficiency of ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and
      metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif member 13). Decreased ADAMTS13 activity
      leads to an accumulation of ultralarge von Willebrand factor (vWF) multimers which induce
      aggregation of platelets and microthrombi. These microthrombi may involve the brain, heart,
      kidneys and lead to life-threatening organ failures.

      In experimental models, magnesium sulfate increases cleavage of newly released vWF by
      ADAMTS13, decreases the endothelial secretion of ultralarge vWF and inhibits the interaction
      of vWF with platelets. In another thrombotic microangiopathy, magnesium sulfate has been
      shown to reduce the risk of seizures in women with severe pre-eclampsia. In analogy with its
      evidence-based therapeutic application in pre-eclampsia and based on a strong rationale for
      magnesium supplementation in TTP, we propose a phase 3, double blind, placebo controlled, and
      randomized study to evaluate the efficacy of magnesium sulfate in more rapidly restoring
      normal platelet counts as measure of prevention of further microvascular thrombosis in
      patients with Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura.
