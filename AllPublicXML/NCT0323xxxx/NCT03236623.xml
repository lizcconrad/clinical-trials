  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thirst is defined as the desire to drink water. The perception and satiation of thirst
      constitute an interconnected network of neuronal, physiological and hormonal mechanisms that
      act simultaneously. In the oropharyngeal cavity are ionic channels called Transient Receptor
      Potential Melastatin 8 stimulated by cold temperatures and menthol, which aid in the control
      and decrease of the thirst intensity for providing refreshment and satiety without, however,
      the necessity of fluid intake In high amounts.

      Thus, the present study aims to: compare the intensity and discomfort of thirst in the use of
      the menthol popsicle and usual care in patients in the preoperative period. This is a
      randomized clinical trial, to be performed in a public tertiary hospital. The sample size
      calculation will be performed after the pilot test is conducted. Two groups will be formed
      through randomization. The tested intervention consists of the menthol popsicle (experimental
      group). The thirst intensity (primary outcome) will be measured by means of the Numerical
      Scale and the discomfort of thirst (secondary outcome) through the Perioperative Seat
      Discomfort Scale, in two moments: at the end of the first approach of the patient and 20
      minutes after the intervention. The results of this research may support the decision-making
      of health professionals in the implementation of effective and safe actions to manage the
      seat of the surgical patient in the preoperative period. Another relevant aspect is the
      production of knowledge about the problem, which is scarce both in the national and
      international scenario.

After 20 minutes of the end of the popsicle, will again be questioned as to the intensity and discomfort of thirst. The popsicle will have a support that will assist the patient in the administration of the intervention, giving him autonomy and safety in the application of the intervention.</description>
