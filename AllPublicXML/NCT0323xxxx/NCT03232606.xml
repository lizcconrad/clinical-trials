  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity is mandatory to the optimal development and health of children. The
      presence of asthmatic manifestations may influence the comportment of children and its family
      toward exercise and practice of sports. There no scientific argument to advice a reduction of
      physical activity in asthmatic children, but previous studies showed that physical activity
      is reduced in asthmatic children.

      The aim of this observational study is to evaluate the existing factors leading to this
      reduction of physical activity in asthmatic children and their families.

      Physical activity is mandatory to the optimal development and health of children. The
      presence of asthmatic manifestations may influence the behaviour of children and its family
      with a significant reduction of exercise and practice of sports.

      There no scientific argument to advice such a reduction of physical activity in asthmatic
      children.

      The aim of this observational study is to evaluate the existing factors leading to this
      reduction of physical activity in asthmatic children and their families.

      To evaluate the factors explaining this behaviour the investigator design an observational
      study, based on a questionnaire.

      The evaluation of the number of sujets to complete this study is 50 asthmatic children. The
      whole population will be considered as the same group. This study may be further completed by
      a comparative and new study including asthmatic and non-asthmatic children.
