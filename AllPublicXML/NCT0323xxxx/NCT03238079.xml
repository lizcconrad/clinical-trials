  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and
      pharmacokinetic profile of the investigational medicinal product (IMP) and to determine, on
      the basis of historical control data, how it compares with other 10% intravenous
      immunoglobulin (IGIV) products currently licensed in North America for the treatment of
      subjects with primary immune deficiency diseases (PIDD).

The starting dose will be the previous IGIV dose or a dose calculated from the previous SCIG dose up to a maximum of 900 mg/kg/mo.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has a confirmed clinical diagnosis of a PIDD, which requires treatment with
             IGIV:

          -  Subject/guardian has provided written informed consent (and assent, as applicable).

          -  Subject is between the ages of 2 and 70 years.

          -  Subject has received regular IGIV therapy at 21- or 28-day (±4 days) intervals for at
             least three consecutive months at a dose between 300-900 mg/kg/month prior to
             Screening or;

          -  Subject has received commercial SCIG at a dose of 300-900 mg/kg/month on any dosing
             schedule for at least 12 consecutive weeks prior to Screening. Subjects on SCIG must
             have received and tolerated IGIV treatment prior to SCIG treatment.

          -  Subject has a documented trough of ≥500 mg/dL in the 6 months prior to screening.

          -  Females of childbearing potential must be willing to use an effective form of birth
             control (eg, oral contraceptives) for the duration of the study, per IRB/REB

          -  Subject has had an immune globulin associated arterial or venous
             thrombotic/thromboembolic event (TEE) within 7 days of infusion or a TEE that is not
             associated with an immune globulin within one year of screening.

          -  Subject has received blood products (except for IGIV, SCIG, or albumin) within 6
             months of screening.

             (AST) &gt;3.0 times the upper limit of normal (ULN).

          -  Subject has severe neutropenia (≤1000 neutrophils per mm3).

          -  Subject is receiving other immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory drugs or
             chemotherapy.

          -  Subject has hypoalbuminemia, protein-losing enteropathy, or proteinuria greater than
             300 mg/24 hours except for subjects with documented orthostatic proteinuria.

          -  Subject has immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency with known antibodies to IgA.

          -  Female who is pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning a pregnancy during the course of

             study).

          -  Any condition that is likely to interfere with evaluation of IMP or satisfactory
             conduct of the trial in the PI's opinion.

          -  Subjects who may not be compliant or have a history of non-compliance in the opinion
