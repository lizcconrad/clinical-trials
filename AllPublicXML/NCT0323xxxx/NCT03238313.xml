  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine if exposure to the &quot;Plan A&quot; video causes decreased
      risky sexual behavior among the target population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Policy &amp; Research Group (PRG) is evaluating the &quot;Plan A&quot; video, which was designed to
      educate high-risk teens about effective Long Acting Reversible Contraception (LARC). The
      video is approximately 23 minutes in length and is shown immediately prior to a clinical
      appointment at a reproductive health center. By teaching about LARC prior to a clinic
      appointment, developers hope to reach high-risk teens at a teachable moment, when they can
      ask a health care provider about what they have learned. The primary focus of the study is to
      investigate the impact of the intervention on participants' self-reported sexual behaviors
      and contraceptive use (use of LARC, condom use, and STD testing). Additionally, the
      evaluation will include exploratory analysis on the following: (1) use of other effective
      contraception methods; (2) dual methods of protection; (3) perception of risk and/or severity
      for pregnancy and HIV/STD infection; (4) intention to use LARC; (5) intention to use other
      effective contraception methods; (6) provider communication self-efficacy; (7) condom
      negotiation self-efficacy; (8) knowledge/awareness of contraception options/LARC.

      The control (counterfactual) condition consists of a 17 minute video titled &quot;The Toxic Life
      Cycle of a Cigarette&quot;. The control video, which discusses the effects of smoking, is shown in
      the same manner as the treatment video: immediately prior to a clinic appointment at a
      reproductive health center.

      All eligible participants who provide the proper consent are randomized and enrolled into the
      study by a study coordinator who is an employee of the reproductive health clinic. Outcomes
      will be assessed using self-reported, participant-level data gathered (by way of a
      questionnaire) at three time points: baseline (enrollment, prior to watching the video); 3
      month follow-up (3 months after baseline); and 9 month follow-up (9 months after baseline).
      The study is taking place at seven clinics within the Planned Parenthood Mar Monte system in
      California, all of which serve the target population.

    <ipd_description>A dataset will be prepared at the conclusion of the study, which includes de-identified individual-level data on all study participants who contributed self-report data. Respondents will be represented only by a research ID number. Included in the dataset will be self-report data collected across all survey administrations (including demographic characteristics, sexual behaviors, and theoretical antecedents to those behaviors) and select information on program participation (e.g., which program sessions were attended). Basic data cleaning steps will be taken in order to ensure data are unidentifiable and to increase usability.</ipd_description>
