      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if a combination of ibrutinib,
      rituximab, and lenalidomide can help control newly diagnosed mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) in
      patients over 65. The safety of this drug combination will also be studied.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each cycle is 28 days.

      If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, participant will take 4
      ibrutinib capsules with 1 cup (about 8 ounces) of water each day. Participant should take
      ibrutinib in the morning and at the same time as participant takes lenalidomide (described
      below). Do not open the capsules or dissolve them.

      If participant misses a dose, participant can take it up to 6 hours after the time
      participant would have taken it. If it is later than 6 hours, participant should skip the
      dose and start taking the capsules at the same time as usual the next day. Participant will
      need to fill out diary cards with information about when participant takes ibrutinib.
      Participant should bring the diary cards with participant to appointments. Participant will
      receive a 30 day supply of the ibrutinib capsules on Day 1 of Cycles 1-11. After that,
      starting on Cycle 12 and then every other cycle after that (Cycles 14, 16, and so on),
      participant will receive a 60-day supply of the drug every other cycle.

      Participant will take lenalidomide by mouth on Days 1-21 of each cycle. Participant should
      take lenalidomide at the same time each day. Participant should take it with a glass of water
      on either a full or an empty stomach. Participant should not break, chew, or open the
      capsules.

      If participant misses a dose of lenalidomide, participant should take it as soon as
      participant remembers on the same day. If participant misses taking participant's dose for
      the entire day, participant should take participant's regular dose the next scheduled day.
      Participant should not take double participant's regular dose to make up for a missed dose.

      If participant takes more than the prescribed dose of lenalidomide, participant should seek
      emergency medical care if needed and contact study staff right away.

      Participant will also be given standard drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects.
      Participant may ask the study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their
      risks.

      Participant will receive rituximab by vein on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of Cycles 1 and 2. After
      that, participant will receive rituximab by vein on Day 1 of Cycles 3-8 and then every other
      cycle after that (Cycles 10, 12, 14, and so on). The first dose should take about 6-8 hours.
      After that, each dose should take about 4 hours.

      If the doctor thinks it is in participant's best interest, participant may receive rituximab
      for a period of over 2 days. Participant's doctor will tell if participant will receive the
      dose over 2 days.

      Length of Study:

      Participant may continue taking ibrutinib for as long as the doctor thinks it is in
      participant's best interest. Participant may continue taking lenalidomide for up to 1 year.
      Participant may continue taking rituximab for up to 2 years. Participant will no longer be
      able to take the drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if
      participant is unable to follow study directions.

      Participation will be over after follow-up.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of Cycle 1:

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn to check the status of the disease and for
           biomarker testing, which may include genetic biomarkers. Biomarkers are found in the
           blood and may be related to participant's reaction to the study drug.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn to check participant's immune system.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for tumor lysis syndrome monitoring if needed.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 1-12 and then every other cycle after that (Cycles 14, 16, 18, and so on):

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      On Days 8, 15, and 22 of Cycle 1, blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests
      and tumor lysis syndrome monitoring if needed.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 2, 4, 6, 8, then every 4 cycles after that (Cycles 12, 16, 20, and so on),
      participant will have a CT scan to check the status of the disease. If the doctor thinks it
      is in participant's best interest, participant may have these scans less often.

      One (1) time between Cycles 2-10, when the study doctor thinks it is needed or if the disease
      gets worse, blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing and to check
      participant's immune system.

      Every 14 days, if the doctor thinks it is needed and if participant is able to become
      pregnant, blood (about 1½ tablespoons) or urine will be collected for a pregnancy test.

      At any time during the study, if the study doctor thinks it is needed:

        -  Participant may have a bone marrow biopsy and/or aspiration.

        -  Participant may have a gastrointestinal endoscopy.

        -  Participant may have a PET/CT scan

        -  If participant can become pregnant, blood (about 1½ tablespoons) or urine may be
           collected for a pregnancy test.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      Within 30 days after participant's last dose of study drugs:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Participant will have an EKG.

        -  Blood (about 5-7 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, for biomarker testing,
           for immune system testing, and to check the status of the disease.

        -  Participant will have an x-ray.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, participant will have a CT scan and/or a PET/CT scan
           to check the status of the disease.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, participant will have a gastrointestinal endoscopy to
           check the status of the disease.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, participant will have a bone marrow biopsy and/or
           aspirate to check the status of the disease.

        -  If participant can become pregnant, blood (about 1½ tablespoons) or urine will be
           collected for a pregnancy test.

      Long Term Follow-Up:

      After participant's end-of-treatment visit, a member of the study staff will contact
      participant by phone every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months after that to see how
      participant is doing. These calls will take about 2-3 minutes.

      This is an investigational study. Ibrutinib is FDA approved and commercially available for
      the treatment of MCL. Rituximab is FDA approved for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
      and certain types of leukemia. Lenalidomide is FDA approved for the treatment of
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      The use of these drugs in combination is investigational. The study doctor can explain how
      the study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 40 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
