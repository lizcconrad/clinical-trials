             medication(s)

        Exclusion Criteria:

             disorder.

          -  Subjects with clinical presentation or history that is consistent with delirium,
             dementia, amnesia or other cognitive disorders; subjects with psychotic symptoms that
             are better accounted for by another general medical condition(s) or direct effect of a
             substance (eg, medication, illicit drug use)

          -  History of failure of clozapine treatment or response to clozapine treatment only
