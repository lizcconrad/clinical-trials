      The purpose of the study is to investigate whether preventive measures for newly hospitalized
      ventricular assist device (VAD) patients will reduce the Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) occurrence
      rate, progression and associated complications

      Participants will be in the study for the first 7 days of hospitalization. The study
      investigators will access the electronic medical record daily from admission day 1 through
      admission day 7 in order to provide clinical recommendations in an effort to minimize AKI
      risk as per routine practice.

      If the patient is discharged prior to day 7 the study, intervention will be terminated on day
      of discharge.

      The investigators will review the participant's medical record up to one year after surgery.

      This study will not include any experimental laboratory tests or experimental medication.

      The clinical recommendations will regard the following:

        1. Avoidance of potentially nephrotoxic medications (e.g. NSAIDs, intravascular contrast,
           nephrotoxic antimicrobials)

        2. Optimizing volume status (avoidance of volume overload or depletion)

        3. Optimizing electrolytes and acid-base status

        4. Optimizing hemodynamics (Mean arterial BP&gt;65mmHg)

        5. Assessment of kidney function with serum creatinine and/or cystatin C None of the
           suggestions will be experimental. All suggestions will be based on standard nephrology
           practice.

      The investigators plan to compare the results of the current study with those in in the years
      of 2012-2017 (1/7/2012- 1/7/2017) via retrospective chart review
