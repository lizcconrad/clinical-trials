  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain is becoming increasingly more prevalent worldwide. High rates of co-morbid
      psychological distress are also commonly found among individuals living with chronic pain.
      Often requiring a multi-modal treatment approach, a growing body of literature suggests that
      digital behavioral health interventions and tools may serve as promising complementary
      options to help individuals cope with the pain.

      The research objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of the myStrength product offerings,
      namely the chronic pain focus area, on study participants' functional well-being over time.
      The research questions to be answered include the following:

        1. Do study participants who are randomized to the myStrength intervention arm experience
           change in their self-reported ability to function, outlook on pain, and/or perception of
           prescription opioids.

        2. Do study participants who are randomized to the myStrength intervention arm experience
           change in terms of their behavioral health, such as anxiety and depression levels,
           during the study period.

      The study team hypothesizes that myStrength study participants will achieve a higher level of
      functioning and adopt a more positive outlook toward their pain management as compared to the
      waitlist control group. Self-assessments will be repeated throughout the study period to
      capture the inflection point of change as well as the sustainability of these changes over
      time.

    <description>The myStrength intervention arm will be encouraged to utilize the chronic pain offering consisting of 6 modules. Each module has 5 activities and can take on average 5-15 minutes to complete. Study participants assigned to the myStrength intervention will have one week to complete each module. In addition to completing the required chronic pain modules, study participants in the myStrength intervention arm will have the option to also select other areas of interest and complete corresponding activities at their own pace. myStrength utilization will be recorded and analyzed.</description>
