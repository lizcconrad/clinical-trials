  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this investigation is to assess the safety, feasibility and performance of
      the VIPUN Balloon Catheter 0.1 in the assessment of gastric motility. The investigation will
      also assess whether the inflation of the VIPUN Balloon Catheter can stimulate gastric
      motility and emptying. Furthermore, this investigation will examine whether gastric motility
      and emptying as measured in this study are correlated.
