  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is investigating a novel MRI method called Magnetic Resonance Force (MRF). MRF
      has been developed to accurately estimate tumour stiffness in the breast by measuring the
      interstitial fluid pressure (IFP).

      50 healthy volunteers will be recruited to extend the hardware and establish MRF imaging
      acquisition protocols for pre and post-menopausal women. Once completed, we will test this
      new imaging technique with the acquired imaging protocols on 100 patients undergoing surgery
      as first line of their treatment for their breast cancer to establish a potential biomarker
      signature predictive of lymph node involvement and metastatic potential. Simultaneously, 50
      patients undergoing chemotherapy as first line of their treatment for their breast cancers
      will be recruited to develop a biomarker signature that could predict response or resistance
      to neoadjuvant chemotherapy as determined by conventional imaging and histopathology.

      Magnetic Resonance Force (MRF) is based on Magnetic Resonance Elastography which uses
      mechanical waves to quantitatively assess the viscoelastic properties of tumours and the
      shift in interstitial fluid pressure (or stiffness) of tissues.

      It generates 3D images of applied deformation via low frequency acoustic waves within the
      tissue and provides a snapshot of the apparent stiffening of the tumour border zone. Growth
      induced stretch of the tumour not only increases stiffness but also alters the apparent
      change in stiffness due to additional loading. Magnetic Resonance Force (MRF) provides
      measures of MRE and macro-deformation at multiple load states therefore enabling estimation
      of tissue properties as well as the stress load relation. Since the stress load relation is
      related to tumour swelling and modifications, it can be directly linked to the tumour
      pre-strain and provides an indicator of the underlying interstitial tumour pressure. Using
      biomechanical models it is possible to directly translate the stress load relation into an
      estimate of IFP. The same approach also allows quantifying the active pull by cell traction
      forces (CTFs) coming from the tumour and exerted onto its surroundings. While that force is
      directed inwards, the force generated by the elevated interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) is
      directed outwards allowing separation of both effects from each other. These forces represent
      one of the biomarkers which we will quantify within the this project using MRF.
