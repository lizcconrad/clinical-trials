  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the different analgesic protocols for patients receiving total hip
      arthroplasty(THA). Patients will divided into 3 groups, which are 1. fascia iliaca
      compartment block with IV-PCA(patient controlled analgesia), 2. femoral nerve and lateral
      femoral cutaneous nerve block with IV-PCA, 3. IV-PCA only.
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      90 patients will be enrolled and randomized to the 3 different groups.

        1. Inclusion criteria:

           Patient undergoing THA: 20-75 years old, ASA I-III, general anesthesia with intubation,
           fentanyl IV PCA.

        2. Exclusion criteria Alcohol/substance abuse Rheumatoid arthritis Severe coagulation
           disorder(PLT&lt;80000 or INR &gt; 1.5) Peripheral neuropathy Allergy to opioids or local
           anesthetics BMI&gt;35

        3. The outcome followers are blinded to the intervention provided.

        4. Outcome parameters:

             1. Opioid consumption of IV PCA in first 24 hrs.

             2. NSAID consumption

             3. NRS of pain, the timings of follow-up should be: pre-block, 30

                mins post-block, 60 mins post-block, 2 hours post-block, 24hours post-block

             4. sensory block in FN, Obturator Nerve and LFCN

             5. First request of supplemental IV analgesia

    <description>1. Fascia iliaca compartment block: The injection was performed under ultrasound guidance. Surface landmark is identified on the line between anterior superior iliac spine and pubic tubercle. The injection site is at the medial one-third of the line. The needle is threaded medial to lateral and standardization of local anesthetic deposit is in the fascia plane between fascia iliaca and iliacus muscle. Anesthetic regimen: 2% xylocaine 15mL + 0.5% bupivacaine 15mL.</description>

    <description>Femoral nerve block: The injection was performed under ultrasound guidance. Femoral nerve was identified in the femoral neurovascular bundle below or around inguinal ligament. The needle is threaded with lateral to medial approach. Local anesthetics will be deposited around the femoral nerve, the standardization of protocol is that femoral nerve should be lifted off from iliacus muscle. Anesthetic regimen: 2% xylocaine 10mL + 0.5% bupivacaine 10mL.
Lateral femoral cutaneous nerve block: The injection was performed under ultrasound guidance. Lateral femoral cutaneous nerve was identified in the fascia plane between sartorius muscle and tensor fascia lata muscle. Anesthetic regimen: 2% xylocaine 5mL + 0.5% bupivacaine 5mL</description>
