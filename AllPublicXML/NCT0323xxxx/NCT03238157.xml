  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiation retinopathy is a known complication of ocular radiation therapy. To date there is
      no known effective treatment. In addition to their anti-vascular endothelial growth factor
      (VEGF) properties, corticosteroids decrease the retinal capillary permeability by increasing
      the activity/density of tight junctions and acute inflammatory effects of radiation in
      various tissues.

      The purpose of the project is threefold:

        1. To study the natural history of radiation retinopathy using advanced imaging techniques.
           A combination of macular OCT to evaluate for edema, OCT angiography to evaluate for
           macular and peri-papillary ischemia and wide-field angiography for peripheral ischemia
           and leakage. Potential role of OCT angiography in radiation retinopathy will be
           evaluated by comparison to other eye (control) and FA.

        2. Currently there is no consensus on effective management strategy for radiation
           retinopathy. Patients in the interventional will be prospectively followed to study
           efficacy of steroids for early treatment of radiation retinopathy while comparing the
           multimodal therapeutic approach in a randomized trial.

        3. Patients in the observational arm will be prospectively followed while comparing the
           multimodal therapeutic approach in a randomized trial.

    <description>The study will only include those patients that are ascertained be at more than 50% risk for vision loss (20/200 or worse at 3 years) because of total radiation dose of &gt;40 Gy to the center of the macula. These &quot;at risk&quot; patients included in the study will receive intravitreal triamcinolone (4 mg in 0.1 ml) injected at the time of plaque removal. If lack of IOP rise (30 mm Hg or more) at 3 months, then randomized to either observation (2:1) (standard of care).</description>
