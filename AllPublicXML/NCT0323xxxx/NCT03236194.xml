  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will be studying the development of the microbiome over the first year
      after birth in light of various environmental influences - e.g. mode of delivery, diet (and
      diet changes), antibiotic exposure, GERD medication exposure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Microbiome samples will be collected from mother/infant pairs during post-natal hospital stay
      through the first year of life. Investigators will perform statistical analyses to test the
      hypotheses (1) that there is an association between the developing oral and gut microbiomes,
      and (2) that they interact in affecting childhood obesity.

      This study relates to the INSIGHT study (NCT01167270) and its last outcome measure; exploring
      oral and gut microbiome collected from that study's second born participants.
