  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To report the outcome of hypo-fractionated radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy (RP) for
      prostate cancer (PCa) using IMRT-SIB. 124 patients with PCa at high risk of relapse after RP
      or diagnosis of biochemical relapse were included. Patients received 62.5 Gy to the prostate
      bed (PB) and 45 Gy to pelvis nodes in 25 fractions. Androgen suppressive therapy was
      prescribed based on NCCN risk categories. Median follow-up was 30 months.

      To report the outcome of hypo-fractionated radiation therapy after radical prostatectomy (RP)
      for prostate cancer (PCa) using intensity-modulated radiation treatment with simultaneous
      integrated boost (IMRT-SIB).

      One hundred and twenty-four patients with PCa at high risk of relapse after RP or diagnosis
      of biochemical relapse were included in this phase II study (adjuvant: 106 patients, salvage:
      18 patients). All patients received 62.5 Gy to the prostate bed (PB) and 45 Gy to pelvis
      nodes in 25 fractions. Androgen suppressive therapy was prescribed based on NCCN risk
      categories. Acute and late toxicities were recorded and evaluated according to RTOG
      (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group) criteria and RTOG-EORTC (European Organization for
      Research and Treatment of Cancer) scale, respectively.

      Median follow-up was 30 months (13-92).
