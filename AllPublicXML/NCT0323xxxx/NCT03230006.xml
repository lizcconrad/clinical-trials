  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Almost 18 million US adults have alcohol use disorders (AUD), with one third of these
      individuals also diagnosed with anxiety disorders (AXD). The coexistence of AUD and AXD
      imposes a high burden via healthcare costs and lost productivity. To date, existing treatment
      approaches for addressing AUD/AXD comorbidity have been only modestly effective and there is
      a lack of adequate research to guide treatment decisions.

      The Unified Protocol (UP) is a transdiagnostic, cognitive-behavioral therapy that has shown
      efficacy in treating emotional disorders. The efficacy of the UP to facilitate abstinence
      from alcohol consumption in individuals with comorbid AUD/AXD has also been examined, with
      results from this study indicating a reduction from baseline in drinks consumed per day.
      However, further evaluation of the UP for managing AUD/AXD is warranted.

      In this clinical trial, the investigators will further assess the UP's effectiveness in
      reducing alcohol consumption in patients with comorbid AUD/AXD. Participants will be
      randomized to one of two conditions: 1) treatment with the UP or 2) treatment with
      therapist-guided Take Control (TC; a computerized alcohol reduction program). In addition, in
      a subset of twenty-five participants, functional magnetic resonance scanning (fMRI) will be
      used to examine the effects of the UP on changes in brain activity in areas important to
      regulation of emotional and reward processes implicated in excessive alcohol consumption.

      The researchers' primary hypotheses are that the UP group will, compared to the TC group: 1)
      be superior in acute symptom reduction from pre- to post-treatment, and 2) evidence greater
      reductions in percent days heavy drinking, percent days of drinking per week, and alcohol
      craving.

    <description>The Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders (UP) consists of 5 core skills modules based on cognitive behavioral treatment elements of proven effectiveness. As noted above, these core skills modules were designed to target (and have been shown to address) negative emotionality and aversive reactivity to emotional experiences when they occur (Boswell et al., 2013; Carl et al., 2014; Sauer-Zavala et al., 2012). These modules are preceded by an introductory session that reviews the patient's presenting symptoms and provides a therapeutic rationale, as well as a module on motivational enhancement. A final module consists of relapse prevention. As the treatment proceeds, the domains of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are each explored in detail, focusing specifically on elucidating dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies that the patient has developed over time within each of these domains, and teaching patients more adaptive emotion regulation skills.</description>

In this study, TC will be administered in a computerized format, but will involve direct therapist contact to control for effects that may be related to patient-therapist interaction (as opposed to elements of the treatment itself). Specifically, on a weekly basis, therapists will review material from TC and offer general advice on implementation of the alcohol reduction skills in daily life.</description>
