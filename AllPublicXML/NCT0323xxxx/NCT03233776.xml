  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral and intestinal mucositis are major risk factors for the occurrence of fever during
      neutropenia and bloodstream infections after intensive chemo- and radiotherapy. These
      complications often require dose reductions or cause delay of treatment, and thereby
      interfere with optimal anticancer treatment. Currently, there are no effective strategies to
      prevent or treat mucositis and the related complications.

      The pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β) has shown pivotal in the pathogenesis of
      mucositis and recently, it has been established in murine models that IL-1 inhibition
      significantly ameliorates chemotherapy-induced intestinal mucositis.

      In this phase IIa study the safety, maximum tolerated dose and efficacy of anakinra, a
      recombinant human IL-1 receptor antagonist, will be determined in adult patients with
      multiple myeloma who receive high-dose melphalan (HDM) in the preparation for an autologous
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) and are at high risk for experiencing
      mucositis and fever during neutropenia (FN). After establishing the optimal dose, a pivotal
      double-blind randomized placebo-controlled multicenter phase IIb trial will be planned to
      establish efficacy.

    <description>In this study, using a traditional 3+3 design, 3 doses of anakinra will be examined: 100, 200 and 300 mg. The first cohort of patients will start with 100 mg. Escalation to the next dose cohort(s) is based on the occurrence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs). The definition of a DLT is: an opportunistic infection, a SUSAR, severe non-hematological toxicity grade 3-4, or the occurrence of primary graft failure or prolonged neutropenia (neutrophils have not been &gt;0.5 x10^9/l on one single day, assessed on day +21, and counting from day 0).</description>
