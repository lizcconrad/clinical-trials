  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One hundred twenty female patients who underwent thyroidectomy were evenly distributed into
      three groups: conventional access (CA), aesthetic principles access (APA) and minimally
      invasive access (MIA). The Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) was used as the
      assessment tool for the linear scar. After one year follow-up, the cosmetic outcomes were
      assessed.

      A prospective study in patients with DTC at the Department of Head and Neck Surgery at
      Perking University Cancer Hospital (also called Beijing Cancer hospital). A total of 120
      female patients who underwent surgical treatment for DTC were enrolled in the study from June
      2012 to June 2014. All patients were diagnosed with DTC through preoperative fine needle
      aspiration biopsy pathology. These patients were individually randomly assigned (1:1:1 ratio)
      into the conventional access group (CA), the aesthetic principles access group (APA) or the
      minimally invasive access group (MIA). Lobectomy plus ipsilateral central lymph node
      dissection (CLND) was adopted in each patient. DTC staging was T1N0M0 or T1N1M0. The
      investigators retrieved the patients' information, including age, incision length, incision
      closure procedure, incidence of complications, and cosmetic assessment from patients' medical
      records. Patients with other medical diseases, such as diabetes or obesity, a smoking
      history, a keloid tendency, a history of radiotherapy to the head and neck, or with
      incomplete information, were excluded. RLN function was evaluated by electronic fiber
      laryngoscopy 6 months postoperatively. The follow-up time was 12.3 months. The research was
      reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of Peking University Cancer Hospital, and
      informed consent was obtained from all patients to publish the information/image(s) in an
      online open-access publication. The study was open-label with no blinding of patients,
      clinicians, or research staff.

    <description>The POSAS scale is a reliable and feasible tool for linear scar evaluation. The POSAS included the observer scale and the patient scale. The Observer Scar Assessment Scale (OSAS) score was obtained by the same observer; this scale includes 5 items graded on a 10-point scale with 1 indicating normal skin and 10 indicating the worst scar imaginable. A summary score of 5 indicates normal skin, and a summary score of 50 is the worst possible scar result. The Patient Scar Assessment Scale (PSAS) consists of 6 items. All items are graded by the patient on a 10-point scale; a summary score of 6 to 60 represents the range from normal skin to the worst imaginable scar. After scoring the items, the observer and the patients rated the overall scar appearance on a visual analogue scale corresponding to a 10-point scale.</description>

    <description>A 4- to 5-cm incision was created, subplatysmal flaps were raised, and the strap muscles were mobilized. Then, the superior pole of the thyroid gland was exposed and the gland was delivered through the surgical incision, and the thyroid isthmus was divided. Finally, CLND was performed. The strap muscles were re-approximated with No.1 silk suture. The full-thickness skin was closed with interrupted monofilament.</description>

    <description>The key difference focused on the disposal incision using aesthetic principles, which are depicted below. The incision was protected by Vaseline ointment. Excessive skin traction was avoided to prevent the injury on the skin edge. Bleeding was stanched with a low-power bipolar coagulation device. The surgical field does not have to be pulled in every direction to show the full operation field. The cervical linea alba was closed by continuous sutures with 3-0 absorbable Vicryl sutures. Interrupted sutures of 4-0 Vicryl were used to re-approximate the subcutaneous tissues. The epidermis was fixed with 3M steri-strip elastic skin closures rather than skin sutures.</description>

    <description>With the MIA approach, a shorter incision of between 3 and 4 cm was created. The procedure used the Harmonic scalpel as an auxiliary device. First, the isthmus was divided. Second, the lower pole of the thyroid was dissected from the adipose tissue, and the inferior thyroid vessels were divided close to the thyroid gland for mobilization. The RLN and parathyroid glands were carefully dissected. Third, the superior pole of the thyroid gland was disconnected. Finally, CLND was performed. The closure procedure for the incision was similar to that for APA.</description>
