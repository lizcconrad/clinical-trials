  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study aims to evaluate the feasibility of close glucose monitoring and management
      of patients (targeting fasting and pre-meal glucose of 4-7 mmol/L) using state-of-the-art
      flash glucose monitoring (FGM) technology. The glycemic intervention will be personalized
      based on individual blood glucose levels. Although the glycemic interventions used in this
      study include standard medications and methods of glucose monitoring used for patients with
      diabetes, this pilot study will specifically evaluate the feasibility of using these
      approaches in patients with GBM, appreciating their additional medical, functional and social
      challenges.

      The purpose of this pilot study is to determine the feasibility of using close monitoring and
      management of glucose levels in patients undergoing radiation and chemotherapy for
      glioblastoma.

      The glucose management will include the use of standard metformin a common treatment for
      patients with early type 2 diabetes that has also shown anti-tumor effects in GBM, and will
      be further personalized based on individual blood glucose levels. Additional
      anti-hyperglycemic management will be provided at the discretion of the Endocrinologist.

      Close glucose monitoring will include flash glucose monitoring (FGM) with a device called an
      FreeStyle Libre Pro Flash Glucose Monitoring System, finger-prick glucose measures (standard
      approach for patients with diabetes) and weekly blood tests (our current standard for
      patients with GBM).

      In addition to determining the feasibility of using these approaches, this pilot study will
      help identify the simplest and most effective approach of managing glucose levels in patients
      with GBM appreciating their additional medical, functional and social challenges.
