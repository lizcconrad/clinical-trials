    <textblock>
      This is a research study to test the combination of two drugs, pembrolizumab and epacadostat
      with the goal of benefiting subjects with head and neck cancers where prior or ongoing
      regimens with a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor for the treatment of advanced head and neck cancer

      Primary Objective(s) &amp; Hypothesis

      (1) Objective: Response Rate

      Hypotheses:

      Cohort 1: In patient with prior response to anti-PD-1/PD-L1+ therapy and subsequent
      (acquired) resistance combined IDO1 and PD-1 inhibition will re-induce responses.

      Cohort 2: In patients with suboptimal benefit from prior anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy combined
      IDO1 and PD-1 inhibition will induce clinically meaningful responses.

      Secondary Objective(s) &amp; Hypothesis

        1. Objective: 1-year Progression-free (PFS) and Overall (OS) survival Hypothesis: Combined
           PD-1 blockade with pembrolizumab + epacadostat in HNSCC patients will lead to improved
           1-year survival in patients who a) progress on prior anti-PD-1/PD/L1 therapy on, and/or
           b) compared to patients who progress on 2nd line chemotherapy.

        2. Safety Hypothesis: Combined treatment with pembrolizumab and epacadostat will be safe
           and tolerable in HNSCC patients.

      Exploratory/Translational Objectives

        1. Interferon-gamma Gene Expression Profile (GEP) (Seiwert ASCO 2015, Ribas ASCO 2015) and
           evaluation of RR, PFS, and OS in GEP positive and GEP negative patients.

        2. Determine the micro-environment that underlies resistance/suboptimal treatment

             1. underlying degree of tumor inflammation

             2. Baseline PD-L1 expression

           d) Determine underlying Interferon Gamma signature

        3. Assess underlying mutational burden (Snyder 2014)) Preclinical hypothesis: IDO1
           inhibition will alter the micro-environment to a be &quot;more T-cell inflamed&quot; and make
           tumors amenable to benefit from anti-PD-1 treatment (when given concurrently with IDO1
           inhibition). Hence we will evaluate tumors, with prior response exhibiting acquired
           resistance as well as tumors with minor/suboptimal benefit from prior PD-1/PD-L1 therapy
           for evidence (at baseline) of suboptimal immune microenvironmental conditions.

             subject may enroll if the average QTc for the 3 ECGs is &lt; 470 milliseconds. For
             subjects with an intraventricular conduction delay (QRS interval &gt; 120 milliseconds),
             the JTc interval may be used in place of the QTc with sponsor approval. The JTc must
             be &lt; 340 milliseconds if JTc is used in place of the QTc. Subjects with left bundle

             requiring therapy Note: Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally
             inactivated flu vaccines and are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g.,
             Flu-Mist®) are live attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed within 30 days prior to
             initiation of treatment.
