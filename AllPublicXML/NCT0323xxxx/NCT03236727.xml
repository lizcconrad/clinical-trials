  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intravenous anesthetic agents as far as inhaled agents produce a dose depended increase in
      latency and decrease in amplitude of SomatoSensory Evoked Potential (SSEP). Dexmetedomidine,
      a highly selective a2 adrenergic agonist, not only minimizes the anesthetic agents but also
      the opioids, reducing the analgesic demands. The effect of dexmedetomidine on SSEP has not
      been elucidated. We aimed to investigate alterations on somatosensory SSEP in adults during
      posterior spinal fusion surgery before and after Dexmedetomidine administration.

    <textblock>
      Patients 18-75 years old, ASA (physical status classification system) I-III, scheduled for
      elective posterior spinal fusion surgery were enrolled in this prospective study. After
      induction in anesthesia, it was applied SSEP monitoring and a baseline test was performed
      after 15min (in order to wash out the propofol used for induction). Infusion of
      Dexmedetomidine was started at a bolus dose of 1mcg/Kg following by 0.7mcg/Kg. Bispectral
      Index (BIS) monitored the depth of anesthesia and an adequate level (40-50) of anesthesia was
      maintained by sevoflurane. SSEP were recorded intraoperatively from the tibial nerve (P37)
      and data were analyzed over that period.
