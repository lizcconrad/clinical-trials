  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Analgesia in liver surgery is a challenge, postoperative coagulopathy risk raises fears an
      epidural haematoma formation following the epidural analgesia, &quot;gold standard&quot; in major
      abdominal surgery. The spinal analgesia and/or continuous wound infiltration of local
      anesthetics constitute so an alternative.

      The study will compare the continuous infiltration of local anesthetics and rachianalgesia in
      terms of decreased postoperative morphine consumption and incidences of chronic postoperative
      pain at 3 and 6 months after hepatic surgery compared to the control group.
