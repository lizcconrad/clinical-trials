      This pivotal, open-label, single-arm study will evaluate the anti-cancer activity of ARQ 087
      by Objective Response Rate (ORR) by central radiology review as per RECIST v1.1 in subjects
      with inoperable or advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) whose tumors harbor FGFR2
      gene fusions (by FISH performed by the central laboratory) and who received at least one
      prior regimen of systemic therapy. Subjects will be dosed orally once per day at 300 mg of
      ARQ 087 capsules.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed written informed consent granted prior to initiation of any study-specific
             procedures

          2. 18 years of age or older

          3. Histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced, inoperable (where surgery
             is not indicated due to disease extension, co-morbidities, or other technical
             reasons), or metastatic iCCA or mixed histology tumors (combined
             hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma [cHCC-CCA])

          4. FGFR2 gene fusion status confirmed by NGS or FISH testing

               -  Test positive by FISH by the central laboratory designated by the Sponsor

               -  Have FGFR2 gene fusion documented by a local or central laboratory using standard
                  protocols and approved by local IRB/EC, by CLIA or other similar agency. If the
                  FGFR2 gene fusion is identified by a laboratory other than the Sponsor's central
                  laboratory, then archival and/or recent tissue biopsy samples or a tissue block
                  suitable for genetic testing must be available for confirmatory testing by FISH
                  by the Sponsor's central laboratory. If a subject has documentation from the
                  central laboratory indicating that they test negative for FGFR2 gene fusion, that
                  subject may not be enrolled in the study.

          5. Received at least one regimen of prior systemic therapy and then experienced
             documented radiographic progression or was not able to tolerate prior systemic
             therapy.

               -  If the subject received at least 4 cycles of systemic therapy and no measurable
                  tumor reduction compared to the previous scan is observed, such subject can be
                  enrolled

               -  If the subject received immunotherapy, the documented radiographic disease
                  progression is required

          7. ECOG performance status ≤ 1

          8. Adequate organ functions as indicated by the following laboratory values (based on
             screening visit values from the central laboratory).

         10. Previous malignancy within 2 years of the first dose of ARQ 087, except curatively
             treated or low grade malignancies such as non-melanoma skin cancer, carcinoma in-situ
