  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to:

        1. Evaluate the relative efficacy of a treadmill desk intervention and a sit/stand desk
           intervention on light physical activity and sitting behaviors at work over four weeks;

        2. Evaluate the relative efficacy of a treadmill desk intervention and a sit/stand desk
           intervention on the cardiometabolic risk profiles (composite measure of fasting glucose,
           insulin, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol, and blood pressure)over a four-week period.

      American workers spend 70-80% of their time at work sitting at a desk, working on a computer,
      talking on a telephone, and sitting in meetings. Traditional approaches to increase MVPA in
      the workplace may not be sustainable as they require deliberate and dedicated time away from
      work, and may be perceived as harmful to productivity. Sedentary behavior interventions, in
      contrast, do not interfere with daily tasks and productivity and require small but cumulative
      changes in posture and LPA throughout the workday.

      Sedentary behavior interventions in the worksite, including those conducted by our team, have
      shown promising effects. Studies that have used multi-level approaches targeting individual,
      social, and environmental factors have been most effective. The most robust environmental
      support has been the use of sit-stand workstations, providing distinct opportunities for
      workers to reduce sitting while maintaining productivity. However, treadmill desks may
      provide an even greater opportunity to both reduce sitting and increase LPA during the
      workday. Thus, a pilot study is required to test the efficacy of two approaches to reduce
      sitting and increase LPA in the workplace.

    <intervention_model_description>A within-person, cross-over design will be used. Twenty overweight and obese participants will take part in two interventions: 1) the treadmill desk: this intervention will allow for 1hr+ per day at a treadmill desk for four weeks; and 2) the sit/stand desk: a sit/stand workstation will be installed at the desk for four weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to their initial intervention condition after baseline measures have been collected. In addition to the two intervention months, there will be a one-week baseline period (to collected information on habitual activity level at work) and a four-week &quot;washout period&quot; in between intervention months.</intervention_model_description>
