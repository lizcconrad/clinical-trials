  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ultrasound represents a promising technique for the assessment of joint health in persons
      with haemophilia (PWH) by non-imaging specialists. The Haemophilia Early Arthropathy
      Detection with Ultrasound (HEAD-US) programme has been developed with the aim of integrating
      joint ultrasound in the routine assessment of PWH through the use of a simplified scoring
      system. The inter-operator reliability of the technique among European haemophilia treaters
      has been validated and described elsewhere. Further work is needed to assess the real-world
      impact of ultrasound on disease management and treatment decision-making.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients are seen routinely in clinic by specialist haemophilia physiotherapists who assess
      the patients using the Haemophilia Joint Health Score tool (HJHS). Trial participants will be
      seen during their routine clinic visits and will be seen by a clinician and the
      physiotherapist who will carry out the routine assessment along with the HEAD-US scan.

      Patients will be seen a maximum of 4 times throughout the year from registration of the first
      patient, according to their visit schedule, but will only be scanned at the first visit.

      Results will be analysed to determine if the treatment decision-making is influenced by the
      results of the scan
