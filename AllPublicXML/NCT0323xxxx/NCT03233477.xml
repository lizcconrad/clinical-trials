  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Posner-Schlossman syndrome, or glaucomatocyclitic crisis, is a condition characterized by
      recurrent, acute attacks of mild, nongranulomatous, anterior uveitis accompanied by markedly
      elevated intraocular pressure. Most of patients are the 20 to 50-year-old young adults, with
      unilateral eye involvement. PSS was originally deemed benign, but is now recognized as a
      relatively rare cause of chronic secondary glaucoma,especially in patients with recurrent
      episodes. This relatively rare disease is likely the result of the infections of a variety of
      organisms, and the bulk of literature supports the cytomegalovirus (CMV) as the leading
      cause.

      This study is an observational study that does not interfere with the normal clinical
      diagnosis and treatment process. The investigators in this study focus on observing the
      clinical symptoms and outcome of PSS, analyzing the factors that affect the prognosis of PSS,
      studying the association of its pathogenesis with the psychological status and the behavioral
      types of PSS patients; exploring the relationship between infection (CMV, HSV, Hp) and PSS;
      and studying the changes of local and systemic cytokine expression and its significance in
      patients with PSS.
