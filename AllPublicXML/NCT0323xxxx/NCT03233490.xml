    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this thesis is to identify the factors that may affect 13 year old
      students' acquisition of CPR skills and their willingness to act. The primary hypothesis is
      that the training method (intervention) influences the participants' acquisition of practical
      CPR skills and willingness to intervene.

      The study used a cluster randomized design, based on a randomization list generated by an
      independent statistician. The school classes were randomly assigned to different CPR training
      interventions.

      A strategic sample, where invitation to participate in the study was sent to the headmasters
      of all council schools, with seventh grade students, in two Swedish municipalities (140,000).
      Thus, the sample consists of participants with different cultural as well as socio-economic
      background. Eighteen of 24 schools agreed to participate. Four schools did not respond and
      two schools had a routine to offer CPR education only for grade nine (all six schools from
      the same municipality). The eighteen schools who agreed to participate consisted of
      sixty-eight classes with 1547 students.

      Prior to study participation, students and their guardians obtained a letter with study
      information. Study participation of the individual students was voluntary and all
      participants gave an oral informed consent.

      Inclusion criteria: seventh grade student in one of the participating schools. Exclusion
      criteria: student does not want to participate, student with a physical handicap that limited
      the physical performance, classes of students with development disabilities (these classes
      are age-integrated and have fewer students per class).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main interventions were app or DVD-based education. In addition to the main intervention
      some classes were randomized to various additional interventions; web-course, visits of elite
      athletes, practical test, reflection and AED training. All CPR education was performed in
      accordance with the ERC guidelines of 2010. Training was given to the entire class together.
      The classes consisted of 14-29 students. All participants in all intervention groups used an
      individual training manikin, MiniAnne, during the training. The schools were allowed to keep
      the training manikins after the end of study. Ten teachers were previous CPR instructors and
      another 19 teachers received a five hours education to become CPR instructor. All teachers
      obtained individual oral and written instructions about each class randomized intervention
      method and written bullet points about how the course would be implemented, to ensure that
      they were up to date with present guidelines and training. The teachers acted as
      facilitators; they introduced the lesson, gave advice on the fly, answered questions and
      completed the course.
