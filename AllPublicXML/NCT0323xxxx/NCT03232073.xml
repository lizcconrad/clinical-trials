    <textblock>
      The study AC-058B301 (OPTIMUM; NCT02425644) has been designed to investigate the efficacy,
      safety and tolerability of ponesimod in subjects with relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS). The
      AC-058B303 study is the long-term extension for the core study AC-058B301. The purpose of
      this long term extension of the core study AC-058B301 is to characterize the long-term
      safety, tolerability, and control of disease of ponesimod 20 mg in subjects with RMS.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a single-group open-label extension study to investigate long-term safety, tolerability and control of disease of ponesimod 20 mg in subjects with RMS. Statistical analyses will be descriptive and therefore all endpoints are exploratory in nature. All exploratory endpoints are listed under primary outcomes.</intervention_model_description>
