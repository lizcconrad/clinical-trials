  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemorrhagic shock is a pathologic state in which intravascular volume and oxygen delivery are
      impaired. During circulatory failure associated with hypovolemia and low cardiac output,
      redistribution of blood flow caused by increased vasoconstriction results in decreased
      perfusion of the skin.

      Skin temperature and capillary refill time has been advocated as a measure of peripheral
      perfusion.

      Perfusion index (PI) is a non-invasive numerical value of peripheral perfusion obtained from
      pulse oximetry, it is an indicator of the pulse strength at the sensor site. The PI's values
      range from 0.2% for very weak pulse to 20% for extremely strong pulse according to patient's
      physiological conditions and monitoring sites.

      Large increases in lactate (i.e. &gt; 5 mmol/L) usually only occur due to hypoperfusion or
      muscle activity such as exercise or seizures.

      This study will investigate the role of nitroglycerine patch in improving the peripheral
      perfusion in poly traumatized patient with hemorrhagic shock for the first time.

    <intervention_model_description>To avoid significant hypotension during nitroglycerin administration, each patient was evaluated for adequate intravascularvolume as evidenced by repeated volume challenges(250 mL of crystalloid over 10 minutes) up to appoint at which central venous pressure raised by more than 2 mmHg.
When the systolic blood pressure reaches 90mmHg or more we can apply the nitroglycerin patch of 2.5 mg alongside with continuous resuscitation the dose can be doubled according to the change in the peripheral perfusion parameters. Time between administration of nitroglycerin patch and peak of its action will be calculated.
Nitroglycerin patch will be removed if the patient developed significant hypotension (mean arterial pressure of less than 50 mm Hg ) however its action may persist up to 45minutes after removal.
During the study, infusion rates of noradrenaline or other vasoactive drugs were not changed and no additional fluids were administered.</intervention_model_description>
