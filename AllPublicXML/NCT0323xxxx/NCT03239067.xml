  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-center study to assess the long- and short-term outcomes of
      ticagrelor vs clopidogrel in Chinese patients with acute coronary syndrome undergoing
      percutaneous coronary intervention. When 4500 patients have completed the follow-up, an
      interim analysis will be performed.

    <description>Vascular death was defined as death from cardiovascular causes or cerebrovascular causes and any unknown death unless there was another certain cause.
The definition of myocardial infarction was consistent with the Third Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction (1).
Stroke was defined as a rapid onset of a new focal loss of neurologic function caused by an ischemic or hemorrhagic central nervous system event with residual symptoms lasting at least 24 hours from their onset or leading to death.</description>

    <description>All-cause death was defined as any death at hospital or after discharge.
The definition of myocardial infarction was consistent with the Third Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction.
