      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of vedolizumab intravenous
      (IV) infusion as induction treatment in Chinese participants withmoderately to severely
      active Crohn's disease (CD) at Week 10.

      The drug being tested in this study is called vedolizumab. Vedolizumab will be administered
      as an intravenous (IV) infusion in Chinese participants. This study will investigate the
      efficacy and safety of vedolizumab IV as induction and maintenance therapy in participants
      with moderately to severely active Crohn's Disease (CD).

      The study will enroll approximately 300 moderately to severely active Chinese patients with
      CD.

      Induction Phase: participants will be randomized 2:1 to receive:

        -  Vedolizumab IV 300 mg

        -  Placebo IV

      Participants will receive vedolizumab 300 mg or matching placebo, intravenous (IV) infusion
      at Weeks 0, 2, and 6 in the induction phase. At Week 10, participants will be assessed for
      clinical response. Results of Week 10 clinical response will determine the treatment pathway
      in the maintenance phase.

      Maintenance Phase: participants who achieved clinical response at Week 10 will continue to
      receive the same treatment as they received in Induction Phase; every 8 weeks (Q8W) starting
      at Week 14. Participants who received vedolizumab IV or placebo in the Induction Phase and
      did not achieve clinical response at Week 10 will receive vedolizumab every 4 weeks (Q4W)
      starting at Week 14.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in China. The overall time to participate in this
      study is 60 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and will be
      contacted by telephone, 6 months after last dose of study drug for a long-term follow-up
      safety survey.

    <description>Enhanced clinical response is defined as ≥100-point decrease from baseline in the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score at Week 10. CDAI is a scoring system for the assessment of Crohn's Disease Activity, index values of 150 and below are associated with quiescent disease; values above that indicate active disease and values above 450 are seen with extremely severe disease.</description>
