      INTRODUCTION Fungal Keratitis Microbial keratitis is a leading cause of monocular blindness
      worldwide, being second only to cataract as per WHO bulletin.[1]Fungal keratitis represents
      almost half of all cases of suppurative keratitis in some parts of the developing world[2]
      and comprises 30-40% of all cases of culture-positive infectious keratitis particularly in
      South India[3, 4]. Filamentous fungi have been reported as causative agents in large
      proportions of mycotic corneal ulcers in tropical climates as compared to temperate
      climates[1].

      Despite high prevalence of fungal keratitis, the treatment of fungal keratitis is more
      challenging than bacterial keratitis for several reasons including but not limited to the
      following: few commercially available topical anti-fungal agents, fungistatic drugs, limited
      ocular penetration, insubstantial research and development into newer agents. , Studies of
      longer duration elucidate that monocular vision loss from fungal corneal ulcers had an impact
      on psychosocial functioning apart from its effect on mobility and activity limitation,
      especially among those with severe vision loss in the involved eye.[5, 6] In addition it has
      been well established that poor vision is associated with depression. [7] Current treatment
      for fungal keratitis Few published randomized controlled trial compare alternative antifungal
      therapy for mycotic keratitis[8, 9], and no new ocular antifungal medications have been
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration since amphotericin B and natamycin were approved
      in the 1960s [10].

      Currently, fungal infections of the cornea are difficult to eradicate as fungi often resist
      treatment. Management of fungal keratitis requires timely diagnosis of the infection and
      administration of appropriate antifungal therapy. Antifungal agents are still the major
      therapeutic options in fungal keratitis, whereby success depends on the agent's ability to
      penetrate into the aqueous and achieve therapeutic levels [11].

      Natamycin Natamycin, the only FDA-approved agent for the treatment of fungal keratitis, is a
      fungicidal tetraene polyene antibiotic, derived from Streptomyces natalensis that possesses
      in vitro activity against a variety of yeast and filamentous fungi, including Candida,
      Aspergillus, Cephalosporium, Fusarium and Penicillium species[12]. Therefore Natamycin is the
      preferred drug of choice for filamentous fungal keratitis. Topical Natamycin poorly
      penetrates an intact epithelium and often requires manual debridement of the corneal
      epithelium for greater efficacy. It has a antimicrobial power as effective as Econazole[8],
      more effective than Itraconazole[13], and more rapidly acting than Terbinafine[14],. Topical
      Natamycin has been superior to topical Voriconazole for the treatment of filamentous fungal
      corneal ulcers, and in particular those culture-positive for Fusarium species [15, 16].

      Voriconazole Newer triazoles (Voriconazole, Posaconazole and Ravuconazole) have been
      suggested as better alternatives in the treatment of fungal keratitis not responding to
      conventional antifungals. They are fungistatic and act by inhibiting biosynthesis of
      ergosterol, an essential component in fungal cell wall[17]. Voriconazole is active against
      both filamentous fungi and Candida species and has recently become the treatment of choice
      for systemic diseases such as pulmonary aspergillosis[18]. Numerous case reports in the
      ophthalmic literature have described the use of Voriconazole in fungal keratitis [17, 19-24].
      The superiority of these agents compared with natamycin has not been established Topical
      voriconazole has good penetration into the eye (0.61-3.30 mg/L in the aqueous humor after 1 h
      of topical administration)[25]. Recent randomized controls have not reported greater efficacy
      of 1% voriconazole, (reconstituted from injection vial) compared to 5% natamycin eye drops
      (imported from USA) in fungal keratitis[16, 26].

      While Natamycin is a good drug to treat fungal keratitis, but treatment failures have been
      reported by several authors[27]. Natamycin has been reported as the most effective medication
      against filamentous fungi, but large ulcer size, hypopyon and Aspergillus as causative
      organism have been reported as predictors of poor outcome with topical 5% natamycin
      monotherapy [28]. The search for a better broad spectrum antifungal drug to treat fungal
      keratitis continues. There have been studies using a combination of antifungal agents, in
      order to develop a multidrug therapy[ 29, 30]. Amphoptericin B and Flucytosine have been
      described to have synergistic effects.15 while Natamycin and Etoconazole have also been used
      effectively in an animal model of Aspergillus keratitis[18]. A randomized clinical trial
      testing efficacy of 2% Econazole as a topical preparation added to 5% Natamycin for the
      treatment of fungal keratitis in south India[2, 8]did not show any advantage compared to
      monotherapy with Natamycin [2] .A combination of a Polyene (Amphotericin B) and a triazole
      (Voriconazole) is synergistic at low median concentrations when tested against Aspergillus
      species in vitro, suggesting a concentration dependent interaction between the 2 drug.[31].

      The efficacy of a concurrent therapy with Natamycin and Voriconazole has been not been
      systematically studied, as well as the potential synergistic effect this combination could
      have on the management of fungal corneal infection.

      OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy and safety of the concurrent treatment of 5% Natamycin and
      1% Voriconazole in patients affected by fungal keratitis METHODS AND MATERIALS STUDY

      An ulcer will be defined healed if the ulcer heals with formation of a corneal scar Lesion
      will be classified as resolving keratitis if the corneal infiltrate reduces in size by at
      least 1 mm and or decrease in endothelial plaque or satellite lesions, appearance of
      scarring, accompanied by reduction in symptoms An ulcer will be deemed to demonstrate no
      response or worsening when it will show a lack of improvement or worsening in inflammatory
      sign scores or stromal infiltrate dimensions or corneal melt and deterioration in any
      clinical examination factor.

      Primary End point:

    <description>Once the patient is randomized to either of the 2 groups using computer-generated randomization blocks, the hospital pharmacist would provide the appropriate medications. The treating ophthalmologist, microbiologist and patients will be masked to the drug by using similar vials. The experimental group (Group 1) will receive 1% voriconazole eye drop (Aurolab, Madurai, India) + 5% Natamycin ophthalmic suspension eye drop hourly (USP 5% Natamet, M.J. Pharmaceuticals, Mumbai, India).
The subjects will be hospitalized for at least 4 days with medications given by the ward nurse.
Patients will be followed up every week after being discharged until complete resolution is noted.</description>
