      Determination of The Combined Mesio-Distal Widths of The Permanent Mandibular Incisors and

      Rural Areas of Sohag Governorate: A Cross Sectional Study

      Study Settings:

        -  Students will be randomly selected from preparatory schools in rural areas of Sohag
           governorate, seated in the school lap or an empty classroom.

        -  Clinical examination will be made in the daylight using disposable diagnostic sets
           (mirror, and explorer). No diagnostic radiographs will be taken.

        -  Operator: Master degree's student in Pediatric Dentistry and Dental Public Health.

        -  Full mouth alginate impression will be taken and study models will be poured within one
           hour with hard dental stone for each subject.

        -  Mesio-distal widths of both maxillary and mandibular permanent incisors, canines, first
           and second premolars will be measured from the study models using digital caliper
           according to the method described by(Moorrees &amp; Reed, 1964) by measuring the greatest
           distance between the contact points on the proximal surfaces holding the caliper
           parallel to both occlusal and vestibular surfaces of the tooth.
