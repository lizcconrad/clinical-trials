      Can mindfulness help with attention and emotion difficulties after a brain injury?

      People who have a brain injury often have problems with their attention and emotions. This
      study will see if a short mindfulness task can help with these problems. So far, there are
      not many studies looking at this and those that do show mixed results. When being mindful
      someone is aware of their attention and focuses on the present moment without passing
      judgement. This study focuses on over-selectivity and selective attention to threat after a
      brain injury. These are two concepts involved in attention and emotion problems.
      Over-selectivity is when someone focuses on only one thing around them and misses other key
      things. Selective attention to threat is when someone's focus is drawn to something around
      them that is seen as threatening. This has been shown to cause and keep anxious feelings
      going. This research will see if a short mindfulness task can help those with a brain injury
      by reducing overselectivity and selective attention to threat on two tasks. Participants will
      be recruited from NHS and non-NHS brain injury services. The study will take around two hours
      to complete for each participant. In summary, this study looks to see if a specific
      mindfulness exercise can be helpful for specific attention and emotion problems. It could be
      a first step in making treatment better and giving more treatment options for those with a
      brain injury.

    <measure>Emotional Stroop</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered pre- and post- 10-minute intervention, so over a period of one hour</time_frame>
    <description>This will be a computer task that measures selective attention to threat.
In the emotional Stroop, different coloured words are presented to participants and the emotional meaning of the words are manipulated. Participants are instructed to name the colour of the words as quickly as possible, whilst ignoring the meaning of the words. Selective attention to threat will be inferred when word colour-naming takes longer when the meaning of the word is threatening relative to neutral. So, the greater the difference between reaction times to neutral and threatening words, the greater the selective attention to threat.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Over-selectivity task.</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered pre- and post- 10-minute intervention, so over a period of one hour</time_frame>
    <description>This will be a computer task that measures over-selectivity.
Practice phase - two cards, each with two images appear on the screen. One card is the correct one to select and the other is incorrect. This happens for two sets of two cards (pair 1 and pair 2). Test phase - participants are presented with two single stimuli simultaneously, one from the reinforced compound and one from the verbally punished compound (Figure 4). They are instructed to select one of the pictures on the screen.
Over-selectivity will occur if participants fail to learn about one of the stimuli in the previously reinforced compound and therefore fail to select that stimuli they had not learned about in the practice phase.
So, the higher the score on the over-selectivity task, the greater the difference between the most and least chosen stimuli, which means that the participant is demonstrating greater over-selectivity.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Aged 18 years and over

          -  Medical evidence of ABI with attention or executive functioning difficulties, such as
             difficulties with planning, inhibition or attention

          -  Time since ABI to be 9 months or greater • ABI severity to be moderate to severe,
             determined by the Mayo classification system (Malec et al., 2007). This is
             classification system is frequently used to determine ABI severity and is standard
             practice to record at the acute stage of care when the individual is admitted to
             hospital. This means there must be evidence of one or more of the following in medical
             notes: the individual's lowest Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score is less than 13, there
             is a loss of consciousness of at least 30 minutes immediately following ABI and post
             traumatic amnesia (PTA) is at least 24 hours in length. If there is no evidence of
             this in the medical notes, then there must be evidence that the individual has
             clinically significant difficulties resulting from their ABI to have needed a referral
             to brain injury services.

          -  There are self-reported or clinician-identified emotional difficulties to adjusting to
             circumstances post-ABI

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Significant, severe and enduring presence of mental health difficulties or substance
             misuse that would prevent valid engagement in experimental tasks

          -  Perceptual, language, communication, reading or motor difficulties that would prevent
             valid engagement in experimental tasks

          -  The presence of developmental or acquired dyslexia affecting the automatic reading of
             words in the emotional Stroop

          -  Severe cognitive difficulties that would prevent valid engagement in experimental
             tasks

          -  Presence of pre-existing or comorbid disorders that may affect cognitive functioning
             (other than ABI) that would prevent valid engagement in experimental tasks
