  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 1986, The Pioneer Valley in Western Massachusetts was home to one of the first two
      community supported agriculture (CSA) businesses in the USA. In 2014, there were 6,200 CSAs
      across the states, and today, in the Pioneer Valley alone, there are sixty CSAs. As with many
      parts of the United States, there are too many CSAs competing for the same pool of middle and
      upper-class customers. In his research at the University of Massachusetts in 2014, Mark Paul
      stated CSA farms are trapped in a lose-lose conundrum in which the farmers are not making
      enough money for a living wage, while simultaneously CSA shares are too expensive for many
      community members. The central challenge facing the CSA model moving forward is to provide
      fair compensation to farmers and farm workers, while making shares available at prices that
      can attract more members of the community. &quot;(Im)Proving the CSA Model&quot; proposes to increase
      consumption of and access to local products AND to develop new market opportunities for farms
      by opening the CSA membership base nationwide to low-income consumers and more price
      conscious middle class consumers. The investigators will do this by researching and
      documenting the health benefits of belonging to a CSA program. The investigators expect the
      resulting data to justify insurance-provided cash &quot;wellness&quot; benefits for CSA participation,
      much like those currently provided for gym membership. A wellness benefit will provide the
      financial incentive necessary to open CSA programs to lower- and middle-income consumers.

      The two-year research study intends to demonstrate that enrolling community health center
      patients in a Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) program is feasible and leads to dietary
      improvements that would be expected to offer clinical benefits in larger scale studies over
      longer timeframes. To maximize the knowledge gained from participation in this study, the
      investigators will measure several self-reported, laboratory, and clinical outcomes, but the
      primary purpose of this study is to provide pilot data for the model.

      To test this the investigators will implement a randomized controlled clinical trial design,
      with individual-level randomization of 120 participants, assigned in 1:1 ratio to receipt of
      a CSA membership (goal: 60 participants) or enhanced usual care (goal: 60 participants).

    <description>To estimate the return on investment of CSA membership. We will use effects on dietary quality and quality of life obtained from Outcome 1 and employ an existing microsimulation model of health expenditures to determine the change in health expenditures attributable to program participation divided by the costs of the program to calculate the 'return on investment'. The focus of our analysis will be identifying health effects that are relevant to accountable care organizations and insurers with the goal of informing adoption of the CSA model.</description>
