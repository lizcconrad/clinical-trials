      The primary objective of the study is to assess the safety, tolerability, and
      Pharmacokinetics (PK) of REGN2810 as monotherapy in Japanese patients with advanced
      malignancies. The secondary objective of the study is to assess the immunogenicity of
      REGN2810.

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of malignancy with no alternative
             standard-of-care therapeutic option

          2. ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) PS (Performance status) ≤1 (Restricted in
             physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or
             sedentary nature [eg, light house work or office work]). Note: Patients with ECOG PS
             &gt;1 are ineligible.

          3. Patients must have been born in Japan, and their biological parents and grandparents
             must all have been of Japanese origin

          4. Willing and able to comply with clinic visits and study-related procedures

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Ongoing or recent (within 5 years) evidence of significant autoimmune disease that
             requires treatment with systemic immunosuppressive treatments, which may suggest risk
             for Immune-related adverse event (irAE)s. The following are not exclusionary:
             vitiligo, childhood asthma that has resolved, residual hypothyroidism that requires
             only hormone replacement or psoriasis that does not require systemic treatment.

          2. Untreated brain metastasis (es) that may be considered active. Patients with
             previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are stable, there is
             no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and the patient does not require any
             systemic corticosteroids for management of brain metastases within 4 weeks prior to
             the first dose of REGN2810.

          3. Immunosuppressive corticosteroid doses (&gt;10 mg prednisone daily or equivalent) within
             4 weeks prior to the first dose of REGN2810.

          4. Any positive test (ribonucleic acid (RNA) or Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) by polymerase
             chain reaction) for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus
             indicating uncontrolled active or chronic infection.

          5. History of pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease

          6. Surgery within 1 month of first dose and radiation therapy within 2 weeks of first
             dose

          7. Completed palliative radiation therapy within the prior 2 weeks or has not recovered
             from any medically significant radiation-related Adverse Event (AE)

        Note: Other protocol defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.
