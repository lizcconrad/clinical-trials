    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects of CD19/CD22 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T
      cells when given together with chemotherapy, and to see how well they work in treating
      patients with CD19 positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or B acute lymphoblastic leukemia
      that has come back or does not respond to treatment. A CAR is a genetically-engineered
      receptor made so that immune cells (T cells) can attack cancer cells by recognizing and
      responding to the CD19/CD22 proteins. These proteins are commonly found on diffuse large
      B-cell lymphoma and B acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      cyclophosphamide and fludarabine phosphate, work in different ways to stop the growth of
      cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping
      them from spreading. Giving CD19/CD22-CAR T cells and chemotherapy may work better in
      treating patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or B acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the feasibility of producing CD19/CD22-CAR T cells meeting the established
      release criteria.

      II. Assess the safety of administering escalating doses of autologous CD19/CD22-CAR T cells
      that meet established release specifications in adults with hematologic malignancies
      following a cyclophosphamide/fludarabine phosphate (fludarabine) conditioning regimen.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the ability of CD19/CD22-CAR T cells to mediate clinical activity in adults with
      B cell malignancies.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the frequency of CD22+ expression on lymphoma cells, and determine site density
      when possible.

      II. Analyze alterations in early B cell development induced by immune pressure exerted via
      CD19/CD22-CAR T cells.

      III. Evaluate whether subjects receiving CD19/CD22-CAR T cells relapse with loss or
      diminished expression of CD19 and/or CD22, when feasible.

      IV. Measure persistence of CD19/CD22-CAR T cells in the blood, bone marrow and cerebrospinal
      fluid (CSF), and explore correlations between anti CD19/CD22-CAR T cell properties and CAR T
      cell efficacy and persistence.

      V. Establish the utility of chromatin structure and epigenomic technology to characterize CAR
      T cell therapies.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of CD19/CD22-CAR T cells.

      Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes and fludarabine
      phosphate IV over 30 minutes on days -5 to -3. Patients then receive CD19/CD22-CAR T cells IV
      over 10-20 minutes on day 0. Patients that benefited from the first dose of CD19/CD22-CAR T
      cells, had no unacceptable side effects, and have enough cells left over may receive 2 or 3
      additional doses of CD19/CD22-CAR T cells.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up daily until day 14, twice per
      week until day 28, at 2 months, at 3 months, every 3 months until month 12, every 6-12 months
      up to year 5, and then annually for years 6-15.
