      The FD/MAS Patient Registry is an IRB approved research project that allows patients and
      families to share their experiences with fibrous dysplasia/McCune-Albright syndrome (FD/MAS)
      by completing a series of surveys.

      The surveys were created in collaboration with patients, parents, clinicians and researchers,
      so that the data can be used to answer some of the most important questions about FD/MAS,
      including:

      the way the disease develops over time (its &quot;natural history&quot;), the patient experience of the
      disease, and its impact on quality of life, how and when diagnoses are made, the scope of
      treatments in use, what surgical techniques work best, and for whom, what other medical
      interventions work best, and for whom, what social services and therapies are useful, the
      costs of care to patients and their families, issues that concern patients (such as the
      impact of pregnancy on FD, or children feeling different and facing stigma), and which
      research questions and support programs you think are important to fund.

      Participation is free and convenient for people with FD/MAS and their legal guardians. You
      can join today at www.fdmasregistry.org.
