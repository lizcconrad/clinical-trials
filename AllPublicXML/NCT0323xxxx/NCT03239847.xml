  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the time difference between radial arterial line placement and use
      of the EndoPhys sheath, as well as, assess the cost effectiveness of the EnoPhys sheath vs.
      use of a radial arterial line based on device and operating room costs.
