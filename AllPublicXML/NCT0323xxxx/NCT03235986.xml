  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study will mainly aim at investigating the safety, tolerability and efficacy of
      different escalating single doses administration of nebulised Curosurf®, in preterm neonates
      with RDS (Respiratory Distress Syndrome) during nCPAP.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in spontaneously breathing preterm neonates with mild to moderate
      RDS and will consist of two parts:

      Part I, with the objective to assess the safety and tolerability of single ascending doses of
      nebulised Curosurf® ; Part II, with the objective to compare the efficacy of nebulised
      Curosurf®, administered at two selected doses from part I, during nCPAP, versus nCPAP alone
      in terms of incidence of respiratory failure in the first 72 hours of life.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Written informed consent obtained by parents/legal representative (according to local
             regulation) prior to or after birth

          2. Inborn neonates from 26+0 to 32+6 weeks of gestational age (GA), spontaneously
             breathing and stabilised on nCPAP

          3. Clinical course consistent with RDS.

          4. Receiving CPAP pressure 5-8 centimeter of water (cm H2O) and fraction of inspired
             oxygen (FiO2) between 0.25 and 0.40 to maintain saturation of peripheral oxygen (SpO2)
             between 88% and 95% for at least 30 minutes between 60 minutes and 12 hours after
             birth.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Early need for endotracheal intubation for cardiopulmonary resuscitation in delivery
             room or within 1 hour from birth because of severe RDS

          2. Respiratory Distress not secondary to surfactant deficiency

          3. Use of surfactant prior to study entry and need for endotracheal administration of any
             other treatment.

          4. Major congenital anomalies.

          5. Evidence of severe birth asphyxia

          6. Mothers with prolonged rupture of the membranes

          7. Presence of air leaks.

          8. Presence of IVH (intraventricular hemorrhage ) ≥ III.

          9. Hypotension or evidence of hemodynamic instability.

         10. Any condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would place the neonate at
             undue risk.

         11. Participation in another clinical trial
