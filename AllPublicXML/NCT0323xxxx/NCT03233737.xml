  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the topical application to gingival tissue of
      the combination of benzocaine and tetracaine has a longer duration of local anesthetic
      activity than benzocaine alone.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a blinded study, either benzocaine alone or the combination of benzocaine and tetracaine
      will be sprayed onto the gingival mucosal tissue. Onset and duration of local anesthesia will
      be evaluated over a one hour period using pin prick and QST heat stimulation. Subjects will
      receive both treatments in a cross-over design with each session separated by 4-14 days. A
      total of 50 subjects (normal volunteers) will be evaluated.

          -  At screening and at Baseline during Stage 1 and Sessions 1 and 2, of Stage 2 subjects
             with PPT scores of at least &quot;3&quot; (on a 10 point NRS) on the 2 readings, 1 of which must
             be a score of at least &quot;4&quot;;

          -  Subjects with mean QST Heat Pain sensation temperature assessments on the gingival

             the Baseline Study Sessions for Stages 1 and 2;

          -  Subjects must agree to refrain from ingesting any systemic or topical analgesic
             medication for 3 days or 5 half-lives of the drug prior to and during the study period
