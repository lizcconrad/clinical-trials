      Participants will be randomly assigned between five different well-being programs, each
      8-weeks long and taking place on a simplified research version of the Happify platform. They
      will be asked to complete questionnaires before and after the 8-week program, as well as
      1-month, 3-month, and 6-month follow-up questionnaires after the program is complete, at
      which point study participation will end.

    <description>Participants use Happify as it is currently available to consumers on the main site, including all engagement elements. Users may access a wide variety of 4-week programs and use them in any way they desire for the entire study period.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Negatively-focused tracks</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants use two pre-selected Happify tracks that focus on remediating negatives (e.g. &quot;conquering negative thoughts&quot; and &quot;managing stress&quot;). Several engagement elements are missing, including social forums, regular informational emails, and the ability to play games. Participants gain access to 8 weeks worth of content, but may repeat the content as often as they like in the follow-up period.</description>

    <description>Participants use two pre-selected Happify tracks that focus on improving positives (e.g. building well-being, using one's strengths). Several engagement elements are missing, including social forums, regular informational emails, and the ability to play games.

    <description>Participants complete a Happify program that is designed to engage with specific activities, but that does not aim to promote positive emotion or reduce negative emotion.

    <description>Participants complete a series of quizzes and polls on Happify designed to engage them in thinking about well-being topics, but without giving any specific instructions for how to promote well-being. Participants gain access to 8 weeks worth of content, but may repeat the content as often as they like in the follow-up period.</description>
