  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 1935 the polycystic ovary syndrome was a clinical diagnosis made on the morphological
      appearance of the ovaries in association with amenorrhoea, hirsutism and frequently obesity.
      At that time wedge resection of the ovaries was introduced on an empirical basis and proved a
      successful treatment for the associated anovulation and infertility. In the ensuing fifty
      years the limitations of a purely surgical approach to therapy have become recognized and the
      importance of the biochemical abnormalities appreciated. Prevalence of polycystic Ovary
      Syndrome: The prevalence of polycystic ovary syndrome in any specified population is
      dependent upon the diagnostic criteria used, but does have some regional and ethnic
      variation. While most reports on the prevalence of polycystic ovary syndrome range between 2
      and 20%, the chosen diagnostic criteria are recognized to influence the determined
      prevalence. Anti-mullerian hormone which is a predictor of ovarian reserve is known to
      decrease after laparoscopic ovarian drilling. On the best of our knowledge no study had been
      done to use the level of anti-mullerian hormone as a factor for planning the number of
      ovarian drills in each ovary.

    <description>The electric current used was set at 40 Watts. The power was activated just before touching the ovary, and then the needle electrode was held against the antimesenteric surface of the ovary for 4 seconds until penetration of the ovarian capsule. Four or eight puncture points were made through the ovarian capsule of each ovary according to the study protocol. The ovaries were cooled in the pool of the Ringer's lactate after each cauterization both to minimize adhesion formation and to prevent heat trauma to the adjacent viscera. Complete hemostasis was ensured. At the end of the procedure, the ovaries were copiously rinsed with Ringer's lactate (Aqua-purator, Storz, Germany). An amount about 200 ml of heparinized Ringers lactate (5000 IU/1000 ml) was left in the pelvis to avoid postoperative adhesions.</description>
