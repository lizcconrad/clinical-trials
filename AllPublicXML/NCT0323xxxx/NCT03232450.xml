  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants enrolled in this study will have been diagnosed with patent foramen ovale (PFO)
      and have been scheduled to have a cardiovascular implantable electronic device (CIED) such as
      a pacemaker, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), or cardiac resynchronization
      therapy (CRT) device implanted. A PFO is a condition when there is a hole in the septum (the
      wall separating the right and left sides) of the heart.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether closing the PFO with the GORE® Cardioform
      Septal Occluder in people with an endocardial device leads reduces the risk of recurrent
      stroke or imaging-confirmed transient ischemic attack (TIA) compared to not closing the PFO.

    <measure>Change in Executive Function as Measured by Trail Making Test B</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 1 year post implantation</time_frame>
    <description>Trail Making Test B consists of 25 circles including both numbers (1-13) and letters (A-L). The subject draws lines to connect the circles in an ascending pattern, but with the added task of alternating between the numbers and letters. The subject is timed as they draw the trail. Results are reported as the number of seconds required to complete the task; therefore, higher scores reveal greater impairment. The average score is 75 seconds; &gt; 273 seconds is considered deficient.

    <measure>Change in Language as Measured by Letter and Category Fluency Test</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 1 year post implantation</time_frame>
    <description>The examiner gives the subject a category and ask them to name all the different examples that they can think of from that category in one minute. Examples of categories are animals, fruit, birds, breeds of dog, tools, etc. Subjects are also asked to provide examples that start with a given letter. To score, the examiner counts the number of unique responses for a category or letter for one minute; categories can be averaged together. The higher the score the better the language fluency, the lower the score, the worse the language fluency.</description>

    <measure>Change in Psychomotor Speed as Measured by Trail Making A Test</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 1 year post implantation</time_frame>
    <description>Trail Making Test A consists of 25 numbered circles distributed over a sheet of paper. The patient should draw lines to connect the numbers in ascending order. The patient is timed as they draw the trail. Results are reported as the number of seconds required to complete the task; therefore, higher scores reveal greater impairment. The average score is 29 seconds; &gt; 78 seconds is considered deficient.</description>

          -  Subjects with any clinical indication mandating anticoagulation.

          -  Unable to take anti-platelet medications such as aspirin or clopidogrel (Plavix).

          -  With anatomy where the GORE® CARDIOFORM Septal Occluder size or position would
             interfere with other intracardiac or intravascular structures, such as cardiac valves
             or pulmonary veins.

          -  With active endocarditis, or other infections producing bacteremia, or with known
             sepsis within one month of planned implantation, or any other infection that cannot be

             implant
