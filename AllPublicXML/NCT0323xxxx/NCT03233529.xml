  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to characterize the mechanism of action of crisaborole ointment
      2%, by evaluation of efficacy and changes in key skin biomarkers in atopic dermatitis (AD)
      lesions treated with crisaborole ointment 2% over vehicle, in subjects with mild to moderate
      AD. Two identified AD skin lesions for each subject will be treated for the first 15 days,
      one with crisaborole ointment 2% and one with vehicle, in a blinded manner, and biopsies for
      biomarker analysis will be performed on the lesions. Following completion of the blinded
      treatment period, subjects will start the 28 day open label period during which all AD
      affected skin lesions will be treated with crisaborole ointment 2% twice daily.
