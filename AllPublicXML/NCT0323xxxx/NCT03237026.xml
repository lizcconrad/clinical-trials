  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer (PC) afflicts millions of men worldwide. In Taiwan, around 5,000 men are
      diagnosed as PC while 1,200 men die of the disease each year. Although there is a significant
      advance in the definitive treatments of PC, the failure rate is still up to 40%. Androgen
      deprivation therapy (ADT) and chemotherapy (Chemo) are palliative and rarely curative.
      Immunotherapy brings on promise but is highly unpredictable. Thus, markers that predict
      treatment outcomes may help decision making and prompt early adjuvant or salvage therapy.
      Also, markers that mediate resistance to treatments may become druggable targets.

      This is a prospective and observational clinical study investigating urine metabolites via
      metabolomics analysis in subjects who will undergo therapy for PC. The treatment modalities
      include radical prostatectomy (OP), prostate radiotherapy (RT), systemic Chemo, and ADT. The
      expected subject number to be enrolled is 360 men from NTUH. There will be 2 cohorts:
      training cohort (Cohort A, N=180), and validation cohort (Cohort B, N=180). Each cohort
      consists of patients treated with OP (N=50), RT (N=70), Chemo (N=30) and ADT (N=30). Cohort A
      will be recruited in the first 12 months of the study period to generate the first batch of
      urine metabolite profiles. Cohort B will be recruited in the second half of the study period
      to validate the first batch of newly developed urine metabolite profile.

      Pre-treatment and post-treatment clinic-pathological parameters will be recorded. Group
      specific urine metabolite profiles will be constructed by comparing the outstanding
      metabolites between groups. These metabolite profiles are constructed so as to efficiently
      separate outcome groups, especially to predict subjects with good prognosis and response to
      the treatment. The newly constructed metabolite profiles will be validated against another
      cohort of subjects who will receive therapy for PC to determine the predictive efficiency of
      the constructed profiles. In addition, paraffin blocks of the prostate cancer will be used to
      identify progression markers for invasion and metastasis, as well as progression markers for
      castration-resistant PC.

      Through a better understanding of the biology of PC, we hope to develop new markers/targets
      for more effective predicting outcomes of PC. In the meantime, we can also substantially
      develop a better decision-making tree of PC.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who have histopathologically confirmed prostate adenocarcinoma.

          2. Subjects who age 30 years to 100 years

          3. Subjects who agree to undergo the any of the following four treatments, including
             radical prostatectomy, definitive prostate radiotherapy, systemic chemotherapy, and
             androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer.

          4. Subjects who understand and will comply with the entire study procedures, consent to
             donate his spot urine (once for 50 ml) for urine metabolomics profiling, and agree

             of biopsy and the details of treatments and outcomes. (Note: Subjects will be told

             disease-free for only 3 years or less. Subjects who have other genitourinary cancers
             (urothelial, renal cell, etc) are NOT allowed no matter what the disease-free duration
             is. However, subjects who have been curatively treated and are disease-free for 3
