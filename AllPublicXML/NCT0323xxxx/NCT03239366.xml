  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted at the Montreal Heart Institute and should involve 130 Type 2
      diabetes subjects. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Bio-K+50B®
      probiotic capsules or a matching placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 double-blind, randomized, single-center, placebo-controlled, parallel-group
      12-week study of Bio-K+ probiotic 50B® in subjects diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and
      suboptimal glycemic control.

      After providing informed consent and completion of screening baseline assessments,
      approximately 130 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Bio-K+50B®
      probiotic or matching placebo. Subjects will take investigational product or placebo once
      daily orally for 12 weeks.

      During the double-blind treatment period, subjects will complete a daily diary and will be
      contacted via telephone (at Week 4 and Week 8) for an assessment of adverse events,
      concomitant medications, diabetes management habits, collection of stool sample at home,
      diary revision and study product compliance. At visit 3 (Week 12; end of study visit)
      subjects will return to the study site for laboratory tests and clinical assessment.

Abnormal laboratory findings (e.g. clinical chemistry, hematology, urinalysis) or other abnormal assessments (e.g. vital signs) that are judged by the investigator as clinically significant will be recorded as AEs or SAEs.
A daily diary will be completed by the subject in order to assess overall diabetes management. The diary includes collection of information on symptoms of hypoglycaemia. In addition, information will be collected on gastrointestinal symptoms and any other new symptoms.</description>
