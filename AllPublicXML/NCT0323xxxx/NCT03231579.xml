      This multi-site study will enroll approximately 200 CLL patients across 7 cancer
      institutions. The aim of the project is to ensure hematology care teams that are
      participating in new value-based reimbursement models have an accurate understanding of the
      evidence and roles of new therapies for relapsed/refractory CLL and best practice supportive
      care protocols to proactively assess, monitor, and manage symptoms to promote successful
      clinical outcomes. Hematology teams at seven health systems across the U.S. will be given
      online clinical training on the latest evidence for treatment planning in CLL along with best
      supportive care practices for patients on novel CLL treatments, prior to using Carevive's
      patient engagement software.

      Once training is complete, CLL patients with relapsed/refractory disease will use the
      Carevive patient portal to report any symptoms at and in between clinic visits.
      Patient-reported and clinical data will be processed by the Carevive rules engine technology
      to generate evidence-based supportive care plans providing patients with direction regarding
      self-management strategies, care coordination for relevant cancer center services, and
      direction on when to go to the emergency department (ED) or call their hematologist based on
      their institution's protocol. On the visits subsequent to the delivery of the care plan,
      patients will report on the perceived effectiveness of the intervention (or barriers to
      non-adherence to the intervention).

      Outcomes focus on the effectiveness of current evidence-based, best supportive care practices
      in improving QoL and mitigating ED visits/hospitalizations. This project will lay the
      foundation for new supportive care delivery models incorporating professional education and
      patient engagement tools to improve clinical outcomes. The research team will collect
      real-world evidence for predictive modeling of symptoms for the relapsed/refractory CLL
      patient population and evaluate the effectiveness of current evidence-based supportive care
      recommendations to inform and improve future practice.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common type of adult leukemia in Western
      countries with 18,960 new cases and 4660 deaths expected in 2016. Rapid therapeutic advances
      in the past five years have changed the landscape of CLL treatment giving patients many more
      treatment options. Fit patients with favorable disease features such as mutated
      immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IgHV genes) have long term benefit from
      chemoimmunotherapy and new oral agents such as ibrutinib and idelalisib and the BCL-2
      inhibitor, venetoclax, provide effective options for relapsed patients.

      With recent FDA approvals, the treatment armamentarium for relapsed/refractory CLL has been
      transformed in the past several years. Clinicians are faced with a plethora of new treatment
      options and associated guideline updates, making clinical decision-making much more complex.
      It is challenging for the modern-day hematologist to stay current on the comparative evidence
      of the risks/benefits of various treatment options with so many choices. Such novel regimens
      are changing the survival outcomes and offering new opportunities for the long-term
      management of CLL. While risk-benefit profiles are favorable, diligent supportive care
      practices are required to promote patient engagement and successful clinical outcomes as such
      agents are powerful, leading to potential toxicities that must be diligently monitored.

      Since new agents have had limited use in the clinic, real-world evidence on patient symptom
      experience is not available to guide practice and there is limited data on the effectiveness
      of evidence-based supportive care recommendations. This is a challenge for hematology teams,
      particularly because CLL patients are amongst the highest rates of emergency department (ED)
      visits and hospitalizations (along with lung and colon cancers). Retrospective data
      demonstrated that patient demographic and clinical characteristics, as well as chemotherapy
      choice, were associated with ER visits and hospitalizations in patients with CLL.
      Specifically, significant increases in ER visits and hospitalizations were associated with
      age, comorbidities, use of supportive care, number of CLL-related adverse events,
      chemotherapy duration, use of certain therapies, living in the Northeast region of the United
      States, and treatment following relapse.

      The outcomes of CLL treatment have been found to vary with age, with poorer outcomes in older
      patients. However, the elderly population is highly heterogeneous - ranging from &quot;fit&quot; to
      &quot;frail&quot;. A number of recent studies conclude that while chronological age is an important
      consideration when making treatment decisions for hematologic malignancies, functional status
      is more predictive of treatment outcomes. A review of 83 CLL treatment articles published
      from 1949 to 2011 reported fit patients had more treatment options than the frail elderly and
      most studies included patients younger than 65 years. It has been noted by a number of
      researchers that elderly and frail patients with LGL are under-represented in clinical trials
      and there is need for data to support a tailored treatment plan. Aaldriks et al. (2015)
      evaluated 44 patients with CLL, age &gt; 70 years, receiving R-CHOP. They used a geriatric
      assessment (GA) to show GA scores predicted which patients completed chemotherapy.

      Since fit/frailty status is important to treatment response, it is essential to choose the
      correct method of treatment for the elderly patient population in reference to their physical
      performance. In previous studies, a modified geriatric assessment (GA) tool was used to
      categorize patients into groups of fit, unfit, and frail with treatment decisions based on
      these groupings. When intensity of treatment choice was matched appropriately to patient
      groups, treatment-related mortality was lowered, toxicity was more manageable and survival
      outcomes were better.

      As a result, it is now suggested that fit/frailty status be clinically evaluated by
      incorporating a validated GA tool in clinical practice to guide treatment decisions. This is
      of significant interest as this country shifts to value-based cancer care models. Value-based
      cancer care models require the engagement of patients to better understand patient goals and
      ensure patients are counseled on the risks and benefits of various treatment options. The
      challenges however are that GAs are not routinely performed because they are complex and
      time-consuming, the optimal tools for administering the GA accurately and efficiently have
      not been established, and integrated of a GA into a Health Information System platform has
      not been adequately studied for feasibility and usage. A previous Carevive feasibility study
      was successful in demonstrating use of a computer based patient reported abbreviated cancer
      specific geriatric assessment (CSGA).

      This study will include geriatric assessment (GA) to determine patient frailty status for
      patients â‰¥65 years of age with CLL at the start of treatment or the first clinical visit.
      Patients &lt;65 will not complete the GA. For this initiative, a previously validated GA and
      respective scoring technique will be used. The GA will include brief versions of three
      validated tools: Katz's Activity of Daily Living (ADL), Lawton's Instrumental Activity of
      Daily Living (IADL), and the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) to screen for frailty status.
      Patients will complete the GA prior to treatment planning for patients newly diagnosed with
      CLL. A frailty index will be calculated using the GA measures along with disease stage and
      patient age.

      New value-based care delivery models reward care teams when patients have favorable quality
      of life, measured by how well symptoms are controlled and the avoidance of ED visits and
      hospitalizations. To better manage patient QoL and mitigate unanticipated office and ED
      visits, and hospitalizations, hematologists need to understand real-world patient symptom
      experiences and be able to identify what are best practice supportive care measures to
      maximize the success of CLL therapies in the relapsed/refractory setting.

      This study will explore the symptom assessment and management practices of providers caring
      for individuals receiving active therapy for relapsed/refractory CLL, and will also employ a
      two-part intervention (with both patients and providers) to evaluate the impact of a novel
      existing technology, the Carevive Care Planning System (CPS), on supportive care and symptom
      management. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate adherence to evidence-based
      practices for symptom assessment and management (i.e., &quot;symptom care behaviors&quot;) of
      physicians and nurses (providers) caring for individuals receiving active treatment for
      relapsed/refractory CLL. The intervention will include personalized supportive care and
      symptom management plans for patients auto-generated by the Carevive CPS based on each
      individual's data. The care plans were created based on nationally recognized National
      Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) supportive care guidelines and validated by CLL nurse and
      physician experts.

      Additional aims include understanding the longitudinal symptom experiences of patients across
      CLL treatments in the relapse/refractory setting by collecting symptom incidence and severity
      (PRO-CTCAE), burden (Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale), psychosocial distress (NCCN Distress
      Thermometer), and quality of life (Fact-L). The research team also seeks to understand the
      supportive care strategies currently used to monitor for and manage symptoms by using patient
      reported symptoms, collected through a web-based portal accessible between visits, which will
      then be assessed by both patients and clinicians and stored/analyzed for research purposes.
      Finally, the research team seeks to understand the causes for unanticipated office and ED
      visits.

      Outcomes will focus on the effectiveness of current evidence-based, best supportive care
      practices in improving QoL and mitigating ED visits/hospitalizations. This project will lay
      the foundation for new supportive care delivery models incorporating professional education
      and patient engagement tools to improve clinical outcomes. The research team will collect
      real-world evidence to lay the foundation for predictive modeling of symptoms for the
      relapsed/refractory CLL patient population and evaluate the effectiveness of current
      evidence-based supportive care recommendations to inform and improve future practice.
