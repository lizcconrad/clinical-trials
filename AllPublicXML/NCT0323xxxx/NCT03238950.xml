      This study will assess whether the type of simulation model used in cricothyroidotomy
      training has an effect on the subsequent confidence and competence in the procedure.

      This is a Pilot study - prospective randomised controlled trial involving:

        1. Assessment of ability to complete a surgical cricothyroidotomy

        2. Completion of questionnaire prior to training and prior to assessment

      Prior to beginning training, questionnaires will be completed by all participants asking
      their level of previous training. Current confidence level for completion of
      cricothyroidotomy will be marked on a visual analogue scale (VAS).

      Training will then be completed with each group using the appropriate manikin type - porcine
      or synthetic. This will consist of didactic information on the procedure delivered via
      recorded information to standardise this initial training, and then proceeding to supervised
      practice of the procedure for two occasions. This will be completed by the same trainer, with
      the same information given to both groups. Questions to clarify how to perform the procedure
      will be permitted.

      The second questionnaire will be given to the trainees on completion of training to mark on a
      visual analogue scale their confidence level at this point.

      Assessment will then be completed later the day comprising of assessment of completion of
      surgical cricothyroidotomy using a porcine manikin with skin overlying. This will be
      different to the porcine manikin used for training. The assessment will time the trainees
      from start to completion of airway insertion, as well as a checklist of activities to be
      achieved. The porcine manikins will then be dissected to identify if correct location for
      insertion was achieved and complications. The same amount of time will be given between
      groups training and assessment.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Medically trained healthcare professionals working in Anaesthetics, Emergency Medicine
             or General Surgery as these doctors may be expected to complete a surgical
             cricothyroidotomy despite infrequently performing the procedure.

          -  The healthcare professionals can be from Foundation Year 1 to before Certificates of
             Completion of Training (CCT). Those who are out of training and are not yet at
             consultant level are also eligible.

          -  Able to provide informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        â€¢ Healthcare professionals who already complete surgical airways on a regular basis (e.g.
        Ear Nose Throat or Maxillofacial trainees) as these doctors may already be competent prior
        to training.
