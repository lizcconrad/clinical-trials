  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The UPA doses to be tested in this new IUS, 5, 20 or 40 μg per day, are not expected to
      suppress ovulation, however they should prevent endometrial growth resulting in endometrial
      atrophy, minimal bleeding, or even amenorrhea. It is anticipated that with low UPA doses,
      women will continue to ovulate and secrete progesterone (P) during the secretory phase of the
      menstrual cycle. As a result, PRM associated endometrial changes (PAECs) that have been
      described in previous UPA studies when ovulation was suppressed and associated with
      amenorrhea should not occur and endometria should retain normalcy. These expectations are
      based on our findings from a previous study in which the UPA doses tested were insufficient
      to block ovulation and participants maintained P secretion with normal endometria (protocol
      349). Further evidence regarding the benefit of using low doses of UPA in a copper IUS stems
      from a small rhesus macaque proof of principle study that included an UPA-IUS delivering 40
      or 60 μg/d of UPA, and fixed doses of E2 and cyclic P delivered via implants over 3 cycles.24
      Indices of endometrial proliferation were significantly reduced in 3 out of 5 animals in that
      study; the endometria were atrophied with some glandular cysts, and typical PAECs were
      limited. Glands were generally small and tubular, however, in some animals they were large
      and dilated; resembling cysts with minimal evidence of proliferative activity.24 No bleeding
      was observed in the treated monkeys during progesterone withdrawal over the 3 cycles.

      Intrauterine devices (IUD) such as the Copper IUD (Paragard) and the levonorgestrel (LNG) IUS
      (Mirena®) are considered highly safe and effective long acting reversible methods of
      contraception (LARC). Nevertheless discontinuations are high due to user complaints of heavy
      bleeding during the first few months after insertion of IUDs or irregular bleeding in the
      first year of use of an IUS. To prevent these bleeding problems and enhance the overall
      safety profile, a new IUS is being developed that will deliver copper to provide its well
      described contraceptive efficacy in combination with UPA, a progesterone receptor modulator
      (PRM) that may decrease the amount of bleeding associated with use of a Cu IUD.

      Since results of human studies delivering antiovulatory doses of UPA orally or with vaginal
      rings have shown endometrial changes characterized as typical PAECs, the occurrence of these
      endometrial effects with lower doses of the PRM delivered in the endometrium via this
      investigational IUS requires evaluation with both histology assessments and measures of
      proliferation markers. We need to determine if small doses of UPA administered locally with a
      new Cu-IUS with UPA can result in reduced bleeding or amenorrhea, as observed in the monkey
      study, and whether or not endometrial modifications occur.
