    <textblock>
      Gastrointestinal stromal tumors are the most common stromal tumors of the digestive tract.
      Approximately 60% of tumors develop in the stomach.Before, patients with gastric
      gastrointestinal stromal tumors would receive open or laparoscopic surgery. However,
      gastrointestinal stromal tumors located at special sites, such as cardia, were hardly
      treated. Recently, the robot was used to remove gastric gastrointestinal stromal tumors. In
      this study, the robot will be used to remove gastric gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Then,
      we will evaluate the effect of robotic gastric gastrointestinal stromal tumors resection.
