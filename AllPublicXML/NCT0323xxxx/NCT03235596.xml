  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It's an interventional, prospective and monocentric pilot study concerning adult patients
      with autism without mental retardation.

      The primary outcome is to assess the effects of cathodal transcranial direct current
      stimulation (tDCS) on the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) on the executive
      functions of patients with autism without mental retardation or with Asperger syndrome.

      The secondary outcomes are to evaluate the safety of this treatment and to evaluate its
      impact on impaired social communication and on restricted or repetitive behaviors.

      The patients concerned by the study are aged 20 to 50 years old. They meet ICD-10 criteria
      for autism without mental retardation or Asperger syndrome and they have adaptive capacity
      and autonomy complaints. They stable treatments for at least 4 weeks prior and during all the
      study and no history of tDCS. Women of childbearing age with no adequate contraception,
      pregnant or lactating women are excluded.

      This is an interventional, prospective and monocentric pilot study. The patient is informed
      about the clinical study during the psychiatric consultation. The patient is provided with a
      cooling-off period of several days. During the inclusion visit, the executive functions of
      the patient are assessed (WSCT, Stroop, TMT A and B and verbal fluency test). If 2
      pathological tests are found among all measured scores: administration of ISDC and EC2R
      (interview of the person accompanying) and planning of the first tDCS session 15 days later.
      If no pathological test is found : study exit.

      The treatment consists in 10 sessions of cathodal tDCS applied over the left dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) at 2mA. Each session lasts 15 minutes. They are 2 sessions per day.

      Ten days after the end of tDCS treatment, patients are assessed for executive functions and
      behavioral dysexecutive functions (EC2R and ISCD).
