  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to explore whether heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback can be effective
      in the treatment of chronic cough. Chronic cough has many causes, including asthma, postnasal
      drip, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), each with a specific treatment. However,
      among a subset of cough patients, no clear cause is found despite extensive workup, and
      traditional treatment methods do not provide relief. Several studies revealed less common
      causes of chronic cough and disordered breathing such as vagal neuropathy, paradoxical vocal
      fold motion, and stress. Additional research identified links between the neurological
      networks that produce the cough reflex and those that maintain normal breathing. HRV
      biofeedback is a self-regulation technique that uses computer equipment to monitor heart rate
      and breathing, two key functions of the autonomic nervous system. By using this non-invasive
      behavioral technique, cough patients can regulate their breathing and autonomic function,
      potentially leading to improved autonomic balance and a reduction in cough symptoms.

    <description>(Group 1) will undergo active training in behavioral cough suppression and laryngeal relaxation exercises, but will not receive HRVB. Traditional cough suppression and laryngeal relaxation exercises include pursed lip breathing, swallowing (water, lozenge, gum, ice chips), sustained semi-occluded voicing, discussion and mitigation of triggers, maintaining a cough journal, addressing muscle tension dysphonia if indicated, and developing prophylaxis suppression and laryngeal relaxation based on stimulability. Participants in Group 1 will receive handwritten guidance indicating exercises to practice at home.</description>

    <description>Voice therapy as described in Arm 1. HRVB involves measure respiratory rate, heart rate, body temperature and skin conductance. Participants are guided through reduced breathing rate until a resonant frequency is attained. HRVB breathing simulates resonance between the baroreflex rhythm and respiration based rhythm, increasing heart rate variability and baroreceptor sensitivity. Evidence suggests HRVB improves autonomic regularity. We propose this novel modality to address centrally regulated hypersensitivity that perpetuates coughing.</description>
