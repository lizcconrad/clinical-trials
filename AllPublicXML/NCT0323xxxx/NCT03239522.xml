  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Absorption, metabolism and excretion of daprodustat (GSK1278863) have been studied in
      previous clinical trials; however, the elimination routes and metabolic pathways of
      daprodustat have not been fully elucidated in humans. This is an open-label, single-center,
      non-randomized, 2-period, single-sequence, crossover, mass balance study in 6 healthy male
      participants. The aim of the study is to assess the excretion balance of daprodustat using
      [14C]-radiolabeled drug substance administered orally, and as an intravenous (IV) infusion,
      administered as a microtracer dose (concomitant with an oral, non-radiolabeled dose).
      Absolute bioavailability of an oral dose will also be assessed. Each participant will be
      involved in the study for up to 10 weeks which include a screening visit, two treatment
      periods (treatment periods 1 and 2), separated by about 7 days (at least 14 days between oral
      doses), and a follow up visit 1-2 weeks after the last assessment in treatment period 2. The
      primary objective of the study is to gain a better understanding of the compound's excretory
      and metabolic profile. This study will include sampling of duodenal bile to conduct
      qualitative assessment of drug metabolites in this matrix in order to characterize biliary
      elimination pathways.
