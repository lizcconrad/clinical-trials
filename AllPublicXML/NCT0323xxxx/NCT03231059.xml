      The GLOBAL LEADERS Adjudication Sub-StudY, GLASSY, is based on a re-assessment of all the
      events reported in the dataset of the parent trial (COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS OF 1 MONTH OF
      TICAGRELOR PLUS ASPIRIN FOLLOWED BY TICAGRELOR MONOTHERAPY VERSUS A CURRENT-DAY INTENSIVE
      DUAL ANTIPLATELET THERAPY IN ALL-COMERS PATIENTS UNDERGOING PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY
      INTERVENTION WITH BIVALIRUDIN AND BIOMATRIX FAMILY DRUG-ELUTING STENT USE) by an independent
      Clinical Event Committee (CEC), composed of three physicians not involved in the main trial.
      The substudy include the first 19 top-enrolling sites of the GLOBAL LEADERS to reach the
      estimated sample size of 7,186 patients for the two co-primary outcomes of death, any
      non-fatal myocardial infarction, any non-fatal stroke or urgent target vessel
      revascularization and bleeding events classified as 3 or 5 according to the Bleeding Academic
      Research Consortium (BARC) criteria. To ensure a comprehensive assessment of clinical events,
      a triggers logic is adopted to identify other potential events qualifying for study endpoints
      but not reported as such by local investigators.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The GLOBAL LEADERS trial was designed to determine the benefits and risks of an
      antithrombotic regimen using ticagrelor 90 mg BID combined with low-dose (75 mg OD)
      acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) for one month followed by ticagrelor 90 mg BID alone for 23
      months, compared to conventional dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in all-comers patients with
      coronary artery disease undergoing biolimus-eluting stent implantation on bivalirudin. It was
      intended as a pragmatic clinical trial and, by design, endpoints included in primary and
      secondary analyses are only investigator-reported (IR) and will not undergo independent
      adjudication by a CEC. It is well known that in the absence of blinding of randomized
      treatment (i.e. in an open-label design such as GLOBAL LEADERS) the use of IR outcome may
      introduce detection and/or reporting bias. There are multiple lines of evidence indicating
      that central and independent adjudication of events may affect the results of a randomized
      trial by minimizing variability and heterogeneity inherently present when several different
      clinicians and data managers apply definitions of endpoints which are complex and sometimes
      not well known.Moreover, independent adjudication of ischaemic and bleeding endpoints may
      provide important mechanistic information that may deepen understanding of the primary
      endpoint result of the study by better characterizing component of such endpoints including,
      but not limited to, precise cause of death, sub-type of myocardial infarction (MI), and
      bleeding location. The objectives of this substudy are: to assess the impact of
      CEC-adjudication process on the results of the study; to quantify the added value of CEC
      adjudication process for endpoint reporting by evaluating the concordance between IR-reported
      and CEC-adjudicated events; to gather mechanistic information to aid in the interpretation of
      the effect of the experimental treatment in the parent trial and to identify specific
      subgroups of patients that could particularly benefit from the experimental therapy in terms
      of ischemic and bleeding events.
