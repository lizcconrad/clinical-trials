  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety and depression are among the most common mental disorders in the population. Anxiety
      and depression have significant consequences at the individual, family and community level,
      and mental illness is estimated to cost the Norwegian society 180 billion Norwegian kroner
      annually. The majority of this amount is accounted for by anxiety and depression disorders.
      Meanwhile, access to mental health services to treat these disorders is limited. The
      proportion of people who do not receive treatment of those who are in need of treatment is
      estimated to be over 50%.

      Prompt Mental Health Care (PMHC) is a pilot project initiated in 2012 by the Directorate of
      Health commissioned by the Ministry of Health, with the goal of increasing access to
      evidence-based treatment for adults with anxiety disorders and mild-to-moderate levels of
      depression. The treatment offered is cognitive behavioural therapy and should lead to reduced
      levels of symptoms of anxiety and depression, improved quality of life and better
      employability. PMHC is based on the English program &quot;Improving Access to Psychological
      Therapy (IAPT)&quot;, which is established in virtually all health communities in England.

      The evaluations of IAPT and PMHC have until now been based on relatively weak research
      designs which make it difficult to know to what extent the initiative really has the desired
      effect. In this study, PMHC is compared with a control group that receives treatment as usual
      (often provided by the general practioner) in two PMHC pilot sites (Kristiansand and
      Sandnes). Participants are randomly assigned to either the PMHC or the control group. The
      investigators aim to include 1100 clients in the study.

      The key objectives of this study are to investigate whether PMHC treatment is more effective
      as compared to treatment in the control group with regard to symptoms of anxiety and
      depression, work participation, functional status, and mental well-being. Cost-effectiveness
      of PMHC is also examined.
