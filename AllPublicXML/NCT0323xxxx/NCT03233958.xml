  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the psychosocial effects of systemic / family
      constellation. The method of systemic / family constellation refers to an approach which
      integrates ideas from family systems therapy with elements from psychodrama. The
      constellations are conducted in a group based seminar-setting, each seminar lasting two days.

      Considering the very limited amount of empirical data on this method, the study design is a
      simple pre-post one with a 6-months follow-up. The study will be observational: the
      researchers will not manipulate who receives the intervention; instead they invite all
      clients (individuals from the general population) attending these therapeutic workshops run
      independently of the research process. Given the limited amount of evidence on this
      therapeutic method, special attention will be given to monitor potential adverse outcomes to
      establish intervention safety.

      It is hypothesized that participation in a family constellation seminar might decrease
      potential psychological symptoms and will not result in adverse outcomes.

    <description>Systemic / family constellation integrates elements from psychodrama, family sculpture, and spontaneous dramatizations of intra- and interpersonal processes, while spatially visualizing family dynamics. Family constellations stimulate change through the following ways: 1) making visible the spatial arrangement of relationships within a conflictual system; 2) providing access to the insights of unrelated third parties regarding the sensations, feelings, and thoughts they experienced while representing family members within the constellation; and 3) making observable (from the outside) and experienceable (from within) the transformation of the problem constellation into the solution constellation [Hunger, Weinhold, Bornhäuser, Link, &amp; Schweitzer, 2015].</description>

    <ipd_description>The investigators have not requested permission from their study participants to make their data available to others to increase participants' sense of confidentiality and so willingness to participate in the study. As a consequence, in case of a data sharing request, the investigators would have to seek for additional explicit permission from the participants. As the investigators have committed to destroy participant contact data after finishing the study, the chances of such data sharing seem slim. However, the investigators are more than happy to conduct alternative analyses based on interested colleagues' suggestions / inquiry and share the raw output (including analytic syntax) of such analyses with those making the inquiry.</ipd_description>
