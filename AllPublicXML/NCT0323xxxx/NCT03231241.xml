  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study is aimed at determining why some patients with episodic headache proceed to chronic
      daily or near daily headaches. The Investigators seek to discover differences in brain
      anatomy and function, composition of cerebrospinal fluid, blood products, genetics, and
      patient phenotypes that might help explain this process.

      The purpose of our study is to better understand disease processes and risk factors involved
      in onset of chronic daily headaches/Chronic Migraines. Further, The Investigators hopes to
      learn more about the etiology and disease mechanisms to optimize treatment strategies and
      determine prophylactic measures.

      Participation in this research study, will include online questionnaires, a blood sample, a
      lumbar puncture, and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan without contrast to measure
      brain activity. Participant may select to participate in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      scan and/ or lumbar puncture. participating in atleast 3 procedures is required (blood draw,
      online questionnaires , MRI and/or Spinal Tap.

      The study recruits participants with headache ( any type of headaches), and patients with no
      headaches ( or less than 2/year). Participants do not need to have a specified headache type.
      All participants are asked to complete an on-line survey to characterize a number of
      phenotypic features felt to be relevant by the Investigators. Three independent study groups
      (imaging, proteomics/genetics, and phenotyping) analyze data independently and stratify the
      data. Then, by group analysis, correlation among the different modalities is sought to
      identify features that distinguish common elements that might help elucidate features that
      could predict which patients with episodic headache are likely to progress to chronic, and
      which patients without headache might be at greater risk to develop new daily persistent
      headache.
