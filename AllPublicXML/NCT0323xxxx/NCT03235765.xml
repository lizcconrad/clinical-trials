  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Molecular profiling of lung cancers using circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the blood of
      patients is rapidly becoming established as a useful source of information to aid clinical
      decision-making. This study is aimed to to compare concordance rate between tissue based
      cancer panel analysis and blood based cancer panel analysis in lung cancer patients (both by
      NGS technique).

      This study is comprised of two cohorts as below:

      Cohort A: inoperable, untreated, non-small cell lung cancer patients

      Cohort B: non-small cell lung cancer patients who are in the treatment with targeted agents
      including immune checkpoint inhibitors
