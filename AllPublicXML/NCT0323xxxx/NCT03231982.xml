    <measure>Change in sitting Systolic Blood Pressure(siSBP) from baseline after 8 weeks of treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>For change in siSBP from baseline after 8 weeks of treatment, the mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum will be presented by treatment arm.
The LS mean change in siSBP from baseline after 8 weeks of treatment adjusted for baseline siSBP and its standard error will be presented by treatment arm. Non-inferiority test will be conducted using ANCOVA including change in siSBP from baseline after 8 weeks of treatment as response variable and baseline siSBP and treatment arm as independent variables. Amlodipine besylate/candesartan cilexetil combination tablet will be considered non-inferior to co-administration of amlodipine besylate and candesartan cilexetil if the lower bound of 2-sided 95% CI for the LS mean of difference in siSBP change between the treatment arms is greater than -5.</description>
