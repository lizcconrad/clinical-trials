  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the second cause of death worldwide and the majority of the survivors remain with
      motor impairments. Inhibition of the motor cortex of the unaffected hemisphere has emerged as
      a potential intervention to enhance effects of other rehabilitation strategies on improvement
      of motor performance of the paretic upper limb. In this proof-of-concept study we will
      evaluate the effects of inhibition of the motor cortex of the unaffected hemisphere
      associated with robotic therapy on improvement of motor performance of the paretic upper limb
      in the early phase post-stroke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this study is to test the proof of concept of benefits of inhibition of the
      motor cortex of the unaffected hemisphere on learning evaluated by improvement in kinematics
      of motor performance, in patients with upper limb paresis in the early phase post-stroke. For
      this purpose, patients will be randomized to receive real or sham transcranial direct current
      stimulation before a session of robotic therapy. Data will be collected by kinematic
      assessment performed automatically by the robot at baseline, immediately after and 24h after
      the intervention.

      The working hypothesis is that one session of upper limb motor training will lead to
      improvement of performance in metrics of kinematics, and this improvement will be maintained
      up to 24h after the end of the training.
