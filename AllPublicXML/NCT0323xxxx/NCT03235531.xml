  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol use disorder, or heavy drinking, is commonly seen in patients who present to trauma
      centers. These patients are at risk for Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome (AWS), which is
      collection of symptoms that can range from anxiety and restlessness to seizures, delirium and
      even death. The Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment (CIWA) tool is routinely used to
      assess alcohol withdrawal symptoms. Benzodiazepines (BZD) are commonly administered to trauma
      patients who exhibit symptoms of AWS based on the CIWA scoring system. Although these
      medications have proven efficacy, they can also have negative side effects which may affect
      recovery. Valprate (VPA) is a medication which may have efficacy in management of AWS
      symptoms, thus ameliorating or preventing the need for BZD administration. This trial will
      study the effectiveness of VPA in the prevention of AWS symptoms by comparing the amount of
      BZD use in trauma patients who receive BZD treatment as indicated by CIWA scores with
      patients who receive prophylactic VPA therapy in addition to BZD as indicated by CIWA scores.

      Alcohol use disorder is a common comorbidity among trauma patients. This pre-existing
      condition is associated with Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome (AWS) and frequently complicates the
      management of this patient population. Current treatment and/or prevention of AWS includes
      the administration of sedatives (benzodiazepines [BZD]) in response to the manifestation AWS
      symptoms. This manifestation is indicated by monitoring patients using the Clinical Institute
      Withdrawal Assessment (CIWA) tool. Benzodiazepines elicit an effect on AWS via mediation of
      the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Benzodiazepines, however,
      have the potential to promote multiple negative effects in the acute care setting, including
      increased incidence of delirium, hospital stay, mortality, and the potential for decreased
      long-term cognitive function. The antiepileptic medication valproate (VPA) also has GABA
      activity in the brain, but may be less likely to promote the negative effects associated with
      BZDs. Currently, previous experience with this agent for the prevention of AWS is limited to
      two small studies. In these studies VPA was shown to decrease symptoms of AWS as indicated by
      patients' CIWA scores. Therefore, VPA could serve as an efficacious adjuvant therapy for the
      prevention of AWS. The aim of this study is to determine whether VPA will decrease the use of
      BZD in patients who are receiving symptom-based preventative therapy via CIWA monitoring. The
      hypothesis is that VPA will decrease the utilization of symptom-based lorazepam
      administration in patients who are determined to be at risk of alcohol withdrawal due to
      routine consumption of alcohol.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if prophylactic VPA for the prevention of alcohol
      withdrawal syndrome can decrease symptom-triggered use of benzodiazepines in patients
      monitored for alcohol withdrawal syndrome with the CIWA.

      The Primary objective of this study is to determine if prophylactic VPA acid is associated
      with decreased lorazepam use in patients monitored for alcohol withdrawal syndrome with the
      CIWA.

      Secondary objectives are:

      To evaluate the difference between comparator arms with respect to:

        -  CIWA scores between patients with and without VPA prophylaxis

        -  Hospital and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) length of stay

        -  In-hospital mortality

        -  VPA acid associated side effects (e.g. thrombocytopenia, transaminitis, pancreatitis)

      This will be single-center prospective, randomized study, enrolling trauma patients with a
      history of alcohol consumption admitted to a Level 1 trauma center. Patients included in this
      study will receive standard therapies for AWS practiced at study institution which include
      monitoring of withdrawal symptoms and the administration of BZDs (lorazepam) based on CIWA
      monitoring.

      Following informed consent, patients will be randomized to receive CIWA protocol
      monitoring/BZD or CIWA protocol monitoring/BZD and VPA. Therefore, patients that meet the
      inclusion criteria will be separated into two study groups to compare outcomes:

        1. Treatment Group: Patients treated with CIWA protocol/BZD and VPA

        2. Control Group: Patients treated with CIWA protocol/BZD only.

CIWA Score 9-14: 1 mg IV push lorazepam
CIWA Score &gt;15: 2 mg IV push lorazepam
Patients who have a known history of alcohol withdrawal seizures or who have received greater than 4 mg IV lorazepam per CIWA protocol will be placed on a scheduled lorazepam regimen, 1 mg every 6 hours. The primary managing service may increase the scheduled lorazepam regimen above 1mg every 6 hours if needed to control withdrawal symptoms. Scheduled lorazepam will be discontinued or de-escalated following a 24-hour period in which no additional lorazepam was received per CIWA protocol.
The treatment group will also receive scheduled valproate (VPA), 15 mg/kg divided over 4 doses, rounded up to the nearest increment of 50mg (i.e. a 70 kg person would be administered 300 mg IV VPA every 6 hours) for 96 hours.</description>

    <intervention_name>Valproate</intervention_name>
    <description>Valproate is an anti-epileptic medication that can influence the chemical changes in the brain that result from alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) via three mechanisms of action: (1) an increase in GABA activity, (2) inhibition of glutamate binding to NMDA, and (3) restoration of the balance between dopamine and acetylcholine activity. VPA may be effective in the prevention of AWS, and could serve as efficacious adjuvant to traditional benzodiazepine (BZD) therapy for AWS, both decreasing symptoms of AWS and decreasing the use of BZDs.</description>
