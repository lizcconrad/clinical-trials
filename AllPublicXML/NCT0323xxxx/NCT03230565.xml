      Regional anesthetic techniques are an integral part to many anesthetic approaches, providing
      both intraoperative and postoperative anesthesia and analgesia. Regional anesthesia
      peripheral nerve blocks have been shown to reduce postoperative pain and improve measures
      such as opioid requirements and readiness for discharge. By using a catheter technique for
      continuous peripheral nerve blocks, analgesia can be extended well into post-operative days 2
      and 3, further extending these benefits. Historically these catheters have implemented a
      continuous dosing regimen of local anesthetic, but increasingly there is evidence of improved
      analgesic outcomes without adverse effects by using a scheduled bolus dosing regimen. Many
      institutions have implemented this new protocol for catheter dosing. The beneficial effect of
      scheduled bolus dosing has not been studied in all blocks and all surgical procedures.
