    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effects of a one week weight management summer camp on
      children's weight, quality of life, mood and feelings, self-esteem, weight management
      efficacy, enjoyment of physical activity, and body image.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity affects 17% of children and adolescents in the U.S. Children are entrenched in an
      obesogenic environment, often with little support in the home, school, or medical environment
      to make healthy choices. Obesity is increasingly common in underserved communities that lack
      access and resources for physical activity and healthy eating. Louisiana is a prime example
      of the need for effective obesity treatment, ranking 1st nationally for adult obesity and 4th
      for adolescent obesity with the highest obesity prevalence among African American
      adolescents. We urgently need evidence-based programs to help children and families change
      lifestyle behaviors, achieve clinically significant weight loss, and thereby reduce the
      prevalence of pediatric obesity.

      The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force identifies behavioral treatment including dietary,
      physical activity, and behavioral counseling components as a viable option for pediatric
      obesity treatment, yet a key challenge is how to implement these programs to maximize access
      and participation. Summer (between school years) represents an opportunity for intensive
      intervention to change health behaviors and help children to lose weight. During the summer
      months, children gain weight at a more rapid pace and spend more time engaged in sedentary
      behavior compared to the school year.

      The American Diabetes Association launched Camp Power Up as a summer week-long day camp for
      youth who are obese and/or at high risk for developing type 2 diabetes. The camp will focus
      on wellness education, nutrition, physical activity, and obesity prevention. The purpose of
      the proposed study is to examine effects of Camp Power Up on children's weight status and
      their psycho-social health.

    <measure>Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory - PedsQL</measure>
    <time_frame>First day and final day of camp (day 1 and day 5)</time_frame>
    <description>The PedsQL is a general health related quality of life self-report measure with :complementary scales for children (ages 6-14). The measure assesses availability, negative emotions, physical discomfort, positive activities, and physical, emotional, social, and school functioning, and provides a social psychosocial summary score as well as a total score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Weight Efficacy Lifestyle questionnaire (WEL)</measure>
    <time_frame>First day and final day of camp (day 1 and day 5)</time_frame>
    <description>The WEL assesses self-reported eating habits and perceived self-efficacy in regards to eating and weight loss. The WEL consists of 20 items designed to measure five hypothetical dimensions of efficacy for weight management: availability, negative emotions, physical discomfort, positive activities, and social pressure.</description>

    <measure>Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (PACES)</measure>
    <time_frame>First day and final day of camp (day 1 and day 5)</time_frame>

    <description>Participants will engage in a one-week weight-management summer camp consisting of different activities related to moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and healthy eating. MVPA will consist of modifiable games and activities using a variety of equipment familiar to children of this age, such as balls, hula-hoops, Frisbees, etc., in both competitive and cooperative formats that keep participants moving at all times, and emphasize a feeling of play as opposed to a feeling of exercise. Healthy eating activities are composed of varying classroom-style learning and practical application of knowledge to topics such as recommendations from the MyPlate.gov website, the different types of food groups, and caloric intake and portion sizes, among other various topics.</description>
