  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the safety, tolerability and PK of repeat dose administration of
      GSK2618960 in the treatment of pSS. The study will contain two parts, Part I will be open
      label and Part II will be randomized, double-blind. The minimum duration of Part I &amp; Part II
      of the study will be 26 and 32 weeks respectively.
