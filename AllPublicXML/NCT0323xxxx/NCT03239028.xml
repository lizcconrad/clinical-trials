      We will examine the association between diet quality in offspring at age 14 years and
      maternal diet quality during pregnancy in the Danish National Birth Cohort

      Background: Dietary exposures in fetal life may have long lasting impact on the individual's
      susceptibility for several non-communicable diseases. Although offspring's own dietary habits
      become increasingly independent from parental influence other external factors are likely to
      exist. Further insights are needed to interpret and separate potential influence from
      exposures in pregnancy from later dietary habits on later disease risk.

      Objectives: We will examine the association between diet quality in offspring at age 14 years
      and maternal diet quality during pregnancy in the Danish National Birth Cohort (DNBC).

      Design: A total of 19620 DNBC offspring-mother pairs will be matched by offspring dietary
      intake assessed at age ~14 years with a 150-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and
      dietary intake assessed with a 300-item FFQ during mid-pregnancy (1996-2003). A Healthy
      Eating Index (HEI) will be developed as an indicator for diet quality based on current Danish
      Food-Based Dietary Guidelines including 8 components; fruit and vegetables, fish, dietary
      fibers, red meat, saturated fatty acids, sodium, sugar-sweetened beverages, and added sugar.
