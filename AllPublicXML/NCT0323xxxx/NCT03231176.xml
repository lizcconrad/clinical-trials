  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol for Varlitinib is developed for the treatment of Biliary Tract Cancer.
      Varlitinib (also known as ASLAN001) is a small-molecule, adenosine triphosphate competitive
      inhibitor of the tyrosine kinases - epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), human epidermal
      growth factor receptor (HER)2, and HER4. Varlitinib may be beneficial to subjects with cancer
      by simultaneous inhibition of these receptors. The purpose of this study is to determine the
      safety and efficacy of Varlitinib in combination with capecitabine for the treatment of
      Biliary Tract Cancer. Eligible patients will receive Varlitinib plus capecitabine.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced (unresectable) or
             metastatic biliary tract cancer, including intrahepatic or extrahepatic
             cholangiocarcinoma, gallbladder cancer and carcinoma of the Ampulla of Vater. This
             includes clinical diagnosis of biliary tract cancer with histological confirmation of
             adenocarcinoma.

          2. Patients who have received and failed one and only one prior line of systemic
             treatment or advanced or metastatic disease with radiologic evidence of disease
             progression. This prior line of systemic treatment must also contain gemcitabine

          3. Patients with radiographically measurable disease based on RECIST v1.1.

          4. Patients with no evidence of biliary duct obstruction, unless obstruction is
             controlled by local treatment or, in whom the biliary tree can be decompressed by

             their adjuvant therapy and their disease has relapsed for more than 6 months after
             their last dose of capecitabine adjuvant therapy, their capecitabine therapy will not
             be considered as a line of systemic chemotherapy for metastatic/advanced disease, and
             thus they can participate in the study.
