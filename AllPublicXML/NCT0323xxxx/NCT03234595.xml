      A Phase I/IIa Study to Determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and to Evaluate the Safety
      and Efficacy Profile of Cerebraca Wafer Plus Adjuvant Temozolomide (TMZ) in Patients With
      Recurrent High Grade Glioma.

      High grade gliomas, glioblastoma multiforme (grade IV) and anaplastic anaplastic astrocytoma
      (Grade III), are the most comment malignant brain tumor. The cause of gliomas remains
      unknown. Despite of several researches on environmental hazards and genetic alterations, no
      direct causes were found.

      Patient suffering from glioma usually develops symptoms such as headaches, seizures, memory
      loss and changes in behavior in its early phase. At later stages, patients may encounter loss
      of movement and sensation, language dysfunction and cognitive impairments depending on
      location and size of the tumor. The average survival of glioblastoma patients is 15 months
      regardless of the use of multimodal therapy.

      (Z)-BP/polymer wafer, designated as Cerebraca wafer, is a biodegradable wafer for
      interstitial implantation comprises (Z)-n-butylidenephthalide ((Z)-BP; the active moiety) and
      Carboxyphenoxypropane-Sebacic Acid Copolymer (CPPSA; the excipient).

      Cerebraca wafer, the first human-use drug product, is a biodegradable implant comprises
      (Z)-n-butylidenephthalide ((Z)-BP) and CPPSA. According to pre-clinical study, (Z)-BP could
      reduce glioma migration and invasion, it also could reduce the tumor stem cell marker gens.

    <description>It is a phase I/IIa study of Cerebraca Wafer, intracerebral implantation after resection of tumor, plus adjuvant Temozolomide (TMZ) in patients with recurrent high grade glioma (Grade III and Grade IV; anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma multiforme).
Phase I: at least 2 patients and up to 24 patients. Phase IIa: 12 patients. The main study will end at 24 weeks after all patients receive Cerebraca Wafer implantation. If confirmation tumor response assessment is needed, additional 4 weeks study duration for Main Study Period is allowed. The clinical data at Main Study Period will be summarized in a Main Study Clinical Study Report (CSR).
All patients will be followed in the Extended Period for the efficacy and safety profiles until any one of study cut-off criteria is met, and a CSR will summarize the clinical data covering the overall study period.
NCI-CTCAE 4.03 will be used for grading of the toxicity of Cerebraca wafer.</description>

    <description>Eligible patients will receive Cerebraca wafer implantation with adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ) for the safety and efficacy in this study. At Phase I, the MTD will be determined by DLT. At Phase IIa, up to 12 evaluable patients will be enrolled for the efficacy and safety of Cerebraca wafer implantation. At Phase IIa, the cavity surface after tumor removal will be maximally covered by Cerebraca wafer without exceeding the MTD defined at Phase I. Patients in Phase I receive treatment as designed for Phase IIa, the data will be incorporated into Phase IIa to reduce the patient number. The overall patient number in this study is therefore between 2 to 36 evaluable patients.</description>
