  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To study the association between several exposures of interest and the occurrence of
      infectious loco-regional complications of pharyngitis in children.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will include in the study (after agreement of child and parents):

        -  Cases: children &lt; 18 years old hospitalized for peripharyngeal suppurations, diffuse
           cervical cellulitis or cervical adenophlegmon in participating Ear, Nose &amp; Throat (ENT)
           and pediatric departments.

        -  Controls: children &lt; 18 years old with pharyngitis but without infectious complications
           recruited by general practitioners (GPs) or by primary care pediatricians in private
           setting, matched to cases by age, date of infectious complication (index date), delay
           between the pharyngitis and the index date and, if possible, the referring physician.

      Assessment criterion: difference in the frequency of exposure to various factors among cases
      and controls during an a priori defined exposure window.

      Several exposure of interest will be compared between cases and controls. One specific main
      exposure of interest during a predefined window of exposure has been defined but will not be
      revealed to investigators to avoid selection bias. Several secondary exposure of interest
      were a priori defined but will not be revealed to investigators to avoid selection bias.
