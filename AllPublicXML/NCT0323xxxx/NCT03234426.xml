  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following stroke, patients loses functions of the motor, sensory and higher brain cognitive
      faculties to various degrees which lead to diminished balance. It has been documented that
      hemiplegic or hemiparetic stroke patients presented with more posture sway, asymmetric weight
      distribution, impaired weight-shifting ability and decreased stability capability. There are
      many balance exercises and strategies; to improve balance in elderly age group population, to
      prevent fall prevention. But we have very few evidences of giving manual perturbation balance
      training in stroke patients to improve speed, balance and function. Therefore this study is
      taken up to examine whether the manual perturbation balance training is more effective in
      improving speed, balance and function in stroke patients.

      There are many more studies done for elderly populations, normal individuals for improving
      balance by giving perturbation based balance training.All perturbation exercises are given by
      either mechanical or by self reaching tasks in forward,backward,and in both sideways. There
      are very studies ;who attempted perturbation based balance training to improve balance in
      elderly population but not for stroke patients for their Speed, Balance and Function.The
      manual perturbation exercise can be an promising intervention in the future for various
      conditions
