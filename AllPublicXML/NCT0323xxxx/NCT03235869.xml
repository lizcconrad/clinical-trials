    <measure>The percentage of patients that respond to treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Overall Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the percentage of patients that obtain a Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) to treatment. A global composite scoring system will be used to determine response. Skin, nodes, viscera and blood will be assessed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to response</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The time to response is measured from the start of the treatment until criteria are met for CR or PR. A global composite scoring system will be used to determine response. Skin, nodes, viscera and blood will be assessed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of overall response</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrence or PD (Progressive disease) is objectively documented. A global composite scoring system will be used to determine response and progression. Skin, nodes, viscera and blood will be assessed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression free survival time</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death. A global composite scoring system will be used to determine progression. Skin, nodes, viscera and blood will be assessed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Time to next treatment</measure>
