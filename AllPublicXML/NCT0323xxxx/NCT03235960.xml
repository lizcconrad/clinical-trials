    <textblock>
      Despite numerous techniques for enamel protection, occlusal caries still remains a problem.
      Sealing pits and fissures is considered to be an effective way of preventing caries
      development. Glass-ionomer cements are mainly recommended for pits and fissures sealing for
      two reasons. First, they are less susceptible to moisture which allows their use in
      noncooperable children or in partially erupted teeth where isolation could be a problem, and
      secondly, due to their potential to act as a fluoride reservoir making enamel more resistant
      to demineralisation. The purpose of the study is to clinically examine the caries-preventive
      effect of a glass-ionomer material for fissure protection in newly erupted permanent molars
      in children with low, moderate, and high caries-risk.

      Despite numerous techniques for enamel protection, such as topical fluorides, calcium
      phosphate-based remineralization systems, xylitol, etc., occlusal caries still remains a
      problem. A carious lesion occurs in pits and fissures of occlusal surfaces primarily due to
      their specific anatomy, which is considered to be an ideal site for the retention of bacteria
      and food remnants rendering mechanical means of debridement inaccessible. Sealing pits and
      fissures is considered to be an effective way of preventing caries development. Today, there
      is a wide spectrum of available sealing materials. Glass-ionomer cements are mainly
      recommended for pits and fissures sealing for two reasons. First, they are less susceptible
      to moisture which allows their use in noncooperable children or in partially erupted teeth
      where isolation could be a problem, and secondly, due to their potential to act as a fluoride
      reservoir making enamel more resistant to demineralisation. During last decades,
      glass-ionomer cements of different physical and chemical properties were used for pits and
      fissure sealing which probably contributed to variances in their clinical efficacy. The
      purpose of the study is to clinically examine the caries-preventive effect of a glass-ionomer
      material for fissure protection in newly erupted permanent molars in children with low,
      moderate, and high caries-risk.
