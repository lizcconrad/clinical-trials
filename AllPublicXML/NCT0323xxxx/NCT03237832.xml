  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1 study intends to determine the safety and tolerability of ARN-6039 in healthy
      subjects.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine the safety and tolerability in healthy subjects, ARN-6039 will be dosed in a
      single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending dose study. Five
      cohorts of 10 subjects will be dosed in ascending order, beginning with a single dose of 50
      mg of ARN-6039. Subsequent cohorts will be administered single doses of 100 mg, 150 mg, 200
      mg, or 300 mg. Safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics will be evaluated prior to each
      dose escalation using the assessment of all available safety and pharmacokinetic data.

      In Cohorts 1 through 4, subjects will receive a single dose of ARN-6039 or matching placebo
      under fasted conditions. In Cohort 5, subjects will be administered a single dose of ARN-6039
      or a single dose of matching placebo under fasted conditions in Period 1 and under fed
      conditions in Period 2 with a minimum 5-day washout period between each dose.

      To support the administration of ARN-6039 in humans, preclinical toxicology studies performed
      in rats and dogs demonstrated tolerability exceeding the intended therapeutic dose. In
      addition, the safety and efficacy of ARN-6039 has been demonstrated in model systems and is
      anticipated to be well tolerated in humans. This study will be the first administration of
      ARN-6039 in human subjects.

The unblinded pharmacists were responsible for maintaining the blind, consistent with protocol design, throughout the study. All documentation was filed in the Pharmacy Manual, and access to this manual was restricted to the unblinded pharmacists.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Only volunteers who met all of the following criteria were included as study subjects:

          -  Male or female between 18 and 50 years of age, inclusive.

          -  Female subjects were postmenopausal (at least 2 years prior to dosing) or surgically
             sterile. Subjects who claimed postmenopausal status had their status confirmed with a
             follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) test. Surgically sterile was defined as: Bilateral
             tubal ligation, hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy at least 6 months prior to
             dosing; or Permanent sterilization (e.g., ESSURE procedure) at least 3 months prior to
             dosing.

          -  Subjects had a body mass index (BMI) between 19 and 30 kg/m2 (inclusive) and weighed a
             minimum of 50 kg (110 lbs).

          -  Subjects voluntarily consented to participate in this study and provided their written
             informed consent prior to start of any study-specific procedures.

          -  Subject was willing and able to comply with all trial requirements.

          -  Subject was willing and able to remain in the study unit for the entire duration of
             the confinement period and return for an outpatient visit 7 days after study treatment
             administration.

          -  Subject's vital signs (measured sitting after 5 minutes rest) at screening were within

             pressure (BP): 90-145 mmHg; diastolic BP: 50-95 mmHg. Out-of-range vital signs could
             be repeated once. Predose vital signs were assessed by the Principal Investigator or
             designee (e.g., a medically qualified Sub-Investigator) prior to study drug
             administration. The Principal Investigator or designee verified the eligibility of
             each subject with out-of-range vital signs and documented approval prior to dosing.

          -  Subjects had results within normal range on the following hematology tests performed
             at screening: hemoglobin, hematocrit, total and differential leukocyte count, and
             platelet count.

          -  Subject had results that did not exceed the upper limit of normal range on the
             following liver function tests performed at screening: aspartate transaminase (AST),
             alanine transaminase (ALT), and total bilirubin.

          -  If enrolled in Cohort 5 (the food-effect cohort), subject was willing and able to
             consume the entire high-calorie, high-fat breakfast meal in the designated timeframe

             condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would likely have interfered with
             the absorption, disposition, metabolism, or excretion of the investigational product,
             or would have jeopardized the safety of the subject or the validity of the study
             results.

          -  History of cancer with the exception of basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell (skin)

             of the study results.

          -  Had a positive urine screen for drugs of abuse (amphetamines, barbiturates,
             benzodiazepines, cocaine, cannabinoids, opiates) or cotinine.
