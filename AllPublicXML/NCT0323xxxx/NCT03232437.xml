      A three site study to evaluate the reproducibility of the Aina HbA1c Monitoring System in
      quantitative determination of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) took place at the following
      sites:

        1. Forsyth Institute in Cambridge, MA

        2. Orange County Research Center in Tustin, CA

        3. ActivMed Practices &amp; Research in Methuen, MA
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each site tested three identical samples of HbA1c, at three different levels of HbA1c
      measurement. Samples were drawn at the Forsyth Institute, received and blinded by the
      Sponsor, and returned to Forsyth Institute for testing. Samples were tested in triplicate,
      twice per day, over the course of five days, by three trained operators.
