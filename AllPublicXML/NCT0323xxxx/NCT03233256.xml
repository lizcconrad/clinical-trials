    <textblock>
      This study proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of measuring 2H:1H and 18O:16O in saliva
      and breath by comparing the natural abundances of 2H:1H and 18O:16O in saliva and urine of
      un-dosed humans.

      The scientific premises for this line of research are 1) challenges related to costs, the
      complexity of sample collection and preparation, and the level of technical skills required
      for Isotope-ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) analysis have limited the adoption of the doubly
      labeled water (DLW) method; and 2) the investigators preliminary data demonstrates that
      Off-Axis Integrated Cavity Output Spectroscopy (OA-ICOS) provides a valid, more rapid, and
      less technically challenging approach to isotopic analysis of human samples.

    <description>The investigators propose to demonstrate the feasibility of measuring 2H:1H and 18O:16O in saliva and breath. The natural abundances of 2H:1H and 18O:16O of urine, saliva, and breath samples will be determined from samples obtained simultaneously from 50 relatively healthy human subjects. We will also measure 2H:1H and 18O:16O enrichments in urine, saliva, and breath of 10 relatively healthy human subjects obtained after consuming a standard DLW dose and compare the estimates of TDEE using these different matrices.</description>
