      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the value and effectiveness of a newly-implemented
      preoperative education class for patients undergoing colorectal surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized study to be conducted in a cohort of patients who are scheduled to
      undergo colorectal surgical procedures at Carolinas Medical Center (CMC)-Main. The primary
      objective of this study is to determine the effect of preoperative education classes on
      postoperative compliance with mobilization guidelines. Secondary objectives of this study are
      to evaluate the effect of the preoperative education class on patient knowledge, anxiety, and
      satisfaction, and postoperative outcomes such as inpatient length of stay, postoperative
      complications, and 30-day readmission rates. Data will be compared between patients who are
      scheduled to attend the class and attend and those who are scheduled to attend the class and
      do not.

    <description>The preoperative enhanced recovery after surgery education class will be offered twice a week in coordination with anesthesia preoperative appointments to minimize inconvenience for patients. Patients will need to attend only one class. All participants will be offered the class. This class will be one hour in duration and will be taught by a surgical advanced care practitioner familiar with the details of colorectal surgery. The class will include detailed information about preoperative care, intraoperative care, and postoperative care.</description>
