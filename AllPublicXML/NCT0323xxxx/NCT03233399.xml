  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is to learn about movement intention and volition. To improve
      such knowledge, investigators will conduct sub-studies using multiple non-invasive
      methodologies. These results could provide preliminary data for subsequent studies evaluating
      local and global efficacy of plasticity-inducing treatments for PMD symptoms.

      This study will:

        -  Explore effects of TMS and tDCS on movement intention.

        -  Discern the neural activity underlying modulation of movement intention with
           neuroimaging recording.

        -  Identify brain stimulation's effect in patients with psychogenic tremor and
           non-epileptic seizures.

        -  Technical development of new experimental paradigms and data analysis methods.

        -  Data collection for hypotheses development.
