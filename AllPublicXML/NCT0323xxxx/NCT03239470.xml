  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      T cells, a type of white blood cell called a lymphocyte, play an important role in the immune
      system. One subtype, the regulatory T cell (Treg) helps to regulate the immune system and may
      provide protection against the development of autoimmune disease. The hope is that these
      naturally occurring Treg cells can be utilized for the treatment of autoimmune disease and
      potentially replace the use of chronic immunosuppressive therapies that are associated with
      multiple side effects. There has been a small study showing safe administration of Tregs with
      decreased disease activity in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes. Tregs are being
      studied in lupus, cancer and organ transplantation.

      This phase I trial will be conducted as an open-label, dose-escalation, multicenter trial in
      adult participants with active pemphigus.The purpose of this study is to test the safety and
      effect of Treg therapy in participants who have skin (cutaneous) involvement due to
      pemphigus.

      Up to 12 adults between the ages of 18 and 75 years of age who have been diagnosed with
      pemphigus and meet all other entry criteria will be enrolled to receive one infusion of their
      own expanded Tregs at one of the following doses:

        -  2.5 x 10^8 PolyTregs or

        -  10 x 10^8 PolyTregs.

      Safety, disease activity, and mechanism of action will be assessed over a three year period,
      using biospecimens from blood and skin. Study therapy administration will occur during an
      overnight stay, followed by 2 weekly visits, then monthly visits from Week 8 to Week 12, then
      quarterly visits from Week 26 to Week 52, then twice a year visits until Week 156.
