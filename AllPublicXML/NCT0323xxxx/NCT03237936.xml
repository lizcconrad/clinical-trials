    <textblock>
      The proposed 3-month study is a prospective, open-label, multicentre, phase IV, proof of
      concept study. The study is designed to assess the effect on the quality of vision of
      IKERVIS® (1mg/mL ciclosporin) eye drops administered once daily in dry eye disease (DED)
      patients with severe keratitis, as well as its safety and efficacy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this phase IV clinical trial the Month 3 visit assessments will be used to assess the
      efficacy (quality of vision and other parameters) and safety of IKERVIS® in DED patients with
      severe keratitis.

      To assess the effect on the quality of vision of IKERVIS® (1mg/ml ciclosporin) eye drops
      administered once daily in adult dry eye disease (DED) patients with severe keratitis over 3
      months of treatment.

      To assess the safety of DED patients with severe keratitis treated with IKERVIS® (1mg/mL
      ciclosporin) for 3 months.
