  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the short-term clinical performance of the three contact lenses
      (Methafilcon A IV, Ocufilcon B 1-day and Omafilcon A 1-day daily disposable).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, double-masked, crossover, bilateral non-dispensing study,
      controlled by cross-comparison. Forty subjects will wear each lens brand for approximately
      one hour, on three separate study days in random order. Lenses will only be worn during study
      visits.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  They are of aged 18-40 and have capacity to volunteer.

          -  They understand their rights as a research subject and are willing and able to sign a
             Statement of Informed Consent.

          -  They are willing and able to follow the protocol.

          -  They agree not to participate in other clinical research for the duration of this
             study.

          -  They have a contact lens spherical prescription between -1.00 to - 6.00D (inclusive)

          -  They have a spectacle cylindrical correction of -0.75D or less in each eye (based on
             the ocular refraction).

          -  They can attain at least 0.10 logMAR distance high contrast visual acuity in each eye
             with the study lenses within the available power range.

          -  They currently use soft contact lenses or have done so in the previous six months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  They have an ocular disorder which would normally contra-indicate contact lens wear.

          -  They have a systemic disorder which would normally contra-indicate contact lens wear.

          -  They are using any topical medication such as eye drops or ointment.

          -  They have had cataract surgery.

          -  They have had corneal refractive surgery.

          -  They have any corneal distortion resulting from previous hard or rigid lens wear or
             have keratoconus.

          -  They are pregnant or lactating.

          -  They have any ocular abnormality which would, in the opinion of the investigator,
             normally contraindicate contact lens wear.

          -  They have any infectious disease which would, in the opinion of the investigator,
             contraindicate contact lens wear or pose a risk to study personnel; or they have any
             immunosuppressive disease (e.g. HIV), or a history of anaphylaxis or severe allergic
             reaction.

          -  They have taken part in any other contact lens or care solution clinical trial or
             research, within two weeks prior to starting this study.
