  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      STRIMVELIS is a medicinal product developed by GSK that restores adenosine deaminase (ADA)
      function in hematopoietic cell lineages, thereby preventing impaired immune function.
      STRIMVELIS is indicated for the treatment of patients with ADA- severe combined
      immunodeficiency (SCID), for whom suitable human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched related stem
      cell donor is not available. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of
      routine and additional risk minimization measures by assessing the understanding of referring
      health care providers (HCPs) and parents/carers (hereby referred as participants) with regard
      to the specific risks associated with STRIMVELIS. In this cross-sectional study, surveys will
      be provided to referring HCPs and parents/carers of children approximately six months after
      treatment with STRIMVELIS. The study will recruit for approximately two years until 10
      referring HCPs and 10 parents/carers have completed their respective surveys. STRIMVELIS is a
      trade mark of the GSK group of companies.
