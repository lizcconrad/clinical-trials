      association of opinion score of doctors, nurses and key informants with their selected
      demographic variables.

      Survey Design was adopted. A total of 400 subjects (120 doctors, 120 nurses and 160 key
      informants) were selected using purposive sampling technique from selected hospitals and
      nursing colleges of Ambala, Panchkula and Yamunanagar districts of Haryana. The tool used for
      the study consisted of structured performa regarding sample characteristics and likert scale.
      Research tool was submitted to 11 experts from various departments for validity. Reliability
      was calculated by Cronbach's alpha and it was 0.75 for likert scale. Data Collection was done
      from December 2016 to February 2017. The obtained data was analyzed and interpreted in terms
      of objectives and research hypothesis. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to
