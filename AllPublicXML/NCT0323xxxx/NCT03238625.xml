  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examines whether the injection of local anesthesia mixed with sodium bicarbonate
      in the ratio of 3:1 creates a less burning sensation and is as effective regarding the
      anesthetic effect as in the ratio of 9:1.

    <textblock>
      Therefore the investigators compare two groups with 24 healthy individuals in each group in a
      cross-over study. One group receives four injections (two in each forearm) and one group
      receives only two injections (one in each forearm)

      The four injections of group 1 are:

        -  IMP1: Lidocaine and sodium bicarbonate ratio 3:1

        -  IMP 2: Lidocaine and sodium bicarbonate ratio 9:1

        -  IMP 3: Lidocaine

        -  IMP 4: Sodium cloride 0.9% (=placebo)

      The two injections of group 2 are IMP1 and IMP2.

      After each injection the individual has to rate their pain sensation on a NRS scale and
      afterwards the anesthetic effect gets tested by a standardized laser application.

    <description>Consisting of 24 individuals between 18 and 75 years, able to understand German, not pregnant, with no intolerance of local anesthetics, with intact skin and no skin diseases, not prone to bleeding or taking anticoagulation or aspirine.
Intervention: Every individual receives four injections IMP1: Lidocaine and sodium bicarbonate ratio 3:1, IMP 2: Lidocaine and sodium bicarbonate ratio 9:1, IMP 3: Lidocaine, and IMP 4: Sodium cloride 0.9% (=placebo), namely two in every volar forearm, and has to rate the pain associated during the injection of the fluid, not the needle stitch. Afterwards the anesthetic effect on the four areals which got injected will be checked with a palomar laser after 5, 30, 60, 90, 120 and 180 minutes.</description>
