  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this research is to evaluate functional validation of the MR-US fusion for
      the Clear Guide SCENERGY system, as well as to evaluate benefits derived from system
      performance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Human subjects are proposed to validate the MR-US fusion aspects of the Clear Guide SCENERGY
      product. For these modalities, Clear Guide Medical will work with the subcontract PI to
      determine the appropriate clinical procedure to evaluate (1) functional validation of the
      fusion system and (2) benefits derived from system performance. The selected procedure must
      be a single-patient interaction (i.e., no follow-up visits). Clinical studies will require
      approval through the subcontract's IRB. The Clear Guide SCENERGY will be compared to standard
      clinical practice (either no fusion or an electromagnetic-based fusion system). Clear Guide
      Medical plans to determine sample size based upon statistical powering for a predetermined
      clinically-meaningful difference (delta). This delta has not been selected, because this
      depends on the procedure selected. The anticipated sample size is expected to be around 100
      subjects (i.e., 50 per arm), per modality. Blinding will be used, where possible.
      Clinician-related endpoints cannot be blinded due to obvious equipment differences. Subjects
      will be placed into treatment group by random. Retention strategies are unnecessary, as there
      will not be any planned follow-up visits or activities.
