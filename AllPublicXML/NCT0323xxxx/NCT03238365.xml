  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot early phase I trial studies how well nivolumab with or without
      tadalafil work in treating patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma that has come
      back and can be removed by surgery. Monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may interfere
      with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Tadalafil may stop the growth of tumor
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving nivolumab and tadalafil
      may work better in treating patients head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate whether adding the PDE5 inhibitor, tadalafil, to nivolumab therapy affects
      intratumoral and systemic anti-tumor immunity.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Characterize the combined effects of nivolumab and tadalafil on safety, exosome
      composition and function, the composition of intratumoral immune cell populations, wound
      healing, and tumor radiographic response.
