      Phase II trial to evaluate trametinib in patients with locally advanced non-squamous,
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors harbor a non-synonymous NF-1 mutation, with
      progressive disease on at least one prior line of therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, single-arm, open-label, multicenter clinical trial evaluating the
      efficacy and safety of trametinib monotherapy in patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC
      whose tumors non-synonymous NF1 mutations and are KRAS wildtype. Eligible patients must have
      documented disease progression either during or after treatment with most recent therapy and
      may not have received prior treatment with a MEK inhibitor. Patients with activating
      alterations in EGFR, ALK, and ROS-1 must also have received appropriate TKI treatment.
      Patients who meet eligibility criteria will receive trametinib monotherapy and followed for
      the primary endpoint of objective response rate and additional secondary endpoints. A total
      of 27 patients will be enrolled into the study, with the goals of obtaining 24 evaluable
      patients. Patients may continue treatment until disease progression or up to 24 months from
      the time of study entry or until the study is closed. All patients will be followed for 12
      months.

             or entrectinib) alterations; therapy may be given as monotherapy or in combination
             with other cancer therapy (e.g. bevacizumab, ipilumimab)

          4. Patients with a known activating mutation in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
             (Exon 19 deletion, G719A, S768I, V769L, T790M, L833F, L858R, L861Q), must have

             EGFR-mutation, must have progressed or been intolerant to treatment with anti-PD1/PDL1
             therapy (pembrolizumab, nivolumab, or atezolizumab)

          8. Documented disease progression or intolerance to treatment either during or after
             treatment with most recent therapy.

         15. Adequate baseline organ function defined as follows:

             Hematologic:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count: ≥ 1.2 x 10^9/L

               -  Hemoglobin: ≥ 9 g/dL

               -  Platelets: ≥ 100 x 10^9/L

               -  PT/INR and PTT: ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN)

             Hepatic:

               -  Albumin: ≥ 2.5 g/dL

               -  Total bilirubin: ≤ 1.5 x ULN

             Renal:

               -  Creatine: ≤ 1.5 ULN or

               -  Calculated creatinine clearance (calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault formula): ≥ 50

         16. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test
             within 3 days prior to study enrollment. The effects of trametinib on the developing
             human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because animal studies with trametinib
             have shown reproductive toxicity, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree
             to use effective methods of contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth
             control) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 4
             months following discontinuation of trametinib. Should a woman become pregnant or
             suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she
             should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this
             protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the
             duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of study drug
             administration.

         17. Able to swallow and retain orally administered medication and does not have any
             clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormalities that may alter absorption such
             as malabsorption syndrome or major resection of the stomach or bowels.

         18. All prior treatment- related toxicities must be CTCAE (Version 4.03) ≤ Grade 1 (except
             alopecia) at the time of randomization

         19. Ability to understand a written informed consent document, and the willingness to sign
             it.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known mutation in KRAS at position G12, G13, or Q61.

          2. Symptomatic or untreated leptomeningeal or brain metastases or spinal cord
             compression. Treated brain metastases are allowed as long as they are stable for at
             least 28 days post-treatment.

          3. Pregnant women are excluded from this study; breastfeeding should be discontinued if
             the mother is treated with trametinib . Because there is an unknown but potential risk
             for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with
             trametinib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with
             trametinib.

          4. History of another malignancy. Exception: Subjects who have been disease-free for 3
             years, or subjects with a history of completely resected non-melanoma skin cancer
             and/or subjects with indolent second malignancies are eligible.

          5. Any serious and/or unstable pre-existing medical disorder (aside from malignancy
             exception above), psychiatric disorder, or other conditions that could interfere with
             subject's safety, obtaining informed consent or compliance to the study procedures.

          6. The subject has received cytotoxic chemotherapy, molecular targeted therapy, or
             immunotherapy within 21 days before the first dose of study drug (trametinib).

          8. History of interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis.

          9. Have a known immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reaction or idiosyncrasy to drugs
             chemically related to study drug, or excipients or to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).

         10. Any major surgery, extensive radiotherapy, chemotherapy with delayed toxicity,
             biologic therapy, or immunotherapy within 21 days prior to study enrollment and/or
             daily or weekly chemotherapy without the potential for delayed toxicity within 14 days
             prior to study enrollment.
