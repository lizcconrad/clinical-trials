  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During this study, the investigators will perform a collection of biological and device
      samples (blood, catheters, insulin) in order to investigate the causes of catheter
      obstructions in patients with type 1 diabetes treated by implanted insulin pumps using
      intra-peritoneal delivery.

      This multi-centre study is interventional with minimal constraints. After an inclusion visit,
      blood samples and an insulin sample from pump reservoir will be collected. During the
      following year, if a peritoneal catheter is blocked or changed, the explanted catheter and
      new blood and insulin samples will be collected for examination of the catheter obstruction
      and search for patient- or insulin-related reasons for obstructions.

      In this study, 140 patients will be investigated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In patients with type 1 diabetes treated by implanted pumps using intra-peritoneal delivery,
      the incidence of peritoneal catheter obstructions is close to 12 per 100 patient-years.
      Variability of occurrence is however important between patients. Fibrin, aggregates of
      insulin and fibrotic tissue have been found inside the catheter lumen at peritoneal tip or
      forming a capsule around the catheter. This study will investigate with more precision the
      nature of catheter blockages and look for potential causes of these obstructions such as
      stability of insulin in the pump reservoir, immune reactions against insulin or catheter
      components in patient plasma, prothrombotic factors in patient blood. Blood samples and
      insulin from pump reservoir will be collected at baseline (inclusion). During the following
      one year period, each catheter presenting an obstruction or needing a change associated with
      pump change will be collected and explored. Blood and insulin samples will be collected again
      for comparison with initial samples. Investigations will be performed in collaboration with
      Pr Burgess' team at the School of Pharmacy of the University of Connecticut. From obtained
      results, models replicating the conditions of obstruction will be elaborated and tested in
      rodents at the University of Connecticut. Solutions will be proposed to reduce the occurrence
      of obstruction of peritoneal catheters as an outcome of the study.
