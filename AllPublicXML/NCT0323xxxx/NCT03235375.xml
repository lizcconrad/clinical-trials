    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-dose, parallel group study to evaluate the PK, safety,
      tolerability, and immunogenicity of MEDI0382 in subjects with renal impairment. Enrollment of
      approximately 40 subjects across multiple sites is planned. Subjects will be divided into 4
      groups based on renal function.
