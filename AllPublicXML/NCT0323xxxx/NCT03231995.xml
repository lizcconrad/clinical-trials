  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Context: Seasonal influenza affects 2.5 to 3 million people each year in France, resulting in
      1500 to 2000 severe cases seen in intensive care units. The severity of influenza is related
      to, among other things, its respiratory or neurological complications, observed especially in
      children. Early determination of the severity of influenza is a critical step to avoid in
      appropriate treatment and care for patients and to improve their survival. Viral, human but
      also environmental factors have been described as having an important role in determining
      this severity. Several studies suggest that the nasopharyngeal microbiome may be involved in
      the incidence and severity of respiratory viral infections. During influenza infection, the
      respiratory microbiota is significantly altered. In animal models, particularly murine
      models, the microbiota regulates the immune response to influenza virus infection. In a
      retrospective preliminary study, the investigators showed that the composition of the
      nasopharyngeal bacterial microbiota is different between children who develop a severe or
      moderate influenza. This difference was observed on respiratory specimens at admission to
      pediatric emergencies within two days of onset of symptoms.

      Hypotheses :

        -  The respiratory microbiome is a determining factor in the clinical course of influenza
           infection (benign vs. severe with respiratory or neurological complication)

        -  The respiratory microbiome can be used as a prognostic biomarker of the clinical course
           of influenza Originality: There are currently no clinical and / or virological markers
           to predict the clinical course of influenza infection. This study will define biomarkers
           of the respiratory microbiome to discriminate patients who will develop a severe
           influenza from those who will develop a moderate influenza. These prognostic biomarkers
           could be used to rapidly refer patients at risk to intensive care units, thus improving
           patient management and care. Moreover, at the fundamental level, this study will specify
           the role of the microbiome in the severity of influenza infection.
