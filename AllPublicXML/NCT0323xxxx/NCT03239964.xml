    <textblock>
      Two groups of patients (73 patients each) undergoing routine caesarean section has recurrent
      keloid at site of surgical scar. One group will undergo surgical excision of keloid. The
      other group will have combined surgical excision of keloid and single intralesional
      dexamethasone injection at edges of wound.All patients were reviewed once per month for 6
      months for evidence of recurrence

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One hundred forty six patients that are admitted at Kasr Al Aini teaching university hospital
      for caesarean section, will be enrolled in this randomized clinical trial after approval by
      the local ethical health committee. A written informed consent will be obtained from each
      participant after full explanation of the procedure.

      Under general or spinal anaesthesia done routinely during caesarean section, total
      extralesional surgical excision of the keloid is performed and minimal undermining followed
      by the usual steps of caesarean section. Primary closure of the wound in layers is achieved
      in all cases. A running subcuticular prolene 2/0 stitch is used to suture the skin. Group A
      of 73 patients will not receive further injection. In 73 patients (group B), the wound edges
      are injected once with dexamethasone. A 1 mL syringe with a 30-gauge needle is used and
      injection is both intradermal and subdermal. Repeated alternate punctures are used to bathe
      the wound edges with the drug. Approximately 0.5-1 mL of dexamethasone (4 mg/mL) in wound
      tissue.

      For all patients, the wound is painted with betadine and sealed until postoperative day 14,
      at which time the subcuticular stitch is removed.

      Postoperative medications are given to all patients in the form of analgesics and antibiotics
      as routinely given at the hospital. All patients were advised to avoid direct sun exposure
      for the following month. No postoperative applications (eg, compression, steroid injections,
      etc) were used in any of the patients. All patients were reviewed once per month for 6
      months.
