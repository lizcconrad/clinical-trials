  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to evaluate efficacy and safety of targeted precision therapy in
      patients with refractory tumor, including rare tumor without standard recommended treatment
      and common tumor after multiple line of therapy.

      The individuals recruited in the present study are with solid tumor, mainly including two
      parts: first, rare tumor without standard recommended treatment such as atypical fibrous
      histiocytoma; second, common tumor after multiple line of therapy such as lung cancer,
      gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, etc. All patients have no any standard therapy based on
      NCCN guideline when recruiting. Next-generation sequence was used to detect druggable
      molecular event including gene mutation, gene fusion, amplification, etc. Then patients with
      molecular events were treated with corresponding targeted drug and followed-up, and not
      limited tumor type. The efficacy and safety of targeted drug were evaluated.
