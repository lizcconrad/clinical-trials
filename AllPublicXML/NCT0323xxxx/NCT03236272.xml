    <textblock>
      The aim of the investigators 'study is to investigate the relationship between the biomarkers
      (e.g. protein markers, genetic polymorphisms and epigenetic markers) and the onset of ARDS.
      In this study, the participants were divided into case group (with ARDS) and control group
      (without ARDS), based on a nested case-control study method. During the diagnosis and
      treatment, the clinical data of subjects are collected at the given time point. And the
      clinical data are extracted from plasma, blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of
      participants. These data will be analyzed based on statistical methods. In the end ,the
      investigators can build a multi index early warning model based on the biomarkers,which is
      meaningful for the early diagnosis of the patient with high-risk for ARDS and provide
      evidence for the early treatment.

      The investigators studied patients at high risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
      and ARDS patients. The patients with ARDS were the case group, and the patients without ARDS
      were the control group .Sample size estimate :set alpha =0.05,1- beta =0.8, estimated cases
      exposure rate was 50%, the control group estimated exposure rate was 35%, according to a
      case-control study of sample size estimation formula for sample size calculation, and
      considering the loss rate is 10%, the sample size for each group of 188 cases, two groups of
      376 cases. The plasma, blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid will be collected during the
      diagnosis and treatment，to study biomarkers related to the onset of ARDS, such as protein
      markers,genetic polymorphisms and epigenetic markers.The observation data of two groups will
      be compared .The clinical data are collected at the given time point. The stepwise regression
      (forward-conditional) will be used for establishing a multivariate unconditional logistic
      regression model that will contribute to screened the main risk factor and protective factors
      that affect the ARDS. And these factor will help to established the early warning model and
      the risk function of ARDS in high-risk patients, which will contribute to predict the risk of
      ARDS in high-risk patients.All information about the subjects is strictly confidential, and
      the results of the study may be reported at medical conferences and published in scientific
      journals, but any individual who can identify subjects will not be able to use.
