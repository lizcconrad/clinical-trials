      The purpose of this study is to identify whether pregnant women with chronic hypertension are
      at significantly higher risk of having undiagnosed OSA and should be routinely screened with
      home sleep tests. The investigators will recruit 120 pregnant subjects between 10-20 weeks
      gestation from the Duke High Risk Obstetrics Clinic over a 20-month period. They will be
      enrolled into one of two groups: 1) chronic hypertension (on medication or hypertensive blood
      pressures documented at 3 clinic visits); 2) normal blood pressure, and not on any treatment
      for chronic HTN and no history of chronic HTN, and matched for BMI (+/- 3 kg/m2) with the
      chronic HTN group. The two groups will be matched for BMI to control for the effect of
      obesity on OSA diagnosis and cHTN. The primary hypothesis, that OSA prevalence differs
      between patients with chronic HTN and normotensive controls, will be assessed with a
      two-group two-sided Fisher's exact test. A Fisher's exact test with a 0.05 two-sided
      significance level will have 92% power to detect the difference between a normotensive OSA
      rate of 0.10 and a chronic hypertensive OSA rate of 0.40 when the sample size in each group
      is 50. There are no risks associated with the use of the home sleep test device, but subjects
      that have a severe latex allergy should not participate, as the device

        The investigators will recruit 120 adult pregnant subjects between 10-20 weeks gestation
        from Duke Hospital and clinics in Durham, NC over a 20-month period. They will be enrolled
        into one of two groups: 1) chronic hypertension (on medication or hypertensive blood
        pressures documented on two clinic visits); 2) normal blood pressure, and not on any
        treatment for chronic HTN and no history of chronic HTN, and matched for BMI (+/- 3 kg/m2)
        with the chronic HTN group. The two groups will be matched for BMI to control for the
        effect of obesity on OSA diagnosis and cHTN.
