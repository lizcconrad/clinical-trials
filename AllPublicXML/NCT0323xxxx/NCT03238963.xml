      The main objective is to evaluate ocular and systemic safety and tolerability of BI 1467335
      as well as whether BI 1467335 monotherapy has a potential to improve retinal lesions in
      patients with moderately severe Non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) (DRSS level 47)
      or severe Non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) (DRSS level 53), without
      Center-involved diabetic macular edema (CI-DME)

             the posterior pole

          -  Evidence of neovascularization on clinical examination including active
             neovascularization of the iris (small iris tufts are not an exclusion) or angle

             fluorescein dye

             times half-life of the investigational drug, whichever is longer, since ending another
             investigational drug trial from the screening visit in this trial or receiving other
             investigational treatment(s); patients participating in a purely observational trial
             will not be excluded.
