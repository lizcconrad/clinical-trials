  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To minimize the effects of polymerization shrinkage in the restorative treatment, there are
      new composites called Bulk- Fill which the companies has developed this composites for
      example Tetric N Ceram(Ivoclar-Vivadent) and Filtek ( 3M ESPE). Its decreased polymerization
      shrinkage and properties allow the material to be inserted in one layer being quickly than
      traditional composite. This clinical study is designed to compare the clinical performance of
      the bulk fill composite resin in Class I (one-surface posterior), II (two-surface posterior)
      and V (cervical-surface posterior) fillings.

      A patients with 3 caries lesions class one either two or five will be divided into 3 groups ,
      cavities will be incrementally layered with resin composite and each increment will be cured
      as directed by the manufacturer with the light curing unit (Bluephase Style
      Ivoclar-Vivadent), with an energy 1,100 mW/cm² (±50 mw/cm²) and others group of cavities will
      be restored by bulk fill composite (3M ESPE) and other bulk fill composite (
      IVOCLAR-VIVADENT) as one increment then will be cured as directed by the manufacturer with
      the light curing unit.

      The study will investigate the clinical performance and efficacy of a bulk-filled composite
      resin restorative material for a period of 5 years
