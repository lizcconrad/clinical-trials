      The objective of this study is to demonstrate the clinical performance of the Sofia® 2
      analyzer and Sofia Lyme FIA test in the CLIA waived test environment in comparison to
      Comparator Method(s) and/or an FDA cleared predicate test(s) using matched finger-stick,
      whole blood and serum from symptomatic subjects.

      The objective of this study is to demonstrate the clinical performance of the Sofia® 2
      analyzer and Sofia Lyme FIA test in the CLIA waived test environment in comparison to
      Comparator Method(s) and/or an FDA cleared predicate test(s) using matched finger-stick,
      whole blood and serum from symptomatic subjects. The finger-stick and venous whole blood
      specimens will be tested by CLIA waived test operators. The matched plasma (from the leftover
      whole blood) and serum specimens will be sent to a separate reference laboratory for testing
      to compare the matched specimen using the Comparator Method(s) and/or an FDA-cleared
      predicate test(s). The results of this study may be used to support a 510(k) and/or
      CLIA-Waiver submission for testing whole blood sample types.

    <description>Arm 2 will consist of subjects selected from a pool of patients that were previously determined to have Lyme disease either by the presence of the diagnostic rash (erythema migrans) or through laboratory findings and physician diagnosis based on patient symptoms. In this Arm the site may recruit by contacting subjects previously diagnosed with Lyme disease no longer than 16 months post diagnosis and no earlier than 1 week post diagnosis.</description>

In this Arm the site may recruit by contacting subjects previously diagnosed with Lyme disease between 17 months and 50 months post diagnosis. For the subject to be enrolled, a physician must have diagnosed the subject to have Lyme disease based on clinical symptoms.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Arm 1 - Prospective symptomatic subjects, must have had a known or suspected exposure
             or tick-bite from an endemic area prior to onset of symptoms, and be currently
             exhibiting the following:

          -  The physician determines that the subject has an expanding erythema migrans (EM)
             lesion or &quot;bulls-eye rash&quot; with evidence of clearing in the center and has requested 2
             tier serological testing or prescribed a ≥10 day course of antibiotics such as
             doxycycline in subjects &gt; 8 years old or amoxicillin, cefuroxime or doxycycline in
             subjects ≤8 years of age:

        Or

        - The physician must observe current symptoms, including:

        At least three (3) of the listed acute stage symptoms listed:

          -  fatigue

          -  night sweats

          -  chills

          -  fever

          -  headache

          -  arthralgia

          -  mildly stiff neck

          -  myalgia i. one or more symptoms a. through h. are determined to be intermittent

        Or,

          -  at least one (1) of the following current conditions:

          -  recurrent, brief attacks (weeks/months) of objective joint swelling in one or more
             joints, sometimes followed by chronic arthritis in one or a few joints,

          -  lymphocytic meningitis

          -  cranial neuritis (partial facial palsy and may be bilateral)

          -  radiculoneuropathy

          -  encephalomyelitis

          -  acute onset of high-grade (2nd or 3rd degree) atrioventricular conduction defects that
             resolve in days to weeks, sometimes associated with myocarditis

        In addition, the physician must be sufficiently confident in the possibility of Lyme
        disease to have requested two-tier diagnostic testing and/or prescribed a ≥10 day course of
        antibiotics such as doxycycline in patients &gt; 8 years old or amoxicillin, cefuroxime or
        doxycycline in patients ≤8 years of age.

        Arm 2 - Previously diagnosed with Lyme disease / confirmed case of Lyme disease: Within the
        past 16 months, a physician must have previously diagnosed the subject based on the
        presence of an EM rash or based on symptoms and confirmed by laboratory findings as
        outlined in the CDC two Tier Testing algorithm. A copy of the subject's medical record
        documenting the diagnosis must be obtained, and kept as source documentation at the
        enrolling site.

        Arm 3 - Previously diagnosed with Lyme disease / confirmed case of Lyme disease: Within the
        past 17 to 50 months, a physician must have previously diagnosed the subject based on the
        presence of an EM rash or based on symptoms and confirmed by laboratory findings as
        outlined in the CDC two Tier Testing algorithm. A copy of the subject's medical record
        documenting the diagnosis must be obtained, and kept as source documentation at the
        enrolling site.
