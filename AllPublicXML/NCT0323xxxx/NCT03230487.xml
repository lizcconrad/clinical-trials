      Part 1 (SRD (Single-rising dose)):

      The primary objective of this trial part is to investigate the safety and tolerability of BI
      1015550 in healthy male subjects following oral administration of single rising doses.

      Secondary objectives are the exploration of the pharmacokinetics of BI 1015550 after single
      dosing.

      Part 2 (MRD (Multiple-rising dose)):

      In Part 2, the primary objective is to investigate the safety and tolerability of BI 1015550
      in healthy male subjects following oral administration of multiple rising doses.

      Secondary objectives are the exploration of the pharmacokinetics of BI 1015550 after multiple
      dosing.

          -  Male subjects who do not agree to minimize the risk of female partners becoming
