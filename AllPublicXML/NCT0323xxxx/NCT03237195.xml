  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most patients with cancer of the head and neck are offered surgical resection of the primary
      tumor. In order to determine how the tumor will eventually behave, along with the resection
      of the primary tumor, lymph nodes present in the neck are also dissected. Different
      institutes have different protocol on handling of the specimen that is received by the
      pathology labs after dissection of the neck. The investigators intend to analyze the protocol
      that they use to evaluate the neck dissection specimen.

      This will be a retrospective study. All neck dissections received in the histology laboratory
      from Jan 2013 to December 2016 will be retrieved from the histopathology files by conducting
      a search through CoPath. The glass slides of all the neck dissections that fit the study
      criterion will be retrieved from the archives. The glass slides will be reviewed by the
      pathologist.

      At the time of review number of lymph nodes identified microscopically, presence or absence
      of metastasis and if the Lymph Nodes (LN) were palpable or not palpable will be documented.
      The data will be analyzed to see if the submission of extra fat yielded any additional
      positive lymph nodes or microscopic deposits. The cost analysis for additional slides will be
      also done.
