    <textblock>
      We plan to conduct a randomized trial of tandem colonoscopies comparing water infusion and
      air insufflation for inspection of mucosa on withdrawal. In one randomized group, water
      infusion will be employed as the first method for mucosal inspection while in a second group,
      CO2 insufflation will be used first. This study will be different than usual care since the
      participants will receive two successive or tandem colonoscopies versus one
