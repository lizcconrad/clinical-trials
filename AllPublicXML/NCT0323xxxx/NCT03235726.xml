  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single and repeat increasing dose study will collect information on safety, tolerability
      and drug levels in the body of the CCI15106 inhalation powder. The study will also look at
      the level of CCI15106 that will be released into the air and may be found in the blood of the
      people standing around the person inhaling it (bystanders). This is a two-part study in which
      Part 1 will enroll healthy subjects and look at environmental and bystander exposure and Part
      2 will enroll subjects with moderate COPD. Approximately 36 healthy subjects and
      approximately 22 subjects with COPD will be randomized in this study for dosing. The total
      study duration will be 82 days for Cohort A Part 1; 75 days for Cohort B Part 1 and Cohort C
      Part 1; 77 days for Cohort A Part 2; and 90 days for Cohort B Part 2.
