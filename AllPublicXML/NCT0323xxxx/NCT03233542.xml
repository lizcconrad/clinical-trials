  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to examine panic-related associations and interpretations in the
      context of Panic Disorder and its treatment. While theoretical accounts of Panic Disorder
      suggest a central role of such associations and interpretations in the onset and maintenance
      of the disorder, research to date in fact leaves many questions about the nature of these
      dysfunctional cognitions and their potential role unanswered. Patients with Panic Disorder
      and a control group of patients with other anxiety disorders will complete measures of
      panic-relevant associations and interpretation bias. The patients with Panic Disorder will be
      randomized to receive either Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) or a waiting list condition
      (to be followed by CBT after completion of the study procedures). The anxious control group
      will also receive CBT. Panic-relevant associations and interpretations will be measured
      twice, i.e., pre and post CBT/waitlist. Furthermore, relevant symptom measures and
      physiological and biological markers will be assessed and responses to a hyperventilation
      challenge. The study aims to further advance our understanding of cognitions in the etiology
      and maintenance of Panic Disorder, and inform future treatment optimisation.

      The main purpose of the present study is to look at relationships and changes over time but
      not to compare treatment outcomes (i.e. it is not an efficacy trial). The associations and
      interpretation measures are listed as primary outcomes because these are the measures of main
      interest.

    <time_frame>Change from pre-treatment/waitinglist - post-treatment/waitinglist (post is approx. 3 months after the pre-treatment/waitinglist assessment)</time_frame>
    <description>The Priming Paradigm measures panic related associations. During this task, participants will be instructed to sort target words as words versus non-words (lexical decision task). Before a target appears, however, a prime will be presented. Participants will be instructed to look at the prime but to not react to it. Following the design of Hermans et al. (2010), we will use the following prime-target combinations: panic-panic, panic-neutral, neutral-neutral, neutral-panic. There will also be prime-target combinations with non-words as targets.</description>

    <measure>Single Target Association Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from pre-treatment/waitinglist - post-treatment/waitinglist (post is approx. 3 months after the pre-treatment/waitinglist assessment)</time_frame>
    <description>The Single Target Implicit Association Test (STIAT) measures the associative strength between a target concept and two attribute dimensions. Participants are asked to sort stimuli into three categories by means of two response keys: one category represents a target concept, and two categories represent two poles of an attribute dimension. The target category is paired with both attributes. The present STIAT is designed as follows: targets: bodily changes, attributes: alarming vs. meaningless, and it takes over the structure as suggested by Wigboldus et al. (2006): (a) attribute discrimination, (b) target categorization practice, (c) first combined block, (d) reversed target categorization practice, and (e) reversed combined block.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from pre-treatment/waitinglist - post-treatment/waitinglist (post is approx. 3 months after the pre-treatment/waitinglist assessment)</time_frame>
    <description>The Scrambled Sentence Task (SST, Wenzlaff &amp; Bates, 1998) measures panic-related interpretation biases. It consists of six-word strings participants are asked to unscramble to form a five-word sentence, leaving out one word. The present SST can be completed such that the resulting five-word sentences produce either a panic-related or neutral interpretation. During the SST, there is a cognitive load, i.e., participants have to memorize a 6 digit number.</description>

    <measure>Interpretation Bias Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from pre-treatment/waitinglist - post-treatment/waitinglist (post is approx. 3 months after the pre-treatment/waitinglist assessment)</time_frame>
    <description>The Interpretation Bias Questionnaire (IBQ) measures panic-related interpretation biases. It consists of 18 brief scenarios used in earlier studies (Ebert, 1993, Foa &amp; McNally, 1987). Nine items describe panic-related situations, and the other nine describe negative, threat-related situations. Following each scenario, three explanations are presented (for panic-related scenarios: one panic-related explanation and two panic-unrelated explanations, for negative, threat-related situations: one very negative, threat-related interpretation and two harmless explanations). Participants have to indicate how likely each explanation for the corresponding scenario is, using rating scale from 0 (not likely) to 100 (very likely).</description>

    <measure>Body Sensations Questionnaire (BSQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment/waitinglist - post-treatment/waitinglist (post is approx. 3 months after the pre-treatment/waitinglist assessment)</time_frame>
    <description>The BSQ (Chambless, Caputo, Bright, &amp; Gallagher, 1984; Ehlers, Margraf, &amp; Chambless, 1993) includes 17 items that reflect specific bodily sensations (e.g., heart palpations, dizziness). Participants are asked to indicate the degree to which they experience anxiety related to these sensations by means of a five-point Likert scale (1 = &quot;Not at all&quot; to 5 = &quot;Extremely&quot;).</description>

    <time_frame>Pre-treatment/waitinglist - post-treatment/waitinglist (post is approx. 3 months after the pre-treatment/waitinglist assessment)</time_frame>
    <description>A symptom checklist will assess the presence of panic-relevant symptomatology in line with the DSM-5 criteria for panic disorder, e.g., occurrence and frequency of panic attacks, experienced distress during panic attack, fear of going crazy, dizziness etc. (for a similar procedure, see Wilhelm, Gerlach, &amp; Roth, 2001). It also assess participants' level of generally anxiety and whether or not participants experienced a panic attack. This will be completed repeatedly within each testing session.</description>

    <measure>Responses Hyperventilation Task</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment/waitinglist - post-treatment/waitinglist (post is approx. 3 months after the pre-treatment/waitinglist assessment)</time_frame>
    <description>An adapted version of the procedure described by Kossowsky, Wilhelm, and Schneider (2013) and Wilhelm et al. (2001) will be used in the present study. During the hyperventilation, participants will breathe through their nose and their breathing will be monitored by a capnograph. There will be 3 phases.
Phase 1: Participants will undergo a 'paced breathing' procedure. That is, they will be asked to keep a breathing speed of 18 cycles/minute (breaths per minute, bpm). Breathing speed will be paced by computerized audio instructions. At the end of phase 1, the end-tidal CO2 level should be 25mmHg (for recommendations for the end-tidal level, see Meuret et al., 2005).
Phase 2: The goal of this phase is to maintain the 25mmHg CO2 level while participants keep on breathing with a 18 bpm paced breathing pattern.
Phase 3: This is a 3 minute recovery phase. During this phase, participants are supposed to breath normally again.</description>
