  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate the use of patient throat gargle as an
      alternative to throat swabbing for the diagnosis of pharyngitis caused by Group A β-Hemolytic
      Streptococcus (GABHS) infection, also known as strep throat.

      The aim of this study is to procure a detailed quantitative and qualitative analysis of GABHS
      present in patient throat gargle and to compare various culturing techniques and immunoassay
      methods for efficient and effective GABHS detection from gargle fluid. During the course of
      this clinical trial, the following specimen samples will be collected from each participating
      patient: the patient will first be asked to gargle 10-15 mL of sterile saline to obtain a
      gargle sample, and then the patient will be subjected to two routine standard throat swabs.
      These specimen samples will be properly discarded after processing and analysis.
