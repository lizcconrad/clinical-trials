  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will seek to evaluate the predictability and efficacy of a Computer Aided
      Design-Computer Aided Manufacturing and additively manufactured polycaprolactone and
      hydroxyapatite scaffolds in these defects compared to traditional guided tissue regeneration.
      40 gingival recessions associated with interproximal tissue deficiency will be divided into
      two groups: control group (autogenous bone + collagen membrane; n = 20) and test group
      (autogenous bone + scaffold; n = 20).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of gingival recessions associated with interproximal bone and gingival tissue
      deficiency, and also the absence of interdental papilla, are major challenges within the
      periodontics due to lacking predictability. However, an intervention in these cases is
      extremely important, since the presence of these defects is associated with aesthetic,
      phonetic, hypersensitivity and may be associated with other dental damages. This study will
      seek to evaluate the predictability and efficacy of a Computer Aided Design-Computer Aided
      Manufacturing and additively manufactured polycaprolactone and hydroxyapatite scaffolds in
      these defects compared to traditional guided tissue regeneration. 40 gingival recessions
      associated with interproximal tissue deficiency will be divided into two groups: control
      group (autogenous bone + collagen membrane; n = 20) and test group (autogenous bone +
      scaffold; n = 20). A split-mouth design will be used with both procedures performed at the
      same surgical time.
