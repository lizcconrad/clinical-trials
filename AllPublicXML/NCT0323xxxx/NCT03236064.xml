      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of PEG 3350 for use in nerve repair.

  <detailed_description>

      To demonstrate more rapid and increased return of function by PEG-fusion compared to the best
      current nerve repair techniques. Neurorrhaphy is not new, being performed now for over 150
      years much research has been performed. PEG-Axon fusion on the other hand is relatively new
      in mammals. Success has already been obtained by two institutions in the rat sciatic nerve
      transections, demonstrating rapid return of behavioral function4. These however are very
      controlled injuries and unclear how well these will translate into human studies. For this
      reason 3 separate clinical studies in increasing order of complexity are proposed.

      The first study proposed will be PEG fusion in digital nerve lacerations. Two goals will be
      demonstrated; improved innervation density and improved innervation threshold compared to
      traditional repair, and complication rate similar or less than traditional repair. This will
      demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the procedure.
