    <textblock>
      Currently, successful prevention of migraine is not sufficiently achieved by (prophylactic)
      drug therapy. In contrast, neurophysiologically guided treatments might provide an
      alternative avenue, since these can normalize brain alterations without side effects.
      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) appears useful in the acute and prophylactic
      treatment of migraine, probably because of its modifying and re-balancing influence on
      neuronal activity. Yet, to test for the efficacy of tDCS in a clinically acceptable way, it
      is necessary to apply not only tDCS but also a &quot;sham&quot; placebo, which is often neglected in
      tDCS stimulation studies. Further, tDCS needs to be applied in a large (n &gt; 20) sample of
      well-defined migraine patients, which would be advantageous, compared to previously published
      work. Monitoring sources of regional neuronal alterations in migraineurs prior and after tDCS
      is essential to investigate physiological mechanisms of tDCS. There is an increasing interest
      towards non-pharmacological treatment alternatives for migraine (and headache disorders) with
      reduced side effects to established prophylactic medications. The primary outcome of this
      project is to demonstrate that repetitive sessions of neurostimulation lead to a significant
      and permanent reduction of the primary symptom severity (i.e. migraine attacks) for patients
      suffering from chronic and episodic migraine. Since neurostimulation tools are nowadays
      accepted as therapeutic tools, our study might provide evidence that tDCS can be a
      non-pharmacological alternative for treating migraine.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients from age 18 upwards (max. 80 years) suffering from chronic or episodic migraine.
        Medication overuse headache (MOH) patients are included as well (as chronic migraine
        patients do often show MOH).

        Healthy volunteers (18-80 years) are included if they don't fulfil the exclusion criteria
        and do not suffer from migraine or other headache disorders, except infrequent episodic
        tension-type headache All volunteers are able to read and sign the informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients and healthy volunteers are excluded if they fulfil one of the following exclusion
        criteria:

        Common MR exclusion criteria: such as metallic items in the body (i.e. eye splinter, MR
        incompatible implants*), pacemaker, claustrophobia or obesity (body mass index &gt; 35).

        Also pregnant participants and participants suffering from a degenerative disorder of the
        Central Nervous System, such as Stroke, Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson's Disease,
        Alzheimer's Disease and Huntington's Disease will be excluded. Participants with major
        psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder will also be excluded.
