  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of dietary fat on satiety (the experience
      of fullness between one meal and the next) and energy metabolism over an extended period of
      time (chronic effects). How dietary fat sources affect satiety, appetite and energy use is
      unclear. The investigators will use a controlled setting for the studies. They want to know
      if the source of dietary fat alters satiety, satiety hormones, and energy expenditure
      responses after consuming different diets.

      This work will address the interaction of obesity and dietary fatty acids in regulating
      satiety and energy metabolism. The primary objective is to determine the effects of chronic
      intake of dietary fatty acids of varied saturation and chain length on satiety, thermogenesis
      and energy utilization in healthy individuals. The investigators hypothesize that unsaturated
      fatty acids will 1) increase satiety and 2) increase energy metabolism and that 3) the fatty
      acid binding protein polymorphisms are associated with reduced energy expenditure in response
      to dietary fat intake.
