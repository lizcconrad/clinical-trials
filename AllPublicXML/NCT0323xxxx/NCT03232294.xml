  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Abnormal fetal development such as macrosomia can cause some complications on both fetus and
      mother.The measurement of fetal anterior abdominal wall thickness (FAWT) is an easy
      examination that it can be obtained during an examination of a pregnant woman by ultrasound.
      Macrosomia for fetus can lead to some morbidities. It can affect perinatal outcome and
      increase childbirth complications and operative birth. There are some studies scrutinizing
      the relationship between FAWT and diabetes in the literature. However there are few studies
      which scrutinize effect of FAWT on both abnormal fetal development and adverse perinatal
      outcomes in non-diabetic pregnancies and non high risk pregnancies. Hence the investigators
      wonder if FAWT can anticipate birth-weight or macrosomic infant or perinatal outcome
      regarding with macrosomia in the second trimester.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        A total of 96 women with low risk pregnancy coming to our clinic for a routine antenatal
        examination in 26-28th gestational weeks were included to this study and performed 75 gr-
        oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).
