    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, partly randomized, multi-center, Phase III, controlled trial,
      designed to show that the onset-to-puncture time (OPT) for good functional outcome (defined
      by modified Rankin Scale score at 3 months, 0-2) can be set depending on collateral status
      based on multiphase CT angiogram. The purpose of this study is to prove that (1) for patients
      with poor collaterals, there will no difference in good outcome rate between endovascular
      treatment and best medical treatment group if onset-to-puncture time is between 150 minutes
      and 600 minutes, and 2) for patients wih good collaterals, the rate of good outcome is equal
      to or greater than 42% (10% greater than historical control) if onset-to-puncture time is
      between 150 minutes and 600 minutes. Patients will initially be classified into 3 arms based
      on both collateral status on multiphase CT angiography and whether or not receiving
      endovascular thrombectomy: group 1, patients with good collaterals and receiving endovascular
      thrombectomy, 2) group 2a, patient with poor collaterals and receiving endovascular
      thrombectomy, and 3) group 2b, patients with poor collaterals and not receiving endovascular
      thrombectomy. Patients with good collaterals will receive endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) if
      onset-to-puncture time is between 150 minutes and 600 minutes after last seen well time. Of
      the patients with poor collaterals, they will be randomized into endovascular treatment and
      best medical treatment group, if onset-to-puncture time is between 150 minutes and 600
      minutes, (onset-to-puncture time is not possible within 150 minutes but possible within 600
      minutes after last seen well). Primary endpoint is the rate of good outcome at 3 months. The
      number of subjects needed with statistical power of 0.8 and alpha value of 0.025 is estimated
      309 patients.
