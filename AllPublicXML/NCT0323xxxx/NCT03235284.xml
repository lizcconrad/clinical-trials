  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Parkinson's disease present motor dysfunctions such as stiffness, tremor,
      postural instability and bradykinesia, which leads to alterations of balance, necessitating
      specialized physiotherapeutic treatment. In this way this study aims to determine the
      effectiveness of two tools used in physiotherapy, kinesiotherapy and the Nintendo Wii. 36
      patients will be evaluated through the Berg Balance Scale, Dynamic Gait Index and Timed up
      and go, and will then be randomized to receive 16 sessions of Kinesiotherapy or Nintendo Wii
      alone or together. After this period the patients will be reassessed to verify the effects of
      the techniques.

      Index and the Timed up and go. Later patients will be randomized to receive 16 sessions of
      Kinesiotherapy or Nintendo Wii alone or together, twice a week, for 50 minutes at the
      Neurociencias Outpatient Clinic of Teacher Magalhães Neto - FUBA. After this period the
      patients will be reassessed to verify the effects of the techniques.

    <description>A program of therapeutic exercises (GC) based on the PNF method for a period of two months, with sessions two times a week for 50 minutes (a total of 16 sessions).All treatment groups prior to perform the study interventions,stretches of upper and lower limbs for 10 minutes. The GC treatment program consists of the following protocols: a) protocol 1: 20 minutes diagonal exercise upper limb (flexion-abduction-external rotation and extension-abduction-internal rotation),10 minutes diagonal exercise scapula (anterior and posterior elevation) and 10 minutes of exercise for trunk extension; b) protocol 2: 20 minutes diagonal exercise lower limb (flexion-abduction-external rotation and flexion-abduction-internal rotation),10 minutes diagonal exercise pelvis (anterior and posterior depression), and 10 minutes gait cycle training;</description>
