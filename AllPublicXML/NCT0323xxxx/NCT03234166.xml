  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute necrotizing pancreatitis is a frequent and potentially lethal disease, especially in
      case of infected pancreatic necrosis (IPN). IPN usually occurs after the first week of
      evolution. The step up approach is now widely recommended for the management of IPN. In fact,
      in case of suspicion of IPN, a drainage percutaneous or transgastric is recommended at first,
      supported by probabilist antibiotherapy. 1/3 of patients won't require any other
      interventions. For 2/3 of patients, an additional necrosectomy is necessary. Necrosectomy was
      formally realized by open laparotomy. Since de last decade, mini-invasive technics have
      emerged: transgastric necrosectomy, video-assist retroperitoneal debridement. laparoscopy and
      permitted a decreased of morbidity and mortality. Recently, Hollemans et al. developed a
      nomogram based on 4 variables (sex, multi-organ failure, % of necrosis and collections
      heterogeneity) which are negative predictors for success of catheter drainage in IPN with an
      receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve at 0.76. The aim of this study is to validate
      on a large retrospective cohort Hollemans nomogram in predicting catheter drainage success.
      Secondary aims are to evaluate possible others predictors for success of catheter drainage in
      IPN and to evaluate the impact of antibiotherapy on microbiological results and on the need
      for an additional necrosectomy regarding its type and duration, as well as the emergence of
      multiresistance organism.

      Using electronic patient data monitoring systems, the investigators reviewed all patients
      with a diagnosis of acute necrotizing pancreatitis admitted to digestive liver disease unity
      or ICUs at the Nantes University Hospital, Rennes, Angers and Brest University Hospital from
      January 1, 2012, to december 31, 2017. For enrolled patients, general clinical
      characteristics were collected. Patients were categorized into two groups according to
      success of catheter drainage or failure of catheter drainage, and the differences of these
      characteristics between two groups were evaluated. The Hollemans nomogram is evaluate and
      potential risk factors will be collected and studied by using multiple logistic regression
      analysis.

    <description>Nomogram based on 4 variables independently associated with success of catheter drainage: Male sex, multiple organ failure, increasing percentage of pancreatic necrosis and heterogeneity of the collection . Points are awarded to a factor if it is associated with a reduced success chance of catheter drainage. Favorable scores for all factors (ie, 0 points), result in a 91% success chance of primary catheter drainage. Similarly, unfavorable scores (maximum of 40 points) result in a 2% success chance of primary catheter drainage.</description>
