      This is a clinical trial that will be done in the state of Kuwait, at the physical
      rehabilitation medicine hospital. the participants will be recruited from all over Kuwait,
      there is a clinical registry upon the ethical committee in Kuwait assigned by the ministry of
      health.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Physical therapy approaches continue evolving. During the last years, minimal invasive
      techniques such as percutaneous needle electrolysis (PNE) was being developed, obtaining
      promising results for tendon pathology. PNE technique is a minimally invasive treatment that
      consists in an application of a galvanic electrolytic current that causes a controlled local
      inflammatory process in the target tissue. This allows for phagocytosis and the subsequent
      regeneration of the affected tissue. Nowadays, PNE is being used in clinical practice to
      manage MTrP, but there are not studies supporting that they have an additional beneficial
      effect over DN.

      From a biological point of view, it seems reasonable to ascertain that a patient will obtain
      benefits thanks to the mechanical effects provided by the needle, and that patients may
      benefit more if the electrolysis effect is added to the mechanical stimuli provided by the
      needle. Therefore, the aim of this randomized controlled study is to compare the
      effectiveness of DN versus PNE for the level of pain in patients suffering for PHP.

    <masking_description>Participants who fulfill the inclusion criteria will receive the standardized oral and written information, and, once they grant their consent to take part in the trial, they will be randomized. Allocation to the groups will be achieved using a computer program (Randomizer, https://www.randomizer.org/) generated random patient file numbers sequence by a third person not involved in the study from the file section in Kuwait. This person will be the responsible for guarding the envelope with the information of the randomization. The envelopes will be closed until the moment of the intervention to maintain the blinding. This professional also will ask the patients for informed consent. The consent form is recruited upon the ethical medical committee at the ministry of health in the state of Kuwait.</masking_description>

    <description>Participants will complete the visual analogue scale (VAS) before each treatment session, considering the level of pain they have just before start the treatment session and the highest level of pain they have had during the last 48 hours. The exact words of the questions will be: 1) what is the level of pain, as average, you have feel during last 48 hours?; and 2) what is the maximum level of pain you have feel during last 48 hours? Participants will be explained that a score of 0 indicates the absence of pain whereas a score of 10 represents the maximum tolerable pain. The VAS is widely used and is valid and reliable</description>

    <description>Once the clinician locates the MTrP, he will insert the needle over it and he will do a quick entry of the needle. The chosen technique to manipulate the needle will be Hong technique, which consist of quick entry and exit of the needle (fast in/fast out) to get local twitch response (LTR), it will be repeated 5 times with a rhythmic movement of 1Hz/sec. LTRs will be counted and registered.</description>

    <description>The electrotherapy equipment used (Enraf) produces a continuous galvanic current through the cathode (modified electrosurgical scalpel with the needle) while the patient holds the anode (handheld electrode). Once the needle have reach the relevant treatment area, a continuous current of 3 pulses at an intensity of 3, 1.5 mA for 5 seconds conveyed to the muscle will be applied. It will be done exactly the same way as in the DN group with the only difference that the needle will be transmitting the electrical current.</description>
