  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increasing cases of women with dilated cardiomyopathy with a project of pregnancy are
      observed. However there is few knowledge and publications about cardiac diseases in pregnant
      women. Moreover the majority of medical articles deal with women with congenital heart
      diseases, valvular pathologies or peripartum cardiomyopathies, and few data are available in
      literature about women with dilated cardiomyopathy diagnosed before or during the first
      months of the pregnancy.

      Cardiologist and obstetrician advices are considerably limited when patients with dilated
      cardiomyopathy have a pregnancy project. Knowledges and know-how are currently based on
      limited personal experiment or on few clinical cases descriptions.

      Pregnancy represents a high-risk situation for patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Creation
      of a cohort of pregnant women with dilated cardiomyopathy collecting specific data will allow
      to have a better overview and to appreciate possibilities of a pregnancy project, evolution
      risks and modalities for medical attention and to improve follow-up and advices delivered to
      these patients.

      This study is a national (20 centres) retrospective (10 years) and prospective registry of
      pregnant women with dilated cardiomyopathy.

      As this study is observational, medical attention of the enrolled patients will not be
      modified. No specific visit is planned for the study.

      Before the enrolment of the patient, the investigator provides the subject with clear and
      precise information about the protocol and requests her for written informed consent. The
      French ethical committee gave the investigators the possibility to include women in the
      registry if the investigators are unable to inform her (deceased women, no follow-up).

      The main objective of the study is to evaluate clinical characteristics and study maternal
      and neonatal evolution and complications during pregnancy using analysis of the
      morbi-mortality and clinical and para clinical criteria.

      The following data will be compiled in a case report form (e-CRF):

        -  Risk factors, cardiac history

        -  BNP or NTproBNP value, echocardiographic data (LVEF and LV diameter)

        -  Medical treatment before and during the pregnancy

        -  complications; occurrences during the pregnancy

        -  Modalities of medical attention during delivery: mother/child Patient's data are coded,
           and therefore anonymous, by using the inclusion number and initials of the patient
           (first letter of name and first letter of surname (ex: 01-X_X).

      In this prospective and retrospective, multi-centre, clinical study, all patients enrolled in
      the cohort will be included in the statistical analysis. As an observational non-randomized
      single arm evaluation, the statistical analyses will be descriptive. A minimum of 100
      patients will be enrolled.
