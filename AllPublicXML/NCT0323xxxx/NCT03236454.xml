  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 2-armed randomized, sham-controlled, single-blind study aims at providing evidence for
      the efficacy of a transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)-enhanced cognitive control
      training (PASAT) in participants with subjective cognitive decline (SCD). Overall, the study
      will include 30 participants. Each participant will take part in a four weeks training (12
      sessions); 50% of the participants will receive 2mA anodal tDCS for 20 minutes applied to the
      left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), the other half will receive sham stimulation.
      Event-related potentials (ERPs) evoked by the feedback on the correctness of the response at
      baseline and after training will be measured with EEG as neurophysiological signatures of
      cognitive control. Near and far transfer will be assessed by a verbal 2-back task and the
      Trail Making Test A and B. The amount of worrying regarding the memory impairment will be
      quantified by means of a 10 point Likert-Scale. Together with changes of PASAT performance
      these measures will be obtained before and after the tDCS-enhanced training. Follow-up
      assessments 3, 12 and 24 months after training will investigate the stability of training
      effects.
