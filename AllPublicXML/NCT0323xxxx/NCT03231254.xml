      Study Objective: To explore the differences in predicted therapeutic outcome of OA and
      optimal protrusion position determined by Remotely Controlled Mandibular Positioner (RCMP)
      with overnight PSG in Quebec versus Shenyang patients with OSA.

      Design: A prospective, inter-ethnic pilot study. Setting: Two Standard sleep disorder
      clinical care in Quebec (Canada) and Shenyang (China), with oral appliance titration tests
      performed in sleep laboratory.

      Participants: Consecutive specific OSA patients, who are potential candidates for treatment
      of OSA with an oral appliance (n=100, 50 Canadian, 50 Chinese), will be recruited from a
      sleep center or respirologists, psychiatrists, otolaryngologist and dentists practicing with
      broad inclusion criteria (age: 20-75 years, AHI:15-50/h; BMI＜40 kg/m2).

      Interventions: A mandibular protrusive titration study in the PSG lab using a RCMP not only
      predicts the eventual therapeutic outcome but also prospectively determines Optimal
      Protrusive Position (OPP) for participants predicted to be therapeutically successful with OA
      therapy. One goal of this study is to identify OA favorable candidates by physicians using
      prospectively and explicitly designed criteria. Analyses of the predicted therapeutic outcome
      of OA and OPP between the two ethnic populations (patients in Quebec and Shenyang) will be
      processed after matching for OSA severity.

    <description>RCMP device can accurately identify patients who are likely to be successful OA candidates. With a temporary dental appliance connected to a RCMP, the mandible could be progressively, mildly and precisely protruded in only anterior-posterior dimension, under the monitor of PSG, without disturbing sleep, until obstructive apneas and hypopneas were eliminated, particularly in REM sleep while supine. Besides, RCMP device can also determine the optimal therapeutic level of mandibular protrusion during sleep.</description>

        Research participants will be respectively recruited from Sleep Centre of IOCPQ of Laval
        (Quebec, Canada) and CMU first affiliated hospital (Shenyang, China), which receives the
        majority of referrals from respirologists, psychiatrists, otolaryngologists and dentists
        practicing in Quebec and Shenyang City. Consecutive patients between 20 and 75 years of
        age, satisfying the pre-mentioned inclusion will be considered eligible to our study.
