  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke survivors often encounter impairments in the upper limb after stroke. Sensorimotor
      impairments are present in 67% of the stroke patients, resulting in problems with
      independency and performance of activities of daily life. In addition, the pattern of
      recovery in the brain is still a matter of ongoing debate. Although the importance of
      somatosensory function on motor performance is well described, evidence for somatosensory or
      sensorimotor therapy and brain-related changes is scares. Therefore, we aim to explore the
      effect of a sensorimotor therapy compared to pure motor therapy on motor function of the
      upper limb. A second objective is to investigate therapy-induced brain-behavior associations
      using resting state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the brain.

      Stroke survivors often encounter impairments in the upper limb after stroke. Sensorimotor
      impairments are present in 67% of the stroke patients, resulting in problems with
      independency and performance of activities of daily life. In addition, the pattern of
      recovery in the brain is still a matter of ongoing debate. Although the importance of
      somatosensory function on motor performance is well described, evidence for somatosensory or
      sensorimotor therapy and brain-related changes is scares. Therefore, will conduct a
      Randomized Controlled Trial with three main objectives.

      The first objective of this project is to investigate the effect of sensorimotor therapy on
      motor function of the upper limb. To achieve this objective, a sensorimotor program will be
      developed based on the SENSE therapy. Patients will be randomly allocated to either the
      sensorimotor therapy group or the pure motor therapy group; and will receive 16 hours of
      therapy. Motor and Somatosensory assessments will be performed at three time points:
      baseline(admission to rehabilitation center), immediately after the 16 hours of therapy and
      after 4 weeks of follow-up.

      The second objective is to investigate therapy-induced brain-behavior associations with
      resting state functional connectivity. In order to achieve insights in brain-behavior
      associations, we will perform resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)
      scans at the same time points as the clinical assessments: baseline, immediately after the 16
      hours of therapy, and four weeks after the end of the therapy. Both measurements,
      brain-imaging and clinical measurements will be combined to investigate the associations.

      This project will lead to new insights in brain-behavior associations of sensorimotor
      function of the upper limb after stroke and will provide evidence for a new therapy in upper
      limb stroke rehabilitation.

    <description>sensorimotor therapy will consist of 30minutes of sensory discrimination training and 30 minutes of sensorimotor training per session. The sensory discrimination training is based on on the SENSe training of Carey et all. The sensorimotor training is the same individually tailored motor therapy as described below, but with integration of sensory discrimination training aspects.</description>

    <description>The motor therapy consists of 30 minutes of cognitive and attention-based table top games and 30 minutes of motor training per session. The cognitive-attention-based therapy consists of table top games such as chess, rush hour, or other smart games. Individually tailored motor therapy consists of a unilateral motor exercise program for the upper limb, while seated at a table, under supervision of a therapist to match the therapy and intensity provided in the other sensorimotor therapy group. This 30 minutes of motor arm training is based on a set of standardized exercises which comprise task-related practice for gross movements and dexterity including different grips and selective finger movements, and training in daily life activities, however without any attention to sensory discrimination training.</description>
