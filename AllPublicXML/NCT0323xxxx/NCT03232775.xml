  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) have unique social-communication and behavior
      impairments that complicate their medical management. This study aimed to evaluate the
      effectiveness of using a picture schedule paired with a reinforcement system during the
      medical exam. Two groups (treatment and control) of children (ages 5 - 10 yrs) diagnosed with
      ASD and below average adaptive communication impairment were asked to participate. Following
      participation in an overview of autism diagnostic symptoms training, two teams (comprised of
      one chief medical resident and one nurse), blind to the study aim, conducted the study exams.

      Objective: This pilot study aimed to evaluate the effects of a picture-schedule reinforcement
      system on reducing problem behaviors in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) during a
      physical exam.

      Design, setting, patients, intervention: Fifteen study participants, aged 5-10 years, with
      autism and identified by caregivers as typically uncooperative with physical exams were
      randomized to one of two physical exam groups (treatment and control) based on their adaptive
      communication score. The treatment group exam included use of a picture
      schedule-reinforcement book and the control group exam did not introduce the book. Caregivers
      rated participants' irritability/stereotypy behaviors before and during study exams. Exam
      teams blinded to study aims, recorded participants' total exam items completed and caregivers
      rated participants' level of cooperation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Chronological ages 4 to 10 years.

          2. Presumptive diagnosis of Autistic Disorder or Asperger's Disorder prior to study
             admission from a psychologist or psychiatrist experienced with children who have
             autism.

          3. Meets research criteria for Autistic Spectrum Disorder:

               1. Meets cut-off scores for autism spectrum on the Social Communication
                  Questionnaire (SCQ) (cut-off = 15) and

               2. Meets empirically-derived algorithm cut-off scores for Autism Spectrum Disorders
                  on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS).

               3. All subjects will have the ADOS administered by a clinician trained in research
                  reliability standards.

               4. The Principal Investigator, a certified ADOS trainer and research reliable, or
                  trained designee under the supervision of the Principal Investigator, will
                  administer the ADOS.

          4. Participants will represent the typical DSM-IV diagnostic developmental profile of
             children on the autism spectrum and no neurological injuries or illnesses before the
             age of three years that could account for their symptoms (i.e., meningitis,
             encephalitis, severe head injury or seizure disorder).

          5. A Communication standard score â‰¤ 85, as measured by the Vineland Adaptive Behavior
             Scales - II.

             a) The VABS-II will be administered by the Principal Investigator or trained designee
             under the supervision of the Principal Investigator as part of the initial phone
             screening process.

          6. Children with an ASD, particularly school-aged children and adolescents, may present
             with myriad prescribed psychotropic medications. Therefore, we will not exclude
             children on a variety of psychotropic medications; rather we will conduct a
             qualitative analysis to look at this issue.

          7. No restrictions regarding race or gender will be applied to the autism or
             developmental disability sample. Every effort will be made not to over-represent any
             particular race and/or gender group.

          8. Physically healthy prior to physical exam.

          9. Previous exposure to visual systems. This will be assessed based on caregiver report
             during the phone screening using one question relating to the use of visual structure
             with the child.

         10. History of:

               1. Poor Cooperation

               2. Completely Uncooperative

               3. Physical exams rated by caregiver on 4-point scale of cooperation modified from
                  Forsberg et al. [56].

                    -  0 = No problems with cooperation;

                    -  1 = Minor problems with cooperation: Child shows mild behavior problems
                       and/or anxiety symptoms;

                    -  2 = Poor cooperation: Child's behavior problems and/or anxiety symptoms
                       requires that the medical staff have to spend extra time and effort to
                       manage the child and complete the exam;

                    -  3 = Completely uncooperative: Exam is not possible due to child's behavior
                       problems and/or anxiety symptoms

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Participants with intelligence quotient standard scores &gt; 40.

          2. Presence of the following genetic or progressive neurological disorders known to be
             causative of or potentially resulting in a phenotype similar to autism:

               1. Fragile X,

               2. Landau Kleffner, Rett Disorder,

               3. Childhood Disintegrative Disorder, or

               4. Tuberous Sclerosis, based on screening by clinical staff and subsequent review by
                  medical staff as needed

          3. Presence of vision or hearing loss or significant motor impairments.

          4. Wards of the State.
