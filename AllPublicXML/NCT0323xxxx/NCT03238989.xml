      The purpose of this study is investigating the clinical course, treatment course, and
      prognosis of patients with interstitial lung disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Interstitial lung disease refers to pulmonary disease that occurs in the interstitium of the
      lung.

      It can be broadly classified into lung disease secondary to the cause of systemic disease or
      drug, and lung disease whose cause is unknown, and the latter is known as idiopathic
      interstitial pneumonia.

      Idiopathic interstitial pneumonia is a lung disease showing various aspects of inflammatory
      response and fibrosis reaction, and the cause of the onset is not accurately known yet, also
      there is no effective treatment.

      Idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, progresses very
      slowly, but sometimes acute exacerbation without any obvious cause leads to death, rapidly.

      Therefore, it is important to collect data prospectively for changes in clinical features,
      pulmonary function, imaging findings, and quality of life of these patients.

      A prospective study of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia will provide important information
      on the clinical characteristics and admission history of patients with idiopathic
      interstitial pneumonia, and the idiopathic interstitial pneumonia registry system will serve
      as the basis for further prospective observational studies.

      The aim of this study is to establish the registry of patients with interstitial lung disease
      and to prospectively review the clinical features and progression of the patients.
