  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  The association of FOLFOX (5-fluoruracil, folinic acid, and oxaliplatin) and pan is a
           standard option for the first-line treatment of unresectable RAS and BRAF wt mCRC
           patients.

        -  The phase III TRIBE trial recently demonstrated that FOLFOXIRI (5-fluoruracil, folinic
           acid, oxaliplatin and irinotecan) plus bev significantly prolongs PFS and OS and
           increases RECIST response rate, ETS and DoR, as compared to FOLFIRI (5-fluoruracil
           folinic acid, and irinotecan) plus bev. The advantage provided by the intensification of
           the upfront chemotherapy backbone is independent of RAS and BRAF mutational status.

        -  Some phase II trials recently assessed the safety and activity of the combination of
           three-drugs chemotherapy regimens with an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody. Promising
           activity results in terms of RECIST response rate and R0 resection rate have been
           achieved, with some safety concerns with special regards to gastrointestinal toxicity.

        -  In the phase II randomized MACBETH study the combination of a modified schedule of
           FOLFOXIRI with cetuximab determined remarkable activity results, with an acceptable and
           manageable safety profile.

        -  The optimal duration of the upfront treatment with chemotherapy plus anti-EGFRs is not
           established. The phase II MACRO-2 trial suggested that interrupting FOLFOX after 4
           months while continuing cet alone as maintenance, is a reasonable option.

        -  Activity parameters (RECIST response rate, ETS, DoR) are clinically relevant endpoints,
           associated with longer survival, in particular with anti-EGFR moAb-based treatment.

      On the basis of these considerations, we designed the present phase III randomized trial of
      first-line mFOLFOXIRI plus pan versus mFOLFOX6 plus pan in RAS and BRAF wt unresectable mCRC
      patients.
