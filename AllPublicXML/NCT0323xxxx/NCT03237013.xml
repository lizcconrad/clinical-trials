  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the intended proposed research is to investigate and determine best strategies
      for preventing skin cancer for emerging adults. To answer this question, the investigators
      intended to pilot a randomized control trial with three arms: 1) Facial Morphing, 2)
      Mindfulness, and 3) Treatment as usual. The population from which the sample was drawn from
      was undergraduate psychology students from a large public university in Southern California,
      who report recent indoor/outdoor tanning, and intentions for future tanning.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Indoor and outdoor tanning are two of the most common risk factors for developing skin
      cancer. Predictors of indoor and outdoor tanning including negative body image and negative
      affect. Thus, to subsequently prevent skin cancer, interventions should focus on appearance
      concerns and negative affect. To date, limited brief efficacious skin cancer preventions
      exist. One potential program (APRIL AGE) a facial morphing software program, has recently
      been evaluated as a potential prevention program of skin cancer. However, limited data exists
      on the long term benefits of this program. Additionally, brief mindfulness programs have been
      found to be efficacious in preventing other health risk behaviors (e.g., smoking, negative
      affect, eating behaviors). To the investigators' knowledge, these brief mindfulness
      interventions have yet to be applied in skin cancer prevention. Thus, the investigators
      sought to compare the relative efficacy of the facial morphing intervention and the
      mindfulness intervention vs. control condition (treatment as usual). It was hypothesized that
      both facial morphing and mindfulness would lead to reductions in tanning behavior compared to
      the TAU condition. The investigators also tested contrasts between the facial morphing and
      mindfulness conditions, however, no directional hypotheses could be generated, due to the
      dearth of prior data on these interventions in skin cancer prevention.

    <intervention_model_description>At initial visit, participants were screened for study eligibility, consented, and randomized to a study condition. Participants first completed baseline assessment. Following, all participants completed intervention as determined by randomized assignment (i.e., control, facial morphing or mindfulness). At the initial visit, all subjects were assigned a subject ID number. Each subject ID was pre-assigned to a study condition, determined by an online randomization program, prior to recruitment. Each eligible participant had a 1/3 chance to be assigned to each of the three study conditions. Immediately after intervention, participants completed acute assessment, also consisting of self-report questionnaires. At the end of the initial visit, participants provided researchers a valid email address to be sent a subsequent follow-up survey. Approximately one month from the intervention date, participants received and completed the online follow-up survey.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Following baseline assessment, all participants were given health literature on tanning behavior from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These materials included informational pamphlets addressing common myths regarding tanning behaviors, including &quot;Tanned skin is not healthy skin&quot;, and &quot;A base tan is not a safe tan. These misconceptions were accompanied by &quot;burning truth&quot;, scientific data debunking these myths. Additionally, all participants received a packet on sun protective practices for oneself and family, which include skin cancer statistics and information on UV rays.</description>

    <description>In addition to the health literature, participants completed the Facial Morphing Intervention. Participants had a digital photograph taken and uploaded to the APRIL® software, accompanied by information about their current age and self-identified race. Participants were presented with two, side-by-side identical 2D images of their face. Participants first viewed an image of their face from their current age, in two-year intervals, to age 72, the maximum age, with the &quot;UV exposure&quot; setting turned on. This process was repeated. Next, participants viewed the projected aging process, toggling the &quot;UV exposure&quot; setting (on and off), every ten year interval. The process was repeated using 3D images to view projected changes to their facial profiles.</description>

    <description>In addition to the health literature, participants completed the Mindfulness Intervention. Participants listened to a 10-minute self-guided mindfulness audio exercise. The audio file is a scripted reading of an established, brief mindfulness exercise (Erisman &amp; Roemer, 2010). During this guided session, participants learned what mindfulness was, when it can be used, and benefits from practice. Listeners were led through steps, focusing on the physical sensations, breathing, and thoughts. After the exercise, participants were provided a handout highlighting key points about mindfulness and how to incorporate informal mindfulness practice into their daily life.</description>
