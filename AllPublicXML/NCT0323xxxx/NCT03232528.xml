      To evaluate the efficacy of Moxibustion in the treatment of Ulcerative Colitis, thus the
      scientific foundation for rational use of Moxibustion in clinical usage, in order to find
      admission of the Acupuncture and Moxibustion and even medicine field, accomplish

      A total of 128 patients with UC were randomly divided into the following 2 groups: a)
      Herb-partition moxibustion (Treatment Group) and b) Sham herb-partition moxibustion (Control
      Group). All patients in the trial will be treated with moxibustion 3 times a week, once a day
      for 30 minutes, for a total of 12 weeks. After treating the treatment had ended and the 52nd
      week of follow-up to observe the clinical therapy effect of Moxibustion in UC patients.
      Tissue morphology and molecular biology tests will be conducted to observe the regulation in
      the intestinal mucosa of UC patients. All these steps will be done in order to provide
      clinical usage for the effects of herb-partition moxibustion in the treatment of UC.

    <description>Drug: Herbal cake, Device: Moxibustion. Herbal cakes formula: Monkshood 10g, Cinnamon 2g, Salvia miltiorrhiza 3g, Flos Carthami 3g, Radix Aucklandiae 2g. Herbs are smashed into powder. Every 2.5g medicine powder is mixed with 3g millet wine and then pressed into herbal cakes using a specific mold. Each cake should be 23mm in diameter and 5mm in height. Then, ignited moxa cones are placed on top of each herbal cake. Herbal cakes with moxa cones will be positioned at acupuncture points ST25, ST37 and CV6. The entire treatment will be done once a day for 1 moxa cone every acupuncture point, 30 minutes at a time, 3 times a week, for a total of 12 weeks.</description>
