  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the change in Alanine Aminotransaminase
      (ALT) in patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) initiating Sodium Glucose
      Cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, liraglutide, or sitagliptin, compared to a control group
      of patients who did not initiate a new antihyperglycemic therapy. The hypothesis is that
      patients using Sodium Glucose Cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) will achieve a greater
      reduction in ALT compared to the control group.

    <textblock>
      Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is very commonly associated with type 2 diabetes
      mellitus (T2DM) 1. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is a common biomarker used to predict
      levels of NAFLD. The only class of antidiabetic agents thought to be protective of NAFLD are
      thiazolidinedione's. Few studies have investigated the effect of other antidiabetic agents on
      bio markers of fatty liver disease 2. A recent pooled analysis of randomized controlled
      trials that compared canagliflozin to either placebo or sitagliptin showed significant
      reductions in ALT in the canagliflozin cohorts, which were fully explained by HbA1c and body
      weight reductions 3. As well, a study that compared ALT change in patients initiating
      liraglutide found significant reductions in ALT, which was strongly correlated to reduction
      in body weight 4. However, the effect of different antidiabetic agents on bio markers of
      fatty liver disease is not well characterized.

      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the change in ALT in patients with T2DM
      initiating SGLT2 inhibitors, liraglutide, or sitagliptin, compared to a control group of
      patients who did not initiate a new antihyperglycemic therapy. The hypothesis is that
      patients using SGLT2i will achieve a greater reduction in ALT compared to the control group.

        This study will include patients with T2DM who are patients at LMC Diabetes &amp;
        Endocrinology. Patients will be included in the treatment cohorts if they initiated
        canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, liraglutide or sitagliptin, between January 2011 and December
        2015, and did not discontinue the treatment prior to 6 weeks of being on the medication.
        The control group will include patients with T2DM who are patients at LMC Diabetes &amp;
        Endocrinology, and who did not initiate any new diabetes treatment between June 2014 and
        June 2015.
