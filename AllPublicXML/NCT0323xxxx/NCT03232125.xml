  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intraperitoneal insufflation of carbon dioxide may affect the sympathetic activity that leads
      to changes in ventricular re-polarization. This in turn can result in changes of heart
      rate-corrected QT (QTc) interval. Ramosetron is a 5-hydroxytryptamine three receptor
      antagonist and widely used anti-emetics. However, QTc interval prolongation has been observed
      in a number of patients after administration of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. The aim of this
      study is to evaluate the effects of ramosetron on QTc interval and possible cardiovascular
      adverse effects during robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy with steep Trendelenburg
      position.

      Intraperitoneal insufflation of carbon dioxide may affect the sympathetic activity that leads

      study is to evaluate the effects of ramosetron on QTc interval and possible cardiovascular
      adverse effects during robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy with steep Trendelenburg
      position. Fifty-six patients, aged more than 19 years, undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic
      prostatectomy will be divided into ramosetron group (n=28) and control group (n=28). Randomly
      selected patients of the ramoseton group are given a 0.3 mg of ramosetron after induction. In
      contrast, patients in the control group are given the same volume of normal saline after
      induction and given a 0.3 mg of ramosetron after measurement of QTc interval. The primary
      endpoint is the difference in maximal change of QTc interval between groups.
