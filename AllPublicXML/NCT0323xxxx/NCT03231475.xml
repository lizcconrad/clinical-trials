  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will treat patients with advanced NSCLC who have already received at least one
      course of specific anti-cancer treatment but the tumour has started to re-grow following that
      treatment. This is the first time this drug has ever been tested in patients, and so it will
      help to understand what type of side effects may occur with the drug treatment, it will
      measure the levels of drug in the body, it will also measure the anti-cancer activity. By
      using these pieces of information together the best dose of this drug to use in further
      clinical trials will be selected.
