      The purpose of this research study is to determine whether starting the drug vedolizumab
      earlier than its FDA approved use can lead to better control of UC then using older drugs
      that we have historically used to treat UC. Vedolizumab is FDA-approved to be used after
      initial Corticosteroid treatments have failed or other UC treatments have failed. We will
      study if using vedolizumab as an early treatment for your UC will allow you to get off
      corticosteroids and prevent UC from worsening and requiring surgery.

      Vedolizumab is given intravenously initially every 2 weeks and then every 8 weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Newly diagnosed active ulcerative colitis, defined as a Mayo Clinic score of 6 to 12

             from the anal verge

          -  Must have required CS for treatment of their symptoms within 2 weeks of diagnosis and

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Currently treated with either anti-TNF therapy, immunomodulators or methotrexate due
             to the severity of their condition, making them not appropriate for vedolizumab
