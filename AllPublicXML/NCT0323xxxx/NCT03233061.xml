  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many obese individuals experience difficulties in executing household activities. In this
      study, we investigate the cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) of obese vs. non-obese women, and
      the impact of obesity on cardiorespiratory functioning during daily household activities.

      Methods: On 48 sedentary female subjects will be assessed by cardiorespiratory exercise
      testing with evaluation of peak oxygen uptake (⩒O2), heart rate (HR) and maximal cycling
      power output. Next, cardiorespiratory functioning will be assessed during household
      activities such as ironing (A1), cleaning floor (A2), walking and climbing stairs (A3).

    <description>The cardiopulmonary exercise testing is performed on a cycle ergometer connected to cardiovascular and respiratory software. Subjects have a facemask, which collected respiratory and metabolic variables.An incremental exercise test is performed up to exhaustion. ⩒O2 is recorded and heart rate is averaged by an electrocardiogram system.
Cardiopulmonary exercise testing during household activities Subjects have to perform 3 everyday life household activities: ironing,cleaning floor,walking and climbing stairs.A wearable ambulatory indirect metabolic system is used with Holter mode to record cardiorespiratory measures.Subjects have to breathe through the K4b2 facemask and turbine.</description>
