  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are: a) to develop a statewide Biobank for prostate cancer among
      men of African Ancestry in Florida and; b) to examine whether smoking increases the
      aggressiveness of prostate cancer using several biological approaches.

      Investigators plan to contact African American prostate cancer patients regarding
      participation. This project has 3 main components. Eligible patients may choose to
      participate in any or all parts of the study: Questionnaires; Saliva Samples; Tumor Tissue.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project will create the first state-wide data and biospecimen bank for men of African
      ancestry with prostate cancer. The sampling strategy and size of the study population ensure
      that the cohorts is representative, enhancing validity of studies based on this resource. In
      addition, there are no data on the role of smoking in African American prostate cancer. The
      approach to share the resource with Florida prostate cancer researchers is innovative and
      possible because the four annual prostate cancer symposiums organized by Moffitt has unified
      many Florida prostate cancer researchers who are now well connected and actively
      collaborating, as evidenced by publications and funded projects among participants.

    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The study timeline is up to 3 years to collect detailed patients' data, outcome information and bio-specimens from men of African Ancestry with prostate cancer (n=6,000), diagnosed between January 2013 and December 2015.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of Impact of Smoking in Prostate Cancer Aggressiveness - All Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Rate of prostate aggressiveness according to the smoking status (never, former, current cigarette smoker, pipe/cigar smoker only) at the time of diagnosis. This smoking status can be dichotomized into current smoker and non-smoker.</description>

    <measure>Rate of Impact of Smoking in Prostate Cancer Aggressiveness - Current Smokers</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>

    <measure>Number of Participants with Genetic Markers for Smoking Aggressiveness</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Occurrence of genetic changes associated with smoking and aggressiveness in prostate tumor samples. Investigators selected ~200 mutations identified in 12 prostate-cancer related genes (AR, ETS, TP53, PTEN, APC, BRAF, BRCA2, ATM, KRAS, SPOP, ERG and EGFR) based upon preliminary study and literature search. Investigators will perform mutation detection on randomly selected 200 patients and determine their association with aggressiveness and smoking.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants with Epigenetic Markers for Smoking Aggressiveness</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Occurrence of epigenetic changes associated with smoking and aggressiveness in prostate tumor samples. A customized panel of 384 CpG sites will be profiled. 384 candidate CpG sites were selected from 149 sites including 18 multiple differentially methylated regions (DMRs) identified in the preliminary study, 235 sites from previous literatures. Investigators will determine their association with aggressiveness and smoking.</description>

    <description>Participants will be asked to complete a baseline questionnaire that asks questions about their demographic information, medical history, and smoking habits when they first enroll in the study. They will also be asked to complete a follow-up questionnaire 2 years later. The questionnaires will each take about 25 minutes to complete.</description>

    <intervention_name>Tumor Tissue</intervention_name>
    <description>Participants will be asked for permission to obtain a sample of their tumor tissue. Participants will receive a medical release form. Once they complete it and mail it back, investigators will request a small amount of tissue collected during the participant's prostate biopsy (or during their surgery, if they had surgery) from their health care provider.</description>
