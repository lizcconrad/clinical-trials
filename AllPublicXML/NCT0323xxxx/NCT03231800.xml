    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, efficacy and safety
      study in children with ADHD in a laboratory classroom setting. The study will be comprised of
      3 periods: Screening (up to 35 days) including a 3 - 5 day ADHD medication washout prior to
      Day -1; Double-blind randomized treatment with either dasotraline (2 mg/day) or placebo for
      14 days; and a final safety evaluation 7 days after last dose. Prior to the start of
      treatment (Day 1) and following the conclusion of the double-blind period (Day 15), subjects
      will undergo a full-day laboratory classroom evaluation in cohorts of up to 18 subjects. Each
      laboratory classroom day will include seven 30-minute simulated classroom sessions where
      trained observers will assess subjects using the Swanson, Kotkin, Agler, M-Flynn, and Pelham
      (SKAMP) Scale. In addition during each classroom session, a 10-minute math test (Permanent
      Product Measure of Performance [PERMP]) will be administered to evaluate sustained attention
      and effort. Seven (± 2) days after the last dose of study drug, subjects will return to the
      clinic and complete safety assessments.

      This study is designed to test the superiority of dasotraline 2 mg/day against placebo based
      on Swanson, Kotkin, Agler, M-Flynn, and Pelham Scale (SKAMP)-Combined score in pediatric
      subjects aged 6-12 years with ADHD who weigh ≤ 30 kg

             evaluation that reviews DSM-5 criteria and confirmed using the Schedule for Affective
             Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Present and Lifetime version
             (K-SADS-PL) at screening.

          5. Subject is currently either untreated for ADHD or receiving a treatment regimen of a
             stimulant medication prescribed as monotherapy (i.e., methylphenidate, mixed
             amphetamine salts, lisdexamphetamine, or dextroamphetamine) within the approved
             labeled dose range for ADHD..

          6. In the opinion of the investigator, the subject is not treatment refractory.

          7. Any subject not receiving ADHD medication at screening must display clinically

             and neurological examinations, medical history, and clinical laboratory values
             (hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis). Note: If any of the hematology, chemistry, or
             urinalysis results are not within the laboratory's reference range, then the subject
             can be included only if the investigator determines the deviations to be not
             clinically relevant.

         13. Subject is within the 3rd to 97th percentile for gender specific weight-for-age from
             the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) growth charts

             hour washout from prior ADHD medication treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject or parent/legal guardian has commitments during the study that would interfere
             with attending study visits.

          2. Subject is currently being treated for ADHD with a non-stimulant product, or has been
             treated with a non-stimulant product in the 4 weeks prior to the start of screening.

          3. Subject has failed 2 adequate courses (dose and duration) of stimulant or
             non-stimulant treatment for ADHD.

          4. Subject is considered treatment refractory, as judged by the investigator.

          5. Subject currently has a diagnosis of asthma that has required daily treatment with
             bronchodilators or nebulizer treatments in the 30 days prior to screening and/or who
             may require daily treatments with these agents over the course of the trial.
             Intermittent use of bronchodilators is not exclusionary. Subjects who have a history
             of requiring persistent asthma treatment should be discussed with the medical monitor
             prior to randomization.

          6. Subject has any clinically significant unstable medical abnormality, chronic disease,
             or a history of a clinically significant abnormality of the cardiovascular,

             a condition (eg, malabsorption, gastrointestinal surgery) that may interfere with drug
             absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion. Note: Active medical conditions
             that are minor or well-controlled are not exclusionary if they do not affect risk to
             the subject or the study results. In cases in which the impact of the condition upon
             risk to the subject or study results is unclear, the medical monitor should be

             tricyclic, etc) within 6 months prior to Day 1.

         23. Subject has ever taken any monoamine oxidase [MAO] inhibitor at any time.

         24. Subject is currently undergoing ongoing or newly initiated Cognitive Behavioral
             Therapy (CBT) for the treatment of ADHD; behavioral therapies, including school based
             interventions that were initiated less than one month prior to screening; or,
             behavioral therapy that in the opinion of the investigator would interfere with the
             subject's ability to participate for the duration of the study. School based
             interventions that have been in place for more than one month prior to screening will
             be allowed. Note: Unavoidable changes in school-based interventions that occur during
             study participation will not be exclusionary, but should be documented by the
             investigator, to the extent possible. Subjects should not be enrolled who, in the
             judgment of the investigator, are expected to start substantially different or more
             intensive course of behavioral therapy over the duration of their participation in the
             study.

         25. Subject or subject's family anticipates a move outside the geographic range of
             investigative site during the study period, or plans extended travel inconsistent with
             the recommended visit interval during study duration.

         26. Subject has history of, or current, malignancy other than non-melanomatous skin
             cancer.

         27. Subject has history of positive test for Hepatitis B surface antigen or Hepatitis C
             antibody.

         28. Subject is known to have tested positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

         29. Subject has participated in a classroom study within 6 months prior to the start of
             screening or has participated in any other clinical study with an investigational
             drug/product within 90 days prior to the start of screening or is currently
             participating in another clinical trial.

         30. Subject shows evidence of substance or alcohol use or is currently using tobacco or
             other nicotine-containing products, or has a positive urine drug screen (UDS) at
             screening. Note: Subjects with a positive UDS may be allowed to continue in the study,
             provided that the investigator determines that the positive test is as a result of
             taking medications as prescribed after consultation with the medical monitor.

         31. Subject is taking any disallowed medications for chronic treatment.

         32. Subject has previously been enrolled in a clinical trial of dasotraline (SEP-225289).

             the same laboratory classroom cohort for this study.

         36. Subject is unable to perform at the basic level of the standardized math test as
             defined in the laboratory classroom manual.
