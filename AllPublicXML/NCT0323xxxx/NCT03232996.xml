    <textblock>
      Examining the feasibility and acceptability of the computer game based rehabilitation system
      for improving balance, gait and executive function in individuals with PD. This will involve
      a pilot case series intervention study of individuals with PD will be conducted.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study will involve a case series pilot study of individuals with PD.
      Conventional therapy programs for PD population target motor and cognitive deficits in
      isolation. Recently there has been a growing interest in the application of digital media in
      rehabilitation. Exergaming and the use of cognitive games have shown good results in patients
      with Traumatic brain injury, Cerebral palsy, stroke rehabilitation and geriatric population
      for mobility limitations and dementia.

      All the 30 participants from the previous objective will be requested to take part in our
      objective 2. Objective 2 research protocol will be an 8- week (twice per week) training
      program of DT balance and DT walking exercises.

      Each session will be 45 minutes long. A basic computer game based exercise program will be
      designed for each participant depending upon their functional status. Every Participant will
      receive orientation and training about CGBRS, motion mouse and video-games. For initial
      sessions, relatively slow and large target movements will be selected for the computer games.
      Game speed, amplitude, mouse sensitivity, and difficulty will be progressed as tolerated for
      each participant.

      Participants will be asked to stand on a stationary treadmill, in front of a LED monitor
      which will be placed 1 meter away from the treadmill. The treadmill has front and side hand
      rails so is a convenient place to perform the DT balance activities. The participants will
      also be fitted with a safety harness. The participants will be asked to wear a head band
      which is instrumented with the motion sense mouse. Thus, hands-free head rotations will be
      used to interact with the computer games selected for the DT rehabilitation program. Six to
      eight computer games will be selected for each participant from a collection of over 60
      purchased from Big Fish Games (www.bigfishgames.com). The computer games involve
      goal-directed visuospatial executive cognitive activities including visual search and
      tracking of multiple targets, movements of different speeds to interact with game targets
      with varying movement precision, the presence of distracters, matching and puzzle game.

      Participants will play the computer games under the following conditions: -

        -  While standing on a fixed surface (warm -up duration for 5 minutes)

        -  While Standing on a compliant sponge pad to increase balance demands (duration - 10
           minutes)

        -  While walking on a treadmill at a predetermined comfortable speed for an interval of 2-3
           minutes with 1-2 min rest periods (duration of the treadmill walking component will be
           20 minutes.

    <time_frame>Change from baseline Dynamic standing balance at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The following tasks will be performed for 45 seconds while standing on a sponge pad; a) eyes open (EO), i.e. single task balance condition, and then b) performing the computer gaming activities (i.e. DT balance conditions). A force sensor array (FSA) pressure-sensing mat (Vista Medical Ltd., Manitoba, Canada) will be used to record vertical foot pressures and thus to compute center of foot pressure (COP) migration.</description>

    <measure>Gait Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline spatio-temporal gait variables at 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The participant will first be asked to walk on the treadmill at his/her comfortable speed for 3 minutes to acclimate with the treadmill prior to testing. After a rest period of 2 minutes they will be asked to walk for 1 minute under the following conditions; a) walk only or single task condition and b) walking while performing the computer gaming tasks (DT walking condition). The treadmill instrumented with a pressure mat (Vista Medical, CA) will be used to record vertical foot contact forces and used to compute spatial-temporal gait variables. Participants walked for 5 minutes to acclimate to the treadmill prior to testing.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline &quot;Final UPDRS scores&quot; at 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>UPDRS is the most common rating scale used to observe and quantify disability and impairment in Parkinson's Disease. This is a 5 point rating scale (from 0 to 5) which is assessed in an ordinal level. 0 describes absence or least severity while 4 describes the highest severity. Increase in severity is denoted with higher scores. Scores will be computed for behavior (part 1), Activites of Daily living (part 2) and Motor (part 3) sections. Scores of all the three section will be added and computed as the &quot;Final UPDRS scores&quot; for our clinical trial</description>

    <description>All the participants will take part in an 8 week (twice per week) computer game based exercise program for dual task balance and dual task walk training. Participants will be standing in front of LED monitor. They will be asked to wear a head band which will be instrumented with motion sense mouse. Thus, hands-free head rotations will be used to interact with the computer games selected for the DT rehabilitation program. Participants will play few interactive computer games during - Normal standing (fixed surface), Standing on a compliant sponge pad and then while walking on a treadmill.</description>
