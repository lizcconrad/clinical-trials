  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Today, endoscopic enucleation of the prostate (EEP) has been recognized a method of choice
      for treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) of any size, including large-sized glands
      (&gt;80 cc). The goal of our study was to compare perioperative efficacy, functional outcomes
      and safety of different techniques of endoscopic enucleation of the prostate (monopolar
      enucleation, holmium laser enucleation, thulium laser enucleation) in a single center.

    <textblock>
      HoLEP and ThuLEP or EEP have been approved by the current guidelines of the European
      Association of Urology for use in men with substantially enlarged prostates (&gt;80 ml) as
      first-line therapy [1]. This type of operation can be performed by means of several sources
      of energy.

      To our knowledge, there were no studies comparing efficacy and complications of these three
      treatment modalities.

      In this study the investigators have evaluated efficacy of Thulium-fiber laser enucleation
      (120 W thulium fiber laser Urolase, IPG IRE-POLUS, Russia with wavelength of 1940 nm) and
      monopolar enuclation in comparision with HoLEP (VersaPulse Powersuite 100, Lumenis,
      USA/Israel) in reduction of LUTS secondary to BPH in a prospective randomized trial.

      All peri-operative parameters, urinary flow parameters, prostate size changes, erectile
      function and complications associated with the procedures were compared.

    <description>A high-power (120 W) thulium fiber laser (Urolase, IPG IRE-POLUS, Russia) with wavelength of 1940 nm was used for thulium laser enucleation. In our study, we used a 600-μm laser fiber. The operations were performed at power of 60 W energy of 1.5 J and repetition rate of 40 Hz. Laser power in the verumontanum zone was decreased to 30 W and repetition rate to 20 Hz.</description>
