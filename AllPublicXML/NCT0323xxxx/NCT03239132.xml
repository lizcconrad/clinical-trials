  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish the feasibility and acceptability of a breath-based
      meditation in stroke survivors with post-stroke depression (PSD) and their informal
      caregivers, as well as to examine the effects of the breath-based meditation. The hypothesis
      is that the breath-based meditation will lead to decreases in the severity of symptoms of
      PSD, post-stroke anxiety (PSA), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and decreases in
      plasma IL-1 pro-inflammatory cytokines post-intervention in stroke survivors with PSD and
      their informal caregivers.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Stroke survivors will be included if they speak English, can provide written informed
             consent, have a history of ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic, or transient ischemic attack
             within the past 8 weeks, have a Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D)
             total score of 16 or greater suggestive of clinically significant depressive symptoms,
             and currently live at home.

          -  Informal caregivers will be included if they are speak English, can provide written
             informed consent, and self-identify as a first-time informal caregiver of a stroke
             survivor. -

          -  To reflect standard practice, stroke survivors and their informal caregivers will be
             eligible to participate in the study regardless of whether they are currently
             receiving anti-depressant medications; however, the dose must have been stable for at
             least one month prior to recruitment into the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Stroke survivors will be excluded if they currently reside outside of the home (e.g.,
             rehabilitation center).

          -  Stroke survivors and their informal caregivers will be excluded if they have severe
             cognitive impairment (Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) cutoff score of 20), active
             psychosis, or bipolar disorder; if they currently abuse substances; or if they are
             acutely suicidal. Those currently receiving formal psychotherapy or currently engaging
             in self-identified meditation practices will also be excluded.
