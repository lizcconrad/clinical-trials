  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study of neoadjuvant 'immunoradiation' (durvalumab or durvalumab plus
      tremelimumab) administered every 4 weeks for 2 doses, concurrently with standard thoracic
      radiation (RT) (45Gy in 25 fractions), with one dose of immunotherapy alone delivered in the
      pre-surgical window, prior to surgical resection, for patients with stage IIIA NSCLC that is
      deemed resectable with a lobectomy by a thoracic surgeon. If preliminary safety of the
      durvalumab/thoracic RT combination is established, a second cohort investigating the
      combination of durvalumab/tremelimumab/thoracic RT prior to surgical resection will be
      opened. After surgical resection, patients may receive standard adjuvant chemotherapy, as
      deemed appropriate by the treating investigator.

          -  Known allergy or hypersensitivity to IP or any excipient

          -  Uncontrolled psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements or compromise the ability of the subject to give written consent

             of study treatment or interpretation of patient safety or study results.
