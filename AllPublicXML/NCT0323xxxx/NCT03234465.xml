  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of topically
      administered AG013 compared to placebo for reducing Oral Mucositis (OM) in patients
      undergoing chemoradiation for the treatment of head and neck cancer, as measured by the
      duration, time to development, and overall incidence of OM during the active treatment phase,
      beginning from the start of chemoradiation therapy (CRT) until 2 weeks following its
      completion.

      The effect of AG013 on patient-reported symptoms and analgesic use during the active
      treatment phase, and on the cumulative radiation dose administered before the onset of OM
      will also be evaluated, as will biomarkers and, in a subset of subjects, the PK
      (pharmacokinetic) profile of AG013.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-arm, multi-center trial in which
      subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either placebo or AG013. AG013 is a
      mouth rinse formulation of Lactococcus lactis strain sAGX0085, deficient in the gene coding
      for thymidylate synthase and producing human TFF1 (Trefoil Factor 1).

      Approximately 200 subjects will be enrolled in the study. To protect subjects from
      unanticipated safety risks, enrollment and treatment in the double-blind study will continue
      until 10 subjects on AG013 have been recruited. The Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will
      review safety data after these 10 subjects on AG013 have completed study treatment. If there
      are no safety signals identified, the study will continue to recruit the planned number of
      subjects.

      There are 4 study periods as described below: screening, active treatment, short term
      follow-up and long term follow-up. The screening phase will be no longer than 4 weeks. The
      active treatment phase will be between 7 and 9 weeks depending on the subject's prescribed
      CRT (chemoradiation therapy) plan. The short term follow-up phase will be 4 weeks in
      duration. The long term follow-up will continue until 12 months post CRT. Oral mucositis (OM)
      assessments will begin at the start of CRT and continue until the subject has completed short
      term follow-up or until the OM resolves (as defined by a WHO (World Health Organization)
      score of ≤ 1), whichever comes first. Long term follow-up will continue for 12 months to
      assure that AG013 does not adversely impact the tumor response to anti-neoplastic therapy.

    <intervention_name>AG013</intervention_name>
    <description>AG013 is made up of genetically modified (GM) bacteria called Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis). Wild type L. lactis are commonly used to produce dairy products including cheeses and milk. To make AG013, the DNA of L. lactis has been changed in the laboratory to secrete a protein called human Trefoil Factor 1 (hTFF1). hTFF1 is normally secreted in saliva and intestines. Trefoil factors have been shown to be important in protecting and healing mucosal tissues, such as the tissue in the mouth, when these tissues are damaged by cancer therapies such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy.</description>
