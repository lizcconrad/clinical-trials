    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the patient preference for treatment with once-weekly
      dosing of DPP-4 inhibitor trelagliptin versus once-daily dosing of DPP-4 inhibitor alogliptin
      among the participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus who are being treated with once-daily
      dosing of DPP-4 inhibitor.

      The drugs being tested in this study are called Trelagliptin and Alogliptin. This study will
      look at the patient preference for treatment with Trelagliptin versus Alogliptin.

      The study will enroll approximately 60 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by
      chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups:

        -  Trelagliptin 100 mg, followed by Alogliptin 25 mg

        -  Alogliptin 25 mg, followed by Trelagliptin 100 mg All participants will be asked to take
           one tablet of Trelagliptin orally once a week or one tablet of Alogliptin orally once a
           day throughout the study period.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in this
      study is 16 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic.

    <description>Patient preference for treatment will be assessed by treatment selection rate on standardized questions. This question will be about patient preference of drug therapy for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Patients can select one choice from following 4 choices; Either once-weekly DPP-4 inhibitor or daily DPP-4 inhibitor, Once-weekly DPP-4 inhibitor, Daily DPP-4 inhibitor, Neither once-weekly DPP-4 inhibitor nor daily DPP-4 inhibitor.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Participants who have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus

          2. Participants who are being treated with any of the following DPP-4 inhibitors for at
             least 8 weeks prior to the start of treatment period (Week 0).

               -  Sitagliptin : 50 mg once daily
