  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The reason we are doing this research is to get information about the ORBERA™ Intragastric
      Balloon to learn if it is safe and if it works. We want to learn if older teenagers who are
      overweight will lose weight and if their other medical problems will get better. ORBERA™ is a
      special balloon approved by the FDA for overweight adults, and we would like to try using it
      for overweight teenagers.

      After obtaining consent and determining that participants meet the inclusion and exclusion
      criteria, participants will have baseline tests and initial visits with a physician,
      dietitian, and psychologist. Next, the ORBERA™ Intragastric Balloon (IGB) will be inserted
      into the stomach and then removed after 6 months. Participants will continue to be followed
      for 6 months after the balloon is removed. Throughout the year, participants will have
      additional tests along with ongoing visits with a physician, dietitian, and psychologist.
