      The objective of the study is to evaluate if working memory training is effective in
      improving working memory of MCI patients. Further, to evaluate if cognitive training relates
      to the function and structure of the brain.

      Introduction:

      Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a clinical condition characterized of a reduction in
      memory and/or other cognitive processes that are insufficiently severe to be diagnosed as
      dementia, but are more pronounced than the cognitive decline associated with normal aging.
      The prevalence of MCI ranges from 3% to 19% in adults older than 65 years; some of these
      individuals seem to remain stable or return to normal over time, but more than half progress
      to dementia within 5 year. Thus, MCI represents a critical window of opportunity for
      intervening and altering the trajectory of both cognitive decline and loss of functional
      independence in older adults. Impaired working memory (WM) is regarded as one of the core
      symptoms of patients with MCI. Recent studies have suggested that WM can be improved trough
      computer based WM training in early patients with alzheimer's disease and normal ageing
      population. However, there are still insufficient evidence regarding its effect on MCI.

      Objectives:

      The objective of the study is to evaluate if working memory training is effective in
      improving memory MCI patients. Further, to evaluate if cognitive training relates to the
      function and structure of the brain.

      Patients and Methods:

      The proposed study is a blinded, randomized and controlled trial that will include 120
      elderly patients with MCI from the memory clinic. The groups will be randomized to either
      intervention or waiting-list group. The intervention is computerized working memory training
      performed for 60 minutes x 4 times/week over 24 weeks. Neuropsychological assessment will be
      administered at baseline and week 4, 12 and 24 after intervention. The structural and
      functional MRI, EEG and NIRS will be performed at baseline and week 24 after intervention for
      a sub-study on the effect of cognitive training on brain structure and function.
