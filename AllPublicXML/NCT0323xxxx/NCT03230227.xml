    <textblock>
      Effective pain relief after cardiac surgery has assumed importance with the introduction of
      fast track discharge protocols that requires early weaning from mechanical ventilation.
      Inadequate pain control reduces the capacity to cough, mobility, increases the frequency of
      atelectasis, and prolongs recovery. Infiltration of local anesthetics near the surgical wound
      has shown to improve early postoperative pain in various surgical procedures.

      Magnesium is the fourth most plentiful cation in our body. It has antinociceptive effects in
      animal and human models of pain.

      Effective pain relief after cardiac surgery has assumed importance with the introduction of
      fast track discharge protocols that requires early weaning from mechanical ventilation.
      Inadequate pain control reduces the capacity to cough, mobility, increases the frequency of
      atelectasis, and prolongs recovery.

      A major cause of pain after cardiac surgery is the median sternotomy particularly on the
      first two postoperative days.

      The most often used analgesics in these patients are parenteral opioids which can lead to
      undesirable side-effects as sedation, respiratory depression, nausea, and vomiting.

      Infiltration of local anesthetics near the surgical wound has shown to improve early
      postoperative pain in various surgical procedures.

      Magnesium is the fourth most plentiful cation in our body. It has antinociceptive effects in
      animal and human models of pain.

      It has been mentioned in a systematic review that it may be worthwhile to further study the
      role of supplemental magnesium in providing perioperative analgesia, because this is a
      relatively harmless molecule, is not expensive and also because the biological basis for its
      potential antinociceptive effect is promising.

      These effects are primarily based on physiological calcium antagonism, that is
      voltage-dependent regulation of calcium influx into the cell, and noncompetitive antagonism
      of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors.

      there is a need to evaluate and compare local magnesium with bupivacaine , in comparison to
      bupivacain
