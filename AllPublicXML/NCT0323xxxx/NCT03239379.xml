  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single-center, randomized, single‑blind, placebo (PBO)-controlled,
      multiple-dose study to characterize the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of IV BNZ-1
      administered to healthy adult subjects once weekly (QW) for 4 doses or once every other week
      (QOW) for 3 doses. Five cohorts of 6 subjects randomized 5 BNZ-1:1 PBO are planned to be
      enrolled in the trial. Participants will be followed for 4 weeks after the last dose for
      safety monitoring, and collection of PK and PD samples.

          3. Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥19 and &lt;35 kg/m2.

          4. Healthy as determined by medical evaluation including medical history, physical
             examination, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs (pulse rate, blood pressure,
             respiratory rate), and ECG.

          5. Willing and able to consent and participate in the study.

          6. Subject agrees not to receive any other investigational product or therapy while
             participating in this study.

          7. Agrees to use adequate effective birth control methods prior to, during and for 30
             days after the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinically relevant hepatic, neurological, pulmonary, ophthalmological, endocrine,
             renal, or other major systemic disease making implementation of the protocol or
             interpretation of the study results difficult, or that would put the subject at risk
             by participating in the study in the opinion of the Investigator.

          2. History of cancer (except basal cell and in situ squamous cell carcinomas of the skin
             that have been excised and resolved).

          4. Known active bacterial, viral, fungal, mycobacterial infection, or other infection
             (including tuberculosis [TB] or atypical mycobacterial disease [but excluding fungal
             infection of nail beds, minor upper respiratory tract infection, and minor skin
             conditions]), or any major episode of infection that required hospitalization or
             treatment with IV antibiotics within 30 days of screening or oral antibiotics within
             14 days prior to screening.

          5. Subject has received other investigational products or therapy in the past 30 days
             prior to study drug administration.

          6. Serologic evidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Hepatitis B, or Hepatitis C.

          7. Subject has received an immunization within 14 days prior to study drug
             administration.

          8. History of alcohol or drug abuse within 1 year prior to screening.

          9. Subject requires the ongoing use of prescription medication other than oral
             contraceptives.
