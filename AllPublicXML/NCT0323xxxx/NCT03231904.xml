  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2010, Simamura et al have demonstrated in a rat model that one of the pro-inflammatory
      cytokine belonging to the Interleukin-6 family cytokines, LIF, is required for the
      proliferation of neuronal progenitor cells in the cerebrum. They have shown that maternal LIF
      induces ACTH from the placenta, which in turn stimulates fetal nucleated red blood cells to
      secrete LIF, leading finally to neurogenesis in the fetus As demonstrated recently in a mouse
      model, maternal inflammation suppress the physiological maternal— fetal LIF—ACTH—LIF signal,
      result in reduction of ACTH production from placenta, which lead to a reduction in LIF
      concentration in fetal Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and impaired proliferation of the neural
      stem/ progenitor cells and poor development of the fetal brain.

      In the current study, the investigators will take fetal and maternal blood samples of fetuses
      undergoing termination of pregnancy (TOP) . Maternal samples will be acquired with the
      routine blood samples before performance of TOP , fetal blood samples will be acquired from
      the umbilical vessel after the termination has been completed , the blood samples will be
      analyzed for levels of LIF and ACTH and checked according to termination pregnancy week,
      Patients electronic files will be checked for relevant demographic and obstetric information.
