  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of thread-embedding
      acupuncture for treatment of lumbar herniated intervertebral disc (L-HIVD) by assessing pain,
      function, and quality of life.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Seventy patient between the ages of 19 and 70 with L-HIVD will be recruited by eligibility
      criteria and randomly allocated to the thread-embedding acupuncture (TEA) group and sham
      thread-embedding acupuncture (STEA) group. Both groups will receive treatment on predefined
      23 acupoints once a week for 8 weeks, and needle with thread removed will be used in STEA
      group instead of normal TEA. 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS) for low back pain will be
      assessed as a primary outcome. Also, 100mm VAS for radiating pain, Oswestry disability index
      (ODI), Rolland Morris disability questionnaire (RMDQ), EQ-5D-5L and global perceived effect
      (GPE) will be measured as secondary outcomes. All the outcomes will be assessed at baseline,
      4 weeks after screening, treatment end (8 weeks, primary end point) and follow-up sessions
      (12 and 16 weeks).
