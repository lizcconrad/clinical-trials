  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, open label, non-randomized, single centre safety and feasibility study.
      Patients with no expected airway difficulties scheduled for elective surgery including
      tracheal intubation and general anesthesia procedures will be enrolled into the study.
      Following standard induction of anesthesia, the IRRIS will be attached to the patient's neck
      skin just beneath the laryngeal prominence (Adam's apple) and the intubation will be
      performed by using a video-laryngoscope in a standardized fashion. The IRRIS device emits a
      light that penetrates through the skin into the airway and that is visible on the
      video-laryngoscope display. This light highlights the right pathway for the tracheal tube and
      facilitates the visual recognition and identification of the laryngeal inlet. In case of
      problems identified during the induction period such as an unexpected difficult intubation
      situation and the IRRIS does not provide the expected facilitation of intubation, the local
      &quot;unexpected difficult airway&quot; protocol goes into effect.

      The IRRIS (InfraRed - Red Intubation System) is an external disposable light source in a
      patch that is intended for single use while it is placed externally on the patient's neck
      before tracheal intubation for the duration of tracheal intubation. The device transmits
      near-infrared light through the skin towards the trachea. During laryngoscopy, the emitted
      light becomes visible only from the trachea and not from the oesophagus. Video assisted
      devices which already are in the market known as video-laryngoscopes and fiberoptic
      bronchoscopes are capable of detecting and visualizing the emitted light so that the
      anaesthesiologist who is performing the intubation is aided to direct and insert the
      endotracheal tube into the trachea by following the light on the screen of his video-assisted
      endoscope. The objective of this study is to assess the safety, and performance of IRRIS in
      patients who undergo tracheal intubation in terms of skin integrity, duration of intubation,
      number of attempts, success of intubation and usability aspects in terms of subjective
      physician grading of the IRRIS.
