  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The subjects of this study are the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with
      chronic II respiratory failure. The participants will be divided into two groups: The
      Portable Home Noninvasive Ventilator treatment group and the routine home oxygen inhalation
      treatment group. All subjects will be given a stable COPD regimen and conventional oxygen
      therapy ,but the portable home noninvasive ventilator treatment group will need to wear a
      portable non-invasive ventilator. Objective evaluation indexes were established during the
      routine treatment, and two groups of subjects will be followed up for one year. Finally, the
      clinical data of all subjects will be analyzed，and then the practicability of portable
      wearable household noninvasive ventilator will be verified.The researchers will also build a
      remote breathing data-monitoring platform based on mobile internet,and a community home
      demonstration application point.
