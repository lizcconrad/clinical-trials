    <textblock>
      Existing IV iron complexes differ in relation to the compounds capability to induce
      unintended hypophosphatemia to a degree defined as medical significant.

      This trial is designed evaluate the effect of IV iron isomaltoside compared to IV ferric
      carboxymaltose on phosphate in subjects with IDA
