  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As part of the development of the Engaging Microenterprise for Resource Generation and Health
      Empowerment (EMERGE) Project, the study team will conduct a single-group study to examine the
      feasibility of assessing economic and sexual risk behaviors using text messages. The team
      will enroll approximately 20 young adults, aged 18 to 24, who are African-American, homeless,
      out-of-school, and un/under-employed. Participants will complete a text-messaged survey each
      week for 5 weeks. The study team will collect information about the number of participants
      who respond to the weekly survey, the number of questions to which they respond in each
      survey, and the number of hours from sending a survey to participants to receiving their
      response. As an exploratory aim, participants will also receive 3 informational text messages
      each week for 5 weeks on HIV prevention and economic empowerment. The study team will obtain
      qualitative feedback from participants regarding text messages they most and least liked. The
      survey is not designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the text message intervention.
