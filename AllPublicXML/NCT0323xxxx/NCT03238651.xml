  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) and/or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of TAK-659 when administered in East Asian
      participants with NHL who do not have an effective standard treatment available and to
      characterize the plasma and urine pharmacokinetic (PK) of TAK-659 in East Asian participants
      with NHL.

      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-659. TAK-659 is being tested to treat
      people who have NHL or people who have relapsed and/or refractory DLBCL. This study will
      assess the safety, tolerability, PK, and preliminary efficacy of single-agent TAK-659 in East
      Asian participants with NHL including DLBCL.

      The study will enroll approximately 27 to 38 participants, including at least 6 Japanese at
      RP2D dose level. Participants will be assigned to one of the following treatment groups:

      Dose Escalation Part: TAK-659 DLBCL Expansion Part: TAK-659 RP2D

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Japan and Republic of Korea. The maximum
      duration of participation in dose escalation part of the study is up to 12 months, unless in
      the opinion of the investigator and sponsor the participant would derive benefit from
      continued therapy beyond 12 months. In DLBCL expansion part, participants who stop treatment
      for any other reason other than PD will continue to have PFS follow-up at the site every 2
      months from the last dose of study drug up to 6 months or until PD. Participants will be
      followed 28 days after last dose of study drug or until the start of subsequent
      antineoplastic therapy, whichever occurs first, for a follow up assessment.

                  paraffin-embedded tumor block or appropriately stained slides from a fresh biopsy
                  is required.

               3. Relapsed and/or refractory to &gt;=2 but no more than 4 prior lines of chemotherapy
                  based on standard of care with certain requirements for prior therapy.

                  (defined as CR or PR), documented, investigator-assessed relapse or progression
                  after the last treatment is required.

          3. Measurable disease per IWG 2007 criteria.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma; active brain or leptomeningeal metastases as
             indicated by positive cytology from lumbar puncture or computed tomography
             (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) by local assessment.

          2. Systemic anticancer treatment (including investigational agents) less than 3 weeks

             including unconjugated antibody, antibody-drug conjugate, and bi-specific T-cell
             engager agent; &lt;=8 weeks for cell-based therapy or anti-tumor vaccine).

          3. Radiotherapy less than (&lt;) 3 weeks before the first dose of study treatment. If prior
             radiotherapy occurred &lt;4 to 6 weeks before the study start, as radiated lesions cannot
             be reliably assessed by fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography
             (PET), nonradiated target lesions are required for eligibility.

          4. Prior autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) within 6 months or prior ASCT at any time
             without full hematopoietic recovery before Cycle 1 Day 1, or allogeneic stem cell
             transplant at any time.

          5. Any clinically significant comorbidities, such as uncontrolled pulmonary disease
             (example, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with hypoxemia, interstitial
             lung disease, radiation induced lung injury), known impaired cardiac function or
             clinically significant cardiac disease, active CNS disease, or any other condition
             that could, in the opinion of the investigator, compromise the participant's safety
             and participation in the study per protocol.

          6. Known gastrointestinal (GI) disease or GI procedure that could interfere with the oral
             absorption or tolerance of TAK-659.

          7. Use or consumption of any of the following substances:

        Received medications, supplements, or food/beverages that are P-glycoprotein (P-gp)
        inhibitors or inducers or strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A inhibitors or inducers within a
        certain time frame prior to the first dose of study drug. Depending on the substance, the
        washout period for P-gp inhibitors or inducers or strong CYP3A inhibitors or inducers will
        be either 7 days or 5 times the half-life (half-life is related to the time required for
        elimination from the body). The washout period for grapefruit containing food or beverages
        is 5 days.
