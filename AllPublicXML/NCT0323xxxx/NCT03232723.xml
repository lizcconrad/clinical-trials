  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of the
      Magnetoencephalography (MEG) instrument to record electrical activity from parts of the body
      other than the brain. This study will examine if electrical activity from parts of the body,
      other than the brain, can be imaged by the MEG instrument. Finding will contribute to studies
      of pain, since abnormal electrical activity in skeletal muscle is the basis of pain, which
      can be severe, yet there is no non-invasive way to image this abnormal activity. This is
      particularly relevant to deep muscle pain and back pain.

    <description>&quot;Whole-Cortex MEG System&quot; non- invasively measures the magnetoencephalographic (MEG) signals (and, optionally, electroencephalographic EEG signals) produced by electrically active tissue of the brain. These signals are recorded by a computerized data acquisition system, displayed, and may then be interpreted by trained physicians to help localize these active areas. The location may then be correlated with anatomical information of the brain. MEG is routinely used to identify the locations of visual, auditory, somatosensory, and motor cortex in the brain.</description>
