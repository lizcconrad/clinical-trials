  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There has been an increasing awareness about the need to practice some physical activity,
      including several objectives, mainly as a preventive character. From this perspective, notice
      the use of the Pilates method as an instrument of therapeutic exercise for the protection and
      promotion of health. However, despite being popularly performed, there is still no scientific
      evidence on the standardization of the use of the method and its progression to an adequate
      prescription of physical training. The objective is monitoring the progression of loads of a
      12-week training among the basic, intermediate and advanced levels of the Pilates method
      through heart rate (HR), subjective exertion perception (PSE) and heart rate variability
      (HRV). In addition, analyzing the effect of the method on cardiorespiratory and autonomic
      parameters. 40 healthy men aged 18-36 will receive Pilates training for 12 weeks. After the
      initial assessment and familiarization with the method, the training period will begin
      totalizing 36 sessions for three months, where each class lasts approximately 1 hour. During
      the three months, the participants must pass through the three levels of training: Basic,
      Intermediate and Advanced. During each session, the investigators will initially collect:
      psychological questionnaire, visual analogue pain scale (VAS), and cardiorespiratory
      parameters (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, HR, respiratory rate and partial oxygen
      saturation). Throughout the session a heart rate meter will be positioned on the chest of the
      participant to capture HR, which will occur every five minutes together with the PSE
      illustrated in the model proposed by Borg. At the end of each session, the cardiorespiratory
      parameters will be collected again. In addition, cardiorespiratory parameters and HRV will be
      analyzed at baseline and after three months of training. In the case of HRV analysis, linear
      methods in the time and frequency domain will be verified. For the statistical analysis of
      the cardiorespiratory and autonomic parameters in the pre and post training moments will be
      used paired t test for normal data or Wilcoxon test for non normal data. For the analysis of
      the training load will be used the correlation of Pearson or Sperman according to normality.
      The definition of cutoff points for the HRV and PSE indices will be obtained by the ROC
      curve.
