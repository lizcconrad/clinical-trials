      Icaritin is a newly discovered small molecular compound which is high selective ERa36
      modulators ,the preclinical PK&amp;PD and toxicity studies showed it can inhibit the growth of
      HCC cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo, combining clinical data perhaps it will be a very
      promising new drug to treat hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by targeting this nongenomic
      pathway. Shenogen decided to further investigate the efficacy and safety of Icaritin and to
      explore potential gene targets for treating HCC.

      The results of phase I study showed Icaritin has good safety and tolerance. The biological
      availability of Icaritin after meal is high and the half-life is relatively short.

      The phase Ib study enrolled 28 subjects. Among the 18 HCC subjects, 12 subjects received
      treatment in the oral administration group with 600 mg once, twice per day, after meal 30
      minutes, 6 subjects received treatment in the oral administration group with 800 mg once,
      twice per day, after meal 30 minutes. The results showed that in the 600mg group there are 12
      HCC patients whose therapeutic efficacy is evaluable now, one case of PR (10%), 5 cases of SD
      (50%) and 4 cases of PD (40%) were observed.Safety data showed that totally 24 AEs are
      probably related to investigational drug. Among them, 19 AEs are grade I, 5 AEs are grade II,
      no grade III or above AE.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Only patients who meet all the following criteria are included in the study:

               1. Age≥18years, no gender restriction;

               2. Advanced or metastatic HCC patients in strict compliance with the &quot;Primary Liver
                  Cancer Diagnosis and Treatment Standard&quot; (2011 Edition) issued by the National
                  Health and Family Planning Commission, clinical diagnostic criteria and/or
                  diagnosed by pathology /cytology, patients who fail to undergo liver surgery
                  and/or other local treatment (ablation or hepatic artery intervention), or
                  patients who have recurrence and progression after surgery and/or other local
                  treatment;

               3. Not previously accepted first-line system therapy (systemic chemotherapy,
                  molecular targeting, immunotherapy and research medication, etc.) for advanced or
                  metastatic HCC, including but not limited to systematic chemotherapy with
                  oxaliplatin, sorafenib, PD-1/PD-L1 antibody, Icaritin and cinobufotalin, etc.;

               4. Liver surgery was performed more than 3 months ago, ablation or interventional
                  treatment of hepatic artery was performed more than 4 weeks ago, and the adverse
                  reactions returned to normal; After surgery or other local treatment, if patients
                  have gone beyond the norm for systemic adjuvant chemotherapy, it will need more
                  than 6 months after the chemotherapy, and disease progression and / or metastasis
                  have occurred;

               5. For patients who are not suitable for first-line treatment of advanced HCC which
                  is recommended in &quot;Primary Liver Cancer Diagnosis and Treatment Standard.&quot; issued
                  by the National Health and Family Planning Commission, it's mainly due to partial
                  blood test indicators (See the relaxed scope in 11th inclusion criteria ) or
                  other indicators (Including mild ascites and so on) which are not suitable for
                  the existing first-line standard treatment; Or in particular cases, the patients
                  insist on refusing to accept the existing first-line standard treatment(For
                  example, patients feel that their physical condition is weak and / or economic
                  constraints, which must be strictly mastered and controlled);

                  as ablation or hepatic artery interventional therapy should be detected by
