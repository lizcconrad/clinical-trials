  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to collect data on the use of the Rhythmia HDx mapping system
      running commercially available Software Version 2.0 or any future commercially available
      Software Version with DirectSense technology and the IntellaMap OrionTM mapping catheter in
      patients indicated for ablation treatment for de-novo Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation (PAF).
      The study will collect specific information to characterize the DirectSense technology in
      subjects undergoing catheter-based endocardial mapping and ablation for de-novo PAF using a
      commercial Rhythmia HDx mapping system. The clinical local impedance data will be used in
      order to generate usage guidance on the DirectSense local impedance feature in the management
      of de-novo PAF cases requiring Pulmonary Vein Isolation (PVI) and in order to further develop
      a future lesion indexing feature.

    <description>Subjects will undergo ablation treatment of the pulmonary veins with the Rhythmia HDx mapping system with DirectSense technology. Subjects indicated for ablation treatment of de-novo PAF will be selected based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria and if deemed to be eligible for participation, will be asked to sign the Informed Consent Form.
For all enrolled subjects who undergo the ablation procedure, the subjects will be treated with the commercial Rhythmia HDx System with commercially available Software Version 2.0 with DirectSense technology (or any commercially available updates that are released during the course of the study); the IntellaMap Orion mapping catheter and the IntellaNav MiFi OI ablation catheter.</description>
