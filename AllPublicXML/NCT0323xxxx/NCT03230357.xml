  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center clinical study, 3000 cases, 25 centers in the country involved,
      carry out the guidance of EDUG PICC standardized operation at the same period. Each center
      assists to use app to collect research data.The experimental data will be collected,
      processed and analyzed by the sponsor and the researchers, and the clinical effect of EDUG
      will be evaluated according to the results (like the rate of once in place, the number of
      adjustment times before X-ray, the length of time during the whole catheter placement, the
      ectopic incidence during PICC first implantation and so on, the special content can be seen
      in the next indicator section)
