    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of dapivirine gel (0.05%)
      administered rectally to HIV-1 seronegative adults.

      Participants will be randomized to receive a single dose of either rectally administered
      dapivirine gel (0.05%) or placebo gel at study entry (Day 0). Following a minimum 2-week
      washout period, participants or study staff will administer daily rectal doses of the
      assigned gel for 7 consecutive days under direct observation in the clinic.

      Participants will be in the study for approximately 40 days, and they will attend 16 study
      visits. Study visits may include behavioral assessments, physical examinations, blood and
      urine collection, and pelvic and anorectal sample collection. Some visits will include
      intensive PK sampling. Study staff will contact participants 1 week after Visit 16 for
      follow-up safety monitoring.

        Females who meet any of the following additional criteria will be excluded from the study:

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding at either Screening or Enrollment or intends to become
             pregnant or start breastfeeding during study participation. Note: A documented

          -  Last pregnancy outcome 90 days or less prior to Screening

          -  Has had a hysterectomy

             in Microbicide Studies [Addendum 1, Dated November 2007]. Note: Cervical friability
             bleeding associated with speculum insertion and/or specimen collection judged to be
             within the range of normal according to the clinical judgment of the IoR/designee is
             considered expected non-menstrual bleeding and is not exclusionary.
