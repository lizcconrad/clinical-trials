  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gaps in delivery of gender-sensitive comprehensive care have resulted in disparities in
      quality and patient experience among women seen in VA. VA policy action providing guidance on
      delivery of comprehensive healthcare services for women Veterans was disseminated nationally
      in 2010, followed by annual assessments and sites visits evaluating local VA efforts. While
      substantial inroads have been made, policy implementation, even when leveraged by field-based
      women's health leaders, has not been uniformly successful in achieving delivery of
      comprehensive care by designated providers in gender-sensitive care environments that ensure
      women's privacy, dignity and safety, all tenets of the original guidance and the updated VHA
      Directive (2017).

      In collaboration with VA Women's Health Services (WHS), VA researchers developed a series of
      studies to better understand and help improve comprehensive care implementation through the
      Women Veterans' Healthcare CREATE Initiative. Among these, one focused on testing an
      evidence-based quality improvement (EBQI) approach to tailoring VA's medical home model --
      Patient Aligned Care Teams or PACT -- to the needs of women Veterans, which has yielded
      significant local improvements in women Veterans' care. EBQI emphasizes a multilevel
      partnered approach to building capacity for innovation, implementation and spread of
      evidence-based practice. With its demonstrated success in the CREATE PACT study and several
      other EBQI trials, WHS adopted EBQI as a strategy to help low-performing VA facilities
      systematically improve services.

      The objectives of the WHS/QUERI Partnered Evaluation Initiative that this project represents
      are:

        1. To evaluate the barriers and facilitators to achieving delivery of comprehensive women's
           health care in the identified low-performing VA facilities;

        2. To evaluate the effectiveness of EBQI in supporting low-performing VA facilities achieve
           improved:

             1. Organizational features (e.g., level of comprehensive services available; care
                coordination arrangements; PACT features implemented; environment of care
                improvements);

             2. Provider/staff attitudes (e.g., improved gender awareness; women's health knowledge
                and practice);

           d) Quality of care and patient experiences among women Veteran patients using secondary
           data; and,

        3. To evaluate contextual factors, local implementation processes, and organizational
           changes in the participating facilities over time.

      Results of the evaluation will be used to provide feedback to stakeholders, including women
      Veterans, at the local, network and national levels, while also being used to continuously
      refine EBQI implementation processes. The evaluation will also help inform optimal strategies
      for ongoing improvements in women Veterans' care in the 24 participating VA facilities, other
      VA facilities and for other improvement initiatives in this and other program offices.

    <description>Multilevel research-clinical partnership approach to supporting local strategic planning, priority setting, skill building and engagement in addressing targeted healthcare delivery problems. Launched at participating VA facilities through advance key stakeholder interviews, in-person site visits, data review (e.g., structure and environment of care, gender disparities in quality and patient experience), QI education/training, technical support (e.g., QI project and measures development), additional formative feedback from the evaluation (e.g., provider/survey measure summaries), external and internal practice facilitation, and across-EBQI site collaboration calls. Local leadership, EBQI champions and QI teams develop and implement innovation projects aimed at improving prioritized quality targets related to women Veterans' health and healthcare needs as well as facility-level structural changes needed to improve compliance with VA guidelines.</description>
