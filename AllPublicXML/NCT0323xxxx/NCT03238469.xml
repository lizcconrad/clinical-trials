  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With microwave ablation (MWA), using the heat generated from electromagnetic waves in the
      microwave energy spectrum, hair follicles and apocrine glands in the (hypo)dermis are ablated
      through thermolysis. MWA was recently approved for the treatment of axillary hyperhidrosis
      (miraDry) and removal of axillary hair (miraSmooth). By permanent removal of hairs and sweat
      glands, the investigators hypothesize a beneficial and long-term sustainable preventive
      effect of MWA in HS patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease of the hair follicle,
      and is predominantly located in the axillary, inguinal and anogenital regions. Current
      treatment options for HS include systemic oral antibiotics, anti-TNFα, and surgery, which are
      used to treat the consequences rather than treating the primary pathogenesis of HS. With
      microwave ablation (MWA), using the heat generated from electromagnetic waves in the
      microwave energy spectrum, hair follicles, eccrine and apocrine glands in the (hypo)dermis
      are ablated through thermolysis. MWA was recently approved for the treatment of axillary
      hyperhidrosis (miraDry) and removal of axillary hair (miraSmooth). By permanent removal of
      hairs and sweat glands, the investigators hypothesize a beneficial and long-term sustainable
      preventive effect of MWA in HS patients.
