  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endocrine disruptors are known as a cancer cause. On pregnant women, it can induce major
      foetal pathology and impact growth.

      Among those molecules, bisphenol-A (BPA) is a plasticizer that can be found on cans and
      water.

      Through a prevention program, the investigators tried to warned pregnant women on endocrine
      disruptors exposition risks. The goal here is to assess the effectiveness of this program on
      their fresh products consumption.
