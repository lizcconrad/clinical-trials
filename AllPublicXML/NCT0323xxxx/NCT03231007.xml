  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a multicentre evaluation of maternity care delivered through the Saving Babies'
      Lives care bundle using both quantitative and qualitative methodologies. The study will be
      conducted in twenty NHS Hospital Trusts from six NHS Strategic Clinical Networks totalling
      approximately 100,000 births. It involves participation by both service users and care
      providers.

      To determine the impact of the care bundle on pregnancy outcomes, birth data and other
      clinical measures will be extracted from maternity databases and case-note audit from before
      and after implementation. Additionally, this study will employ questionnaires with
      organisational leads and review clinical guidelines to assess how resources, leadership and
      governance may affect implementation in diverse hospital settings. The cost of implementing
      the care bundle, and the cost per stillbirth avoided, will also be estimated as part of a
      health economic analysis. The views and experiences of service users and service providers
      towards maternity care in relation to the care bundle will be also be sought using
      questionnaires.

      This study will provide practice-based evidence to advance knowledge about the processes that
      underpin successful implementation of the care bundle so that it can be further developed and
      refined. This has the potential to translate into substantial improvements in the rate of
      late stillbirth in the UK should the care bundle be proved effective.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Reducing stillbirth and early neonatal death is a national priority. Best practice and key
      evidence indicates this is potentially achievable through application of four key
      interventions within routine maternity care delivered as NHS England's Saving Babies' Lives
      care bundle. However, adoption of the care bundle by UK maternity services is still in its
      infancy and there is significant variation in the degree of implementation between and within
      units. The effectiveness of the care bundle, when implemented as a package, in reducing
      stillbirth and service delivery has not yet been evaluated. This study aims to evaluate the
      impact of implementing the care bundle on UK maternity services and perinatal outcomes.
