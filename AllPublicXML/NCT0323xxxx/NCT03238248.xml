  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the treatment combination of pevonedistat and azacitidine in the
      setting of DNA methyltransferase inhibitor(s) failure in patients with relapsed/refractory
      myelodysplastic syndrome or myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm.

      Primary Objective:

      To compare survival of patients treated with a combination of pevonedistat and azacitidine
      after failure of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) to historical survival for patients
      with relapsed/refractory myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or myelodysplastic/
      myeloproliferative overlap syndromes (MDS/MPN) who are ineligible for hematopoietic stem cell
      transplant (HSCT)

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To determine the rate of hematologic improvement (HI) in patients with
           relapsed/refractory MDS or MDS/MPN treated with pevonedistat and azacitidine after DNMTi
           failure

        -  To determine the complete remission (CR) and marrow CR rates in patients with
           relapsed/refractory MDS or MDS/MPN treated with pevonedistat and azacitidine after DNMTi
           failure

        -  To determine the reduction of bone marrow blasts in patients with relapsed/refractory
           MDS or MDS/MPN treated with pevonedistat and azacitidine after DNMTi failure

      Exploratory Objectives:

        -  To correlate the mutation burden in patients with relapsed/refractory MDS or MDS/MPN
           with response to treatment with pevonedistat and azacitidine

        -  To correlate genomic aberrations with rate of response and survival in
           relapsed/refractory MDS or MDS/MPN patients treated with pevonedistat and azacitidine

        -  To measure the effect of pevonedistat treatment in combination with azacitidine on
           quality of life in patients with relapsed/refractory MDS or MDS/MPN

        -  To define epigenetic biomarkers for pevonedistat use in relapsed/refractory MDS or
           MDS/MPN

        failure, patients must have received minimum dosing of decitabine 15mg/m2 daily x 5 days,
        or 5'azacitidine 50mg/m2 IV/SC daily x 5 days, or SGI-110 (guadecitabine) 60mg/m2 SC daily
        x 5 days or ASTX727 20/100mg daily x 5 days, or CC-486 200mg daily x 14 days in each prior
        cycle.

          -  Clinically significant graft versus host disease (GVHD) or GVHD requiring initiation
