      Participants will be randomized to one of three study vaginal rings (VRs) in a 1:1:1 ratio,
      and those randomized to the 100 mg and 200 mg VRs will not be told their group assignment.
      Participants will insert one VR to be used continuously for 13 weeks (100 mg VR or 200 mg VR)
      or one VR (25 mg VR) to be replaced every 4 weeks for 8 weeks, then worn for an additional 5
      weeks for a total of 13 weeks. Participants will continue follow-up for an additional one to
      three days after final VR removal.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Assigned female sex at birth Note: Participants who are female at birth, who now

             transition therapy.

          -  Age 18 through 45 years (inclusive) at Screening, verified per site SOPs

          -  Able and willing to provide written informed consent to be screened for and enrolled
             in MTN-036/IPM 047

          -  Able and willing to provide adequate locator information, as defined in site SOPs

          -  Able to communicate in spoken and written English

          -  Available for all visits and able and willing to comply with all study procedural
             requirements

          -  Willing to comply with abstinence and other protocol requirements

          -  Willing to use male condoms for penile-vaginal intercourse (PVI) and penile-rectal
             intercourse for the duration of study participation

          -  Per participant report, using an effective method of contraception for at least 30
             days (inclusive) prior to Enrollment, and intending to continue use of an effective
             method for the duration of study participation; effective methods include:

               1. hormonal methods (except contraceptive ring)

               2. intrauterine device (IUD)

               3. sterilization (of participant or partner, as defined in site SOPs)

               4. having sex exclusively with cis-women

               5. abstinence from PVI for 90 days prior to Enrollment, and intending to remain
                  abstinent from PVI for the duration of study participation

          -  HIV-uninfected based on testing performed at Screening and Enrollment

          -  Per participant report at Screening, regular menstrual cycles with at least 21 days
             between menses Note: This criterion is not applicable to participants who report using

             levonorgestrel-releasing IUD) nor to participants using continuous combination oral
             contraceptive pills, as the absence of regular menstrual cycles is an expected, normal
             consequence in this context.

          -  Per participant report at Screening and Enrollment, states a willingness to refrain
             from inserting any non-study vaginal products or objects into the vagina including,

             vaginal medications, menstrual cups, cervical caps, douches, lubricants, and sex toys
             (vibrators, dildos, etc.) for the 24 hours preceding the Enrollment Visit and for the
             duration of study participation.

        Note: Use of tampons is permitted except for 24 hours prior to clinic visits in which CVF
        samples are scheduled to be collected.

          -  Participants over the age of 21 (inclusive) must have documentation of a satisfactory
             Pap within the past 3 years prior to Enrollment consistent with Grade 0 according to

             Version 2.1, March 2017, or satisfactory evaluation with no treatment required of
             Grade 1 or higher Pap result

          -  At Screening and Enrollment, agrees not to participate in other research studies
             involving drugs, medical devices, vaginal products or vaccines after the Screening
             Visit and for the duration of study participation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant at Screening or Enrollment or plans to become pregnant during the study
             period

          -  Has a clinically apparent Grade 2 or higher pelvic exam finding (observed by study
             staff) at Screening or Enrollment, as per the DAIDS Table for Grading the Severity of
             Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events, Version 2.1, March 2017, and/or Addendum 1 (Female
             Genital Grading Table for Use in Microbicide Studies [Dated November 2007])

          -  5) Participant report and/or clinical evidence of any of the following:

               1. Known adverse reaction to any of the study products (ever)

               2. Chronic and/or recurrent vaginal candidiasis

          -  Use of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention and/or post-exposure
             prophylaxis (PEP) for potential HIV exposure within the 3 months prior to Enrollment,

             participation

          -  Has any of the following Grade 1 or higher laboratory abnormalities at Screening
             Visit:

               1. AST or ALT

               2. Hemoglobin

          -  Has any other condition that, in the opinion of the IoR/designee, would preclude
             informed consent, make study participation unsafe, complicate the interpretation of
             study outcome data, or otherwise interfere with achieving the study objectives
             including any significant uncontrolled active or chronic medical condition.
