    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, randomized, parallel-group, single-center study in healthy adult subjects.
      The study will be conducted in two parts sequentially:

      Part 1 is an open-label, two-arm, active-controlled design to evaluate the PK and safety of
      single oral dose of ETV XR tablet (1.5 mg) in healthy subjects. Part 1 will consist of 16
      healthy subjects.

      Part 2 is a double-blind, three-arm, placebo-controlled design to evaluate the PK and safety
      of higher oral doses of ETV XR tablet (3 mg and 6 mg) in healthy subjects. Part 2 will
      consist of 24 healthy subjects.
