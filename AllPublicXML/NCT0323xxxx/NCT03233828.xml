      This study is meant to assess the use of intralesional IL-2 to modulate the immunological
      response to suspected melanoma, or melanoma in situ, in an effort to increase lymphocyte
      infiltration and decrease disease metastasis.

      Patients that are clinically diagnosed with suspected Melanoma or Melanoma in situ will be
      assigned to either a treatment or control arm. The treatment group will be subjected to two
      intralesional IL-2 injections, whereas the control group will be subjected to two
      intralesional injections of saline.

      The proteomic and metabolomic profiles of both groups will be analyzed using urine and blood
      samples in an effort to assess the systemic immunological response, if any, to the treatment.
      Also, upon disease confirmation and staging by a qualified pathologist, lesions will be
      assessed for lymphocyte infiltration using immunohistochemical methods.

      This study will determine whether pre-treatment of IL-2 on lesions (clinically diagnosed as
      melanoma or melanoma in situ) is effective in generating an adaptive immune response, and
      whether that immune response may play a role in preventing disease metastasis.

      This study is primarily designed to determine if tumor specific immunity can be generated in
      melanoma patients in response to intralesional IL-2, and whether that immunity can confer
      resistance to melanoma metastasis. This is a randomized, controlled, double blind trial where
      participants will be randomly assigned to a treatment group (IL-2: Proleukin (Aldesleukin))
      or non-treatment group (saline placebo). Patients will be identified by Dermatology (Dr.s R.
      Langley, and K. Purdy) and interviews will be held at the surgery clinic (4th floor Dickson
      Center) QEII HSC, NSHA.

      Randomization will be achieved through the pharmacy preparing treatment and placebo
      solutions. At the onset of the study, 20 opaque envelopes will be prepared by the
      investigators, randomized, and given to the pharmacy. Ten of these envelopes will contain
      instruction to prepare treatment (IL-2), and the other 10 will contain directions to prepare
      the injectable control (saline); in this way randomization of treatment and control groups
      will occur in the pharmacy. Once the randomization envelopes are depleted they will be
      replaced 10 at a time (5 treatment, 5 control) until study conclusion. At the time of
      treatment randomization, the patient will be assigned a codified number (contained within the
      randomization envelope) to be used to track samples which will be collected and analyzed as a
      part of this study. This code will de-identify the patient and will allow samples to be
      analyzed without the risk of inappropriate exposure of participant's personal health data.
      When the study solution is prepared by the pharmacy, they will assign a codified ID which
      will be provided along with the syringe with the patient name labeled as study drug. The
      codified ID will be used to track samples that are analyzed at Dalhouise University, so
      patient identification information (such as name, address, or other identifying information)
      does not leave the hospital.

      Treatments, incisional and fine needle biopsy will be conducted at the surgery clinic (4th
      floor Dickson Center) QEII HSC, NSHA.Treatment group patients will be treated intralesionally
      with IL-2 (Aldesleukin, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Canada Inc.) at a dose of 500,000 IU in 0.1
      mL for 2 treatment cycles (1 treatment per week) prior to excisional biopsy; control group
      patients will be treated intralesionally with sterile saline (0.9% m/v) of the same volume
      for the same treatment cycles. Patient response to treatment will be monitored at each visit.

      Prior to the first treatment and after excisional biopsy of the lesion, all patients will
      have blood (4 vials) and urine (25-50 ml) samples taken for proteomic and metabolomics
      analysis. Before delivery of the lesion to pathology, the lesion will be subjected to two
      fine needle aspiration biopsies: one directly into the lesion to be used for RNA analysis to
      assess the genetic profile of the suspected melanoma, and one in the clear margins of patient
      tissue obtained during the excisional biopsy. All samples obtained from pathology will be
      returned to pathology within 60 days of receipt, with the exception of the core needle
      biopsies which are destroyed in the process of analysis.

      All blood, urine, and lesion biopsy samples will be labeled with a codified number (will not
      contain any patient identifying information) and will be immediately transported to Dr.
      Carman Giacomantonio laboratory (Sir Charles Tupper Medical Building, 11F11) at Dalhousie
      University for storage. After histological diagnosis and staging, cells obtained as
      formalin-fixed paraffin embedded sections (FFPE sections) from pathology will be obtained
      directly from pathology; these too will be labeled using the patients designated codifier.

      FFPE sections from pathological analysis of the lesions will be analyzed using
      immunohistochemical staining techniques analysis to look for levels of tumor infiltrating
      leukocytes (TILs). Fine needle aspiration samples will be assessed for tumor genetic and
      epigenetic profile. Blood and urine will be assessed for proteomic and metabolomic profiles,
      respectively.

      The difference in lymphocyte infiltration between treatment and control groups will be
      compared. Lymphocytes to be assessed will include natural killer cells, T cells (CD4+ and
      CD8+), dendritic cells, macrophages (Mac-1+ and Mac-2+) and other immune mediators including
      PD-1, PD-L1 and FoxP3 expressing cells. TILs will be assessed using immunohistochemical
      staining of FFPE sections. Tissue controls will be obtained from the clear tissue margins
      obtained during the excisional biopsy. Immunohistochemical analysis will occur at Dalhousie's
      Histology and Services Research Lab (Sir Charles Tupper Medical Building, 11B).

      RNA analysis of the lesion will be compared to unaffected patient tissue obtained from the
      clear margins of the excisional biopsy to assess genetic changes resulting from the melanoma.
      RNA analysis will occur at Dr. Giacomantonio's laboratory (Sir Charles Tupper Medical
      Building, 11F11) at Dalhousie University.

      Proteomic and metabolomic analysis will be conducted on blood and urine samples to assess
      systemic immune response to both treatment and control groups. Serum collected from patient
      blood samples will be used for proteomic analysis to assess circulating immunomodulators
      (cytokines and chemokines) before, and after, treatment. Urine samples will be used in
      metabolomic studies to look for metabolites excreted from patients before, and after
      treatment. Proteomic and metabolomic analysis will occur at Dalhousie's Proteomics and Mass
      Spectrometric Core Facility located in the Life Sciences Research Institute. These studies
      may serve to help develop diagnostic protocols and methods of assessing response to
      treatments.

      A database containing patient IDs and codified numbers will be restricted to the office of
      Dr. Giacomantonio (11th floor, VG). This is a locked office, and the data will only be
      accessible to the investigators named on this application. This database for will contain
      patient IDs, and info on disease status, treatment/control, follow up visits, and sample
      analysis - only info pertinent to the outcome measures. All sample data will be assessed
      using codified descriptors and will contain no patient ID info. Once the RNA and
      immunohistochemical data has been analyzed, unmasking treatment and control groups will be
      conducted at the VG office of Dr. Giacomantonio, by the named investigators. If the data
      reaches statistically significance, the study will not accept any more patients, if not, a
      further 10 patients will be incorporated - to a maximum of 60 patients. Any publications of
      study results will be completed devoid of any information that could be used to identify
      patients included in the study.

      All study participants will receive biannual assessments for 5 years after the initial
      intervention to assess disease progression, or the development of new melanoma, to compare
      between both treatment and control groups. This aspect of the study is identical to the
      patient assessment conducted as per standard of care for melanoma patients. Again, any
      publications of study results will be completed devoid of any information that could be used
      to identify patients included in the study.
