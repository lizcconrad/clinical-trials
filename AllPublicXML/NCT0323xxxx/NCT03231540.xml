      This study evaluates the effect of whey protein enriched enteral nutrition in addition to
      exercise training on the preservation of muscle function in critically ill patients.

      One half of patients receive whey protein enriched enteral nutrition with a protein intake of
      1.5 g/kg/day and the other half of patients receive standard enteral nutrition with a protein
      intake of 1 g/kg/day.

      Muscle wasting has an enormous impact on long-term physical performance and quality of life
      of intensive care survivors. Limitation of muscle wasting might therefore improve physical
      performance and quality of life. Data on high protein nutritional intake in addition to a
      standardized exercise training program to prevent skeletal muscle wasting during critical
      illness are lacking.

      Objective: to determine whether early high protein intake, using an enteral whey protein
      supplement, in addition to a standardized exercise training program and standard enteral
      nutrition preserves: a) in vitro skeletal muscle function in critically ill patients during
      the first week of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and b) short- and long-term in vivo
      muscle function and mass, clinical outcomes and quality of life in critically ill patients.
      Secondly, to determine whether high protein intake, in addition to standardized exercise and
      standard enteral nutrition, increases muscle protein synthesis and attenuates activation of
      the Ubiquitin-Proteasome pathway in critically ill patients.
