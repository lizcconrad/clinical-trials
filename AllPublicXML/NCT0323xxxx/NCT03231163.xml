  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to determine whether music has any effect on resting metabolic
      rate (RMR), which is the amount of energy expended at rest. There is currently conflicting
      research on how music affects RMR. One problem with RMR testing is that participants often
      fall asleep during the test. There can be a 5-10% difference in the metabolic rate between
      rest and sleep. If no change in RMR is observed, playing music during an RMR test could be a
      potential strategy to prevent participants from falling asleep. Participants will undergo RMR
      measurements while listening to no music, relaxing classical music, and self-selected
      classical music.
