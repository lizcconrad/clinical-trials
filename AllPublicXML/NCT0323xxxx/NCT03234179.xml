  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer mortality among adults worldwide. The incidence
      rates of lung cancer among never smoking females in some parts of East Asia are among the
      highest in the world. The adenocarcinoma of lung being the most frequently identified
      histological type is more weakly associated with smoking, and often occurs in females and
      never-smokers. Although family history of lung cancer has been associated with histological
      subtypes, the inherited susceptibility factors that affect specific histology are unknown.

      Genetic factors that determine individual predisposition to lung cancer have been identified
      via genome-wide association studies. These known common loci, however, explain only a small
      fraction of the familial risk of lung cancer. The hypothesis of this study is that there are
      genetic factors that confer inherited susceptibility among patients with primary
      non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      To delineate the genetic etiology underlying NSCLC, this study proposes to employ a
      family-based linkage analysis, together with rich data generated from NGS, to search for
      disease susceptibility locus for the patients with strong family history of primary NSCLC. By
      using family pedigrees, linkage analysis will be able to find co-segregation of alleles
      through multiple generations at a genetic susceptibility locus and a known genetic marker,
      and then the highly penetrate gene loci may be detected by our study. These gene loci will be
      a good genetic predictor of NSCLC which should be a great advantage in treatment, prevention
      and screening of NSCLC in the future.
