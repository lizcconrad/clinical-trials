  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gut hormones have therapeutic potential in the prevention and treatment obesity and type 2
      diabetes (T2D). Milk protein and calcium can each potentiate gut hormones following meal
      ingestion in humans. However, these nutrients may interact synergistically (and with other
      minerals in milk) such that specific co-ingestion of these nutrients is required to obtain
      the full therapeutic potential for metabolism and energy balance. This proposal is to perform
      a pilot study on the effect of co-ingesting CapolacÂ® plus protein on circulating gut hormone
      responses.

      Participants will be asked to arrive to the laboratory between 08:00 and 10:00 am after not
      eating for between 8-14 hours i.e. in a fasted state (water intake is permitted and
      encouraged). Participants will then be given one of three test drinks: 1) calcium citrate
      (1000 mg); 2) milk mineral supplement (equating to 1000 mg calcium); or 3) milk mineral
      supplement (equating to 1000 mg calcium) plus whey protein hydrolysate (50 g). Each of these
      drinks will also contain 500 mL of water and artificial sweetener (80 mg sucralose).

      Blood samples will be taken before, and at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 minutes after ingestion
      of the test drink to determine the concentrations of gut hormones (GIP, GLP-1 and PYY)
      circulating in the bloodstream. We will also ask participants to complete an appetite
      questionnaire at baseline and every 30 minutes after ingestion of the test drink to assess
      their appetite sensations. After the 120-minute time point, we will remove the cannula and
      the trial day will be complete.
