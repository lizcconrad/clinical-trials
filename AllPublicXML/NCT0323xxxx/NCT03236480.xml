  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are 2-3 times more likely to occur
      together with chronic gastrointestinal tract (GIT) diseases, such as inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD) or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Similarly, despite many patients have no
      history of acute or chronic respiratory disease, up to 50% of IBD patients and 33% of IBS
      patients have pulmonary involvement, such as inflammation or impaired lung function.
      Increasing evidence indicated chronic gut and lung disease share key conceptual features with
      the disorder and dysregulation of the microbial ecosystem. However, the underlying mechanisms
      are not well understood.

      Our study is aimed to elucidate the intimate relationship between the gastrointestinal tract
      and respiratory tract, and uncover the mechanisms by which the gut microbiota affects the
      immune responses in the lungs, and vice versa.
