    <description>This is a one-arm study. In postmenopausal women prescribed teriparatide for osteoporosis treatment, enrolled subjects will perform voluntary loading exercises on one upper extremity. A data logger device will assist in recording exercises and determining goal force during the exercises. Each subject's non-loaded upper extremity will serve as a control.</description>

    <description>Subjects who are prescribed teriparatide by their healthcare provider may enroll in this study. The study intervention consists of loading one upper extremity. Subjects will be trained on how to perform the upper extremity exercises at home. Subjects will be expected to perform the exercises 3 days per week using one arm, with each session consisting of 100 loading cycles lasting a total of approximately 2 minutes each day.</description>
