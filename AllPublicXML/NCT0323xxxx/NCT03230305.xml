  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The transposition of the results of biomedical research to medical management of patients in
      real-life setting depends highly from patient's selection. In Europe and the United States,
      the majority of cancers occur after 65 years. In France, 45% of cancers diagnosed in 2012
      were after 70 years or 158,722 in absolute value. In this context, the median age at
      diagnosis was 72 years old. Disease particularly affecting the elderly, cancer is also
      characterized by the importance of biomedical research devoted to it. Despite the dynamism of
      the research activity in oncology and therefore the number of affected patients, the elderly
      are paradoxically sparsely included in clinical trials. Numerous studies have focused in
      recent years, to identify possible causes of under-representation of elderly patients in
      clinical trials but most of them focused on eligibility criteria and few on barriers related
      to non-invitation or non-inclusion in eligible patients.

      We postulate that a qualitative survey based on an structured epidemiological device will
      able to objective evidences of reasons related to the patient, his/her familial caregivers,
      his/her physician and the clinical center organization for participating or not to a clinical
      trial and the interrelations between the identified reasons.

      The main objective is to assess reasons of non-participation of older patients with cancer in
      clinical trials, from the physicians, patients and family caregivers' perspectives using
      qualitative and quantitative methods.

      The secondary objectives are:

      To investigate the social representation and construction of being &quot;aged&quot; from the patient,
      physician and family caregiver perspective (qualitative part).

      To compare the reasons of non-participation regarding age class (old and very old), localized
      versus metastatic disease and tumor site (quantitative part).

      To characterize the profiles of participants and non-participants to clinical trial among
      older patients with cancer thanks to qualitative and quantitative data.

      Method Quali SAGE is a French, socio-epidemiologic, multicenter prospective study that
      includes patients aged 70 years or over, with solid tumor (irrespective of the stage) in
      French hospitals.

If included: an ethnographic interview will be held with patient (or his representant) who agreed to participate in the clinical trial, his family caregivers, his physician(s) in charge of him and the trial and, and clinical studies technician responsible for management.
If not included, an ethnographic interview has offered to him, his caregivers, his physician(s) in charge of him and the trial and clinical studies technician responsible for management. In parallel, the reasons for non-inclusion are collected from a pre-established epidemiological questionnaire.
If a patient is not invited to participate,an ethnographic interview will be held with his physician(s) in charge of him and the clinical trial and with clinical studies technician responsible for management.The reasons for non-invitation will be collected from an epidemiological survey multiple choices.</description>
