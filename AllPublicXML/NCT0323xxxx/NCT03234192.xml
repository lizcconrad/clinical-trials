  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of three common techniques for the
      treatment of lateral epicondylosis. Through objective and subjective assessments this study
      will determine the effectiveness of the Astym Treatment Technique, the Graston Treatment
      Technique, and therapeutic ultrasound in the conservative treatment of lateral epicondylosis.
      It is hypothesized that the more manual Astym technique and Graston technique will produce
      more significant results than the more frequently utilized ultrasound.

    <measure>Patient Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE)</measure>
    <time_frame>30 Minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 15 item self-reported questionnaire to measure perceived pain and disability in people with Lateral Epicondylosis (LE)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>QuickDASH</measure>
    <time_frame>30 Minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This is an 11 item questionnaire where by participants' score themselves using a 1-5 point scale. 1 represents &quot;no difficulty&quot; in performing task whereas 5 represents &quot;unable to perform task&quot;</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>EQ-5D-5L</measure>
    <time_frame>30 Minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This is a visual analog scale used to assess the clients view of their overall health on a scale of 0 (worst imaginable) to 100 (best imaginable). Also, clients report issues with mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each is scored on a 3 point scale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Range of motion</measure>
    <time_frame>30 Minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This will be taken at the wrist and elbow using goniometric measurements and a volar/dorsal approach at the wrist and lateral approach at the elbow. Measurements recorded will be wrist flexion and extension and elbow flexion and extension</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Grip strength</measure>
    <time_frame>30 Minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This will be measured using a hand held dynamometer and tested in the standard (arm at side) position and elbow extension position. Three trials on each UE will be reported in pounds</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Numeric Rating Scale for Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>30 Minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This scale is a single point scale from 0-10. The client picks one number to represent their pain, where 0 represents no pain and 10 represents worst pain imaginable</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cozens Test</measure>
    <time_frame>30 Minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This involves the examiner resisting the wrist extension force of the client with the elbow in extension</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mills Test</measure>
    <time_frame>30 Minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This is performed by palpating the lateral epicondyle while passively pronating the forearm, flexing the wrist, and extending the elbow</description>
