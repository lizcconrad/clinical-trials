  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, 6-sequence, 3-period crossover study. Subjects will
      receive multiple oral doses of YHR1705, YHR1706 or YHR1705 + YHR1706 QD for 5 consecutive
      days. There will be a washout of at least 10 days between the last dose in one period and the
      first dose in the subsequent period.
