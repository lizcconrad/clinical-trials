    <textblock>
      A Phase 1 dose escalation study to determine if SNDX-6352 will be sufficiently safe and
      well-tolerated at biologically active doses to warrant further investigation in patients with
      solid tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, multi-center Phase 1 study to evaluate SNDX-6352 in patients with
      unresectable, recurrent, locally-advanced or metastatic solid tumors which must have
      progressed following prior treatment and have no standard therapy alternatives left (ie:
      patients must not be candidates for regimens known to provide clinical benefit). The primary
      objective will be to determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended
      Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of SNDX-6352 as evaluated by the incidence of adverse events that are
      defined as dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). A standard &quot;3+3&quot; dose escalation schema will be
      used to determine an MTD with 3-6 patients enrolled per dose level. The RP2D will be
      determined based on data from the dose escalation patients as reviewed by the Safety Review
      Committee (SRC; comprised of investigators and the Sponsor).

    <intervention_model_description>Initially, 3 patients will receive SNDX-6352 at a starting dose of 1 mg/kg IV on C1D1 and then again on C1D15 of a 28-day cycle. If no DLTs are noted, then 3 more patients will be treated at the next higher dose level (3 mg/kg). If one DLT is observed in 1 of 3 patients, 3 additional patients will be treated at that starting dose level (1 mg/kg). If 2 or more DLTs are observed in 3-6 patients at the starting dose, the study will be terminated or a lower dose will be considered. An SRC will approve dose escalation after the safety assessments for each dose group are completed. If the safety profile is acceptable, escalation to SNDX-6352 doses of 3 mg/kg, 6 mg/kg and 10mg/kg is planned. The MTD will be considered to have been exceeded if 2 or more patients in a dose group experience a DLT; in this case, the next lower dose group which has been evaluated will be considered as the MTD.</intervention_model_description>
