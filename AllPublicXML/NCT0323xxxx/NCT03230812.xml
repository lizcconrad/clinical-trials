  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      the results from animal studies and preliminary human studies show that carnitine
      availability and acetylcarnitine concentrations are low in insulin resistant states such as
      with type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, in humans, carnitine supplementation is sometimes
      beneficial, but not in everyone. We hypothesize that this variability in response is due to
      differences between individuals in the amount of carnitine in the muscle i.e. only subjects
      with a low initial carnitine status will benefit from supplementation. The state of the art
      non-invasive magnetic resonance spectroscopy method allows us to identify patients with low
      vs high muscle acetylcarnitine status. Here we aim to - for the first time - make the
      translational step to humans and test the hypothesis that carnitine supplementation in type 2
      diabetic patients with initially low carnitine status enhances metabolic flexibility and
      insulin sensitivity to a greater extent than in subjects with an initially high carnitine
      status.

      Rationale: Type 2 diabetic patients are characterized by a decreased metabolic flexibility: a
      reduced capability to switch from fat oxidation in the basal state to carbohydrate oxidation
      in the insulin-stimulated state. This metabolic inflexibility is an early hallmark in the
      development of diabetes. Recent evidence suggests that a low carnitine availability may limit
      acetylcarnitine formation, thereby reducing metabolic flexibility. Thus, when substrate flux
      in the muscle is high, acetyl-CoA concentrations increase, leading to inhibition of pyruvate
      dehydrogenase (PDH) and thereby reducing glucose oxidation. The conversion of acetyl-CoA to
      acetylcarnitine relieves this acetyl-CoA pressure on PDH. In humans, carnitine
      supplementation is sometimes also beneficial, but not in everyone. Here we aim to test the
      hypothesis that carnitine supplementation in type 2 diabetic patients with initially low
      carnitine status enhances metabolic flexibility and insulin sensitivity to a greater extent
      than in subjects with an initially high carnitine status. Our novel non-invasive MRI-based
      method to determine acetylcarnitine in muscle provides the opportunity for a priori
      identification of patients with low acetylcarnitine status in muscle.

      Objective: The primary objectives are to investigate whether carnitine supplementation in
      patients with type 2 diabetes with an initially low carnitine status can improve metabolic
      flexibility and insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, a secondary objective is to examine the
      molecular pathways of carnitine and acetylcarnitine, responsible for muscle insulin
      sensitivity and metabolic flexibility as well as the effects of carnitine supplementation in
      patients with type 2 diabetes with an initially low carnitine status on intrahepatic lipid
      content, acetylcarnitine formation, blood plasma metabolites, body composition, physical
      performance and quality of life.

      Study design: The current study is an interventional parallel design. Subjects will not be
      blinded for the intervention since all subjects will receive oral carnitine supplementation.

      Study population: n=26, patient with type 2 diabetes (BMI 25-35, age 40-70 years) male and
      female will be included. 13 patients with an initially low carnitine status (&lt;3.3 mmol/kg)
      and 13 patients with an initially high status (&gt;4.5 mmol/kg). Only subjects with relatively
      well-controlled non-insulin depended diabetes will be included.

      Intervention (if applicable): Participants will be asked to take three chewing tablets of
      L-carnitine (330mg), three times a day (breakfast, lunch and dinner), for 96 days.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary study endpoints are insulin sensitivity and
      metabolic flexibility, measured by the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. Secondary endpoints
      are maximal acetylcarnitine concentrations after exercise, Intrahepatic lipid content, body
      composition, metabolites in the blood before (i.e. glucose, free fatty acids, triglycerides,
      cholesterol, insulin), CrAT activity, acylcarnitine profiles, lipid and lipid intermediates,
      functional markers of physical performance, quality of life and quality of sleep.
