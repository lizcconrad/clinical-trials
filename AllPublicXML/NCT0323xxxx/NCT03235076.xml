  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the pharmacokinetics of BAY1101042 in subjects with mild to severe renal
      impairment, stratified according to estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) determined
      2-10 days prior to dosing, and age-, weight- and gender- matched healthy subjects and to
      assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamics of BAY1101042 after a single oral dose
      of a 10 mg BAY1101042 given as 5 mg modified release (MR) tablet.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ability to understand and follow study-related instructions and ability to participate
             in the study for the entire period.

          -  Age: 18 to 79 years (inclusive) at the screening visit.

          -  Body mass index (BMI): 18 to 34 kg/m² (both inclusive).

          -  Male or female subject.

          -  Only women without childbearing potential will be included in the study (e.g.
             postmenopausal for at least one year, women with bilateral ovariectomy and women with
             hysterectomy).

        Subjects with renal impairment:

          -  eGFR &lt;90 mL/min/1.73 m*2 determined from serum creatinine 2-10 days prior to dosing.

          -  Stable renal disease, i.e. a serum creatinine value determined at least 3 months
             before the pre-study visit (e.g. during routine diagnostics) should not vary by more
             than 20% from the serum creatinine value determined at the pre-study visit.

        Healthy subjects:

        - eGFR ≥90 mL/min/1.73 m*2 determined from serum creatinine 2-10 days prior to dosing.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or lactating women.

          -  Medical disorder, condition or history of such that would impair the subject's ability
             to participate or complete this study in the opinion of the investigator.
