  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary reason the investigators are doing this study are to understand how the right
      side of the heart functions in heart failure patients with left ventricular assist devices
      (LVADs, or &quot;mechanical hearts&quot;). Second, the investigators are interested in understanding
      how different pacemaker settings influence function of the heart at rest and activity.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        15 patients with advanced HF who have already undergone CF-LVAD implantation.

        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Have already received CF-LVADs and are clinically stable,

          2. Ambulatory outpatients and are fully recovered (at least 3 months) from LVAD
             implantation;

          3. Presence of a cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) with an
             underlying LBBB conduction abnormality.

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Individuals with clinical RV failure under resting conditions, defined as
             moderate-severely reduced RV systolic function on echocardiography, or

          2. Clinical evidence of RV failure (elevated jugular venous pressures, 3 or 4+
             [significant] peripheral edema);

          3. Disorders that adversely influence exercise ability (e.g. arthritis, peripheral
             vascular disease, pulmonary disease); and

          4. Patients that do not have a CRT-D device.

        10 healthy individuals will serve as a control group to define normal RV function during
        exercise.

        Inclusion criteria:

        1) Persons without a past medical history of cardiovascular disease or related disease such
        as:

          1. hypertension,

          2. diabetes,

          3. peripheral vascular disease,

          4. arrhythmias,

        f. are not taking any cardiac-related medications (e.g. antihypertensive medications).

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Individuals requiring systemic anticoagulation with vitamin-K antagonists or
             new/direct oral anticoagulants (&quot;NOAC&quot;/&quot;DOAC&quot;);

          2. Disorders that adversely influence exercise ability (e.g. arthritis, peripheral
             vascular disease).
