    <textblock>
      This phase II trial evaluates how well AVD (doxorubicin hydrochloride, vinblastine,
      dacarbazine) in combination with brentuximab vedotin and nivolumab work in treating patients
      with stage I-II Hodgkin lymphoma. Drugs used in the chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin
      hydrochloride, vinblastine, dacarbazine, and brentuximab vedotin, work in different ways to
      stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing,
      and/or by stopping them from spreading. Targeted agent, such as nivolumab, may interfere with
      the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread by enhancing the immune system. Giving
      doxorubicin hydrochloride, vinblastine, dacarbazine, brentuximab vedotin, and nivolumab may
      improve survival of patients with stage I-II Hodgkin lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate progression-free survival (PFS) at 3 years in patients with previously
      untreated stage I or II non-bulky Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) who received doxorubicin
      hydrochloride, vinblastine, dacarbazine (AVD) plus brentuximab vedotin (BV) induction therapy
      followed by nivolumab (N)VB consolidation therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the overall survival (OS) rate at 3 years in patients with previously
      untreated stage I or II non-bulky HL who received AVD plus BV induction therapy followed by
      NVB consolidation therapy.

      II. To estimate the percentage of patients with untreated stage I or II non-bulky HL who are
      positron emission tomography (PET) positive versus PET negative after 3 cycles of AVD plus BV
      induction therapy.

      III. To estimate PFS and OS at 3 and 5 years separately for patients who are PET negative
      versus PET positive after 3 cycles of AVD plus BV induction followed by NVB consolidation
      therapy.

      IV. To estimate time to progression (TTP) in patients with previously untreated stage I or II
      non-bulky HL who received AVD plus BV induction therapy followed by NVB consolidation
      therapy.

      V. To estimate the overall response rate and the number of patients who convert to complete
      response (CMR) after NVB in patients with partial response (PMR) at the end of AVD plus BV
      induction therapy.

      VI. To evaluate the toxicity and tolerability of AVD plus BV induction followed by NVB
      consolidation therapy as assessed via the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology
      Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE version [v]4).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Optional biopsy tissue samples will be collected for future analysis. II. Optional blood
      sample will be collected for future analysis.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 3-5 minutes, vinblastine
      IV over 3-5 minutes, and darcarbazine IV over &gt;= 30 minutes, and brentuximab vedotin IV over
      30 minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 3 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with PET-positive then receive
      brentuximab vedotin IV over 30 minutes and nivolumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Treatment
      repeats every 2 weeks for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. PET-positive patients then receive nivolumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Treatment
      repeats every 2 weeks for 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. PET-negative patients receive nivolumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1 starting after
      AVD and BV treatment. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 8 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 and 8 weeks, every 3 or 6
      months for 2 years, and then once a year for 3 years.

             for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the subject to
             participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator

          -  Known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation
             with the requirements of the trial

          -  Received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent

          -  Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies)

          -  Known active hepatitis B (e.g., hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] reactive) or
             hepatitis C (e.g., hepatitis C virus [HCV] ribonucleic acid [RNA] [qualitative] is
             detected)

          -  Received a live vaccine =&lt; 30 days prior to registration; Note: Seasonal influenza
             vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and are allowed;
             however, intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist) are live attenuated vaccines,
             and are not allowed; routine vaccinations, including seasonal influenza, must be given
             &gt;= 2 weeks prior to registration

          -  History of allergies and adverse drug reaction to study drug components

          -  History of another primary malignancy that has not been in remission for at least 3
             years; (Note: The following are exempt for the 3-year limit: nonmelanoma skin cancer,
             fully excised melanoma in situ [stage 0], curatively treated localized prostate
             cancer, and cervical carcinoma in situ on biopsy or a squamous intraepithelial lesion
             on papanicolaou [PAP] smear)

          -  Co-morbid systemic illnesses or other severe concurrent disease which, in the judgment
             of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study or
             interfere significantly with the proper assessment of safety and toxicity of the
             prescribed regimens

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Receiving any other investigational agent which would be considered as a treatment for
             the primary neoplasm

          -  History of progressive promyelocytic leukemia (PML), known history of pancreatitis,
             active grade 3 or higher viral, bacterial or fungal infection =&lt; 2 weeks prior to
             registration and documented history of cerebrovascular event (stroke or transient
             ischemic attack [TIA]) =&lt; 6 months prior to registration
