  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Itch is a debilitating condition affecting many people. Currently, there are no
      FDA-approved treatments. Apremilast is an FDA-approved oral medication used to successfully
      treat the inflammatory skin disorder psoriasis and the inflammatory disorder psoriatic
      arthritis. This study examines if apremiliast taken twice daily relieves chronic itch.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is no FDA-approved medication for chronic idiopathic pruritus (CIP). Apremilast has
      demonstrated notable activity and is approved for treatment in other pruritic inflammatory
      skin conditions such as psoriasis. The drug is currently being investigated as therapy for
      atopic dermatitis. Additionally, the investigators have preliminary data to suggest that
      apremilast's anti-inflammatory properties may work via neuromodulation targeting neuronal
      cytokine pathways. The proposed study plans to assess the efficacy of apremilast 30 mg BID in
      the setting of CIP. Durable response to a medication is typically seen within one to two
      months of starting an efficacious medication in subjects who respond. Therefore, the
      investigators have designed this study to end at Week 16 to definitively determine efficacy
      and conclude the study with confidence with regard to both efficacy and failure.
