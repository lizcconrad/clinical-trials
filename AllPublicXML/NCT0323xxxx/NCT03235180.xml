      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a new ultrasound technology for
      evaluating Crohn's disease.

      The investigators will study the efficacy of ultrasound shear wave elastography and
      vascularity imaging for Crohn's Disease (CD) evaluation. Literature evidences demonstrate
      that bowel stiffness is correlated with fibrosis, while bowel vascularity and perfusion is
      correlated with inflammation. Therefore, the investigators expect the combination of shear
      wave elastography and vascularity imaging can increase the sensitivity and specificity of CD
      evaluation.

      Ultrasound is safe, cost-effective, and widely accessible, thus provides an attractive
      alternative to the clinical standard Computed Tomography (CT), risks of radiation)) and
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), more expensive and limited accessibility)).

      Because ultrasound may not be able to image bowel loops deep in the body, its main role is
      for follow-up after initial screening by CT or MRI, especially for terminal ileum, which is
      easily accessible by ultrasound and the most frequently affected bowel segment for CD.

    <description>Subjects will receive ultrasound exams of the bowel with 2 different machines (Ultrasound Elastography and Ultrasound Vascularity) at three time points: baseline, 4 weeks, and 6 months. The ultrasound exams will be performed at first with no contrast agent, and then ultrasound measurements will be repeated with 1-2 ml of Sulfur Hexafluoride, a contract agent.
Subjects also will receive Magnetic Resonance Enterography (MRE) exams at baseline and 6 months as part of their clinical care.</description>

    <description>Subjects will receive ultrasound (US) imaging of the terminal ileum without and with sulfur hexafluoride contrast at baseline, 4 week and 6 months. Subjects will receive one to two milliliters of the contrast agent.</description>
