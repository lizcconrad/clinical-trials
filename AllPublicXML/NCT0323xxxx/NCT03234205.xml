  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Measurement of T2 transversal relaxation time by magnetic resonance has a major interest in
      cardiac imagery. It has been initially used for quantitative evaluation of heart viability
      and more recently for edema characterization. It allows to prematurely detect a cardiac
      transplant rejection. This technique needs successively around ten FSE sequences during
      apnea. Weak reproducibility of successive apneas and discomfort of patient limit the
      precision of this measurement and consequently its use in standard care. The ARTEMIS study
      method allows the examination during free respiration without prolonging the duration of
      examination compared to the examination during apnea. Moreover, image processing is
      simplified and correction of respiratory movements renders results more reliable.

      This is a pilot study of evaluation of ARTEMIS technique of image reconstruction. ARTEMIS is
      a method of MRI image reconstruction for measurements of T2 transversal relaxation. It allows
      to obtain diagnostic images without movement artifacts.

      The primary objective si to show the feasibility of ARTEMIS method for measurement of
      myocardial T2 relaxation time during free respiration in cardiac transplant patients.

      The secondary objective is to collect quantitative data to compare ARTEMIS method of
      measurement of T2 during free respiration and standard clinical practice during apnea.
