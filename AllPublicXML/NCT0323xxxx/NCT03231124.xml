  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will investigate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic (PK) data of LEO
      32731 (and major human metabolite LEO 40815) in healthy male Japanese subjects. The primary
      objective is the assessment of PK in Japanese subjects.

      Data obtained from this trial will be used to compare with existing data from the other Phase
      1 trials. This comparison of safety and PK profiles between Japanese and Caucasian subjects
      will allow the inclusion of Japanese patients into Phase 2b studies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Ability to provide written, personally signed, and dated informed consent to
             participate in the study, in accordance with the ICH Good Clinical Practice (GCP)
             Guideline E6 (1996) and applicable regulations, before completing any study-related
             procedures.

          2. An understanding, willingness and ability to fully comply with study procedures and
             restrictions.

          3. Japanese men aged &gt;20 to &lt;45 years (from date of signing informed consent which is
             defined as the beginning of the Screening Period). This inclusion criterion will only
             be assessed at the Screening Visit.

          4. Japanese subjects must have lived outside of Japan for ≤ 5 years in total and be first
             generation Japanese, defined as born in Japan and having 4 biologic grandparents who
             are ethnic Japanese.

          5. Subjects must have a body mass index (BMI) between 18.0-25.0 kg/m².

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Current or recurrent disease (i.e. with, or with a history of, any clinically
             significant neurological, gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, cardiovascular,
             psychiatric, respiratory, metabolic, endocrine, haematological, dermatological or
             other major disorders as determined by the Investigator) that could affect the action,
             absorption, or disposition of LEO 32731, or could affect clinical assessments or
             clinical laboratory evaluations.

          2. Current or relevant history of physical or psychiatric illness that may require
             treatment or make the subject unlikely to fully comply with the requirements of the
             study or complete the study, or any condition that presents undue risk from the
             investigational product or study procedures.

          3. Any history of psychiatric or mental health issue such (including depression) deemed
             clinically significant as assessed by the Investigator.

          4. Any history of/or active cancer or malignancy (other than squamous cell carcinoma more
             than 5 years prior).

          7. Any other significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the investigator,
             may either put the subject at risk because of participation in the study, may
             influence the result of the study, or the subject's ability to participate in the
             study.

          8. Use of any prescribed systemic or topical medication(s) within 14 days or 10
             half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to Day 1 of the dosing period.

          9. Use of any systemic or topical non-prescribed or over-the-counter (OTC) medication(s)
             (including multivitamin, herbal, or homeopathic preparations) within 7 days or 5
             half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to Day 1 of the dosing period. The occasional
             use of paracetamol (acetaminophen) is allowed to treat short term adverse events;
             subject to review by the investigator. The maximum allowed daily dose is 2000 mg for
             paracetamol at the discretion of the investigator.

         11. History or clinical evidence of substance and/or alcohol abuse within the 12 months

         13. Use of tobacco in any form (e.g., smoking or chewing) or other nicotine-containing
             products in any form (e.g., gum, patch) within 90 days prior to Day 1 of the dosing
             period.
