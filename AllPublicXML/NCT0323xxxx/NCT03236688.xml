      Demonstrate detection of ARv7 splice variant transcripts from exosomes in the circulation of
      MCRPC patients pre and post treatment with selective Androgen pathway inhibitors (i.e.
      abiraterone and enzalutamide)

      Primary Objective

      -Demonstrate detection of ARv7 splice variant transcripts from exosomes in the circulation of
      MCRPC patients pre and post treatment with selective Androgen pathway inhibitors (i.e.
      abiraterone and enzalutamide)

      Secondary and Exploratory Objectives

        -  Correlate ARv7 status with PSA response (&gt;/=50% decline in PSA level from baseline,
           maintained for &gt;/=4 weeks) at any time after the initiation of therapy.

        -  Comparison of median progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).

        -  Determine additional molecular lesions in exoRNA and cfDNA in MCRPC patients
           post-treatment with androgen pathway inhibitors.

        -  Correlate other AR-variants (non ARv7) with clinical outcomes including PSA response.

    <measure>Detection of ARv7 splice variant in the circulation of MCRPC patients. PSA response rate in ARv7 positive patients.</measure>
    <time_frame>Two years</time_frame>
    <description>The detection of ARv7 splice variants in samples will be considered both binary: positive or negative/not assessable and level based. ARv7 splice variants from exosomes will be detectable from baseline in 50% of both API; PSA response rates will be 10% or less in ARv7 positive patients. With a sample of 30 patients (as reported in the NEJM study) per cohort would allow the study to have an 85% power to detect a difference of 50 percentage points in PSA response rates, with the use of a two-sided test at an alpha level of 0.1.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Participants must have histologically confirmed diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the
             prostate.

          2. Clinical or radiographic evidence of metastatic disease.

          3. Planned therapy with either enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate within the coming 6
             weeks.

          4. Evidence of disease progression on or following most recent therapy as evidenced by
             the following:

               -  Radiographic evidence of disease progression as defined by one or more new bone
                  scan lesions.

               -  Growth of soft tissue / visceral metastases to greater than one centimeter in
                  longest diameter.

               -  Progressive disease despite 'castration levels' of serum testosterone (&lt;50ng/dL
                  with continued androgen deprivation therapy.

          5. At least two of the following high risk features during screening for rapid disease
             progression:

               -  Anemia with a hemoglobin &lt;12.0 g/dL

               -  Elevated alkaline phosphatase

               -  High lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
