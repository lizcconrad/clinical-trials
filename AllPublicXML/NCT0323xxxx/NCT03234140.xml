  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Follicular lymphoma is the second most common adult B-cell lymphoma. The acquisition of the
      t(14;18) translocation is the genetic hallmark of Follicular lymphoma. However, 50% to 70% of
      healthy individuals harbor low levels of circulating t(14;18)-positive cells but will never
      develop Follicular lymphoma. It was observed that individuals who developed Follicular
      lymphoma showed a higher t(14;18) frequency than controls (Roulland et al., J Clin Oncol
      2014). High t(14;18) frequency in blood from healthy individuals could be a predictive
      biomarker for Follicular lymphoma development. Genetic instability of those t(14;18)+ B-cells
      as well as failure of the micro-environment to control the proliferation of these cells are
      proposed mechanisms linking these lymphoma precursors to true lymphoma cells. The prognosis
      of Follicular lymphoma patients has been significantly improved mainly with the development
      of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, with a current median overall survival over 15 years.
      However, this lymphoma remains an incurable disease. The most commonly used tool for
      prognostication of patients with Follicular lymphoma is the Follicular Lymphoma International
      Prognostic Index (FLIPI) based on conventional clinical and pathology parameters. Although it
      has clinical utility, the Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index does not reflect
      the biologic heterogeneity of Follicular lymphoma. First-degree relatives of Follicular
      lymphoma had a fourfold increased risk of Follicular lymphoma suggesting a genetic etiology.

      Using the Genome wide association studies (GWAS) approach on Follicular lymphoma cohorts of
      1,565 patients, the project plan to identify new prognostic markers. These markers will then
      be analyzed to decipher the impact of host genetics on somatic alterations and tumor biology,
      using public or matched patient data. The investigators also plan to analyze the influence of
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms on circulating t(14;18) levels in 318 healthy individuals
      included in EPIC cohort that will develop Follicular lymphoma later on, and assess if these
      biomarkers are helpful to refine the identification of high-risk Follicular lymphoma
      individuals.

    <description>Event Free Survival for follicular lymphoma patients treated with modern immunochemotherapy in five cohorts is the primary end point defined as the time from the diagnosis or randomization to the date of progression, relapse, re-treatment, or death from any cause.
Two steps analysis, with a discovery cohort and a validation cohort :
The discovery cohorts that the investigators plan to study are a subset of patients with available deoxyribonucleic acid samples of two prospective phase III trials (PRIMA (NCT00140582) (N=396) and FOLL-05 (NCT00774826) (N=229), and one prospective observational cohort SPORE of the University of Iowa-Mayo Clinic (MER1; N=178). A GWAS will then be performed on a subset of patients with available deoxyribonucleic acid of two validation cohorts (Prospective observational SPORE MER2; N=321, phase III trial RELEVANCE, NCT01476787, N=441).</description>

    <measure>Somatic alterations and tumor biology</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>In order to better decipher the impact of host genetics on somatic alterations and tumor biology and understand the physiological function of the single-nucleotide polymorphism identified from the primary outcome measure, we will study the link between the molecular profiles of the tumor and the prognostic single-nucleotide polymorphism. This will be performed on samples of the PRIMA and MER studies, for which we have access to somatic and constitutive data.
In parallel, we will investigate the relation between known susceptibility single-nucleotide polymorphism and the level of the t(14 ;18) translocation. The latter analysis will be performed on EPIC samples (European Prospective Investigation Into Cancer and Nutrition), comparing healthy individuals to individuals who developed a follicular lymphoma. Finally, we will assess the effect of susceptibility single-nucleotide polymorphism on somatic molecular profiles on PRIMA and MAYO cohorts.</description>
