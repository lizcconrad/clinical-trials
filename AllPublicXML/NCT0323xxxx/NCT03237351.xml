  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perioperative fluid management is a key component of anesthetic management during thoracic
      surgery. On one hand, fluid restriction could compromise perfusion of vital organs and
      surgical anastomosis. On the other hand, fluid overload could lead to cardiopulmonary
      complications, notably pulmonary edema, which carries a high mortality rate. Perioperative
      fluid management to avoid postpneumonectomy pulmonary edema has been previously reviewed.
      Therefore, to achieve the balance between preventing fluid overload and optimising organ
      perfusion, the practical index to guide fluid management, which can predict whether fluid
      loading will improve haemodynamic conditions in an individual patient, would be very valuable
      during lung surgery. Perioperative goal-directed fluid therapy (GDFT) is a cornerstone of
      tissue perfusion and oxygenation, and it can improve surgical outcomes. Respiratory
      variations of arterial pressure [i.e. pulse pressure variation (PPV) and systolic pressure
      variation] can predict fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients under various
      conditions. Therefore, pressure variations are increasingly being advocated for fluid
      management.This study will discuss the effects of pulse pressure variation(PPV) in different
      level during anesthesia on patients with oxygenation index and short-term prognosis
      undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for pneumoresection.
