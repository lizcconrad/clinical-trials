  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For many people with spinal cord injury (SCI), the goal of walking is a high priority. There
      are many approaches available to restore walking function after SCI; however, these
      approaches often involve extensive rehabilitation training and access to facilities,
      qualified staff, and advanced technology that make practicing walking at home difficult. For
      this reason, developing training approaches that could be easily performed in the home would
      be of great value. In addition, non-invasive brain stimulation has the potential to increase
      the effectiveness of communication between the brain and spinal cord. Combining motor skill
      training with brain stimulation may further enhance the restoration of function in persons
      with SCI. Based on these findings, the primary aim of this proof-of-concept study is to
      inform future intervention development. To meet this aim, we will determine if
      moderate-intensity, motor skill training can improve walking-related outcomes among persons
      with SCI and to determine if the addition of non-invasive brain stimulation will result in
      greater improvements in function compared to training alone.

      For many people with spinal cord injury (SCI), the goal of walking is a high priority. There
      are many approaches available to restore walking function after SCI; however, these
      approaches often involve access to intensive training programs, facilities, qualified staff,
      and advanced technology that make practicing walking at home difficult. For this reason,
      developing training approaches that could be easily performed in the home would be of great
      value. In addition, research suggests that enhancing brain excitability might have benefits
      for improving the communication between the brain and spinal cord. Transcranial direct
      current stimulation (tDCS) is a type of non-invasive brain stimulation that has been shown to
      directly increase brain excitability, which may make it easier for the brain and nervous
      system to respond to training. Combining motor skill exercises with brain stimulation may
      enhance the restoration of walking function in persons with SCI. Based on these findings, the
      primary aim of this proof-of-concept study is to inform future intervention development. To
      meet this aim, we will determine if moderate-intensity, motor skill training can improve
      walking-related outcomes among persons with SCI and to determine if the addition of
      non-invasive brain stimulation will result in greater improvements in function compared to
      training alone.

      Participants in the proposed study will complete one baseline testing session, 3 motor
      training sessions, and one follow-up session over 5 consecutive days. During the first and
      fifth sessions, participants will complete assessments only, which will take approximately
      2-3 hours each day. During the second, third, and fourth sessions, participants will perform
      a series of 6 standing motor skill exercises designed to challenge balance, lower extremity
      coordination, agility, and speed. Participants will be randomized to either a motor training
      only group or a motor training + tDCS group. The motor training + tDCS group will receive
      brain stimulation during the motor skill training, while the motor training only group will
      receive sensory level brain stimulation only. Each participant will complete the 6 motor
      skill exercise circuit 4 times. Motor training exercise sessions will last approximately
      25-30 minutes and will be preceded and followed by assessments of walking function,
      spasticity, and ankle strength in order to determine changes in these measures over time.

    <measure>10 Meter Walk Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1-5</time_frame>
    <description>Walking speed will be the primary outcome measure for walking function, as speed has been the standard measure used in the literature and will allow us to assess outcomes relative to other published studies. Walking speed will be determined using the 10 Meter Walk Test, which will be recorded as the average time across 3 trials that a participant can walk a 10 meter distance.</description>

    <measure>Maximal Isometric Dorsiflexor Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1-5</time_frame>
    <description>Ankle dorsiflexion (tibialis anterior) strength will be measured with the subject seated, with the test foot strapped to a handheld dynamometer. An ankle dorsiflexion test was selected based on evidence indicating that the tibialis anterior is under the greatest corticospinal control. Maximum dorsiflexion torque will be calculated based on the highest of three attempts.</description>

    <measure>Gait Kinematics</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1-5</time_frame>
    <description>Kinematic data related to walking performance will be obtained using an accelerometer-based motion capture system (Xsens MVN Biomech Awinda, Xsens, Enschede, Netherlands) as the subject walks along a 12-meter path, using only the passive assistive devices they typically use (e.g., lower limb orthotics, walker, forearm crutches). Secondarily, we will assess gait quality as reflected by step height, step length, and step symmetry.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Berg Balance Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, Day 5</time_frame>
    <description>Balance will be measured using the Berg Balance Scale, which has been found to be valid for use in persons with SCI.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Falls Efficacy Scale-International Version</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, Day 5</time_frame>
    <description>The fear of falling may be a major concern for persons with mobility impairments and may limit one's confidence or ability to perform activities of daily living. Fear of falling may also limit an individual's performance of specific overground motor tasks irrespective of functional ability to perform that task. Therefore, the fear of falling will be an important factor to consider relative to the mobility interventions employed in the present study.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Spinal Cord Assessment Tool for Spastic Reflexes</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1-5</time_frame>
    <description>We will use the Spinal Cord Assessment Tool for Spastic Reflexes to assess the impact of MT-only and MT+tDCS on spasticity. This measure is well correlated with electrophysiological measures of spasticity and is better correlated with self-reported measures of spasm frequency than the Ashworth test.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified 5-Times Sit-to-Stand</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, Day 5</time_frame>
    <description>The modified 5-times sit-to-stand test will be used a measure of functional lower extremity strength. In this test, the subject is seated on a mat table with height adjusted to 80% of lower extremity length. The time required to complete 5 repetitions of standing up and sitting down (without using the upper extremities for assistance) is recorded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximal Isometric Quadriceps Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, Day 5</time_frame>
    <description>Knee extensor (quadriceps) strength will be measured with the subject seated, with the test leg strapped to a handheld dynamometer. Prior studies have shown that a single session of tDCS improves quadriceps strength in persons with stroke. Maximum knee extensor torque will be calculated based on the highest of three attempts.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>2 Minute Walk Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, Day 5</time_frame>
    <description>Functional walking capacity will be measured based on 2-minute walk test distance. The use of the 2-minute rather than the 6-minute walk test allows us to include individuals whose impairments result in inability to walk for 6 minutes.</description>

    <intervention_name>Motor Skill Training</intervention_name>
    <description>Motor skill training will consist of activities that will be performed while standing to promote upright control (the toe-tapping activity will be performed while seated). Participants will perform each of the 6 different activities for one minute each, until 4 cycles of the circuit have been completed (approximately 25 minutes total). Motor training activities will be performed at an intensity of 40-59% of heart rate reserve (HRR). Toe tapping will provide the opportunity for scheduled rest. During MT, all participants will wear a heart rate monitor to ensure that the optimal HR range is achieved. HRR will be calculated from resting and peak heart rate measures obtained during baseline testing via administration of a graded-exercise test.</description>

    <intervention_name>Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)</intervention_name>
    <description>The tDCS electrode placement is based on procedures shown to improve gait and balance in a single session when used in combination with gait training activities. tDCS electrodes can simultaneously activate the bilateral leg motor areas when placed at the midline of the scalp slightly anterior to the vertex (anode) and at the inion (cathode), with a current intensity of 2mA. The tDCS device is lightweight, and can be worn in a backpack during the MT activities. As reported previously, participants in the MT-only group will receive sham tDCS to maintain analogous study procedures.</description>
