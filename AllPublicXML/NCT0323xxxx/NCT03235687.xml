  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to investigate the utility of a validated urine test
      which predicts the likelihood of high grade prostate cancer on an initial prostate biopsy.

      Primary Objective(s)

        1. Evaluate performance of the ExoDx Prostate(IntelliScore) (EPI) to reduce the number of
           initial prostate biopsies by greater than or equal to 15% for men with an elevated
           Prostate-Specific Antigen 2-10ng/mL presenting for a biopsy in consultation with their
           urologist.

        2. Compare performance of both the ExoDx Prostate(IntelliScore) 15.6 and 20 cut-points with
           respect to the biopsy decision process.

        3. Assess physician satisfaction with the ExoDx Prostate(IntelliScore) report including
           test result presentation, graphics and interpretation.

        4. Assess urologist / patient satisfaction for ease of understanding test results and role
           on biopsy decision process.

      Secondary Objectives

        1. Determine the medical economic impact of the ExoDx Prostate(IntelliScore) test in the
           prostate biopsy decision process.

        2. Correlation of the ExoDx Prostate(IntelliScore) score with the actual biopsy result by
           utilizing the Receiver Operating Characteristic of the Area Under Curve for
           discriminating high-grade (greater than or equal to Gleason Score 7, International
           Society of Urological Pathology 2 and 3) from low-grade (Gleason Score 6, International
           Society of Urological Pathology 1) and benign disease on initial prostate needle biopsy.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a prospective, randomized blinded, shared decision-impact and health-economic assessment study. 1000 appropriately screened consecutive patients seen during planning for a prostate biopsy will be enrolled. 500 patients will be randomized (blinded) to have the ExoDx Prostate (IntelliScore) test (Cohort A) and 500 (Cohort B) will proceed with conventional standard of care. At time of enrollment, neither the patient nor the urologist will be made aware of whether the patient will have an ExoDx Prostate (IntelliScore) test as part of their work-up. Cohort A EPI test results will be sent to the urologist for assessment and ultimately shared with the patient.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>ExoDx Prostate (IntelliScore) is a non-invasive, urinary 3-gene expression validated test in which the results of the assay are adjunctive to the ordering physician's clinical judgment and work-up of the patient in the determination of whether a prostate needle biopsy is necessary. The ExoDx Prostate (IntelliScore) was clinically validated to discriminate patients with higher grade prostate cancer from those with more indolent lower grade cancer and benign disease.</description>
