  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will retrospectively analyze and compare data of 2 groups of overweight and
      obese patients: subjects who followed a diet based on Resting Energy Expenditure (REE)
      measured by indirect calorimetry and subjects who followed a diet based on REE estimated by
      the Harris-Benedict equation. Propensity score adjustment will be used to adjust for known
      differences between the 2 groups

    <description>Indirect calorimetry will be performed by using an open-circuit calorimeter (Sensor Medics, Italy). Indirect calorimetry is the reference method for energy expenditure determination. A canopy hood covered the patient's head and expired air is extracted by a pump to be analyzed by metabolic cart sensors; flow rate is directly measured with a digital turbine flowmeter. After an overnight fast, patients will asked to lay supine in complete physical rest, not sleeping or talking for approximately 20-25 minutes, at a room temperature ranged between 22 and 24°C. The mean REE for each participant considers the last 15-20 minutes of measurements corresponding to steady state.
Software of calorimeter will be set for minute-by-minute reading report of VO2 (Oxygen flow) and VCO2 (Carbon dioxide flow) measurement.
Parameters obtained by Indirect Calorimetry will be the Resting Energy Expenditure and the Respiratory Quotient (RQ)</description>

        To collect clinical data of a total population comprising patients referred to our
        Endocrinology-Diabetes Outpatient Clinic, in the period from April 2012 through October
        2016.

        In this retrospective study, will be considered patients with an age ranging from 20 to 86
        years, with overweight (25 ≤ BMI ≤ 29.9) or obesity (BMI ≥ 30), requiring dietary
        intervention for weight control.

        Statistical analysis will perform on overweight and obese patients divided into two
        subgroups: IC group and NO-IC group.

        Anthropometric status and metabolic biomarkers will re-evaluated at check-ups performed
        after 3 months, 6 months, 12 months and 18 months from the baseline.
