  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The reported risk of nonreassuring fetal heart trace following neuraxial analgesia is 3-23%.
      This variability may be due to fluid and oxytocin management prior to and during the
      initiation of neuraxial analgesia. The study hypothesis is that decreasing the oxytocin
      infusion rate by 50 % prior to initiation of combined spinal epidural analgesia will cause a
      reduction in the incidence of adverse fetal heart rate changes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oxytocin is used in labor and delivery to increase the frequency of contractions and augment
      uterine contractile strength, thereby establishing a regular pattern of labor. However, the
      administration of exogenous oxytocin in the presence of an uncoordinated labor pattern
      confers a risk for an increase in uterine contraction frequency, resulting in inadequate
      relaxation periods. This leads to an increase in the basal tone of the uterus, which may lead
      to a tetanic contraction with the risk of decreased uteroplacental blood flow and fetal
      hypoxemia. Previous studies investigating low- versus high-dose oxytocin for induction or
      augmentation of labor have had conflicting results on the effect on fetal heart rate
      abnormalities. One of the limitations of these studies is that the labor analgesia was not
      standardized. The combination of low-dose combined spinal epidural analgesia and the high/low
      dose oxytocin have not been evaluated. One of the proposed mechanisms for nonreassuring fetal
      heart a tracing after initiation of analgesia is that the pain relief from neuraxial
      analgesia causes a decrease in catecholamine release by the sympathetic nervous system. The
      subsequent decrease in the circulating epinephrine concentration contributes to an increase
      in uterine tone, as epinephrine is a potent tocolytic agent. The increased tone, in turn,
      leads to a decrease in placental blood flow, and eventually fetal bradycardia. The primary
      outcome of this study is the incidence of non-reassuring fetal heart rate tracings within the
      first 60 minutes after the placement of combined spinal epidural analgesia
