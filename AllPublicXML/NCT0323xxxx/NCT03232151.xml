  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching objective of our proposal is to develop a One-Stop-Shop imaging using the
      available C-arm Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) data acquisition systems currently
      widely available worldwide in interventional angiography suites to enable acute ischemic
      stroke patients to be imaged, triaged, treated, and assessed using a single modality in one
      room.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an evaluation to determine the efficacy of the use of C-arm CBCT with SMART RECON
      novel software for the rapid assessment of time-resolved CTA and CT perfusion in the setting
      of ischemic cerebrovascular events. As a leading center for the treatment of cerebrovascular
      disease in the Midwest as well as being one of the first Comprehensive Stroke Centers in the
      United States we have a large potential patient group to assess. Our pilot plan is to compare
      conventional CT/CTA/CTP acquired during the clinical work up with C-arm CBCT/CTA/CTP acquired
      in the angiography suite at initiation of therapy. The C-arm CBCT acquisition provides whole
      brain coverage (compared to only 8 cm brain coverage with conventional CT) with less
      radiation and higher resolution; the CT perfusion maps obtained using C-arm CBCT and new
      reconstruction algorithms provides better perfusion maps.

    <description>C-ARM CBCT angiogram and CBCT perfusion imaging using prototype software (SMART-RECON) can rapidly and accurately assess the cerebral blood flow maps in the setting of decreased blood flow to the brain (ischemic cerebrovascular events). This rapid assessment would eliminate the need for the patient to be imaged in another scanner and be subsequently transported again to another room; all anatomic and physiologic imaging would occur in the angiography suite.</description>
