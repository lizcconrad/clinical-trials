  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled study to evaluate the
      micro-macroscopic effects on muscles, the safety and tolerability, and the efficacy of
      givinostat in patients with Becker Muscular Dystrophy. Approximately 48 eligible patients
      will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to be treated with givinostat or placebo for a period of 12
      months.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Givinostat or placebo oral suspension (10 mg/mL) will be administered orally as 2 oral doses
      daily while the subject is in fed state, according to the subject's weight.

      Study drug should be permanently stopped if any of the following occur:

        -  severe drug-related diarrhoea;

        -  any drug-related Serious Adverse Event (SAE);

        -  QTcorrected by Fridericia's formulas (QTcF) &gt;500 msec;

        -  platelets (PLT) count ≤50 x 1.000.000.000/L (10E9/L);

        -  White blood cell (WBC) ≤ 2.0 x 10E9/L;

        -  Hemoglobin (Hb) ≤ 8.0 g/dL.

      Study drug should be temporarily stopped if any of the following occur:

        -  PLT count &lt;75 x 10E9/L but &gt;50 x 10E9/L;

        -  WBC &lt; 3.0 x 10E9/L but &gt; 2.0 x 10E9/L;

        -  Hb &lt; 10.0 g/dL but &gt; 8.0 g/dL;

        -  moderate or severe diarrhoea. In case the study drug was temporarily stopped, the study
           drug can be resumed at a level 1/3 smaller than the one at which the Adverse Event
           leading to temporary stop occurred, once platelets, WBC or Hb are normalized or
           diarrhoea is mild (if treatment was stopped for moderate or severe diarrhoea).

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Ambulant patients with BMD diagnosis confirmed by genetic testing.

          2. Able and willing to give informed consent in writing.

          3. Able to perform 6MWT at screening with a minimum distance of 200 m and maximum
             distance of 450 m.

          4. If in treatment with systemic corticosteroids and/or angiotensin-converting-enzyme
             (ACE) inhibitor , and/or β or α adrenergic receptor blocker, no significant change in
             dosage or dosing regimen (excluding changes related to body weight change) for a
             minimum of 6 months immediately prior to start of study treatment.

          5. Patients must be willing to use adequate contraception. Contraceptive methods must be
             used from Randomization through 3 months after the last dose of study treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Exposure to another investigational drug within 3 months prior to the start of study
             treatment.

          2. Use of any pharmacologic treatment, other than corticosteroids, that might have an
             effect on muscle strength or function within 3 months prior to the start of study
             treatment (e.g., growth hormone). Vitamin D, calcium, and any other supplements will
             be allowed.

          3. Surgery that might affect muscle strength or function within 3 months before study
             entry or planned surgery at any time during the study.

          4. Presence of other clinically significant disease that in the Investigator's opinion
             could adversely affect the safety of the patient, making it unlikely that the course
             of treatment or follow-up is completed, or could impair the assessment of study
             results.

          5. A diagnosis of other neurological diseases or presence of relevant somatic disorders
             that are not related to BMD.

          6. Platelet count, WBC count and hemoglobin at screening &lt; Lower Limit of Normal (LLN).
             If laboratory screening results are &lt; LLN, platelet count, WBC count and hemoglobin
             are to be repeated once, and if again &lt; LLN become exclusionary.

          7. Symptomatic cardiomyopathy or heart failure (New York Heart Association Class III or
             IV) or left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 50% at screening or with heart transplant.

          8. Current liver disease or impairment, including but not limited to elevated total
             bilirubin (&gt; 1.5 x ULN), unless secondary to Gilbert's disease or pattern consistent
             with Gilbert's disease.

          9. Inadequate renal function, as defined by serum Cystatin C &gt; 2 x the upper limit of
             normal (ULN). If the value is &gt; 2 x ULN, serum Cystatin C will be repeated once, and
             if again &gt; 2 x ULN becomes exclusionary.

         10. Positive test for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody, or human
             immunodeficiency virus at screening.

         11. Baseline corrected QTcF &gt; 450 msec, (as the mean of 3 consecutive readings 5 minutes
             apart) or history of additional risk factors for torsades de pointes (e.g., heart
             failure, hypokalemia, or family history of long QT syndrome).

         12. Psychiatric illness/social situations rendering the potential patient unable to
             understand and comply with the muscle function tests and/or with the study protocol
             procedures.

         13. Hypersensitivity to the components of study medication.

         14. Sorbitol intolerance or sorbitol malabsorption, or the hereditary form of fructose
             intolerance.

         15. Contraindications to muscle biopsy.

         16. Contraindications to MRI/MRS (e.g., claustrophobia, metal implants, or seizure
             disorder).
