  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an extension of a previous feasibility study (Clinical Trials Registry -
      NCT02571244). The actual study is a research aimed to compare the effectiveness of telephone
      counseling and personalized text messages (TM) for supporting post-discharge quit attempts
      among hospitalized smokers, with focus on smoking cessation as the main outcome. Smokers
      patients will receive brief interventions and nicotine replacement therapy during the
      hospitalization. After discharge smoker patients will be allocated into a intervention or
      control arm. In the first and third months, after randomization, the patients will be contact
      to smoke abstinence assessment.

      This is an extension of a previous feasibility study (Clinical Trials Registry -
      NCT02571244). Background: Research suggests that smokers who receive treatment inside the
      hospital and post-discharge follow up for at least a month is most likely to quit smoking
      than those who didn't receive any intervention. The current challenge is to know the best way
      to support post-discharge quit attempts in the Brazilian context. Objective: The aim of this
      study is compare the effectiveness of personalized text messages (TM) and telephone
      counseling to support smoking cessation between post discharge patients. Methods: All
      patients admitted to the University Hospital of Juiz de Fora (HU/UFJF), between 06/2017 to
      11/2018, will be asked about the cigarettes consumption in the last 30 days. Smokers patients
      will receive brief interventions and nicotine replacement therapy during hospitalization.
      After discharge these patients will be allocated into an intervention or control arm. The
      intervention group will receive mobile phone TM twice a day up to fifteen days. The control
      group will receive usual care (four telephone counseling sessions using motivational
      interviewing approach). Results: At the first and third months, after randomization, the
      patients will be contacted for smoke abstinence assessment.

    <description>The patient will receive standard care inside the hospital. After discharge the active comparator group will receive four phone counseling sessions. The sessions will provide basic information about smoking and successful quitting. The counselor will use motivational interview techniques to build coping skills with the goal of helping the participant build and implement a quit plan. The counseling timing, duration, and content will be consistent with guideline-based recommendations.</description>

    <description>The patient will receive standard care inside the hospital. After discharge the experimental group will receive extended care including text messages. Participants in this arm will be offered up to 30 text messages to help implement the quit plan discussed during the hospitalization. Patients motivated to quit in the next 30 days or that had already quit will receive 30 messages and patients unwilling to quit will receive 16 messages. The messages content follows the self efficacy theory.</description>
