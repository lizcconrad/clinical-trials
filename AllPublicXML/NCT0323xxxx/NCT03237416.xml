    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy subject - as determined by the investigator or medically qualified designee
             based on medical evaluations including medical history, physical examination,
             laboratory tests and cardiac monitoring.

          -  Gender: Male.

          -  Age: 45 to 65 years (inclusive) at the screening visit.

          -  Race: White.

          -  Body mass index (BMI): ≥18.0 and ≤30.0 kg/m2.

          -  Agree to use condoms as an effective contraception barrier method and refrain from
             sperm donation during the whole study (starting after informed consent) and for 3
             months after the end of treatment with darolutamide.

        In addition, participants must agree to utilize a second reliable method of contraception
        simultaneously. The second method which has to be used by a female partner of childbearing
        potential can be one of the following methods: diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide or
        intra-uterine device or hormone-based contraception. Therefore, contraception methods to be
        used by male subjects and female partners are in line with clinical trial facilitation
        group recommendations related to contraception in clinical trials.

          -  Ability to understand and follow study-related instructions.

          -  Results of alcohol tests are negative at screening and on Study Day -1.

          -  Confirmation of the subject's health insurance coverage prior to the first screening
             examination/visit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Existing relevant diseases of vital organs (e.g. liver diseases, heart diseases),
             central nervous system (for example seizures) or other organs (e.g. diabetes
             mellitus).

          -  Incompletely cured pre-existing diseases for which it can be assumed that the
             absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination and effects of the study drugs will
             not be normal.

          -  Known history of hypersensitivity (or known allergic reaction) to medications
             including any ingredient of midazolam, benzodiazepines, dabigatran etexilate, or
             darolutamide.

          -  Relevant hepatic disorders like cholestasis, disturbances of bilirubin metabolism, any
             progressive liver disease.

          -  Relevant renal disorders like recurrent glomerulonephritis, renal injury, and renal
             insufficiency. However, a history of a single episode of uncomplicated nephrolithiasis
             will not prevent participation.

          -  CYP3A4 inhibitors within 1 week or 5 drug half-lives, whichever is longer, before
             start of study treatment or during the study.

          -  CYP3A4 inducers as well as St John's Wort within 28 days or 5 drug half-lives,
             whichever is longer, before start of study treatment or during the study.

          -  Known BCRP and OATP substrates within 28 days or 5 drug half-lives, whichever is
             longer, before start of study treatment or during the study.

          -  P-gp inducers (e.g. rifampin) within 28 days or 5 drug half-lives, whichever is
             longer, before start of study treatment or during the study.

          -  P-gp inhibitors within 1 week or 5 drug half-lives, whichever is longer, before start
             of study treatment or during the study.
