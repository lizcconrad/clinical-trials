    <textblock>
      Asthma, abbreviation for bronchial asthma, is one of the common chronic airways disease that
      threatens human health. Typical symptoms of asthma are recurrent wheezing, shortness of
      breath, chest tightness and cough, usually occurring at night or early morning. However,
      there are still some patients with only persistent clinical manifestations of chest
      tightness. Concerned about this group of patients, we presented a subgroup of bronchial
      asthma, namely, chest tightness variant asthma (CTVA). This asthma subgroup usually lacks
      asthma-specific clinical features such as wheezing, shortness of breath, wheezing, and
      therefore often misdiagnosed for a long time. In order to further understand the clinical
      characteristics, pathogenesis, and prognosis of patients with CTVA, we conducted a national
      multicenter observation study to further understand CTVA. Finally, we plan to clarify whether
      CTVA is a relatively independent asthma phenotype. Meanwhile, reducing misdiagnosis and
      perform an appropriate treatment of CTVA.
