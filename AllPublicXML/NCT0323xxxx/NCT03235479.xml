                  months

               -  Consistent migraine headaches of at least 2 migraine headache attacks of moderate
                  or severe intensity in each of the 3 months prior to the Screening Visit and

          2. Less than 15 days with headache (migraine or non-migraine) per month in each of the 3
             months prior to the Screening Visit and maintains this requirement during the
             Screening Period

          3. Patients on prophylactic migraine medication are permitted to remain on therapy
             provided they have been on a stable dose for at least 3 months prior to study entry.

          4. Patients with contraindications for use of triptans may be included provided they meet
             all other study entry criteria.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient history of HIV disease

          2. Patient history with current evidence of uncontrolled, unstable or recently diagnosed
             cardiovascular disease, such as ischemic heart disease, coronary artery vasospasm, and
             cerebral ischemia. Patients with Myocardial Infarction (MI), Acute Coronary Syndrome
             (ACS),Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI), cardiac surgery, stroke or transient
             ischemic attack (TIA) during the 6 months prior to screening.

          3. Uncontrolled hypertension (high blood pressure), or uncontrolled diabetes (however
             patients can be included who have stable hypertension and/or diabetes for 3 months
             prior to being enrolled)

          4. Patient has a current diagnosis of major depression, other pain syndromes, psychiatric
             conditions (eg, schizophrenia), dementia, or significant neurological disorders (other

             medical conditions (eg, history of congenital heart disease or arrhythmia, known
             suspected infection, hepatitis B or C, or cancer) that, in the investigator's opinion,
             would expose them to undue risk of a significant adverse event (AE) or interfere with
             assessments of safety or efficacy during the course of the trial

          7. History of, treatment for, or evidence of, alcohol or drug abuse within the past 12
