    <textblock>
      This study makes an observation over the objective response rate of autologous erythrocytes
      derived microparticles packaging methotrexate peritoneal perfusion and systemic therapy
      combination in the treatment of malignant ascites. All the participants will randomly receive
      the treatment of autologous erythrocytes derived microparticles packaging methotrexate
      peritoneal perfusion and systemic therapy combination or convention drugs peritoneal
      perfusion and systemic therapy combination.

      As a drug carrier, erythrocytes have their own advantages, such as high biocompatibility,
      high immune compatibility, simple structure and easy access. In this study, microparticles
      released from erythrocytes are used as the carrier of chemotherapy drugs and effectively kill
      tumor cells in malignant ascites. These microparticles can easily reach the tumor site and
      bring the drug into tumor cells, which can overcome the two main problems in normal
      chemotherapy: damage to normal cells and drug resistance of tumor cells.
