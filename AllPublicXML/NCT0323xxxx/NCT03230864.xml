  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy of 10 mg/day Lu AF35700 on symptoms of schizophrenia in
      patients with early-in-disease (ED) or late-in-disease (LD) treatment-resistant schizophrenia
      (TRS)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the study, patients will receive risperidone (4-6 mg/day), or, if recently failed on
      risperidone, olanzapine (15-20mg/day). Later during the study, patients will be randomized to
      either receive Lu AF35700 (10 mg/day), or continue their treatment with risperidone or
      olanzapine.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline 2 to Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) is a 30-item scale for assessing the symptoms of schizophrenia. For each PANSS item, symptom severity was rated on a 7-point scale, from 1=absent to 7=extreme. The PANSS total score (30 items) ranged from 30 to 210 with a higher score indicating greater severity of symptoms.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Global Clinical Impression - Severity of Illness (CGI-S) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline 2 to Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Global Impression - Severity of Illness (CGI-S) provides the clinician's impression of the patient's current state of mental illness. The clinician uses his or her clinical experience of this patient population to rate the severity of the patient's current mental illness on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (normal - not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill patients).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in 16-item Negative Symptom Assessment (NSA-16 total) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline 2 to Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>The NSA-16 is a clinician-rated scale designed to assess the presence, severity, and range of negative symptoms associated with schizophrenia. The NSA-16 consists of 16 items arranged in 5 subdomains: communication dysfunction (items 1 to 4), emotional/affective dysfunction (items 5 to 7), dysfunction in sociality (items 8 to 10), motivational/hedonic dysfunction (items 11 to 14), and reduced psychomotor activity (items 15 and 16), and a Global Negative Symptom Rating. NSA-16 items are rated on a 6-point scale from 1 (behaviour is normal) to 6 (behaviour severely reduced), and a score of 9 if the item is not-rateable. The Global Negative Symptom Rating is rated from 1 (no evidence of symptoms) to 7 (extremely severe symptoms). The 16 items are summed to yield a total score ranging from 16 to 96 and the global rating ranges from 1 to 7.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in PANSS Negative Factor Score (Marder Negative Score)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline 2 to Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS Negative Factor score is a subset of the PANSS assessing negative symptoms of schizophrenia. The factor consist of the seven items: blunted affect, emotional withdrawal, poor rapport, passive social withdrawal, lack of spontaneity, motor retardation, and active social avoidance which are each rated on a 7-point scale, from 1=absent to 7=extreme. The PANSS Negative Factor score (7 items) range from 7 to 49 with a higher score indicating greater severity of symptoms.</description>

          -  The patient has schizophrenia, diagnosed according to DSM-5(TM). (Diagnostic and
             Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) and confirmed by the Mini International
             Neuropsychiatric Interview for Schizophrenia and Psychotic Disorders (MINI-Schz).

          -  The patient is receiving treatment with a psychiatrist in either an inpatient or
             outpatient facility.

          -  The patient has been treated with adequate dose(s) of antipsychotic drug treatment for

          -  The patient has failed to show an adequate response in the level of psychotic symptoms
             during at least one documented treatment trial with an adequate dose of an
             antipsychotic drug prescribed for an adequate time (at least lasting for 6 weeks)
             within 2 years prior to the Screening Visit. The failure to respond to the current
             antipsychotic drug treatment trial may be considered a retrospective failed treatment,
             if the patient has been treated for 6 weeks with adequate dose(s) of antipsychotic
             drug(s).

          -  The patient has a PANSS total score of ≥80 (on 1-7 scale) and a score of ≥4 (≥
             &quot;Moderate&quot; on 1-7 scale) on at least 2 of the following PANSS items at the Screening
             and at Baseline 1 [Week 0] Visits: P2 - Conceptual disorganization, P3 - Hallucinatory
             behavior, P6 - Suspiciousness/persecution, G9 - Unusual thought content; AND the
             patient has a CGI-S score of ≥4 (≥ &quot;Moderately ill&quot;) at the Screening and at Baseline
             1 (Week 0) Visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has any current primary psychiatric disorder other than schizophrenia, as
             assessed using the MINI-Schz.

          -  The patient suffers from mental retardation, organic mental disorders, or mental
             disorders due to a general medical condition (DSM-5™ criteria).

          -  The patient is experiencing an acute exacerbation of his/her psychotic symptoms.

          -  The patient has been treated with, AND is resistant to, clozapine according to the
             investigator's judgement.
