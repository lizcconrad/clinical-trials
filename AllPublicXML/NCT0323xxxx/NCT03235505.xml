      Abstract Rationale. Electronic cigarette use is increasing at an exponential rate in Finland
      and internationally. The health consequences of vaporised aerosols in electronic cigarettes
      are largely unknown especially in a long run. Still, very few studies are available on
      quitting attempts with e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation tool compared to evidence based
      cessation pharmacotherapy in adult smokers who want to quit.

      Research Objective: To investigate effectiveness and safety of e-cigarettes for smoking
      cessation in middle-aged smokers, and to compare the effectiveness of them to varenicline.
      Our study provides new information of success in smoking cessation among heavy adult smokers
      for clinicians.

      Design: A double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial with the intervention
      phase of 12 weeks and the observational phase up to 52 weeks. This is an investigator
      initiated study.

      Setting: Volunteer middle-aged daily smokers, who were recruited through newspaper
      announcements. The majority of the cohort subjects (n=513)were recruited for our previous
      follow-ip study during years 2003- 2009, and many of them continued daily smoking during the
      whole follow-up period.

      Participants: In all, 450 adult heavy smokers, who want to quit smoking and are willing to
      participate up to 52 weeks´ follow-up.

      Intervention and procedures: Standardized self-reported questionnaires with detailed smoking
      history with assessment of motivation to quit smoking, parameters of nicotine dependence,
      symptoms will be included. Smoking status will be repeatedly reassessed during the study
      visits, and self-reported smoking abstinence is verified with exhaled-carbon monoxide (CO)
      assessment. All adverse side effects either of drugs or of e-cigarettes, and symptoms related
      to the drugs or to withdrawal from smoking will be carefully reported.

      This is a study with three arms. Each arm has 12 weeks intervention and observation up to 12
      months:

      A. Nicotine containing e-cigarettes + placebo-pills + Motivational Interview (MI)

        -  E-Voke 15mg electronic inhaler

        -  10 inhalations is typically needed before cravings will go away

        -  How often a smoker needs to use the inhaler depends on how many cigarettes he/she used
           to smoke

        -  130 inhalations in each cartridge

        -  2-3 cartridges per day is the maximum a smoker can use during these study.weeks

        -  If max 15 cartridges per week, thus 180 cartridges /12 weeks period (5 cartridges is the
           maximum according to the manufacturer )

        -  Placebo -pills: starting week: 0,5mg once daily on days 1.-3 and 0,5mg twice daily on
           days 4.-5.Continuing weeks: 1mg twice daily up to 12 weeks

      B. Nicotine-free e-cigarettes + varenicline + MI

        -  Like E-Voke electronic inhaler but without any nicotine. This product has not yet been
           chosen.

      Varenicline (Chantix®)

        -  Starting week: 0,5mg once daily on days 1.-3 and 0,5mg twice daily on days 4.-5.
           Continuing weeks: 1mg twice daily up to 12 weeks

      C. Placebo-varenicline + nicotine -free e-cigarettes + MI

        -  Placebo -pills : starting week: 0,5mg once daily on days 1.-3 and 0,5mg twice daily on
           days 4.-5. Continuing weeks: 1mg twice daily up to 12 weeks

        -  Like E-Voke electronic inhaler but without any nicotine. This product has not yet been
           chosen.
