  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of the study is to compare the patterns of neurocircuitry activation in
      severe asthmatics vs. mild to moderate and healthy controls. The Investigators hypothesize
      that neurocircuitry activation increases with asthma severity, producing different
      neurocircuitry patterns for severe asthmatics than those of mild to moderate asthmatics or
      non-asthmatics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To begin to further address possible relationships of asthma and brain function, the
      investigators propose the following hypothesis, &quot;patients with defined characteristics of
      severe asthma will have distinct patterns of persistent neurocircuitry activation. The
      investigators further propose that the detection of ongoing neurocircuitry activation occurs
      because of persistent and active airway inflammation in severe asthma. Finally, the
      investigators propose that the intensity of specific neurocircuitry activation will relate to
      the severity of underlying asthma.
