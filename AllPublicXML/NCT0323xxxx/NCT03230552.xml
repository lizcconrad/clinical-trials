  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a need for the development and validation of new teaching strategies and resources
      for surgical training that can occur outside of the operating room. The use of surgical
      videos is not novel however it has not been validated as an effective approach for
      gynecologic surgical training. The goals of our study are to (1) develop an educational
      surgical video for laparoscopic salpingo-oophrectomy (LSO) and (2) to evaluate and test the
      effectiveness of this tool in preparing residents for performance in the operating room.

    <textblock>
      In the rapidly changing face of surgical education and with a pressure to adopt
      competency-based training and assessment nationwide, obstetrics and gynecology residency
      programs will be forced to implement effective strategies to ensure that learners acquire the
      skill set required to become competent gynecologists. However, very few instructional tools
      have been validated in gynecologic surgery. The use of surgical videos as a teaching strategy
      may be one piece to this puzzle. Surgical videos are becoming increasingly popular, however,
      their value as an effective instructional technique has yet to be validated. Should surgical
      videos prove to be of benefit in surgical training it would offer an alternate modality to
      optimize operating room experiences and learning for gynecology residents.

      Obstetrics and gynecology residents in years one and two of their training (junior
      residents), will view a teaching video about LSO (intervention group) compared to not
      watching a video (control group) to assess if our intervention results in better performance
      in the operating room for this procedure as rated by an objective structured assessment of
      technical skills tool (OSAT) (primary outcome). Secondary outcome measures will include a
      self-administered questionnaire grading knowledge and confidence, and a 5-point Likert scale
      grading resident satisfaction with the video.
