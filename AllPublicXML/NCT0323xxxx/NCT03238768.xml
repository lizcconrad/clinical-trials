  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of the proposal is to demonstrate the feasibility of providing
      increased calories and protein in the first week of life to very low birth weight (VLBW)
      preterm infants.

      Infants will be randomized to receive either standard parenteral nutrition via the neonatal
      intensive care unit (NICU) protocol or enhanced parenteral nutrition via the Study protocol
      during their first week of life through higher initial macronutrient provision and faster
      advancement of macronutrient provision.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Infants who are diagnosed prenatally with a clinical condition (other than
