  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study, to evaluated epitinib, which is a selective epidermal growth
      factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR TKI), to treat glioblastoma patients with
      EGFR gene amplification. As epitinib could cross blood-brain barrier (BBB), inhibition of
      EGFR may provide a novel mechanism in treating glioblastoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epitinib could cross BBB and show its efficacy in brain metastasis tumors. Patients with
      histologically confirmed glioblastoma; standard treatment failed or no standard treatment as
      well as EGFR gene amplication are eligible. Patients will receive epitinib 120mg or 160mg
      epitinib daily. Epitinib is orally administered qd until patients reach intolerance or
      progression of disease. Tumor assessment takes place every 4 weeks. Simon two stage design
      was used, estimated making sample size of 35 cases.
