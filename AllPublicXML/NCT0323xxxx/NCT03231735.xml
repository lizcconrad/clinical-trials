  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine, in preterm infants less than 37 weeks gestation
      with respiratory distress who are ventilated in the first 48 hours after birth, if mid
      frequency ventilation strategy using ventilator rate of ≥ 60 to ≤ 150 per minute compared
      with standard frequency ventilation strategy using ventilator rates of ≥ 20 to &lt; 60 per
      minute will increase the number of alive ventilator-free days after randomization and reduce
      the risk of ventilator induced lung injury.

      In preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) who are ventilated in the first
      48 hours after birth, mid frequency ventilation (MFV) strategy, compared with standard
      frequency ventilation (SFV) strategy, in the first week after birth, will increase the number
      of days alive and ventilator-free in the 28 days after birth.

      This will be a randomized controlled trial with a 1:1 parallel allocation of infants to MFV
      or SFV using stratified permuted block design. Randomization will be stratified by
      gestational age (≥ 23 weeks to ˂ 26 weeks, ≥ 26 weeks to ≤ 28+6/7 (less than 29 weeks), and
      29+0/7 to 36+6/7). Randomization of twins and higher orders (when eligible) will be to the
      same group.

      Inborn and outborn infants who are receiving assisted ventilation for RDS in the first 48
      hours after birth will be included in this study. Infants with any of the following: a major
      malformation, a neuromuscular condition that affects respiration, terminal illness or
      decision to withhold or limit support will not be eligible.

      Infants will be randomized to MFV versus SFV. MFV delivered at rates &gt; 60 per minute and ≤
      150 per minute, with patient triggered ventilation and pressure support.

      SFV delivered at rates &lt; 60 per minute and ≥ 20 per minute, with patient triggered
      ventilation and pressure support.
