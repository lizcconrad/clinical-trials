    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in two phases; an in-patient meal study phase (Phase I) and an
      outpatient home study (Phase II). The two phase study design is chosen to enhance safety by
      testing the Afrezza Closed-Loop (CL) system in controlled in-clinic setting under study staff
      supervision before it could be investigated at the outpatient home setting. Phase II will not
      begin without the establishment of safety in Phase I.

      There are 2 primary study aims that this research will address. The first study aim will be
      to determine whether use of Afrezza inhaled insulin with ultra-fast kinetics will improve the
      performance of a closed-loop (CL) system, both with respect to immediate post-prandial
      hyperglycemia and the subsequent late post-prandial hypoglycemia as compared to hybrid CL
      (HCL) with subcutaneous (SC) rapid-acting insulin (RAI) pre-meal bolus.

      The second study aim will be to examine the efficiency and feasibility of Afrezza inhaled
      insulin as a pre-meal bolus and a missed meal correction bolus on mitigating post-prandial
      blood glucose control during outpatient CL therapy.

      This study will test the hypothesis that Afrezza inhaled insulin given before a meal to mimic
      physiologic first phase insulin release will limit the magnitude and rate of rise of glucose
      levels following a meal and will achieve greater percent time spent within target blood
      glucose range as compared to conventional hybrid CL therapy without inhaled insulin both in
      the in-clinic research and outpatient real-life setting.
