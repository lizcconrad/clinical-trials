  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to compare two different approaches for treating patients
      with stress urinary incontinence: neuromuscular re-education, impairment-based exercise and
      electric dry needling versus neuromuscular re-education and impairment-based exercise.
      Physical therapists commonly use all of these techniques to treat stress urinary
      incontinence. This study is attempting to find out if one treatment strategy is more
      effective than the other.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with stress urinary incontinence will be randomized to receive 2 treatment sessions
      per week for up to 6 weeks (8-12 sessions total) of either: (1) neuromuscular re-education,
      impairment-based exercise and electric dry needling (2) neuromuscular re-education and
      impairment-based exercise

    <measure>Incontinence Impact Questionnaire - Short Form IIQ-7</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 weeks, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>7 questions, each worth 0-3 points. The average score of items responded to is calculated, then multiplied by 33 1/3 to put the scores on a scale of 0 to 100. High scores indicate greater impact of incontinence.</description>

    <measure>Global Rating of Change Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>15 point self-report scale (-7 to 7). High rating indicates a greater impact of change</description>

    <measure>Urogenital Distress Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 weeks, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>6 questions, each worth 0-3 points. The raw score is divided by 6 then multiplied by 25 for the total score. High scores indicate more distress due to bladder symptoms.</description>

    <description>sEMG targeting type I slow-twitch fibers and type II fast-twitch fibers. Type I fibers maintain continuous muscle activity over prolonged periods of time; therefore, training of type I fibers will be achieved through endurance and repetition training of the pelvic floor muscles. Type II fibers are recruited during sudden increases in intra-abdominal pressure, and these fibers will be recruited with &quot;The Knack&quot; training. The Knack is a term created to use rhythm or timing to the pelvic floor. Neuromuscular re-education will be performed during the first treatment, but it will be performed &quot;as needed&quot; on subsequent treatments.</description>
