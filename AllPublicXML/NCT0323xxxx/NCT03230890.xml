  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects associated with the use of in-office
      High-resolution, relational, resonance-based, electroencephalic mirroring (HIRREM) for
      participants with symptoms of military-related traumatic stress. This is a single site,
      non-randomized, open label pilot study. Outcome measures collected before, and after the
      intervention evaluate effects on self-reported symptoms, autonomic cardiovascular regulation,
      functional measures, blood and saliva biomarkers of stress and inflammation, and network
      connectivity on whole brain, rest MRI testing. Self-reported symptom outcomes will also be
      collected remotely at 1, 3, and 6 months after completion of intervention. The study will
      assess feasibility in this cohort, focused on the Special Operations community, will provide
      estimates of effect size, and durability of symptom changes, while providing important pilot
      data for future proposals and investigations.

    <time_frame>Data for the primary symptom outcome is collected at enrollment, and immediately following completion of the HIRREM intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>The PTSD Checklist (PCL) - Civilian (C) and Military (M) is a symptom checklist to measure stress severity due to a traumatic experience, in civilian or military settings, respectively. The PCL measures the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM-IV) Criteria B, C, &amp; D of PTSD symptoms based on traumatic life experience. Seventeen items are rated on a Likert scale with a composite score range of 17 to 85. Primary outcome for this pilot study will be change in PCL-M score from baseline to the immediate post-intervention in-person data collection at the completion of the HIRREM intervention. Outcomes with the PCL-M will also be collected remotely at 1, 3, and 6 months following completion of the intervention.</description>

To quantify DNA methylation at each site, investigators will use the HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (Illumina, Inc.), which targets over 485,000 CpG sites at single-nucleotide resolution, and the HiScan Reader (Illumina, Inc.). This microarray assays CpG sites from 99% of the RefSeq genes, with an average of 17 CpG sites per gene region distributed across the promoter, 5'UTR, first exon, gene body, and 3'UTR. The methylation proportion for each site (beta value) is based on the ratio of the fluorescence intensity of the methylated versus the combined methylated and unmethylated probes, and will be determined with GenomeStudio (Illumina, Inc.). A ratio of 0 equals no methylation and a ratio of 1 equals total (100%) methylation.</description>

    <description>HIRREM is a closed-loop, allostatic, acoustic stimulation neurotechnology intended to support auto-calibration of neural oscillations. The core technology is commercially available as a technique for relaxation. Scalp sensors monitor brain frequencies and amplitudes, and in real time, software algorithms translate specific frequencies into audible tones of varying pitch. These are reflected via earbuds in as little as 4-8 milliseconds. The in-office intervention for this study is administered as a series of up to twenty four, typically 1.5-2 hours sessions, comprised of 4-10 protocols (some eyes open, some eyes closed), lasting 6-40 minutes each, working at different scalp locations. Sessions are received over 12 days. Two sessions can be done in a half day. The intervention is received while comfortably seated in a zero gravity chair.</description>
