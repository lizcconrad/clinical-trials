  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Canada, over 102,900 men are diagnosed with cancer each year. Of these, 81,000 are
      diagnosed with colorectal cancer and an estimated 65% are expected to survive the disease for
      at least 5 years. Men who have completed treatment for colorectal cancer face many adverse
      physical, cognitive, psychological, and social effects. The Wellness Beyond Cancer Program at
      The Ottawa Hospital is a cancer survivorship program that helps people who have completed
      treatment for cancer, including men diagnosed with colorectal cancer, manage these effects.
      The Wellness Beyond Cancer Program does this through education and referral to supportive
      care services and programs offered throughout the city of Ottawa.

      Group-based physical activity programs are one of the varied services and programs available
      to adults diagnosed with cancer in Ottawa. Such programs are offered through the Ottawa
      Regional Cancer Foundation (http://www.ottawacancer.ca) and Breast Cancer Action Ottawa
      (http://bcaott.ca). Research on these programs show that group-based physical activity can
      improve disease and treatment-related effects while promoting overall quality of life amongst
      women with cancer. However, few of these programs have targeted men, even though their needs
      and preferences have been shown to be very different from women. While men diagnosed with
      colorectal cancer might also benefit from group-based physical activity programs offered in
      the community, it is not known if such programs would effectively reach them and what the
      impact would be on their quality of life after cancer treatment.

      It is believed that a men's group-based walking program could be an effective way to reach
      men and promote quality of life after cancer treatment. Therefore, a sustainable 8-week
      group-based walking program was developed. This project will seek to explore the feasibility
      and potential benefits of the program among men who have completed treatment for colorectal
      cancer and who are referred to the program from staff at the Wellness Beyond Cancer Program
      in a prospective single-arm trial.

    <description>The walking prescription will be progressive in nature. The program will begin with participants walking for approximately 20 minutes in weeks 1-3.

The program will promote walking at a moderate intensity as assessed by Borg's Rating of Perceived Exertion scale. Each session will be preceded by a brief warm-up and followed by a brief cool-down period.</description>
