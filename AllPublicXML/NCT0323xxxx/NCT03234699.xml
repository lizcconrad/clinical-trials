  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aimed to investigate the influence of cenobamate on the activity of CYP3A4/5,
      CYP2B6, CYP2C19, and CYP2C9 by using drugs recommended by both the FDA and EMA as in vivo
      probes. In order to avoid a potential pharmacokinetic interaction between the probes,
      midazolam (CYP3A), warfarin (CYP2C9), and omeprazole (CYP2C19) will be administered together
      as a validated cocktail and separately from bupropion (CYP2B6) using an adequate washout time
      period between the 2 assessments.

      The starting daily dose of cenobamate will be 12.5 mg, which will be administered for 2
      weeks. Then, daily cenobamate doses will be increased every 2 weeks to 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg,
      150 mg, and 200 mg. The CYP probes will be tested before cenobamate administration, at steady
      state at 100mg/day of cenobamate for midazolam only and finally at steady state at 200mg/day
      of cenobamate for all CYP probes.

      The results of this DDI study will provide a basis to make appropriate dose recommendation
      for a safe use of concomitant drugs with cenobamate using these isoenzymes in their metabolic
      pathway.
