      Comparison of heartburn or epigastric pain severity following administration of Neobianacid®
      (Group B) or omeprazole (Group A) from day 0 to day 27. An ad-hoc placebo will be also
      administered in both treatment arms. Then, a following phase (day 28-55) will follows in
      which Neobianacid® will be administered (on demand) to both treatment arms.
