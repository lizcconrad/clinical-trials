  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Purpose Project intervention is an 8-session progressive structure that was developed
      based on theoretical and scientific evidence from psychology and occupational therapy. The
      goal of the intervention is to provide participants with information, tools, and support that
      help them move towards reclaiming a sense of self-grounded purpose in daily life. The study
      will use a convenience sample of women with breast cancer to evaluate the feasibility of the
      Purpose Project intervention in terms of demand/acceptability, implementation, and
      limited-efficacy testing. Findings will be used to inform a later study to evaluate the
      efficacy of the Purpose Project intervention.

    <description>The purpose project intervention 8-session group intervention that integrates education, support, self-reflection, and action-expectation to help people reaffirm or reconstruct self-grounded purpose after significant life events/transitions. The 8 sessions extend over 2-3 months, with 7 weekly sessions and the final session 1 month after Session 7. The intervention is structured around the 6 dimensions of flourishing (autonomy, self-acceptance, personal growth, relationships, purpose in life, external mastery), the goal of which is to help people enact behaviors that move them forward in reframing a sense of self and reaffirming or reconstructing a sense of purpose in life that helps them flourish.</description>
