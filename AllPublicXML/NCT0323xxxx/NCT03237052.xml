  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multi-centre study will evaluate the clinical efficacy of 3 atypical antipsychotics
      treatment in Chinese Patients with Schizophrenia by comparing model-decision with real-world
      psychiatrist-decision. The three atypical antipsychotics are olanzapine (5-20 milligram per
      day), risperidone (2-6 milligram per day) and aripiprazole (5-30 milligram per day). The main
      purpose of this study is to explore the potential difference between modal-aided-decision
      with clinician-decision in order to validate and optimize the selection model that has been
      established in advance.

      The efficacy evaluations include symptoms, social function, recurrence rate and
      hospitalization. Visits occurs at 0, 4, 8, 13, 26, 52 weeks.
