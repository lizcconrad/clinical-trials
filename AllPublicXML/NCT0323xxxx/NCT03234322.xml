  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Little evidence exists on the impact of diabetes risk scores, e.g. on physicians and
      patient's behavior, perceived risk of persons, shared-decision making and particularly on
      patient´s health. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of a non-invasive
      diabetes risk prediction model in the primary health care setting as component of routine
      health checks on change in physical activity.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes risk scores are predictive models to estimate the probability for an individual to
      develop diabetes within a defined time period. In the last years, many diabetes risk
      prediction models were developed worldwide. It has been proposed that using diabetes risk
      scores as first step of diabetes screening is more practical than blood glucose tests as the
      latter are time consuming and costly. Given the rapid development of diabetes risk scores and
      a simultaneous reluctance of primary care physicians (PCPs) to implement diabetes risk scores
      in everyday practice, there is an urgent need to expand our knowledge of the impact of
      diabetes risk scores in the primary health care setting. Thus, the aim of the study is to
      investigate the impact of a non-invasive risk prediction model in the primary health care
      setting as component of routine health checks on change in physical activity.

    <description>The risk prediction model will be integrated into a routine health check. The diabetes risk prediction model contains modifiable non-invasive risk factors and consists of eleven questions on age, height, waist circumference, hypertension, physical activity, smoking status, intake of whole-grain bread, intake of red meat, coffee consumption, and family history of diabetes (parents and siblings) to predict the five-year diabetes risk. The filled diabetes risk score will be used in the counseling interview with the PCP at the end of the health check as a practical guide to discuss individual tailored preventive strategies.</description>
