  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of daratumumab when combined
      with Velcade (bortezomib) and dexamethasone (DVd) to that of Velcade and dexamethasone (Vd),
      in terms of progression free survival (PFS) in Chinese participants with relapsed or
      refractory multiple myeloma (MM).

    <description>EQ-5D-5L is a 5 item questionnaire that assesses 5 domains including mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression plus a visual analog scale rating &quot;health today&quot; with anchors ranging from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state). The scores for the 5 dimensions are used to compute a single utility score ranging from zero (0.0) to 1 (1.0), with higher values representing better general health status of the individual.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Weeks 8 and 16 post PD (Approximately up to 4.5 years)</time_frame>
    <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 is a cancer-specific measure of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) that includes 30 items resulting in 5 functional scales (physical functioning, role functioning, emotional functioning, cognitive functioning, and social functioning), 1 Global Health Status scale, 3 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and pain), and 6 single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties). The recall period is 1 week (the past week). Scores are transformed to a 0 to 100 scale. A higher score for the global health status scale represents greater quality of life, a higher score for a functional scale represents greater functioning, and a higher score for a symptom scale/item represents more symptomatology/problems.</description>
