  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with terminal chronic kidney disease (CRD) need renal function supplementation,
      namely dialysis or renal transplantation. Transplantation is the most efficient and
      cost-effective treatment. Early and equitable access to transplantation is a public health
      issue. Access to transplantation is facilitated by early and systematic information and
      assessment of patients for inclusion in the national waiting list for transplantation prior
      to the onset of dialysis, and by the development of transplantation from living donors. In
      France, there are wide disparities in access to national waiting list registration and
      transplantation. One of the causes of these inequalities in access would be the disparity in
      referral practices to a transplant medical and surgical team authorized to register the
      individual on the national waiting list.

      The aim of the TRACE study is to evaluate the impact of a new regional organization promoting
      renal transplantation on access to renal transplantation.
