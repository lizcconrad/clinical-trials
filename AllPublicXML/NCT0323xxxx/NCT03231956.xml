  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the relationship between initial ClearSight™ derived hemodynamic parameters
      and outcomes (death, ongoing organ dysfunction or delayed ICU admission) in patients with
      acute infection and possible sepsis, with a focus on venous blood lactate (&lt; 2.0, 2.0-3.9,
      and ≥ 4.0 mmol/dL) and hemodynamic subgroups, using ED patients presenting with minor
      infections or asthma/COPD exacerbations as controls (henceforth referred to as Sepsis Mimic
      Group).

      Laboratory specimens to be collected include blood and will be analyzed for lactate at a
      central clinical research laboratory (WSU Integrative Biosciences, Detroit, MI).
      Additionally, plasma samples will be obtained for and stored at the WSU Biobank to support
      potential future clinical and translational research. Samples for the purpose of the WSU
      Biobank are optional to the clinical research participant and will not adversely affect
      participation in the clinical trial.
