      The goal of this study is to identify the thoughts and perceptions of pharmacy access to
      hormonal contraception among rural women and pharmacists. This will be key in order to
      address concerns or perceived barriers in order to inform the implementation of this program.

      There are no studies examining New Mexico pharmacists' interest in prescribing hormonal
      contraceptives or rural New Mexican women's support for pharmacist prescribed hormonal
      contraceptives. However, some states where pharmacists already prescribe contraception have
      experienced difficulties in implementing the education, infrastructure, and financial support
      necessary to provide hormonal contraception in the community pharmacy setting. Nationwide,
      68% of women reported that they would utilize pharmacist prescribed hormonal contraception
      and cited benefits such as convenient hours and locations of pharmacies. The goal of this
      study is to identify the thoughts and perceptions of pharmacy access to hormonal
      contraception among rural women and pharmacists. This will be key in order to address
      concerns or perceived barriers in order to inform the implementation of this program.
