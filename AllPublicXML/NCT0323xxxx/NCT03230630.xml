  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pre-clinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that melatonin has cardio-protection
      effects. Melatonin has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antihypertensive, antithrombotic and
      antilipaemic properties, which plays important roles in a variety of cardiovascular
      pathophysiologic processes. Nocturnal melatonin levels decreased after AMI, and lower serum
      melatonin concentrations after AMI are associated with more heart failure and cardiac death
      and left ventricular remodeling. Moreover in women with increased BMI, lower melatonin
      secretion is associated with higher risks of MI. Early-morning blood collection is easier in
      clinical practice. Therefore, the investigators carried out a cohort study to evaluate the
      prognostic value of plasma soluble melatonin in hospitalized patients with acute myocardial
      infarction (AMI).
