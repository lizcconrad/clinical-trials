  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The most recent conflicts are creating a new generation of Veterans, including an increasing
      number of women Veterans, who present with comorbid PTSD and chronic pain conditions,
      including Fibromyalgia (FM), from deployment-related physical injuries and exposure to
      psychological trauma. Health behavior change is important in treating these conditions and
      proactively preventing long-term negative health sequelae, in order to benefit these Veterans
      directly and reduce the challenges to our healthcare system. The proposed SPiRE application
      will use an innovative translational research approach to study whether a progressive -based
      exercise program will reduce FM pain in patients with PTSD and to elucidate and modify
      potential PTSD-related deficiencies in neurobiological and psychological responses to
      exercise to optimize the physical and psychological benefits of exercise for these
      individuals.

      This study will compare the effects of a 12-week progressive exercise training program on 1)
      Fibromyalgia (FM) pain and PTSD symptoms, 2) pain threshold and tolerance, and 3) relevant
      biomarkers and neuromodulators including: a) anti-stress, anti-nociceptive, immune modulating
      factors such as neuropeptide Y (NPY) and GABAergic neuroactive steroids such as
      allopregnanolone and pregnanolone (together termed ALLO) b) factors that upregulate the
      expression of NPY and the GABAergic neuroactive steroids, and otherwise modulate
      inflammation, such as cortisol, c) excitatory factors such as substance P that directly
      promote pain transduction and d) pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-8 that not
      only increase pain and inflammation, but also contribute to psychological dysfunction (e.g.
      anhedonia and depression) via impact on the CNS reward system. This study will focus on
      Veterans with FM/PTSD. The study design includes a baseline, acute, cardiopulmonary exercise
      assessment (CPX) that will inform the exercise prescription for a 12-week &quot;progressive
      exercise&quot; training program, comprised of three 30-45 minute exercise sessions per week
      (walking or running, depending on the ability/capacity of the participant). Exercise sessions
      will be initially supervised by an exercise physiologist in the Clinical Studies Unit (CSU)
      at the VA Boston Healthcare System and then each participant will transition into the home.
      Weekly telephone calls by the PI will provide additional motivational support and problem
      solving. Implementation of the prescribed exercise regimen will also be supported by the use
      of heart rate and actigraph monitors programmed for the participant to achieve their
      prescribed heart rate range (HRR). Finally, an &quot;endpoint&quot; CPX assessment will occur at week
      13 to track changes in psychological and neurobiological factors and to delineate their
      impact on pain and PTSD symptoms. Both CPX, maximum load, exercise tests will be performed in
      accordance with guidelines published by the American College of Cardiology. Among Veterans
      with FM/PTSD, changes in the biomarkers assessed after acute, CPX exercise testing will be
      associated with improvements in pain and PTSD symptoms.

      Once identified, such biomarkers could be augmented by modification of the exercise regimen
      to help enhance the anti-stress hormone levels for the FM/PTSD population and experience
      clinically significant reductions in their symptoms. To obtain sufficient power, 36
      participants (18/year) will be recruited. Data from this pilot work will be used to
      demonstrate feasibility and inform the further development of individually prescribed
      exercise regimens and a motivationally based exercise behavior change intervention aimed at
      reducing chronic musculoskeletal pain, including FM, and PTSD symptoms in Veterans. In the
      short-term, this SPiRE proposal will allow the PI to develop a more effective, motivationally
      based, exercise behavior change protocol that fosters long-term exercise adherence in
      patients with FM/PTSD. In the long-term, this intervention will be used as an adjunct to
      cognitive interventions for these disorders to be further developed and studied via a larger
      VA, NIH, or DOD-funded grant for which the PI will apply year 2 of the current SPiRE
      proposal.

    <description>The FIQR has been found to be a useful and brief instrument to assess the overall impact and severity of FM.
The FIQR consists of 21-items that assess pain, fatigue, stiffness, sleep, depression, memory, anxiety, balance, and environment sensitivity.
All items are framed in the past 7 days and are scored on an 11-point numeric rating scores of 0 to 10.
The total score ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores representing greater symptom burden and functional limitations.</description>

    <time_frame>Two Years</time_frame>
    <description>This 30-item structured interview is designed to assess both the 17 symptoms of PTSD and the 8 hypothesized associated features. The scale yields a dichotomous diagnosis of PTSD, and also provides a continuous score of frequency and severity for each symptom. In addition, a behaviorally anchored probe question is provided for each symptom to increase the reliability of administration. The CAPS-5 is currently in the process of being validated however its previous version demonstrated excellent sensitivity (.81) and specificity (.95).57</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Only participants in whom a physical examination and medical history indicate that the
             participant meets current diagnostic criteria for FM, as specified by the American
             College of Rheumatology, will be eligible for the study.

          -  Eligible participants who agree to a blood draw for measurement of biomarkers, must be
             free of medications and other substances (e.g., illicit drugs and alcohol) that may
             alter results for 2-6 weeks depending on the medication and frequency of use (which
             must be cleared by MD consultants).

          -  If on pain medications with short half-lives, participants must be off of them for 5
             half-lives before testing, generally about 24 hours.

          -  Any FM participant with an ICD-10 chronic pain diagnosis of a musculoskeletal
             etiology, will also be eligible for inclusion in the study as many individuals with FM
             also have such conditions.

          -  Any participant with a confirmed psychiatric diagnosis of PTSD will be included in the
             study. Individuals in the PTSD group must meet diagnostic criteria for current chronic
             PTSD (&gt;3 months) as assessed by the CAPS-5, 1-Month Diagnostic Version.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants will be excluded from participation in the study if they have a life
             threatening or acute physical illness (e.g., cancer)

          -  Current schizophreniform illnesses (except for Psychosis NOS due to PTSD-related
             sensory hallucinations)

          -  Untreated bipolar disorder

          -  Or active suicidal or homicidal ideation requiring clinical intervention

          -  Individuals with current or past alcohol and/or substance dependence (less than three
             months from date of screening assessment) will be excluded

          -  Individuals seeking interventional pain treatment, such as surgical interventions or
             other pain clinic interventions, will also be excluded unless they agree to
             participate in the biomarker procedure prior to the start of their pain intervention.

          -  Finally, participants who have a neuropathic origin to their pain will be excluded.
