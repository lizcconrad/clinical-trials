      The registry study aims to determine serial biomarkers to diagnosis and prognosis of aortic
      aneurysm/aortic dissection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to investigate the role of candidate biomarkers in the diagnosis and prognosis
      of AA and AD. In the diagnosis part, we begin with a discovery phase where individually
      matched case-control study. Patients within each disease outcomes (i.e. AD, AMI, PE, AA
      without AD and healthy controls) are age and sex matched and retrospectively included.In the
      prognosis part of the study, patients with confirmed AA and AD are enrolled. The primary
      outcome is the all-cause mortality based on the death certificates. The secondary outcome is
      the in-hospital mortality according to the patients'medical records.

AMI if they had chest pain lasting &gt;20 min, diagnostic serial ECG changes comprising new pathological Q waves or ST-segment and T-wave changes, and a plasma creatine kinase-MB elevation greater than twice the normal level or cardiac troponin I (cTnI) level greater than 0.1 ng/mL.
Diagnosis of PE was confirmed by positive spiral computed tomography or pulmonary angiography, a high probability on ventilation perfusion scintigraphy, or a proximal deep vein thrombosis documented on compression ultrasonography or angiography.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Retrospective

          -  All patients who were referred to the surgical service for evaluation and management
             of aortic dissection were included.

        Perspective

          -  Patients with initial suspicion of having AAD were perspectively enrolled.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Retrospective

          -  Patients who received packed red blood cells, whole blood, or platelets less than 10
             days before the blood sample was taken;

          -  Patients with aortic trauma, pseudo aneurysm, history of heart failure, renal
             dysfunction, severe pulmonary diseases, or active cancer;

          -  Patients who entered the hospital for checkups after surgery.

        Perspective

          -  Patients in whom there is little or no suspicion of a life-threatening disease;

          -  Patients with confirmed acute myocardial infarction,angina or pulmonary embolism

          -  The symptoms were clearly not related to AD (e.g. pleurisy, pneumonia, acute abdominal
             diseases).
