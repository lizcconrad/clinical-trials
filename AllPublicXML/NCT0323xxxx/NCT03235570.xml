        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  First generation Japanese; subject was born in Japan and has not lived outside of
             Japan for a total of &gt; 10 years and subject can trace maternal and paternal Japanese
             ancestry.

          -  Part 1: Any histologically confirmed advanced solid tumor malignancy. Subjects
             enrolled at a lower dose level expansion cohort are required to have documented
             FGF/FGFR alterations and baseline and on-treatment tumor biopsy for testing of
             biomarkers.

          -  Part 2: Any histologically confirmed advanced solid tumor malignancy with a FGF/FGFR
             alteration

          -  Advanced or metastatic and recurrent cancer where an appropriate treatment option is
             not available.

          -  Life expectancy &gt; 12 weeks.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status: Part 1: 0 or 1; Part 2:
             0, 1, or 2.

          -  Genomic testing is mandatory for all enrolled subjects. Archival tumor specimen of at
             least 7 slides or willingness to undergo a pretreatment tumor biopsy to provide a
             tumor block or at least 7 unstained slides. Archival tumor biopsies are acceptable at
             baseline and should be no more than 2 years old (preferably less than 1 year old and
             collected since the completion of the last treatment); subjects with samples older
             than 2 years old and/or with sequencing report from the central laboratory require
             approval from the sponsor medical monitor for exemption from tumor biopsy or tumor
             sample requirement.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Treatment with other investigational study drug for any indication for any reason, or
             receipt of anticancer medications within 21 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer)
             before first dose of study drug (6 weeks for mitomycin-C or nitrosoureas, 7 days for
             tyrosine kinase inhibitors).

          -  Prior receipt of a selective FGFR inhibitor.

          -  Laboratory and medical history parameters outside Protocol-defined range.

          -  History and/or current evidence of ectopic mineralization/calcification including but
             not limited to soft tissue, kidneys, intestine, myocardia, or lung, excepting
             calcified lymph nodes and asymptomatic arterial or cartilage/tendon calcification.

          -  Current evidence of corneal disorder/keratopathy including but not limited to
             bullous/band keratopathy, corneal abrasion, inflammation/ulceration,
             keratoconjunctivitis, confirmed by ophthalmologic examination.
