  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study objective is to demonstrate safety and feasibility of the CORolla® TAA during 12
      months of follow up, and to evaluate the performance of the therapy in relieving symptoms and
      restore diastolic function in patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction.
