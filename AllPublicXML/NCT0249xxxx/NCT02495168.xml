    <textblock>
      A randomized multiple-dose, placebo-controlled, parallel group design consisting of a 2-week
      run-in period followed by a 6-week treatment period of the placebo, Test product (Budesonide
      80 mcg / Formoterol fumarate dihydrate 4.5 mcg), or Reference product Symbicort® inhalation
      aerosol.

      This is a pivotal trial that will examine therapeutic equivalence of a new generic fixed-dose
      combination product containing Budesonide 80 mcg / Formoterol fumarate dihydrate 4.5 mcg and
      reference listed drug (RLD) Symbicort® inhalation aerosol in adult patients with chronic but
      stable asthma as defined in National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Expert Panel
      Report 3 (NAEPP 3) guidelines. To ensure adequate study sensitivity the test and reference
      products should both be statistically superior to placebo (p&lt;0.05) with regard to the
      bioequivalent study primary endpoints.

             participating in the study, must commit to consistent and correct use of an acceptable
             method of birth control (at the Investigator's discretion) throughout the study and
             for 30 days after study drug discontinuation.

          4. Male patients and male partners of female patients (WOCBP) must commit to consistent
             and correct use of an acceptable method of birth control (at the Investigator's
             discretion) throughout the study and for 30 days after the study drug discontinuation.

          5. Diagnosed with asthma as defined by the NAEPP 3 at least 6 months prior to screening.
             If the patient is new to the study site, the Investigator must confirm the patient's
             asthma diagnosis. Acceptable means include either medical records or pharmacy records.

          6. Moderate to severe asthma with a pre-bronchodilator FEV1 of ≥45% and ≤85% of the
             predicted normal value during measured at least 6 hours after short-acting β agonist
             (SABA) and at least 24 hours after the last dose of long-acting β agonist (LABA) at
             the screening visit (Visit 1) and on the first day of treatment (prior to
             randomization at Visit 2).

          7. Currently non-smoking, negative for urine cotinine at screening, having not used
             tobacco products (i.e., cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco, electronic cigarettes)

             ≥10% reversibility at Visit 1, the site may instruct the patient to hold LABA and/or
             inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and return up to 7 days later for a repeat test. Only 1

             calculated using Bazett's formula.

         17. Willing to give written informed consent/assent, and willing and able to follow the
             study rules and procedures.

         18. Stable on chronic asthma treatment regimen for at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment.

             intubation, and/or associated with hypercapnea, respiratory arrest or hypoxic
             seizures, asthma-related syncopal episode(s), or hospitalizations within the past year
             or during the Run-in Period.

          2. Exercise-induced asthma as the only asthma-related diagnosis.

          3. Evidence or history of clinically significant disease or abnormality including
             congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled coronary artery

             current evidence of significant hematologic, hepatic, neurologic, psychiatric, renal,
             or other diseases that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would put the patient at
             risk through study participation, or would affect the study analyses if the disease
             exacerbated during the study. Patients with well-controlled hypertension, diabetes or
             hypercholesterolemia are not excluded as long as their medication does not interfere
             with the study.

          4. Any other clinically significant pulmonary disease except for asthma, including
             chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), interstitial lung disease, cystic
             fibrosis, bronchiectasis, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, active pulmonary

             weeks.

          6. Patients with hypersensitivity to any sympathomimetic drug (e.g., formoterol,
             albuterol/salbutamol, or salmeterol) or any inhaled, intranasal, or systemic
             corticosteroid therapy.

          7. Patients taking medication(s) (either daily or as needed) with the potential to affect
             the course of asthma or to interact with sympathomimetic amines, e.g.,:

               1. Oral β-blockers.

               2. Strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir).

               3. Monoclonal antibodies/Biologic agents which may affect the course of asthma (such
                  as mepolizumab, reslizumab, lebrikizumab, and others).

         11. History of alcohol or drug abuse within the last 6 months.

         12. A positive urine drug screen at Visit 1. Exceptions are made for a positive urine drug
             screen at Visit 1 for opiates or stimulants if there is a documented prescription with
             supporting medical history and diagnosis, and the Principal Investigator assesses
             there are no safety concerns with patient participation. Screened patients with a
             urine drug screen positive for Marijuana/Tetrahydrocannabinol are not eligible for
             study participation, without exceptions. Repeat drug screening is not allowed.

         13. Have received any investigational treatment within 30 days (or within 5 terminal
             half-lives of the investigational drug whichever is longer) of the screening visit or

             completed.

         14. Be an Investigator, employee, or otherwise be directly affiliated with the study site,
             Watson Laboratories Inc. and affiliates, or service provider involved in the study

             immediate family member is defined as spouse, parent, child or sibling, whether
             biological or legally adopted or in foster care).

         15. Non-compliance with the study requirements, rules, and procedures.
