  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of QBX258, a compound developed by
      Novartis Corporation composed of two antibodies, in reducing arm volume excess in women with
      stage I-II breast cancer related lymphedema.

    <description>Therapeutic volume changes in the arm will be calculated using the methods published by Anderson et al (2000).65 Briefly, the difference in volume measurements between the normal and lymphedematous arms at baseline (i.e volume excess) will be compared to the volume differential after drug treatment and following the washout period using the following formula:
(VL-VN) B - (VL-VN) F</description>

    <description>This will be a single arm, open label design pilot study, aiming to test the efficacy of QBX258, a combination of two fully human monoclonal antibodies that neutralize the biologic activity of interleukin 4 and interleukin 13 (IL4/IL13), for the treatment of stage I or II breast cancer related upper extremity lymphedema (BCRL).</description>

    <description>Once patients are registered for the trial, they will be treated with QBX258 (VAK694 3mg/kg and QAX576 6mg/kg) delivered via peripheral intravenous injection once every 4 weeks (+ 1 week) for 4 treatments.</description>
