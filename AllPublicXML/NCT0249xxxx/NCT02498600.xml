      This randomized phase II trial studies how well nivolumab works with or without ipilimumab in
      treating patients with epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer that
      has not responded after prior treatment (persistent) or has come back (recurrent). Monoclonal
      antibodies, such as nivolumab and ipilimumab, may block tumor growth in different ways by
      targeting certain cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the proportion of patients who have objective tumor response (complete or
      partial) by modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 in patients
      with persistent or recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, primary peritoneal cancers,
      treated with nivolumab or the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab and to assess the
      difference in objective response rate (ORR) between patients treated with nivolumab versus
      those treated with the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the progression-free survival (PFS) hazard ratio for patients treated with
      nivolumab versus those treated with the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab.

      II. To estimate and compare the duration of overall survival (OS) for patients treated with
      nivolumab or the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab.

      III. To determine the frequency and severity of adverse events associated with treatment with
      nivolumab or the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab as assessed by Common Terminology
      Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether cellular and molecular laboratory parameters in pre-treatment tissue
      and peripheral blood specimens predict overall survival (OS), tumor response by modified
      RECIST 1.1, and progression-free survival (PFS):

      II. Integrated Biomarker: Programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in tumor cells
      and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) measured by quantitative immunohistochemistry
      (IHC).

      III. Natural anti-tumor immunity in tumor cells and TILs measured using IHC and T cell
      repertoire analyses.

      IV. Tumor &quot;immunogenicity&quot; as determined by the neo-epitope landscape using next-generation
      whole exome sequencing (NGS).

      V. Anti-tumor immune response in peripheral blood, including serologic responses and analysis
      of T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires by deep sequencing.

      VI. Shift in quantitative laboratory peripheral blood parameters after the first 6 and 12
      weeks of therapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups.

      GROUP I:

      INDUCTION: Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes every 2 weeks.
      Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE: Patients receive nivolumab IV over 60 minutes every 2 weeks. Treatment repeats
      every 4 weeks for up to 21 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      GROUP II:

      INDUCTION: Patients receive nivolumab IV over 60 minutes and ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes.
      Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE: Patients receive nivolumab IV over 60 minutes every 2 weeks. Treatment repeats
      every 4 weeks for up to 21 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 100 days, every 3 months
      for 2 years, and then every 6 months for 3 years.

             with rheumatoid arthritis and other arthropathies, Sjogren's syndrome and psoriasis
             controlled with topical medication and patients with positive serology, such as
             antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-thyroid antibodies should be evaluated for the
             presence of target organ involvement and potential need for systemic treatment but
             should otherwise be eligible

          -  Patients are permitted to enroll if they have vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus,
             residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone replacement
             (such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis), psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or

             event)

          -  Patients should be excluded if they have a condition requiring systemic treatment with
             either corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other

             topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses =&lt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents

             use topical, ocular, intra-articular, intranasal, and inhalational corticosteroids
             (with minimal systemic absorption); a brief course of corticosteroids for prophylaxis
             (e.g., contrast dye allergy) or for treatment of non-autoimmune conditions (e.g.,
             delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction caused by contact allergen) is permitted

          -  Any of the following within 2 months of registration: active peptic ulcer disease,
             diverticulitis, cholecystitis, symptomatic cholangitis or appendicitis, malabsorption
