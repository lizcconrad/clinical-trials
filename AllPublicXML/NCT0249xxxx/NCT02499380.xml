  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this post-marketing study is to advance the understanding of the mechanism
      of action of the CE marked RePneu Coil by observing changes in lung physiology and cardiac
      performance in patients with emphysema treated with the RePneu Coils, when used as intended.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adult subjects diagnosed with emphysematous type of COPD.

          2. CT scan indicates bilateral emphysema, with sufficient lung parenchyma for coil
             deployment (based on PneumRx CT scoring) criteria.

          3. Subject has post-bronchodilator FEV1 ≤45% predicted.

          4. Subject has Total Lung Capacity &gt;100% predicted.

          5. Subject has residual volume (RV) ≥175% predicted.

          6. Subject has marked dyspnea scoring ≥2 on mMRC scale of 0-4.

          7. Subject read, understood and signed the Informed Consent form.

          8. Subject has received Pneumococcal and Influenza vaccinations consistent with local
             recommendations and/or policy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has co-morbidities that may significantly reduce subject's ability to improve
             exercise capacity (e.g. severe arthritis, planned knee surgery) or baseline limitation
             not due to dyspnea.

          2. Subject has a change in FEV1 &gt;20% (or, for subjects with pre-bronchodilator FEV1 below
             1 L, a change of &gt; 200 mL) post-bronchodilator unless investigator can confirm by
             other means that subject does not have asthma.

          3. Subject has severe gas exchange abnormalities as defined by:

               -  PaCO2 &gt;55 mm Hg

               -  PaO2 &lt;45 mm Hg on room air (High altitude criterion: PaO2 &lt;30 mm Hg)

          4. Subject has severe pulmonary hypertension defined by right ventricular systolic
             pressure &gt;50 mm Hg via right heart catheterization and/or echocardiogram.

          5. Subject has evidence of other severe disease (such as, but not limited to, lung cancer
             or renal failure), which in the judgment of the investigator may compromise survival
             of the subject for the duration of the study.

          6. Subject is pregnant or lactating, or plans to become pregnant within the study
             timeframe.

          7. Subject has an inability to tolerate bronchoscopy under moderate sedation or general
             anesthesia.

          8. Subject has clinically significant bronchiectasis.

          9. Subject has had previous LVR surgery, lung transplantation, lobectomy or other BLVR
             treatment in either lung.

         10. Subject has participated in studies to treat COPD using high dose radiation.

         11. Subject has been involved in pulmonary drug or device studies within 30 days prior to
             this study.

         12. Subject is chronically taking &gt;20 mg prednisone (or equivalent dose of a similar
             steroid) daily.

         13. Subject requires high level chronic immunomodulatory therapy to treat a moderate to
             severe chronic inflammatory autoimmune disorder.

         14. Subject is on any type of antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy which cannot be
             stopped for seven (7) days prior to procedure.

         15. Subject has a sensitivity or allergy to Nickel.

         16. Subject has a known sensitivity to drugs required to perform bronchoscopy.

         17. Subject has been diagnosed with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD).

         18. Subject has any other disease, condition(s) or habit(s) that would interfere with
             completion of study and follow-up assessments, would increase risks of bronchoscopy or
             assessments, or in the judgment of the investigator would potentially interfere with
             compliance to this study or would adversely affect study outcomes.
