      The investigators will develop a digital application (app)—&quot;rPlan dual protection&quot; (rPlan)—to
      be used in the clinic waiting room prior to a gynecological and/or contraceptive visit. The
      goal of this research is to develop the app and conduct a feasibility, acceptability and
      effectiveness assessment of rPlan to examine improvement in dual method use, enhancement of
      contraceptive adherence and continuation, increase of condom use and decrease of sexually
      transmitted infection (STI) and human immunodeficiency virus(HIV) infection. The research
      will consist of baseline activities as well as 6 week phone call and 12 week in-clinic survey
      and STI test, as well as a retrospective chart review.

    <textblock>
      Using the investigators' experience in digital media, behavior theory, client-centered
      interventions, and family planning, the investigators will develop a digital application
      (&quot;app&quot;)—rPlan—to be used in the clinic waiting room prior to a gynecological and/or
      contraceptive visit. The goal of this research is to develop the app and conduct a
      feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness assessment of rPlan.

      This study will develop rPlan, a three-part intervention that includes a precounseling app
      that promotes dual protection, motivational interviewing-informed counseling, and concomitant
      printed educational materials.

      The research will proceed in two phases. In Phase I, the investigators will assemble a
      10-member stakeholder advisory team to enhance the PreCounselor app to focus on dual
      protection, train reproductive health counselors in motivational interviewing, and create
      concomitant printed educational materials. In Phase II, the feasibility, acceptability, and
      effectiveness of the intervention will be assessed. The specific aims are to:

      Aim 1: Develop the rPlan intervention by (1) enhancing the pretested PreCounselor app to
      focus on dual protection, (2) training reproductive health counselors, and (3) creating
      concomitant printed educational materials.

      Aim 2: Conduct a pre/post feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness assessment of rPlan
      to examine improvement in dual method use, enhancement of contraceptive adherence and
      continuation, increase of condom use, and decrease of STI/HIV infection.

      The primary outcome is dual method use, which will be measured via patient report at 6 weeks
      and 12 weeks post enrollment. The secondary outcomes are contraceptive adherence/uptake
      (measured at 6 and 12 weeks post enrollment), frequency of unprotected penile-vaginal/anal
      intercourse (PVI/PAI) (measured at 6 and 12 weeks post enrollment, and risk reduction
      behaviors (measured at 6 and 12 weeks post enrollment), decisional balance/self-efficacy
      (measured at 12 weeks post enrollment), and STI infection (12 weeks post enrollment).

      The research will consist of baseline activities as well as 6 week phone call and 12 week
      in-clinic survey and STI test, as well as a retrospective chart review to capture interceding
      visits (e.g., initial contraceptive method selection, method switching, etc.) and diagnoses
      (e.g., pregnancy, STI/HIV).

    <description>Participants will complete a 10-15 minute questionnaire . After completing the questionnaire, a research assistant (RA) will provide a brief orientation to the rPlan app and use the rPlan app for up to 15 minutes. After viewing rPlan, participants will be asked a series of questions regarding the app's usability, helpfulness, and content appropriateness (10 min). The participant will also be given an STI test.</description>
