    <textblock>
      This Phase I/IIa study will test the combination of the epigenetic drug decitabine with the
      isoflavone genistein in children with leukemias and solid tumors. For the phase I study, the
      maximum tolerated dose will be evaluated in pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory
      leukemia and solid tumors. For the phase II study, only patients with relapsed or refractory
      leukemias will be included. To further evaluate the treatment efficacy and gain further
      insight into action of these drugs, the DNA methylation levels before and after treatment for
      all participants, pharmacokinetics parameters such as through level for decitabine and
      through and peak level for genistein will be measured. Pharmacogenomics testing for
      decitabine will be performed prior to cycle 1 of treatment.

      Decitabine will be administered over a 24 hours infusion on day 1 of cycle (28 days) and
      genistein will be taken orally twice daily from day 2 to 21, followed by a 7 days rest
      period.
