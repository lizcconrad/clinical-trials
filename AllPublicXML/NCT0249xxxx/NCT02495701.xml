  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Arthroscopic hip surgery is performed with traction on the leg to allow the surgeon to
      perform the surgical procedure. A retrospective study has described neuropraxia, ankle joint
      pain and a skin burn after surgery (1). Moreover, it has been described that surgeons
      performing the procedure have a learning curve related to the number of complications
      described postoperatively. At the investigators' institution, hip arthroscopies have been
      performed since 2010 and the 3 surgeons have 4-12 years of experience. During the past years,
      changes have been made to secure the best possible comfort for the patient during the
      arthroscopic procedure. Hence, there is a rationale for investigating complications after hip
      arthroscopy in a setting that is less affected by the surgeon's learning curve and with the
      patient comfort in focus.
