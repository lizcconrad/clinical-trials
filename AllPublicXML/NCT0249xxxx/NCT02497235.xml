  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the brain cholesterol 24S-hydroxylase (CH24H)
      enzyme occupancy of TAK-935 after single oral dose in healthy participants using the positron
      emission tomography (PET) ligand [18F]MNI-792 and PET imaging and to determine the
      relationship of occupancy to TAK-935 exposure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-935. TAK-935 is being tested to examine the
      degree and duration of brain CH24H enzyme occupancy/target engagement as a function of
      TAK-935 plasma concentration in order to guide dosing and schedule for future clinical trials
      with TAK-935. This study will utilize the PET ligand [18F]MNI-792 to evaluate the brain CH24H
      occupancy of TAK-935 after single dose oral administration in healthy adult participants. The
      study will evaluate up to 16 participants. The first 2 participants will take TAK-935 600 mg
      oral solution and undergo PET imaging using tracer [18F]MNI-792 up to 5 mcg (up to 370 MBq),
      injection, intravenously prior to each PET scan at Baseline, 45 minutes and 10 hours
      post-TAK-935 dose. TAK-935 dose and timing of post-dose scans for subsequent participants
      will be based on the data from the previous participants. This single-center trial will be
      conducted in the United States. The overall time to participate in this study is up to 55
      days. Participants will make 4 visits to the clinic, including 2 confinement periods to the
      clinic for PET imaging. Participants will be contacted by phone on Day 28 for follow-up
      safety assessments.

    <description>CH24H brain enzyme occupancy was obtained by graphical analysis of global occupancy plot. Global occupancy plot was calculated as: total volume of distribution [VT] (Baseline) - VT (Day 1) = Occupancy (Day 1) * (VT [Baseline] - non-displaceable volume of distribution [VND]), where VT (Baseline) and VT (Day 1) are the total distribution volumes obtained at Baseline and after TAK-935 administration, respectively and VND is the non-displaceable volume of distribution. The occupancy is determined as the slope of the linear regression of the plot, and the VND as the x-intercept. Data was reported only for TAK-935 600 mg because only first two participants were analyzed at 45 minutes post-TAK-935 dose.</description>

        <title>Cholesterol 24S-Hydroxylase (CH24H) Brain Enzyme Occupancy as a Function of TAK-935 Plasma Concentration at 45 Minutes Post-TAK-935 Dose</title>
        <description>CH24H brain enzyme occupancy was obtained by graphical analysis of global occupancy plot. Global occupancy plot was calculated as: total volume of distribution [VT] (Baseline) - VT (Day 1) = Occupancy (Day 1) * (VT [Baseline] - non-displaceable volume of distribution [VND]), where VT (Baseline) and VT (Day 1) are the total distribution volumes obtained at Baseline and after TAK-935 administration, respectively and VND is the non-displaceable volume of distribution. The occupancy is determined as the slope of the linear regression of the plot, and the VND as the x-intercept. Data was reported only for TAK-935 600 mg because only first two participants were analyzed at 45 minutes post-TAK-935 dose.</description>

          <title>CH24H Brain Enzyme Occupancy as a Function of TAK-935 Plasma Concentration at 2 Hours Post-TAK-935 Dose</title>
          <description>CH24H brain enzyme occupancy was obtained by graphical analysis of global occupancy plot. Global occupancy plot was calculated as: VT (Baseline) - VT (Day 1) = Occupancy (Day 1) * (VT [Baseline] - VND), where VT (Baseline) and VT (Day 1) are the total distribution volumes obtained at Baseline and after TAK-935 administration, respectively and VND is the non-displaceable volume of distribution. The occupancy is determined as the slope of the linear regression of the plot, and the VND as the x-intercept.</description>
