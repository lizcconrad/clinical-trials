      Rollover study supporting solid tumor and hematological disorder indications from Celgene
      sponsored CC-486 protocols eligible for participation in the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The open-label, multicenter, multinational rollover study is intended to evaluate the safety
      of CC-486, while providing continued treatment with CC-486 for subjects who are receiving
      single agent CC-486 at the time of transition to the rollover study and tolerated the
      protocol prescribed regimen in Celgene-sponsored trials, and whom in the opinion of the
      Investigator may derive clinical benefit from continuing treatment with CC-486. Subjects'
      survival will also be followed if required by the parent CC-486 study protocol. If approved
      by Celgene, subjects from any ongoing or future Celgene sponsored CC-486 studies in solid
      tumors and hematological disorders will be included in this protocol.

    <description>This study is an open-label, single-arm study and is divided into the screening period, treatment period and follow-up period. It is intended to evaluate the long-term safety of CC-486 and is to be taken at the same dose, schedule and frequency used from the last dose of CC-486 given in the parent study.</description>

    <description>The subject will continue at the same dose, frequency and schedule used for the last dose of CC-486 given in the preceding CC-486 study. Subjects are allowed to rollover after the last cycle is finished and before the new cycle begins in the parent protocol. There is a 7 day window from End of Study on the parent protocol and when the participant will start Day 1 of the rollover study.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Previously participated in, and received oral azacitidine, and continues to fulfill
             the eligibility criteria in one of the parent oral azacitidine clinical trials.

             The Investigator believes the subject is tolerating treatment with oral azacitidine
             monotherapy and continued oral azacitidine treatment is of benefit to the subject.

          2. Understand and voluntarily sign an informed consent document prior to any study
             related assessments or procedures being conducted.

          3. Willing and able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol
             requirements.

          4. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) may participate, provided they meet the
             following conditions:

               1. Have two negative pregnancy tests as verified by the Investigator prior to
                  starting study therapy. She must agree to ongoing pregnancy testing during the
                  course of the study, and after end of study treatment. This applies even if the
                  subject practices true abstinence from heterosexual contact.

               2. Either commit to true abstinence from heterosexual contact (which must be
                  reviewed on a monthly basis and source documented) or agree to use, and be able
                  to comply with, effective contraception without interruption, 28 days prior to
                  starting investigational product, during the study therapy (including dose
                  interruptions), and for 3 months, or longer if required by local regulations,
                  after discontinuation of study therapy.

          5. Male subjects must:

               1. Practice true abstinence (which must be reviewed on a monthly basis) or agree to
                  use a condom during sexual contact with a pregnant female or a female of
                  childbearing potential while participating in the study, during dose
                  interruptions and for at least 3 months, or longer if required by local

             rollover study, subjects must have been in a parent oral azacitidine study where
             monitoring for survival was required and have signed informed consent for follow-up
             phase.

          2. Understand and voluntarily sign an informed consent document for this study.

          3. Willing and able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol
             requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from receiving investigational
        product in the study:

             investigational agent after the last dose of oral azacitidine administered as part of
             the parent oral azacitidine study.

          3. Subjects have met one or more criteria for discontinuation as stipulated in the parent
             oral azacitidine study.

          4. Subjects received oral azacitidine in combination with another compound during a
             parent oral azacitidine study (Subjects form multi-arm parent oral azacitidine studies
             will be allowed to enroll into the rollover study, if the subject is receiving
             single-agent oral azacitidine at the time of transition into the rollover study).

          5. A subject's transition into rollover study â‰¥ 45 days after End of the Study visit of
             the parent oral azacitidine study
