      The Substance Abuse Treatment to HIV care (SAT2HIV) project, a Type 2
      Effectiveness-Implementation Hybrid Trial, seeks to address this gap in services by providing
      new knowledge regarding the effectiveness of brief intervention (BI) for substance use within
      community-based HIV/AIDS service settings, as well as new knowledge regarding how to address
      the well-documented underutilization of evidence-based practices in real-world settings. The
      specific aims of this project are: Aim 1: To experimentally test the effectiveness of a
      motivational interviewing-based BI for substance use within community-based HIV/AIDS service
      organizations, relative to usual care (UC). Aim 2: To experimentally test the effectiveness
      of adding an organizational-level implementation intervention called Implementation &amp;
      Sustainment Facilitation (ISF) to enhance the effectiveness of the implementation strategy
      currently used by SAMHSA-funded Addiction Technology Treatment Centers (ATTCs; i.e., online
      introductory training, 2-day training workshop, ongoing feedback and coaching).
