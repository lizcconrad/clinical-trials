    <textblock>
      In deep carious lesions, presenting risk of pulp exposition, a treatment option is the
      partial caries removal of carious tissue followed by provisional restoration, while this
      approach is called indirect pulp capping. The aim of this double-blinding controlled
      randomized clinical trial is to evaluate the success of indirect pulp capping using only
      resin-modified glass ionomer, while the additional layer of calcium hydroxide was used as
      control. The sample of 112 molars and/or premolars (n=56), presenting deep carious lesions,
      from patients with age between 15 and 30 years treated in dental clinic at Department of
      Dentistry of Federal University of Sergipe. The selected carious lesions must be reached 2/3
      of dentin, observed in bite-wing radiography, without pulp involving and/or other factor that
      to compromise the evaluation. After detailed anamneses, the selected teeth will be
      radiographed e all carious tissue from surrounding walls will be removed. At the floor of
      cavity, the carious tissue will be partially removed using hand dentin excavators, remaining
      the caries-affected dentin and avoiding the pulp exposition. The removed carious tissue from
      the floor of cavity will be evaluated for presence of Lactobacilos e Estreptococos Mutans,
      while the remaining dentin will be evaluated for consistency, colour and humidity. Randomly,
      the cavity will be provisionally restored with: Control - dress and cement of calcium
      hydroxide followed resin-modified glass ionomer; or Experimental - only resin-modified glass
      ionomer. The distance between the base of restoration and the pulp cavity cap will be
      measured by bitw-wing radiography. The patients will be re-evaluated after 15 days, while the
      teeth with compromised pulp vitality will be excluded from the study. The remaining patients
      will be evaluated after 6 months. The distance between the base of restoration and the pulp
      cavity cap will be measured again, followed by provisional restoration removal. The remaining
      caries-affected dentin from floor of cavity will be fully removed and a bacteriological
      evaluation performed. The consistency, colour and humidity of this tissue will be evaluated
      too. Finally, the permanent restorations will performed.
