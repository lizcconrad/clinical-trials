  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is looking to evaluate the efficacy of liposomal bupivicaine (Exparel) on
      decreasing the amount of consumed pain medications.

      Patients will be randomly selected to received either Exparel or standard bupivicaine
      injection during surgery. Patients will be followed up to assess pain levels using a visual
      pain scale, and to assess how much pain medication was consumed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exparel is a formulation of liposomal bupivacaine that is reported to allow local anesthesia
      for up to 72 hours post injection.

      It is the investigators' aim to follow their prior study with a randomized trial to compare
      local infiltration of liposomal bupivacaine at the conclusion of each procedure with
      injections of standard .25% bupivacaine.

      Patients in group A will receive, at the end of the surgical procedure, injections of
      liposomal bupivacaine (Exparel) (266 mg, 20 mL, diluted at surgeon's discretion) into the
      thoracoscopic port incision sites and around the intercostal nerves serving that space.

      Patients in group B will receive, at the end of the surgical procedure, injections of
      standard .25% bupivacaine into the thoracoscopic port incision sites and around the
      intercostal nerves serving that space.
