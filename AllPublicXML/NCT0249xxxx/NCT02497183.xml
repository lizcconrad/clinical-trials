  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute appendicitis is the most common cause of abdominal pain requiring surgical
      intervention.

      The gold standard test for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis is the CT scan. Despite its
      effectiveness, the test involves exposure to a high dose of radiation.

      Using ultrasound to diagnose this condition has been described extensively in the medical
      literature, and this test has a very high specificity (over 95%), however sensitivity of the
      test is not as good and varies between 40% and 90%. Major limitations of the Ultrasound test
      include operator dependency as well as factors such as body habitus of the patient, presence
      of technical disturbances (artifacts) caused by gas in the large intestine and inadequate
      cooperation from the patient during the exam. All of these factors may affect the ability to
      detect sonographic signs of appendicitis.

      The investigators believe that it is possible to reduce the amount of artifacts caused by the
      presence of gas in the intestine by filling of the colon with liquid suspension that is
      routinely given in the investigators' hospital before performing an abdominal CT and
      performing an additional ultrasound scan to those patients in which the initial ultrasound
      examination (without any preparation) proved to be equivocal or not diagnostic.

      The target population for the study is any patient who arrives to the emergency room with
      complaints of right lower quadrant abdominal pain and it is decided by the referring
      physician in the ER to start diagnostic workup for suspected appendicitis by performing an
      ultrasound, if the ultrasound exam proves to be equivocal or not diagnostic and it is decided
      that the patient needs to continue investigation by performing a CT scan, the patient will
      receive contrast material orally for approximately 180 minutes and prior to the CT the
      investigators intend to repeat the ultrasound. The investigators hypothesize that the repeat
      ultrasound will allow a statistically significant improvement in the detection rate of the
      appendix.
