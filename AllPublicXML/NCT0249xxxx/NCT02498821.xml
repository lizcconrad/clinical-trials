  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate differences in the time and costs between Sherlock
      3CG® TCS and Chest X-ray to confirm the location of a Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter
      (PICC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a cross-sectional, observational design, characterized as a time and motion
      study. The study will observe subjects and specific outcomes from the time a PICC insertion
      procedure begins until the subject is cleared for administration of their prescribed therapy.
      It will compare two approaches for PICC line placement and confirmation of PICC tip
      placement.

      The two methods for placing and confirming PICC lines to be examined in this study are: 1)
      Standard of Care, defined as PICC line placement with Chest X-ray tip confirmation, and 2)
      Sherlock 3CG® TCS magnetic tracking PICC placement and ECG-based tip confirmation. These two
      approaches are currently in use, and are not investigational.

      The study will evaluate the time elapsed from the beginning of PICC line placement procedure
      through the catheter tip confirmation (subject released for IV therapy). A researcher will
      observe from the time the catheter kit is opened until your catheter is cleared for
      administration of treatment. Limited subject follow-up includes review of subject medical
      records related to the PICC line placement. Subjects will be followed only up to the point at
      which the PICC line tip has been confirmed and the subject has been released to receive IV
      therapy. For most subjects, all study data will be collected on Day 1.

      The study is expected to include 120 subjects, 60 subjects will have confirmed PICC line
      placement using Chest X-ray, and 60 will have confirmed PICC line placement using Sherlock
      3CG® TCS. Each group of subjects will be from two clinical sites using either tip
      confirmation method, for a total of 4 study sites.

      <time_frame>Subjects were followed only up to the point at which the PICC line tip was confirmed and they were released to receive therapy (usually from 0 to 300 minutes following procedure initiation). Once they were released to receive therapy, and review of electronic medical record (EMR) data was complete, there was no other subject follow-up.</time_frame>

          <description>Correct placement of the Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter (PICC) will be confirmed using standard of care (Chest X-ray).
X-ray: A Chest X-ray will be taken after healthcare providers have inserted the PICC to make sure it is in the correct location. The X-ray can tell your healthcare providers where the PICC is and whether is has been inserted correctly.
Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter (PICC): A peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) is a form of intravenous access that can be used for a prolonged period of time (e.g., for chemotherapy, antibiotics, total parenteral nutrition)</description>

          <description>Correct placement of the Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter (PICC)will be confirmed using Sherlock 3CG® TCS magnetic tracking PICC placement and ECG-based tip confirmation.
Sherlock 3CG® TCS: The Sherlock 3CG® TCS is a device that is placed on the subject during the PICC insertion procedure, which helps your healthcare providers know where the PICC is as the healthcare providers are inserting it. It uses magnets and measures electrical activity of the heart to determine the location of the catheter in your body.
