      Study Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of orally administered Lozanoc under fasted and
           fed condition in healthy male subjects

        -  To compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) of orally administered Lozanoc and Sporanox under
           fed condition in healthy male subjects

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of single oral dose of Lozanoc and Sporanox in
           Korean healthy male subjects
