      One of the most important factor that affects the post op complication of the cardiac surgery
      is systemic inflammation. Valvular heart surgery requires cardiopulmonary bypass and
      cardioplegic arrest, which can arouse the ischemic/reperfusion injury causing myocardial
      damage and inflammatory response. These myocardial damage and inflammatory response can cause
      multi-organ failure or even death.

      One of the most important factor that affects the post op complication of the cardiac surgery
      is systemic inflammation. Valvular heart surgery requires cardiopulmonary bypass and
      cardioplegic arrest, which can arouse the ischemic/reperfusion injury causing myocardial
      damage and inflammatory response. These myocardial damage and inflammatory response can cause
      multi-organ failure or even death.

      High-mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1) is a protein which is encoded by the HMGB1 gene in
      human. HMGB1 is secreted by immune cells (like macrophages, monocytes and dendritic cells).
      Activated macrophages and monocytes secrete HMGB1 as a cytokine mediator of Inflammation.
      There are many studies suggesting the relationship between HMGB1 and acute coronary syndrome,
      myocardial ischemic/reperfusion injury, atherosclerosis, heart failure and other cardiac
      disease as a marker for inflammatory response. However, there are no other study evaluating
      HMGB1 as a prognostic factor after valvular surgery, so far.
