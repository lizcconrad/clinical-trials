  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare continuous femoral nerve block with continuous
      proximal adductor canal block for postoperative pain control and rehabilitation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients meeting the criteria: American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class I and II,
      that are scheduled for elective total knee arthroplasty, will be recruited into the study.
      Subjects will be randomized into 2 groups: those who will receive a continuous proximal
      adductor canal block (ACB) and those who will receive a continuous femoral nerve block (FNB).
