      The aim of this study is to examine the clinical outcome after anterior cervical
      decompression and fusion, and cervical disc prostheses in general. Additionally these two
      surgical methods for degenerative diseases of the cercival spine are analyzed comparatively
      in order to see whether one procedure should be preferred.

      The study population consists of patients who are suffering from neck and cervicobrachial
      pain because of degenerative diseases of the cervical spine. In that population conservative
      treatment such as analgesia and physiotherapy is no more sufficient, so that surgery is
      necessary. For surgical treatment are chosen either total disc replacement with an cervical
      disc prostheses or anterior cervical decompression and fusion.

      In the context of this work the clinical success of these surgical methods should be
      analasied by means of the neck disability index (NDI), the visual analogue scale (VAS) in
      centimeter, clinical examinations, the satisfaction of patients with the surgery and the
      occurrence of adverse events. The included patients are examined and seen before and after
      the surgery.

      Furthermore the two different methods are compared to each other in order to detect a
      possible advantage of one type of surgery.
