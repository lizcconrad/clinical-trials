  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of intraperitoneal administration of
      Bevacizumab to prevent the recurrence of malignant ascites. Ten patients will receive
      intraperitoneal Bevacizumab 200 mg in 250 ml of normal saline for infusion every two weeks
      for up to six weeks, or a maximum of three treatments.

    <textblock>
      This protocol describes a pilot study to assess whether intraperitoneal Bevacizumab infusion
      is safe and improves the time to repeat paracentesis. In patients with non-draining malignant
      peritoneal effusion, published data suggests that the average time to repeat paracentesis in
      malignant ascites is 10-13 Days. The investigators' treatment will be considered potentially
      efficacious if the median time to repeat paracentesis is greater than 14 days.
