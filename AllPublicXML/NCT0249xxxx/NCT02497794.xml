    <textblock>
      This study is a randomised controlled trial that included 150 pregnant women undergoing
      cesarean in Sisli Ethal Training and Research Hospital, Department of Obstetrics and
      Gynecology, Istanbul, Turkey. It was carried out in the period from October 1, 2015 to
      December 31, 2015. After operation, the participants are going to randomly assigned into two
      groups by using cards. The patients are going to randomized into two groups by using a sealed
      enveloped system.The patients in the study group, will chew one sugar less gum for 30 minutes
      in postoperative 3., 5. and 7. hours. The control group will be followed without chew gum.
      All patients will note the time of first rumbling of the stomach, first feeling of hunger and
      the first gas outlet.

      For elective cases, all participants are going to given nothing by mouth since midnight
      before surgery, and all operations are going to perform in the morning. For those who had
      emergency cesarean section, nothing is going to given per oral for at least 4 hours before
      the start of the operation. Operation data is going to recorded including surgical setting,
      type of cesarean section, previous surgery, adhesion and operation time.

      After operation, the participants are going to randomly assigned into two groups by using
      cards. The patients are going to randomized into two groups by using a sealed enveloped
      system. A blue card and an orange card are going to sealed in separate envelopes. Blue card
      means patients will chewgum.

      The patients in the study group, will chew one sugar less gum for 30 minutes in postoperative
      3., 5. and 7. hours. The control group will be followed without chew gum. Both patient groups
      will be mobilized in postoperative 6 hour and 8 hour after the operation, juicy food will be
      given. It will be introduced to solid foods after bowel movements and gas output occurs. All
      patients postoperatively 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24 and 48 hours will be examined and bowel sounds
      will be oscult. Gas evolution is still not, enema will be applied. All patients will note the
      time of first rumbling of the stomach, first feeling of hunger and the first gas outlet.
