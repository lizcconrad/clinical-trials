  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The introduction of insulin pump therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes using multiple
      daily injections and poorly controlled can be considered in order to improve glycemic
      control. Recent developments of continuous glucose sensors and insulin infusion pumps have
      motivated the research toward &quot;closed-loop'' strategies to regulate glucose levels for
      patients with diabetes. In a closed-loop strategy, the pump(s) infusion rate is altered based
      on a computer generated recommendation that rely on continuous glucose sensor readings. This
      study confirmed the feasibility and potential of the closed-loop strategy to improve glycemic
      control while reducing the risk of hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes but did not
      target the population most likely to benefit from this strategy.The objective ot this study
      is to compare the efficacy of closed-loop strategy to multiple daily injections in regulating
      glucose levels for 24 hours in elderly adults with type 2 diabetes under intensive insulin
      therapy. The investigators hypothesize that closed-loop strategy will increase the time spent
      in the target range in adults with type 2 diabetes compared to multiple daily injections.

    <description>Variable subcutaneous insulin infusion rates will be used to regulate glucose levels. Subject's usual fast-acting insulin analog will be infused using a subcutaneous infusion pumps (Accu-Chek Combo, Roche). The glucose level as measured by the real time sensor (Dexcom G4 Platinum, Dexcom) will be entered manually into the computer every 10 minutes. The pumps' infusion rate will then be changed manually based on the computer generated recommendation infusion rates.</description>

             surgery.

          3. A recent (&lt; 2 months) injury to body or limb, muscular disorder, use of any medication
             or other significant medical disorder if that injury, medication or disease in the
             judgment of the investigator will affect the ability to walk.

          4. A recent (&lt; 2 months) infection needing IV antibiotic or hospitalization

          5. Severe hypoglycemic episode within two weeks of screening.

             dose stable inhaled).

          7. Recent initiation or dose modification (&lt;2 months) of therapy known to interfere with
             glucose metabolism (e.g. neuroleptics, anti-psychotics, etc.)

          8. Known or suspected allergy to the trial products or meal contents.

          9. Other serious medical illness likely to interfere with study participation or with the
             ability to complete the trial by the judgment of the investigator.
