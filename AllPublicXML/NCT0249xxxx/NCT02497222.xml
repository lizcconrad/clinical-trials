      This study evaluates the use of RNS60 in the treatment of asthma examining regional
      improvements in inflammation using PET imaging. All subjects will be treated with both RNS60
      and placebo in a crossover design.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males or females with mild asthma (as defined by the National Institutes of Health
             2002 Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma (2)) with symptoms more
             than 2 times a week but less than once per day with normal FEV1 (&gt; 80% predicted).

          -  Clinical history of allergic symptoms to cat or dust mite allergen and demonstrated
             skin reactivity.

          -  Subjects must have a lifetime total of less than 5 pack years with no smoking in the
             previous 5 years.

          -  Willing and able to give informed consent and adhere to the study protocol
             requirements.

          -  Expressed the desire to participate in the study in an interview with the principal
             investigator (PI).

          -  Age between 18 and 50 years.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women of childbearing potential who are documented to be pregnant (based on blood
             beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [HCG] testing) or who are nursing.

          -  The presence of spontaneous asthmatic episode or clinical evidence of upper
             respiratory tract infection within the previous 6 weeks.

          -  Participation in research study involving a drug or biologic during the 30 days prior
             to the study.

          -  Intolerance to albuterol, atropine, or lidocaine.

          -  Antihistamines within 7 days of the screening visit.

          -  Known exposure to agents that are associated with pulmonary disease (i.e. asbestos,
             silica).

          -  Presence of other known pulmonary disease, coronary disease, congestive heart failure,
             ventricular arrhythmias, history of a cerebrovascular accident, renal failure (or
             creatinine &gt; 1.5, if known), history of anaphylaxis, cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus or
             presence of a significant disease, which in the opinion of the PI would pose a
             significant risk for the subject or confound the results of the study.

          -  Use of systemic steroids, increased use of inhaled steroids, use of beta blockers and
             monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or a visit for an asthma exacerbation within 1
             month of the screening visit.

          -  A history of asthma-related respiratory failure requiring intubation.

          -  A history of hospitalization for asthma.

          -  Subjects with a high possibility of poor compliance with the study as judged by the
             PI.

          -  Unresponsive to bronchodilator agents.

          -  Quantitative skin prick test at or below a dilution level of standardized cat allergen
             extract of 1:2048 (4.88 BAU/ml) for subjects being challenged with cat allergen.

          -  Quantitative skin prick test at or below a dilution level of standardized mite
             allergen extract of 1:2048 (4.88 AU/ml) for subjects being challenged with either mite
             allergen.

          -  Subjects who, by participating in any research study, will have a cumulative radiation
             dose exceeding 50 mSv in the previous year.

          -  Contraindication to Methacholine challenge testing (heart attack or stroke in last 3
             months, uncontrolled hypertension, or known aortic aneurysm).

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt; 32.

          -  Individuals with known allergy or hypersensitivity to FDG will be excluded.
