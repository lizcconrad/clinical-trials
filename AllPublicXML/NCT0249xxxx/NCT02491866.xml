      Objectives

        1. to develop and validate a Computerized Adaptative Testing (CAT) of self-perceived
           quality of care in Psychiatry.

        2. to analyze the implementation of this new measure in clinical practice : qualitative
           analysis of the relationship patient/professional.

      Prospective and multicentric study

        1. Development and validation of the CAT. 4 steps :

             -  Elaboration of a pool of items, based on literature review and interview with
                patients.

             -  Selection of the most relevant items based on a qualitative approach using
                cognitive interview with patients.

             -  Calibration of the item bank : the psychometric properties of the item bank will be
                based on classical test and item response theories and approaches, including the
                evaluation of unidimensionality, item response theory model fitting, and analyses
                of differential item functioning.

             -  Metrological validation of the CAT.

        2. Analysis of the implementation of the CAT in clinical practice using interview with
           professionals and patients.
