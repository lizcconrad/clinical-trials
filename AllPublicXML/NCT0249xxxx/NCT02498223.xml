  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to reduce the physiological and biomechanical loads that the soldiers are exposed
      to, the investigators want to examine new approaches for distributing the carried loads
      according to measurements that are specific for each soldier (body composition and aerobic
      capacity). A functional index (LCI=load carriage index) will provide the commander a tool for
      better decisions in distributing the same total load among the same number of soldiers,
      according to each soldier's ability.

      50 healthy, male and female combat soldiers will be recruited. Anthropometry and maximal
      aerobic capacity will be measured for each participant: Physiological evaluation: the
      participants will perform physical stress on a treadmill with changing slope and speed, once
      carrying 40% of their body weight (as the current instructions) and a second time with weight
      that is calculated by the examined body composition and aerobic capacity based index (LCI).
      The physiological response will be assessed based on heart rate, lactic acid in the blood and
      oxygen consumption.

      Biomechanical evaluation: the biomechanical response will be measured in the biomechanical
      lab: pressure on the shoulder and waist from the load and straps, walk analysis and stress
      scatter in the foot.

      By this experiment the investigators want to examine if the new index, the LCI, is
      physiologically and biomechanically better than the current load distribution instructions.

    <description>the subjects will undergo the following experiment protocol:
recruitment and medical examination day.
physiological evaluation day- the subjects will perform twice* a physiological stress protocol ; 3 min sitting followed by 20 min walking on treadmill (4 km/h, 4% slope), and then 3 min sitting for recovery examination. total 26 min.
biomechanical valuation day- the subjects will perform twice* a biomechanical protocol using the Zebris system; 2 min standing followed by 10 min walking on treadmill (4 km/h, 4% slope). total 12 min.
once carrying the weight calculated according to the army current instructions, and a second time carrying weight calculated according to the new LCI. 2 hours rest between the two performances.</description>
