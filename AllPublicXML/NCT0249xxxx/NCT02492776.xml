  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the multiple dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of two
      gefapixant (AF-219) formulations; to assess the effect of omeprazole on the multiple dose PK
      of two gefapixant formulations; and, to assess the safety and tolerability of gefapixant.

    <measure>Plasma concentration profiles of two different oral formulations of gefapixant</measure>
    <time_frame>12 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma gefapixant concentration versus time profiles will be plotted for each subject; similar summary plots will be constructed for each treatment period. Plasma gefapixant PK parameters will be calculated using noncompartmental methods and summarized using descriptive statistics by each treatment.</description>

    <measure>Plasma concentration profile of gefapixant following administration of omeprazole</measure>
    <time_frame>5.5 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be performed on log normal-transformed Cmax and AUC0-t values to determine the extent of a drug interaction, if any, of omeprazole on the plasma gefapixant PK parameters.</description>
