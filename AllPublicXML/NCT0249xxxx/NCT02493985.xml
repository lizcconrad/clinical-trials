    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to study the effects of carbon dioxide combined with head down
      tilt on cerebral physiology and anatomy. This paradigm will help establish a ground-based
      analog for spaceflight, and also evaluate the ability of non-invasive devices to monitor
      brain physiology.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many of the long duration astronauts develop visual changes, associated with
      neuroophthalmological abnormalities suggesting elevated intracranial pressure. There is
      currently no suitable ground based analog to simulate these changes on Earth, or a standard
      methodological approach to monitoring the combined effects of head down tilt and atmospheric
      carbon dioxide. Given that carbon dioxide and cephalad fluid shifting are known factors in
      spaceflight, we sought to evaluate an approach to monitoring these effects in healthy subject
      in a ground based analog on Earth.
