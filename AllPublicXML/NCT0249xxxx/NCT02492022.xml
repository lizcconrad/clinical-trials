  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Quitting smoking is a big decision, a decision to achieve better health. Trying to quit
      smoking can be stressful. The prospect of dealing with withdrawal symptoms, fear or failure
      to change the routine, can also be sources of stress.

      Withdrawal from nicotine is characterized by symptoms that include anxiety, irritability,
      hunger and cravings for more tobacco. Nicotine creates a dependency so that the body develops
      a need for a certain level of nicotine at all times. Unless that level is maintained symptoms
      of withdrawal appear.

      For tobacco users trying to quit, symptoms of withdrawal from nicotine are unpleasant and
      stressful, but they are temporary.

      Research has demonstrated the relative effectiveness of pharmacotherapy treatments in smoking
      cessation but no studies have examined the effects of the probiotics on the withdrawal
      symptoms associated with the tobacco cessation during nicotine replacement therapy (NRT).

      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of two probiotic products during NRT
      for managing withdrawal symptoms associated with smoking cessation.
