    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to identify genetic loci,or gene variations contributing to the
      development of coronary artery disease (CAD) in Chinese young adults. Investigators will
      compare coronary angiogram results to genetic findings within young CAD patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During last 10 years, the rise in coronary artery disease (CAD) prevalence in Chinese young
      adults is observed and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is generally considered to be
      low operative risk in these young patients. Genome-wide association studies have identified a
      considerable number of common genetic variants related to CAD. However, the extent to which
      these genetic variants are related to the future cardiovascular events, the prevalence,
      extent, severity, and prognosis of young patients with CAD is not clear.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the genetic loci, or gene variations contributing to
      the development and prognosis of CAD in Chinese young adult. Investigators will compare the
      angiogram results to genetic findings first in patients with different stages of CAD. Then,
      investigators will collect patients from hospital discharge registry, and compare long-term
      outcome as well as on operative details in different gene groups.

      The results of the study provide a possibility to develop a gene test to recognize patients
      at risk at its early stage, and needing for preventive medicine.
