  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will provide information regarding the metabolic pathway of GBT440, the need for
      evaluation of potential drug-drug interactions, and the need for studies in special
      populations. The administration of radiolabeled drug is necessary to fully characterize the
      rates and routes of elimination of GBT440, providing further quantitative information on the
      disposition of GBT440. The results from this study will permit a comprehensive comparison
      between animal and human routes of elimination and metabolic profiles of GBT440.
