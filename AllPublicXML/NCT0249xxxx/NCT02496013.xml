    <textblock>
      This is an open-label whole-body PET/CT study for investigation of radiation dosimetry,
      plasma pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, safety and diagnostic performance of 68Ga-NEB in
      healthy volunteers and patients with suspected infection. Changes of routine blood and urine
      tests and any adverse events will be collected from the volunteers. Adverse events will also
      be observed in the patients.

      The labeling of albumin has advantages as drawing blood is unnecessary and the operator
      labeling is not exposed to potentially infectious material. Evans blue (EB) dye has high
      affinity for serum albumin, The final obtained products NEB (a NOTA conjugate of a truncated
      form of Evans blue for in vivo albumin labeling) was proceeded strict quality controls.

      No fasting, hydration or other specific preparation was requested on the day of imaging.

      Patients for blood pool imaging underwent whole-body PET/CT acquisitions 30-45 min after
      intravenous injection of 111-148 MBq (3-4 mCi) 68Ga-NEB with each bed position lasted for 2
      min and a standard routine 18F-FDG PET/CT within one week.

      Patients for lymph node imaging including the breast nodules patients underwent a standard
      routine 18F-FDG PET/CT first, and were locally injected 10~20MBq 68Ga-NEB, followed by
      dynamic chest regional PET acquisitions.

      A Siemens MMWP workstation was used for post-processing. Visual analysis was used to
      determine the general biodistribution and the temporal and intersubject stability.
      Semiquantitative methods were applied for image analysis.
