  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin D insufficiency has become a global concern, with low vitamin D status associated
      with bone disorders, cardiovascular disease and certain cancers. The United Kingdom (UK) and
      Ireland are at particular risk of vitamin D deficiency owing to the northerly latitude,
      increased use of sunscreen, decreased sun exposure and a high level of cloud cover. A recent
      survey in the UK showed that more than 50% of UK adults have insufficient vitamin D status,
      with lower levels noted in the winter months. Variations in vitamin D status have been known
      to vary between summer and winter, owing to our northern latitude (52-55°N) the Ultraviolet
      (UV)-B intensity in Northern Ireland is inadequate to promote the dermal synthesis of vitamin
      D during the winter months, causing us to rely on dietary sources. The aim of this
      intervention is to investigate the main effects of vitamin D3-fortified milk and supplemental
      vitamin D3 on vitamin D status and functional health outcomes during the winter, and how this
      intervention will affect subsequent dermal synthesis of vitamin D from UV exposure.
      Participants will be recruited from the local community. Blood samples will be collected from
      each participant at two timepoints (September/October and March/April). Pre- and
      post-intervention blood pressure, grip strength, height, weight, waist and hip circumferences
      will be measured, in addition participants will undergo a dual energy x-ray absorptiometry
      (DXA) scan to assess body composition and bone mineral density. Information on general
      health, lifestyle, physical activity, dietary intake and typical behaviours in the sun will
      be collected. Following the dietary intervention, a subset of participants will be invited to
      participate in a follow-up study, examining UV exposure during the summer months, when they
      will wear a personal wrist dosimeter for 1 month, complete a sun dairy and provide 2
      additional blood samples.
