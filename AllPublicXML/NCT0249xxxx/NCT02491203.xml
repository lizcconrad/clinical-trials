  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a leading cause of death and long-term disability worldwide and its incidence is on
      the rise. Importantly, loss of arm function occurs in up to 85% of stroke survivors, with a
      significant long-term impact on activities of daily living, leisure activities and work. The
      capacity for recovery following a stroke depends on several factors, including the extent of
      the initial neurological damage, spontaneous recovery and rehabilitation, with possible
      recovery even years after the stroke. Unfortunately, accessibility of much needed
      rehabilitation services poststroke often remains limited, both in terms of intensity and
      duration, as reported in a recent report on post-stroke rehabilitation services in Quebec
      (Richard, 2013) Recent evidence suggests that homebased telerehabilitation (TR) is a viable
      approach for upper limb training post-stroke when rehabilitation services are not available.
      Similarly, the Canadian Best Practice Recommendations for Stroke Care update for 2013
      recommends home-based patient monitoring be used when frequent monitoring is needed and
      face-to-face visits are not available. Hence, The investigators have developed and propose to
      examine the use of a TR system that allows upper limb rehabilitation with ongoing off-line
      monitoring, to be used after usual poststroke rehabilitation is completed and services are no
      longer offered.

      More specifically, the objective of the proposed study is to assess the impact, in terms of
      motor recovery, function,quality of life, compliance, safety and cost, of a novel,
      patient-centered home-based tailored TR program using an affordable virtual reality system
      for upper-limb rehabilitation post-stroke. Such a system, combined with remote off-line
      monitoring could allow patients to take charge and pursue their rehabilitation beyond current
      services, maximizing their potential for recovery.

      A single-blind two-arm randomized clinical trial (RCT) is proposed for this study with
      participants who have had a stroke randomly allocated to: (1) 4-week training with home-based
      tele-rehabilitation (TR) system (see intervention below).i.e. treatment group or (2) 4-week
      written home exercise program provided by a clinician, i.e. exercise control group.

The intensity and choice of game for the home program will be determined by the therapist based on the patient's abilities, interests, motivation and fatigue. The patient's performance for the VR home program will be monitored asynchronously and the program adapted to ensure it remains at an appropriate level for the patient.</description>
