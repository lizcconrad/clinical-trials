  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is a well-established treatment for patients with
      severe systolic heart failure (HF) and ventricular desynchronization. Despite the
      consistently observed structural and functional improvements as well as reductions in HF
      events and mortality in large multicenter randomized trials, 30% patients remain classified
      as nonresponders. Present evidences showed that QRS duration was the most effective parameter
      to predict responsivity of CRT in patients with severe HF. But some studies showed that QRS
      duration could be influenced by obesity and gender. Accordingly, the simple QRS interval
      width of body surface electrocardiograph should not be the most satisfactory parameter for
      screening patients suitable for CRT. Recent study showed that left ventricular electrical
      delay, as measured by the time from the onset of QRS to the LV electrogram peak (QLV),
      predicted CRT response. At long QLV intervals, atrioventricular optimization (AVO) can
      increase the likelihood of structural response to CRT. However, it is unclear whether it is
      suitable for Chinese patients. The investigators would like to validate this relation in a
      Chinese population and explore if a corrected QLV might do better to predict the responsivity
      of CRT.
