      A single center, open label, Phase IIa, Idea, Development, Exploration, Assessment, Long-term
      follow-up (IDEAL) prospective development study. The study will treat approximately 20 men
      who meet the eligibility criteria, and give written informed consent. Safety and Tolerability
      will be assessed post-treatment at 2 days (phone call), 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 24 weeks
      and 26 weeks. Potential Efficacy will be assessed by biopsy at 24 weeks and imaging (MRI) at
      2 weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks and PSA outcomes at 12 and 24 weeks.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men aged ≥40 years and life expectancy of ≥10 years.

          -  Serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≤15 ng/mL.

          -  Transperineal prostate biopsy within 12 months prior to dosing, with a clinically
             significant lesion correlating with an mpMRI visible lesion.

          -  Radiological stage T1-T2 N0 Mx/M0 disease.

          -  A visible lesion on mpMRI that is accessible to PRX302 transperineal injection.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous radiation therapy to the pelvis.

          -  Androgen suppression or anti-androgen therapy within the 12 months prior to dosing,
             for prostate cancer.

          -  Use of a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor within the 3 months prior to dosing.

          -  Evidence of metastatic disease or nodal disease outside the prostate on bone scan or
             cross-sectional imaging.

          -  Inability to tolerate a transrectal ultrasound (TRUS).

          -  Known allergy to latex or gadolinium (Gd).

          -  Previous electroporation, radiofrequency ablation, high-intensity focused ultrasound
             (HIFU), cryosurgery, thermal or microwave therapy to treat cancer of the prostate.

          -  Unable to have pelvic MRI scanning (severe claustrophobia, permanent cardiac
             pacemaker, metallic implant, etc. likely to contribute significant artifact to
             images).
