      The purpose of this study is to determine the location of periostin and urine periostin level
      in patients with lupus nephritis and IgA nephropathy.

      Total of 50 lupus nephritis and IgA nephropathy patients who met the inclusion criteria were
      included in this study. The information sheet and informed consent will be obtained before
      collecting the patient's data. All patients were interviewed for collecting demographic data
      and laboratory testing were reviewed from patient's record. Kidney tissue and urine sample
      were collected at the biopsy date from patients.Kidney tissue were stained with hematoxylin
      and eosin (H&amp;E), Masson's trichrome solution and immunohistochemistry for periostin. The
      location of periostin staining in kidney tissue were assessed by renal pathologist.

      The total of 50 urine samples from patients and 50 urine samples from healthy controls were
      measured for periostin level by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The Mann-Whitney rank-sum
      test was used for comparing urine periostin level between patients and healthy controls and
      also other variables between patients with urine periostin detection and without urine
      periostin detection. Spearman correlation coefficients were used test correlations between
      urine periostin level in patients and other variables. Receiver operating characteristic
      curves was generated to calculate the area under the curve and find the best cutoff value of
      urine periostin level for distinguishing patients from healthy controls. P-values &lt; 0.05 were
      considered statistically significant.
