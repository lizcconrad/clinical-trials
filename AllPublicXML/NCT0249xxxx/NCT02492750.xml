    <textblock>
      This partially randomized phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of anakinra
      when given together with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in treating patients with early stage
      multiple myeloma. Biological therapies, such as lenalidomide and anakinra, may stimulate or
      suppress the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Drugs used
      in chemotherapy, such as dexamethasone, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer
      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. It is not yet known whether lenalidomide and dexamethasone are more effective with
      or without anakinra in treating patients with multiple myeloma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/maximum allowable dose (MAD) of anakinra
      that can be combined with lenalidomide and dexamethasone. (Phase I) II. To compare the time
      to progression of the standard treatment arm (lenalidomide/dexamethasone) to the experimental
      arm (lenalidomide/dexamethasone + anakinra). (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the response rate of the standard treatment arm (lenalidomide/dexamethasone) to
      the experimental arm (lenalidomide/dexamethasone + anakinra).

      II. To compare the toxicity of the standard treatment arm (lenalidomide/dexamethasone) to the
      experimental arm (lenalidomide/dexamethasone + anakinra).

      III. To compare the overall survival of the standard treatment arm
      (lenalidomide/dexamethasone) to the experimental arm (lenalidomide/dexamethasone + anakinra).

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of anakinra followed by a phase II study.

      PHASE I: Patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO) on days 1-21 and dexamethasone PO on days
      1, 8, 15, and 22. Patients also receive anakinra subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-28. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PHASE II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive lenalidomide PO on days 1-21 and dexamethasone PO on days 1, 8, 15,
      and 22. Patients also receive anakinra SC on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive lenalidomide and dexamethasone as in Arm A. Patients also receive
      placebo SC on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.

    <measure>Incidence of adverse events, graded according to NCI CTCAE version 4.0</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The number and severity of all adverse events (overall and by dose-level) will be tabulated and summarized in this patient population. The grade 3+ adverse events will also be described and summarized in a similar fashion. The maximum grade for each type of adverse event will be recorded for each patient, and frequency tables will be reviewed to determine patterns. Additionally, the relationship of the adverse event(s) to the study treatment will be taken into consideration.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of toxicity graded according to Common Toxicity Criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Overall toxicity incidence as well as toxicity profiles by dose level, patient and tumor site will be explored and summarized. Frequency distributions, graphical techniques and other descriptive measures will form the basis of these analyses.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>MTD of lenalidomide, dexamethasone, and anakinra defined as the dose level below the lowest dose that induces dose-limiting toxicity in at least one-third of patients (at least 2 of a maximum of 6 new patients) (Phase I)</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>Dose-limiting toxicity is graded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Response profile (Phase I)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>A response is defined to be a stringent complete response (sCR), complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR), or partial response (PR) noted as the objective status. Responses will be summarized by simple descriptive summary statistics delineating complete and partial responses as well as stable and progressive disease in this patient population.</description>

    <measure>Time to disease progression (TTP) (Phase II)</measure>
    <time_frame>Time from registration until the earliest date of documentation of disease progression, assessed at 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The primary analysis of TTP will be a comparison of arm A to arm B using a one-sided log-rank test between the two Kaplan-Meier curves.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall response rate (ORR) (Phase II)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>ORR will be estimated by the number of patients with an objective status of sCR, CR, VGPR, or PR divided by the total number of evaluable patients. Exact binomial 95% confidence intervals for the true overall response rate will be calculated within each arm and compared between the arms using Fisher's exact test.</description>

    <measure>Survival time (Phase II)</measure>
    <time_frame>Time from registration to death due to any cause, assessed up to 5 years</time_frame>
