  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A promising form of enhancing brain function non-invasively involves stimulating the brain
      using weak magnetic or electric currents. This method is becoming increasingly popular in
      both clinical and commercial circles; a number of portable, at-home devices are available on
      the commercial market for personal use. In this study, the investigators aim to determine
      factors associated with the enhancement of cognitive and motor learning following
      transcranial direct-current stimulation in healthy young adults. Understanding how
      participants respond to brain stimulation is critical to maximizing the effectiveness of
      stimulation and determining its potential as a performance-enhancing aid for mental tasks.
      Future developments of this study may also inform the capacity of brain stimulation to act as
      non-drug alternative to treatment for cognitive decline.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must be in good health,

          -  between 18-35 years of age

          -  with no prior history of neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's
             disease, stroke with paralysis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants with cardiac stimulators (pace-makers) and those with metal implants in
             the skull will be excluded.

          -  Pregnant women will also be excluded.

        Participants will be required to fill out a brief health questionnaire to ensure that they
        have no conditions that would prevent brain stimulation.
