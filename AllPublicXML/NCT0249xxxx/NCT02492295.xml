  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Migraine headache is a frequent Emergency Department complaint. While first-line Emergency
      Department treatment for this condition is well-established, optimal second-line treatment
      options are not well-defined. First line Emergency Department treatments include
      Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs), dopamine antagonists. Second line treatments
      that have been proposed include triptans, steroids, antiepileptics, benzodiazepines,
      magnesium and narcotics, but none have shown reliable Emergency Department efficacy (less
      than 50% in most studies). In the past ten years there have been several case series
      published on using low, sub-anesthetic doses of propofol for the treatment of refractory
      migraine. These case series have reported very impressive efficacy rates, especially in
      comparison to the published efficacy rates of other second-line treatments. Personal
      experience using this treatment modality has also yielded impressive clinical results. Most
      of the published series, however, have not been conducted in the Emergency Department.

      The Investigators propose to conduct a prospective, observational trial of low-dose propofol
      for the treatment of refractory migraine in the Emergency Department. Propofol is a
      frequently-used Emergency Department sedative, with a good safety profile when administered
      by experienced Emergency Medicine practitioners using appropriate monitoring. The primary
      outcome measurement will be reduction of pain after treatment, with secondary outcome
      measures related to the safety of treatment and continuation of pain relief after leaving the
      Emergency Department. Although the protocol will involve the use of low-dose propofol with
      the aim of achieving light-to-moderate sedation only, all patients will care for and monitor
      at a level appropriate for deep procedural sedation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, observational trial to assess basic efficacy and safety in
      the Emergency Department treatment environment.

      Emergency Department patients at Einstein Medical Center Philadelphia, with migraine type
      headache (International Headache Classification), who continue to have severe (6/10 or
      greater) pain one hour after receiving adequate first-line treatment with a dopamine
      antagonist (prochlorperazine or metoclopramide) and an NSAID (ketorolac or ibuprofen) will be
      approached for possible inclusion. Patients who meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria will be
      given informed consent, including consent for procedural sedation. Patients who decline to
      participate will continue to have their headache treated by the ED team as per usual
      practice.

      After enrollment, patients will be set up for procedural sedation per standard Emergency
      Department protocol. This includes a well-running peripheral IV; continuous monitoring with
      telemetry, pulse oximetry, capnography and automated blood pressure checks; continuous
      bedside monitoring by both an Emergency Department nurse and an Emergency Department
      attending or senior resident (with immediate attending availability); and airway management
      tools including suction, oxygen, and Bag valve mask ventilation at bedside, with advanced
      airway management tools (intubation equipment, etc) immediately available. After time-out,
      propofol administration will begin. The study drug will be administered only by those
      properly trained to do so and will be administered in compliance with healthcare licensure
      requirements. Propofol will be administered as a 0.5mg/kg (at a concentration of 10mg/mL,
      rounded to the nearest 0.5mL) initial bolus, followed by repeat 0.25mg/kg boluses (same
      rounding) every three to five minutes as needed to maintain Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale
      (RASS) target -2 (&quot;light sedation - awakens to voice &lt;10 seconds&quot;) to RASS target of -3
      (&quot;moderate sedation - movement or eye opening without eye contact&quot;) for 15 minutes. No more
      than 1.5mg/kg of propofol will be administered over this time period. After the sedation
      session is complete, patients will be allowed to wake up and will be monitored in the ED for
      at least another hour prior to discharge.

      If a patient experiences any adverse safety event that in the determination of the treating
      provider make it unsafe to continue giving propofol, the protocol will be terminated
      immediately.

      Numeric pain score (0-10) will be obtained prior to medication administration, at 30 minutes
      and at 60 minutes after the final dose of medication. Patients will also be questioned about
      associated migraine symptoms (nausea/vomiting/photophobia/phonophobia) and their resolution.
      Patients will receive follow-up phone calls at 24 hours to assess pain score, need for
      additional medications and whether they would opt for the same treatment again in the event
      of another severe headache. Patient charts will subsequently be reviewed to determine if they
      had any further ED visits within 72 hours after propofol administration.
