      The general aim of this study is to investigate the effect of an individually tailored mental
      training program in adolescents developing chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) after an acute
      Epstein Barr-virus (EBV) infection. Endpoints include physical activity (primary endpoint),
      symptoms (fatigue, pain, insomnia), cognitive function (executive functions) and markers of
      disease mechanisms (autonomic, endocrine, and immune responses).

      EBV-infection is a well-known trigger of CFS. A closely related research project (Chronic
      fatigue following acute Epstein-Barr virus infection in Adolescents; ClinicalTrials
      ID:NCT02335437) is a combined prospective and cross-sectional study of 200 adolescents
      suffering from acute EBV infection. The primary aim of that study is to identify factors that
      predispose to CFS 6 months after the acute infection. Thus, that project will provide a
      sample of thoroughly characterized CFS patients, all having the same precipitation factor
      (EBV-infection).

      The present project is an intervention trial in the subgroup of patients that actually did
      develop CFS 6 months after the acute EBV infection. Patients will be randomised 1:1 to either
      a mental training program (10 sessions) combining elements from cognitive behavioral therapy
      and music therapy, or routine follow-up from the general practitioner. By its nature,
      treatment group allocation cannot be blinded; however, both patients and therapists will be
      blinded for end-point evaluation. An extensive investigational program will be carried out at
      three time points: Prior to the intervention, immediately after the intervention, and 1 year
      after the intervention. The program includes: Clinical examination; Pain threshold
      assessment; Cardiovascular assessment; Cognitive assessment; Sampling of biological material
      (blood and urine); Questionnaire; Brain fMRI; Qualitative interview; Monitoring of physical
      activity (accelerometer)

    <description>The intervention consists of one introductory session (patients and their parents/next-of-kin), followed by 9 individual therapy sessions (one each week) of 1.5 hours duration and related home-work, combining elements from cognitive behavioural therapy and music therapy: Important elements of the mental training program are:
Psychoeducation: Theories of CFS/ME pathophysiology and treatment rationale
Relaxation: Bodily stress reduction, mindfulness
Visualization: Contact with positive emotions, techniques of worrying reduction
Experiences: Behavioral 'experiments' (individually adjusted), 'trick into action'
Cognitive challenges: Challenging thoughts about disease process, stimulus and outcome expectancies, prognosis</description>
