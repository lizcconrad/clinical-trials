  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy plays an integral role in breast cancer therapy. Multiple randomized studies
      have demonstrated decreased local-regional recurrence rates and decreased breast-cancer
      mortality. However, balanced with this survival benefit is the potential toxicity of the
      treatment itself. In particular, cardiac effects of radiotherapy have been a concern and an
      area of research for the past 20 years. From long-term follow up of patients with lymphoma,
      it is known that radiotherapy can lead to increased risk of myocardial infarction, valvular
      dysfunction, systolic and diastolic function abnormalities, and heart failure among
      cancer-survivors. Patients with breast cancer receive lower doses to smaller volumes of the
      heart, but they also have an excellent long-term survival, so it is crucial to study the
      effects of low dose radiotherapy. Indeed, a recent study suggests that these effects can be
      seen within the first 5 years after treatment, and that there is no dose threshold. This
      study aims to develop imaging and blood biomarkers of cardiac exposure, as a first step to
      identifying patients at increased risk for cardiac effects, so they can be targeted for close
      monitoring and early intervention, potentially with statins or ACE inhibitors. Additionally,
      by characterizing a time-course and radiation dose-volume relationship, potentially real-time
      modifications can be made to RT field design for patients sensitive to RT effects. Finally,
      this information can be incorporated into better designs of treatment plans for future
      patients.

    <description>Cardiac MRI has increased use in evaluating structural and functional cardiac pathologies. For detection of coronary artery disease, MRI outperforms SPECT and dobutamine stress echocardiography for the detection of ischemia. MRI also can detect wall-motion abnormalities and other dysfunction. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) can evaluate microvascular parameters such as vessel permeability and fluid volume fraction as an assessment of tissue perfusion. Cardiac MRI holds promise for early detection of subclinical cardiac abnormalities after radiotherapy and could potentially identify patients for intervention to prevent cardiac events. All patients will follow the protocol calendar requiring research MRIs, but will receive standard radiation treatment determined by their physician. Treatment will not be altered based on MRI.</description>

    <description>We have identified potential candidates based on other processes affecting heart function in a way similar to probable mechanisms of RT-related injury. For fibrosis and left ventricular dysfunction, these include galectin-3 and N-terminal-Pro brain natriuretic peptide. For myocyte destruction, troponin; for inflammation and oxidative stress, C-reactive protein, myeloperoxidase, and growth differentiation factor 15. Additional blood will be collected and stored for future assessment of other candidate biomarkers.
All patients will follow the calendar of protocol required research blood draws for biomarker collection, but will receive standard radiation treatment as clinically indicated by their physician. Treatment will not be altered based upon the data collected from these samples.</description>

      Collection of approximately 20 ml of blood will be performed by venipuncture at the specified
      time points. When possible, blood collection will be coordinated with other routine blood
      studies. These blood samples will be drawn at the clinical blood drawing station in the
      Radiation Oncology department.
