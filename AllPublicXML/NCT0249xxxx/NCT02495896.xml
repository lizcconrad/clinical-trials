      This pilot phase Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of recombinant EphB4-HSA
      fusion protein when given together with standard chemotherapy regimens in treating patients
      with solid tumors that have spread to other places in the body and usually cannot be cured or
      controlled with treatment (advanced) or have spread to other places in the body (metastatic).
      Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein, paclitaxel
      albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation, gemcitabine hydrochloride, docetaxel, and
      cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. It is not yet
      known whether standard chemotherapy regimens are more effective with recombinant ephB4-HSA
      fusion protein in treating advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To document the safety and tolerability of sEphB4-HSA (recombinant ephB4-HSA fusion
      protein) intravenously (IV) weekly when administered in combination with: arm A) gemcitabine
      (gemcitabine hydrochloride) and nab-paclitaxel (paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle
      formulation), arm B) docetaxel, arm C) gemcitabine and cisplatin.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the adverse event profile of sEphB4-HSA IV weekly when administered in
      combination with: arm A) gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel, arm B) docetaxel, arm C) gemcitabine
      and cisplatin.

      II. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of sEphB4-HSA when combined with: arm A) gemcitabine
      and nab-paclitaxel, arm B) docetaxel, arm C) gemcitabine and cisplatin.

      III. To assess, in a preliminary fashion, the anti-tumor efficacy of sEphB4-HSA in
      combination with the various chemotherapy regimens in each of the 4 cohorts separately: Arm A
      cohort 1-patients with advanced pancreatic cancer; Arm B cohort 2-patients with head and neck
      cancer; Arm B cohort 3-patients with non-small cell lung cancer; Arm C cohort 3: patients
      with cholangiocarcinoma.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the expression of EPH receptor B4 (EphB4) and ephrinB2 in the archival tumor
      samples and explore potential associations with outcome.

      II. To bank specimens for future correlative biomarkers studies based on the results of
      ongoing biomarkers analyses in the phase I of sEphB4-HSA as a single agent.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose de-escalation study of recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein. Patients
      are assigned to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 15,
      and 22 (beginning course 2), paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation IV over
      30 minutes and gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and
      15 (beginning course 2) and docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM C: Patients receive recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and
      15 (beginning course 2), cisplatin IV over 120 minutes and gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over
      30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      In all arms, patients with chemotherapy related toxicity may continue treatment with
      recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein alone. Patients with toxicity related to recombinant
      EphB4-HSA fusion protein may continue treatment with chemotherapy at the discretion of the
      investigator.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.

          -  Patients must not be pregnant of lactating

          -  Patients must not be on any dose of warfarin or are on full dose anticoagulation with

             drug; patients on prophylactic doses of low-molecular weight heparin are allowed

          -  Patients must not have had any active bleeding in the last =&lt; 4 weeks or have an
             otherwise known bleeding diathesis

          -  Patients must not have corrected QT (QTc)F (Fridericia Correction Formula) &gt; 480 on 2
             out of 3 electrocardiograms (EKG's) (if first EKG is =&lt; 480, no need to repeat, if
             first EKG is &gt; 480 repeat twice for a total of 3 EKG's)

          -  Patients must not have uncontrolled hypertension as defined by systolic blood pressure
             (SBP) &gt;= 160 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) &gt;= 90 mmHg; patients whose blood
             pressure can be controlled medically are allowed to be rescreened once blood pressure
             (BP) is under control

          -  Patients must not have &gt; grade sensory neuropathy

          -  Patients must not have known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection

          -  ARM A COHORT 1: Patients must not have a history of slowly progressive dyspnea and
             unproductive cough, or of conditions such as sarcoidosis, silicosis, idiopathic

             of major arterial involvement

          -  ARM B COHORT 3: Patients must not have prior exposure to docetaxel

          -  ARM B COHORT 3: Patients must not have had more than one prior line of systemic
             therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (including treatment with a targeted
             agent); prior adjuvant therapy completed more than 6 months prior to disease
             recurrence will not count as a prior line of systemic therapy for advanced disease

          -  ARM B COHORT 3: Patients must not have active clinically significant hemoptysis

          -  ARM B COHORT 3: Patients must not have a central lesion with radiologic evidence of
