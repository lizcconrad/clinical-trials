      This randomized phase II study aims to investigate whether the addition of bevacizumab to
      standard corticosteroid therapy results in greater improvement in symptoms and less
      treatment-induced symptoms compared with standard corticosteroid therapy for patients with
      symptomatic brain radionecrosis following radiosurgery. It is hypothesized that the addition
      of bevacizumab to standard care corticosteroids will reduce treatment-induced toxicities and
      improve neurologic impairments in patients with brain radionecrosis following radiosurgery
      for brain metastases.

      This is a randomized double-blinded phase II study of corticosteroids with bevacizumab vs.
      corticosteroids with placebo for brain radionecrosis following radiosurgery for brain
      metastases. This is a two-arm clinical trial with parallel group design for longitudinal
      quality of life endpoint. Patients will be stratified according to age (≤ 65 years vs. &gt; 65
      years), pathological confirmation of necrosis (yes vs. no), MDASI-BT mean global score
      (symptom + interference scores) ( &lt; 4.0 vs. &gt; 4.0) and prior whole brain radiotherapy (yes
      vs. no). The primary and secondary objectives are detailed below.

      Primary Objective:

      To investigate whether the addition of bevacizumab to standard corticosteroid therapy results
      in greater improvement in symptoms (clinical and patient-reported symptom improvement
      associated with radionecrosis and less radionecrosis treatment-induced symptoms) compared
      with standard corticosteroid therapy.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To evaluate the toxicity profile associated with bevacizumab and corticosteroid therapy.

        2. To compare self-reported health related quality of life (HRQOL) using LASA,
           Dexamethasone Symptoms Questionnaire-Chronic (DSQ-C), and MDASI-BT symptom and
           interference score between treatment arms.

        3. To compare intracranial progression-free survival and time to maximum radiographic
           response between treatment arms.

        4. To compare the dose and duration of corticosteroids required between treatment arms and
           correlate steroid requirement with DSQ-C and MDASI-BT scores.

      Patient event monitoring will occur every 2 months after treatment up to 6 months. Then event
      monitoring will occur up to one year.

Once the patient has started the study treatment, the dose of corticosteroids will be tapered every 5 days (e.g., dexamethasone 2 mg or prednisone 15 mg per taper), as tolerated, under the management of the treating MD. If patients deteriorate while tapering, dexamethasone will be increased up to a maximum of 16 mg per day, as per treating MD, to manage symptoms.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Pre-Registration Eligibility Criteria:

          1. Patients who present with symptomatic brain radionecrosis after they have received
             radiosurgery for brain metastases from primary solid tumor including but not limited
             to lung, breast, colorectal cancer but excluding melanoma, choriocarcinoma, renal cell
             carcinoma or gliomas

          2. Patients at institutions that elect to utilize central imaging review to confirm
             eligibility must be pre-registered prior to submission of these images; images should
             be submitted as soon as possible after the pre-registration magnetic resonance imaging
             (MRI) is obtained; turnaround time for this review will be =&lt; 72 business hours after
             receipt of images by the Imaging and Radiation Oncology Core (IROC)

          3. Patients at institutions that elect to confirm eligibility locally may be
             pre-registered at the same time as they are randomized

        Registration/Randomization Eligibility Criteria:

          1. A diagnosis of radionecrosis will be based on a clinical onset of symptoms and
             radiological findings of radionecrosis at 3-24 months following radiosurgery, with or
             without pathological confirmation.

             1.1 'Symptomatic' brain radionecrosis to at least one lesion following radiosurgery
             treatment for brain metastases where 'symptomatic' is defined as:

             1.1.1 New or increasing headache associated with mass effect, sensory or motor
             abnormality, cognitive changes, speech difficulty, balance or coordination difficulty,
             cranial nerve deficits

             1.1.2 Symptoms are persistent or worsening despite administration of at least
             dexamethasone 4 mg (or equivalent corticosteroid) daily for 1 week

             1.2 Clinical eligibility supported by central imaging real-time review. The presence
             of at least the following conventional MR image characteristic:

             1.2.1 Conventional MR - Lesion quotient of &lt; 0.3, where lesion quotient is defined as
             the proportional value of the maximum axial cross-sectional area of the T2-weighted
             defined lesion over the maximum axial cross-sectional area of the contrast-enhancing
             lesion on the T1-weighted post-gadolinium sequence on a comparable axial slice. If the
             conventional MR findings are not seen, the following dynamic susceptibility-contrast
             (DSC) MR characteristics may be used to meet eligibility for this study.

             1.2.2 DSC MR - The cut-offs below will be based on GRE EPI DSC perfusion images,
             acquired without using a gadolinium pre-load:

             1.2.2.1 Relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) &lt;1.5 in the enhancing- lesion relative
             to normal-appearing white matter (NAWM)

             1.2.2.2. Percentage of signal recovery (PSR) &gt; 76%, where PSR is determined by
             comparing the lower signal intensity during passage of the contrast bolus with the
             post-contrast signal intensity on the signal intensity-time curve

             1.2.3 Centers that standardly use PET or MRS to determine a diagnosis of radionecrosis
             are permitted to use these modalities to assist in their patient selection; however
             the criteria described for conventional MR and/or DSC should also be met for study
             eligibility. Both PET and MRS are not mandatory for study eligibility.

          2. Prior to start of treatment

             2.1 Must have been taking a stable dose of corticosteroids for symptom management for
             at least 1 week before baseline MRI.

             2.2 No systemic therapy within 2 weeks prior to registration or plan for systemic
             therapy within the first 8 weeks after study registration. The protocol provides a
             list of 'approved systemic' therapies that are allowed for concurrent use with
             bevacizumab.

             2.3 No bevacizumab ≤ 3 months of study registration.

             2.4 Central imaging real-time review (72 hour turn around) to confirm eligibility.

          3. Not pregnant and not nursing, because this study involves an investigational agent
             whose genotoxic, mutagenic and teratogenic effects on the developing fetus and newborn
             are unknown. Therefore, for women of childbearing potential only, a negative urine or
             serum pregnancy test done ≤ 14 days prior to registration and confirmation they are
             not nursing is required.

          5. Karnofsky Performance Status ≥ 60%

          6. Required Initial Laboratory Values ≤14 days of registration:

             anti-coagulation therapy with an agent such warfarin or heparin are allowed to
             participate if INR ≤ 3.0.**

             6.10 UPC Ratio &lt;0.5 or if ≥ 0.5
