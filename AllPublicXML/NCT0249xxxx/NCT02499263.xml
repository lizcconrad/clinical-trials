    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single country, multi-center study in Ulcerative Colitis (UC) patients
      treated with adalimumab. 200 subjects will be enrolled at approximately 20 sites. The
      baseline assessment should be performed prior to the first dose of adalimumab (Visit1). Study
      visits will be conducted at weeks 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48 and 56 in accordance with clinical
      practice. All subjects will have one Follow-up for safety approximately 70 days after the
      last dose of adalimumab
