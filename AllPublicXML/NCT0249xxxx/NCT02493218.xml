  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Effective strategies to ameliorate the negative effects of stressful urban living are greatly
      needed. D-Stress Baltimore (DSB) is an evidence-based mindfulness-based instructional program
      of stress-reduction techniques, found to reduce mental health problems across many adult
      populations.

      The investigators propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial of the 12-week
      school-based DSB program compared with a 12-week school-based health education control
      program at Elev8 schools among 5th-8th graders to assess if DSB program is beneficial for
      mental health and behavioral problems among public middle-school students.

    <textblock>
      Urban youth in Baltimore City are under significant and inevitable stresses, including
      violent neighborhoods, failing schools, and interpersonal conflict. Effective strategies to
      ameliorate the negative effects of stressful urban living are greatly needed.

      D-Stress Baltimore (DSB) is an evidence-based mindfulness-based instructional program of
      stress-reduction techniques which has been found to be beneficial for adults in decreasing
      anxiety and depression, improving positive emotions, and reducing anger.

      The investigators propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial of the 12-week
      school-based DSB program compared with a 12-week school-based health education control
      program at Elev8 schools among 5th-8th graders. The investigators hypothesize that the
      D-Stress Baltimore Program will reduce negative emotions, including hostility, and improve
      coping.
