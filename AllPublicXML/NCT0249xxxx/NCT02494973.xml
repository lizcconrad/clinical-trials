    <textblock>
      Currently, no adjuvant study with hepatic arterial infusion in the adjuvant setting is
      opened. Recently, the results of a phase II study (NCT00268463, NSABP-C-09) assessing the
      potential benefit of systemic oxaliplatin and capecitabine alternating with HAI of FUDR,
      after resection of CRLM have been reported.

      The primary end point was 2-year survival. Fifty-five of 76 eligible patients were able to
      initiate protocol-directed therapy and completed median of six cycles (range, one to six).
      Three postoperative or treatment-related deaths were reported. Overall, 88% of evaluable
      patients were alive at 2 years. With a median followup of 4.8 years, a total of 30 patients
      have had disease recurrence, 11 involving the liver. Median disease-free survival was 32.7
      months. In conclusion alternating HAI of FUDR and systemic capecitabine and oxaliplatin met
      the prespecified end point of higher than 85% survival at 2 years and were clinically
      tolerable.
