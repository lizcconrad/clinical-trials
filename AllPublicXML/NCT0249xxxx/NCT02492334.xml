      antagonist, as compared to placebo in reducing PTSD symptomatology and alcohol use severity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As a result of sustained operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, there are an increasing number
      of U.S. military personnel and Veterans at risk of developing both posttraumatic stress
      disorder (PTSD) and an alcohol use disorder (AUD). If left untreated, individuals with
      PTSD/AUD are at risk of developing other mental health problems (e.g., depression, anxiety),
      suicidal ideation and attempts, physical health problems, reduced resiliency, vocational
      problems, and family/relationship impairment. While mental health services are in place for
      U.S. military personnel and Veterans, there are substantial gaps in the evidence base to
      guide treatment of co-occurring PTSD/AUD. The proposed study directly addresses this gap by
      testing the efficacy of doxazosin, a long-acting and selective alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist,
      as compared to placebo in reducing PTSD symptomatology and alcohol use severity among U.S.
      military personnel (including National Guard and Reservists) who have served in Operation
      Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, or Operation New Dawn (OEF/OIF/OND).

      The primary objectives of this stage II study are to evaluate the benefits of doxazosin as
      compared to placebo in reducing (1) PTSD symptomatology, (2) AUD severity, and (3) impairment
      in associated mental and behavioral health problems (e.g., depression, anxiety, sleep, risky
      behaviors) among OEF/OIF/OND Veterans (N=126) with co-occurring PTSD and AUD. Secondary
      objectives are to characterize the underlying pathophysiology of comorbid PTSD/AUD and
      identify prognostic indicators of treatment outcome using functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI). In order to accomplish this the investigators will (1) employ an
      intent-to-treat, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial that will consist
      of 12 weeks of treatment with doxazosin or placebo medication; (2) examine standardized,
      repeated dependent measures of clinical outcomes at 5 time points (baseline, week 4, week 8,
      week 12, and 1-month follow-up); and (3) employ advanced neuroimaging methodology.

    <description>Doxazosin is a quinazoline compound that is a selective inhibitor of the alpha-1 subtype of alpha-adrenergic receptors. The chemical name is 1-(4-amino-6,7-dimethoxy-2-quinazolinyl)-4-(1,4-benzodioxan-2-ylcarbonyl) piperazine methanesulfonate. The molecular formula for doxazosin is C23H25N5O5 â€¢ CH4O3S and the molecular weight is 547.6. Doxazosin is used clinically to treat hypertension and improve urination in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia.</description>
