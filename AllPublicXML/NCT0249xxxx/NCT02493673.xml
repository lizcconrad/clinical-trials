  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a highly prevalent sleep-related breathing disorder
      associated with adverse cardiovascular outcome. Underlying mechanisms are subject of debate.
      A causal relationship between OSA and systemic hypertension as well as peripheral endothelial
      dysfunction was shown, and there is accumulating evidence from physiologic and observational
      studies that cerebral autoregulation is insufficient to protect the brain from the nocturnal
      consequences of OSA. However, there are no data from randomised controlled trials proving a
      causal relationship between OSA and impaired cerebral vascular reactivity (CVR). The aim of
      this randomised controlled trial is to study the effects of a short-term CPAP withdrawal, and
      thus returning OSA, on daytime CVR and brain oxygenation to establish whether there is a
      causal relationship between OSA and cerebral vascular damage.
