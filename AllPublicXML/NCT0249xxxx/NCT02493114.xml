    <textblock>
      This trial investigates the impact of curative lung cancer treatment on functional status and
      exercise tolerance. Furthermore this trial investigates possible underlying causes and
      consequences of deconditioning.

    <textblock>
      Preliminary evidence suggests that patients with lung cancer experience a decrease of
      exercise tolerance and muscle strength during the course of their treatment. The underlying
      mechanisms and impact of this change has not yet been investigated. In light of this, our
      trial will prospectively follow a convenience sample of 70 patients with lung cancer who are
      treated curatively. Patients will be assessed before, during and at the end of the treatment
      (surgery and/or chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy). The aims of the study are to

        1. Investigate the influence of curative treatment for lung cancer on functional and
           maximal exercise tolerance (primary outcome).

        2. Investigate the metabolic changes underlying changes in exercise tolerance during
           curative treatment for lung cancer (primary outcome).

        3. Investigate the relationship between changes in exercise tolerance, daily physical
           activity, pulmonary function and skeletal muscle function during curative treatment for
           lung cancer (secondary outcome).

        4. Investigate the relationship between changes in exercise tolerance and self-reported
           quality of life, functional status, feelings of anxiety and depression and symptoms
           during curative treatment for lung cancer (secondary outcome).

        5. Investigate the relationship between physical activity and exercise tolerance on one
           hand and comorbidities, hospitalisations and cancer-related and all-cause mortality on
           the other hand after curative treatment for lung cancer (exploratory outcome).
