      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the influence of none-lubricated dry tube on the
      incidence of Postoperative Sore Throat (POST) after general anesthesia with endotracheal
      intubation.

    <measure>Oropharyngeal injury</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hours and 24 hours after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>assessed by direct visualization of the oropharyngeal cavity with regard to the location such as pharyngeal wall, uvula, vallecular, tonsillar fossa and pillars and presence of hyperemia, edema, hematoma, or any other lesions</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>respiratory symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week after the surgery</time_frame>
    <description>At the 1 week postoperative follow-up phone call, patients would be asked if they have upper respiratory symptoms such as cough, sputum, sore throat or fever. And if so, they would be checked if they diagnosed following diseases, common cold, tonsillitis, pneumonia or any other possible respiratory infectious diseases.</description>

    <measure>severity of postoperative sore throat (POST)</measure>
    <time_frame>When arriving at postanesthesia care unit (PACU) and thereafter 2, 4, and 24 hours after the surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of POST was evaluated on a 4-point-scale : 0, no sore throat; 1, mild sore throat (complained of sore throat only upon inquiry); 2, moderate sore throat (complained of sore throat on his/her own); 3, severe sore throat (change of voice or hoarseness, associated with throat pain)</description>
