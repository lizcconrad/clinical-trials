      The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of cold water immersion (CWI)
      during post-exercise recovery with different durations and temperatures on heart rate
      variability (HRV) indices. 100 participants performed a protocol of jumps and a Wingate test,
      and immediately afterwards were immersed in cold water, according to the characteristics of
      each group (CG: control; G1: 5' at 9±1°C; G2: 5' at 14±1°C; G3: 15' at 9±1°C; G4: 15' at
      14±1°C). Analyses were performed at baseline, during the recuperative technique (TRec) by CWI
      and 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 minutes post-exercise. The HRV indices average of all RR intervals
      in each analysis period (Mean RR), standard deviation of normal R-R intervals (SDNN), square
      root of the mean of the sum of the squares of differences between adjacent R-R intervals
      (RMSSD), spectral components of very low frequency (VLF), low frequency (LF) and high
      frequency (HF), scatter of points perpendicular to the line of identity of the Poincaré Plot
      (SD1) and scatter points along the line of identity (SD2) were assessed. Comparisons between
      groups and moments were performed using the technique of analysis of variance for repeated
      measures in two scheme factors. A significance level of p&lt;0.05 was considered.
