  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some subtypes of gastric and cardia tumors such as adenocarcinoma or gastric linitis with
      disseminated cells respond poorly to the pre-operative chemotherapy, and some of them do not
      respond to chemotherapy usually performed. Doing chemotherapy in these patients could delay
      their surgical management. The completion of chemotherapy for these patients would be a bad
      prognosis factor according to recent data from the literature. Therefore, the aim of this
      research is to find prognostic markers of sensitivity to chemotherapy usually performed. The
      investigators are going to use biopsies realized at diagnosis and select patients &quot;good and
      bad&quot; responders.

      Primary purpose:

      To study cardia and gastric tumors, molecular markers sensitivity to pre- and post- perative
      chemotherapy protocols (EOX protocol ... FOLFOX) or chemoradiation

      Secondary purposes:

        -  To assess the impact of patients' lifestyle (via a questionnaire) on the response to
           chemotherapy

        -  To study markers of cancer stem cells

        -  To correlate clinical and molecular markers with patient survival and quality of life
           questionnaires

        -  To characterize the expression levels (Met, Her2, FGFR2) and mutations (p53 ras) in
           frequently deregulated genes in gastric cancers.

        -  To characterize the level of expression of predictive candidate markers (ΔNp73, TAp73,
           HDAC4, mir140, EZH2, CXCL12, CXCR4, CXCR7) found in the literature.

        -  To correlate the abnormalities found in the with tumor stages (before and after
           chemotherapy) and with 5 years overall survival and progression-free patients
