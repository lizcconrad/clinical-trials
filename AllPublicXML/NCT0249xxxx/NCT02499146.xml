  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As part of the global clinical development program for Palbociclib, studies are planned in
      cancer patients in China. An assessment of Palbociclib pharmacokinetics in Chinese patients,
      as required by the Chinese Health Authorities, is therefore warranted. In addition, safety
      and efficacy will be also evaluated.

      The single and multiple 125 mg oral dose pharmacokinetics of Palbociclib will be
      characterized.
