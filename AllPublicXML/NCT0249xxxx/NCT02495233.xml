    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Phase 1b part of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      ASP2215 in combination with erlotinib and determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of
      ASP2215. The purpose of the Phase 2 part of the study is to evaluate the objective response
      rate (ORR) of the RP2D of ASP2215 in combination with erlotinib.
