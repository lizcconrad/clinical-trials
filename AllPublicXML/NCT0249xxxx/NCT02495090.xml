  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypospadias is the second most common malformation of the male genitalia and consists in a
      congenital hypoplasia of its ventral face. Hypospadias results from abnormal development of
      the penis that leaves the urethral meatus proximal to its normal glanular position. Meatus
      position may be located anywhere along the penile shaft, but more severe forms of hypospadias
      may have a urethral meatus located at the scrotum or perineum. Glandular and penile anterior
      represents approximately 70% of all the diagnosed cases.

      The frequency of family reached depend on the severity of hypospadias. The number of children
      which have hypospadias mutation discovered by classical technique is low. Families are often
      the cause of the discovery of new genes involved in sexual differentiation because they allow
      comparison of genomes of related persons, and detect more easily mutations.

      The aim of this protocol is to search for new genes involved in genital malformations such as
      hypospadias. Addressed to families with usual causes of these malformations excluded. The
      search for these mutations will be done by exome sequencing in families where several cases
      of hypospadias were identified.
