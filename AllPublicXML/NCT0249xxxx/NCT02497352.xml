  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effects of flaxseed supplementation on fasting blood sugar, lipid profile and
      anthropocentric measurements in subjects with metabolic syndrome, in a randomized,
      open-labeled, controlled pilot study, 44 subjects with metabolic syndrome will be received
      30g/d flaxseed with lifestyle modification or lifestyle modification alone for 12 weeks. Both
      groups will be advised to follow an energy balanced diet and physical activity
      recommendations. Parameters related to metabolic syndrome will be measured at the baseline
      and at the end of the study.
