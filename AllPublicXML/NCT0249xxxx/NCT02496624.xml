  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Guided Therapeutics (GTx) program at the University Health Network is a network of
      clinicians, scientists, and engineers focused on the development and translation of
      image-guided technologies focused on minimally-invasive, adaptive therapies. Technologies
      developed within the GTx program include a portable intra-operative cone-beam CT (in
      collaboration with Siemens) that has been evaluated in clinical trials for head and neck
      surgery. The intraoperative imaging has been integrated with tracking and navigational tools
      and optical imaging to provide a general &quot;surgical dashboard&quot; that is used to improve the
      accuracy of surgical resection.

      A recent addition to the GTx program is the development of the GTx OR, located within the
      general operating room of the Toronto General Hospital. The GTx OR houses 2 complimentary
      advance technologies: the Siemens Zeego and the Siemens Somotom Flash CT. The dual-energy
      Somatom Flash provides a &quot;gold-standard&quot; in CT imaging, while the Zeego provides excellent 3D
      Cone-beam CT with robotic placement for flexible integration within the operating
      environment. Together, the integration of these 2 components into a single OR enables
      critical evaluation of the limits of CT imaging technology for surgical guidance.

      This study will be conducted using solely the Cone-beam CT (Zeego) for percutaneous placement
      and localization of markers for resection of small pulmonary nodules during VATS.
