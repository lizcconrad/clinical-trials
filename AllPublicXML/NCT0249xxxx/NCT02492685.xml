    <description>After acquiring the EUS image by a regular procedure of EUS and contrast-enhanced with one of the fluoro-gas-containing contrast agents (SonoVue, Bracco, Germany), whole video is recorded on the embedded HDD (hard disk drive) of the US system for later analysis. The videos will be analyzed by using the VueBox software (Bracco Suisse SA, Geneva, Switzerland). After surgical treatment, we will compare the results of quantitative analysis with surgical pathology.</description>
