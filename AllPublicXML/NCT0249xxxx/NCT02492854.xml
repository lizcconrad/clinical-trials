      The objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of standard moist dressings and
      PICO single-use negative pressure dressings in post-operative lower extremity bypass
      patients. This study will compare the dressings' ability to decrease swelling, decrease
      post-operative infection, and improve mobility and quality of life measures.

      Subjects will be asked to participate in this study because they will undergo a lower
      extremity bypass using the ipsilateral great saphenous vein. Subjects will then be randomized
      to two post-operative treatment groups. One group will receive standard sterile gauze and the
      other will receive PICO single-use negative pressure dressings. Both groups will be assessed
      for study measures in follow-up visits as clinically indicated up to 1 year with the 30 day
      timepoint as the primary outcome for study measures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-operative infection after lower extremity bypass operations (LEB) can lead to
      devastating consequences. A systematic review of lower-extremity (LE) re-vascularization
      cases using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program
      (ACS-NSQIP) found that 11.1% of patients were diagnosed with surgical site infections (SSI).
      Another main issue in LEB is swelling, which occurs in about 70% of these patients and leads
      to increased pressure along the leading edges of often-long wounds.

      A wide variety of methods to decrease these post-operative consequences are currently part of
      standard practice. These techniques include covering incision sites with sterile gauze
      dressing, elevating the leg, and wrapping with pressure dressings. Patients are then
      instructed to change dressings themselves at home. However, SSI rates demonstrate that these
      are only partially effective measures, and there remains room to improve post-operative
      management of infection and swelling.

      Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT), over the past several years, has provided a way to
      post-operatively manage complex wounds (see device description). PICO single-use negative
      pressure dressings have been examined in previous studies. However, these were either case
      series, for chronic wounds, or for non-vascular procedures. The effectiveness of PICO versus
      standard dressings in LEB has yet to be determined in a prospective, comparative study.
      Results will indicate whether PICO should be included standard post-operative care of
      lower-extremity bypass patients. This study is designed to compare PICO and standard care,
      and determine which offers the best outcomes of decreased days to ambulation and
      post-operative wound complications.

    <description>Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT), over the past several years, has provided a way to post-operatively manage complex wounds. This is a therapy with potential to decrease rates of SSIs post-LE bypass. Unlike standard gauze dressings, negative pressure wound therapy provides a sealed, moist environment and shuttles fluid away from the wound. A suctioning unit applies even, negative pressure (typically -80 to -120 mmHg) and exudate is suctioned and collected in a control unit. The investigators would like to investigate the efficacy of PICO (Smith&amp;Nephew), a single-use one-step wound dressing which is effective for 7 days. It is lightweight and uses a small hand-held vacuum pump, both of which allow for ease of use. PICO has been FDA-approved.</description>
