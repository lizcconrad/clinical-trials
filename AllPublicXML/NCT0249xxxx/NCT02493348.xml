      Fibromyalgia is a chronic pain disorder associated with widespread pain that dramatically
      impacts patient's quality of life. Its exact cause has not yet been identified, however
      recent studies have indicated that fibromyalgia is associated with significant imbalance of
      the connectivity within brain networks associated with pain, decreased functional
      connectivity in the descending pain-modulating system, and increased activity in the pain
      matrix related to central sensitization. It has been suggested, therefore, that treatments
      that induce coherent neuronal activity, and/or stimulate synchronization of dysregulated
      brain circuitry, have significant benefits, improving pain management and enhancing patient's
      quality of life. Rhythmic Sensory Stimulation (RSS) is an example of a non-invasive treatment
      that is thought to indirectly stimulate neuronal coherence. The present research proposal
      aims to determine the effectiveness of Rhythmic Sensory Stimulation with 40 Hz sound on the
      treatment of fibromyalgia. The proposed treatment involves 30 minutes of daily rhythmic
      vibroacoustic stimulation at 40 Hz, 5 days per week, for 5 weeks. The treatment is
      self-administered by the patients at home with the Sound Oasis Vibroacoustic Therapy System
      (VTS) 1000 portable device. Measures of pain severity, fibromyalgia symptoms, sleep quality,
      and depression, will be compared before and after treatment between the treatment and control
      groups. The results of the present study will help to better understand the effectiveness of
      Rhythmic Sensory Stimulation to the treatment of chronic pain disorders, such as
      fibromyalgia, and contribute to the development of future studies to investigate the neural
      driving effects of therapies based on Rhythmic Sensory Stimulation.

      Fibromyalgia is a chronic pain disorder associated with widespread pain that dramatically
      impacts patients' quality of life. Its exact cause has not yet been identified, however,
      recent studies indicate that fibromyalgia is associated with significant imbalance of the
      connectivity within brain networks associated with pain, decreased functional connectivity in
      the descending pain-modulating system, and increased activity in the pain matrix related to
      central sensitization. It has been suggested that treatments that stimulate or induce
      coherent neuronal activity, and synchronize dysregulated brain circuitry, have significant
      benefits improving pain management and enhancing patients' quality of life.

      An example of a non-invasive treatment that is thought to indirectly stimulate neuronal
      coherence is Rhythmic Sensory Stimulation (RSS) in gamma frequencies. RSS stimulates the
      mechanoreceptors in the body using low-frequency sound (e.g., 40 Hz) by means of speakers in
      a chair. Previous research demonstrates significantly improved pain management in several
      pain conditions (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, low-back pain, sports injuries); however, little
      is known about the effect of RSS with low-frequency sound on fibromyalgia. The use of RSS to
      treat fibromyalgia was first explored very recently and findings indicate that this treatment
      could be effective for individuals with fibromyalgia given that 40 Hz low-frequency sound
      stimulation indirectly stimulates neuronal coherence. The present research aims to determine
      the effectiveness of RSS with 40 Hz sound for treating individuals with fibromyalgia.

      Aim: The present study aims to examine and determine the effectiveness of RSS at 40 Hz with
      sound in improving pain management and quality of life among patients with fibromyalgia.

      Intervention: The proposed treatment involves 30 minutes of daily rhythmic vibroacoustic
      stimulation at 40 Hz, 5 days per week, for 5 weeks. The treatment is self-administered by the
      patients at home with the Sound Oasis Vibroacoustic Therapy System (VTS) 1000 portable
      device. Measures of pain severity, fibromyalgia symptoms, sleep quality, and depression will
      be compared before and after treatment between the treatment and control groups.

      Outcomes: It is expected that patients undergoing RSS at 40 Hz will have significantly
      different scores after treatment on all outcome measures examined in comparison to the
      control group. The results of the present study will help to better understand the
      effectiveness of RSS for treatment of chronic pain disorders, such as fibromyalgia, and
      contribute to the development of future studies to investigate the neural driving effects of
      therapies based on RSS.

    <description>Rhythmic Sensory Stimulation (RSS) uses rhythmic sensory cues to induce brain entrainment based on the premise that the spontaneous electrical activity of the brain can synchronize to external periodic auditory, visual, or somatosensory stimuli. RSS can be delivered through sound devices. In this study, the stimuli will be delivered with a portable sound device called Sound Oasis Vibroacoustic Therapy System (VTS) 1000 unit, which is a low-voltage consumer product device that has two built in mid to high frequency speakers and one built in low frequency (subwoofer-type) speaker. The low frequency sounds played by the subwoofer speaker is experienced as vibrotactile vibration. Although the Intervention of Interest in this study is the sound (40 Hz RSS), the efficacy of the Sound Oasis VTS-1000 device to deliver this sound will also be observed.</description>
