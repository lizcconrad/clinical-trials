  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized trial examining the administration of a combination of biguanide
      metformin and atorvastatin (&quot;Lipitor&quot;) to men who are experiencing rising prostate-specific
      antigen (PSA) levels, despite having undergone radical therapy (surgery and/or radiation).

             past 5 years
