  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter, phase 2 clinical trial aimed at evaluating the
      efficacy and safety of the combination of bendamustine and brentuximab vedotin as a first
      salvage therapy in patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma or PTCL.

      A total of 25 patients with PTCL, and 40 with Hodgkin's lymphoma are expected to be treated
      according to this treatment protocol.

    <textblock>
      In the study, intravenous bendamustine will be administered at a dose of 90 mg/m2 on day 1
      and 2 and brentuximab will be given intravenously at a total dose of 1.8 mg/kg on day 1 of
      each 21 days-based cycle, for 6 cycles. All patients achieving a CR can be considered
      eligible to peripheral blood stem cell mobilization (to be performed with granulocytecolony
      stimulating factor alone) and may proceed to an ASCT at any time after cycle 4.
