  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To conduct a prospective, randomized trial to compare the efficacy of a group
      mindfulness-based intervention adapted for social anxiety disorder (MBI-SAD) versus cognitive
      behavior group therapy (CBGT).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this comparative trial is to determine if the MBI-SAD will be noninferior to
      CBGT in improving core symptoms of social anxiety disorder, depressive symptoms, self,
      esteem, disability and quality of life. A secondary aim is to examine whether treatment gains
      are maintained over a 6-month period. Exploratory aims of the study are to: 1) determine if
      the MBI-SAD enhances self-compassion and mindfulness relative to CBGT; 2) determine if
      changes in self-compassion and mindfulness mediate the clinical response to the MBI-SAD; and
      3) explore moderators of treatment response.
