  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b, open-label, multi-center, multiple-dose trial designed to estimate the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and select the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of avelumab
      (MSB0010718C) in combination with axitinib (AG-013736). Once the MTD of avelumab administered
      in combination with axitinib is estimated (dose finding portion), the dose expansion phase
      will be opened to further characterize the combination in term of safety profile, anti tumor
      activity, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and biomarker modulation.

             occurred during or within 12 months after the last dose of treatment

          -  Prior immunotherapy with IL-2, IFN-α, or anti PD 1, anti PD L1, anti PD L2, anti
             CD137, or anti cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated antigen 4 (CTLA 4) antibody
             (including ipilimumab), or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T cell co
             stimulation or immune checkpoint pathways

          -  Prior therapy with axitinib as well as any prior therapies with other VEGF pathway
             inhibitors.

          -  Known severe hypersensitivity reactions to monoclonal antibodies (Grade ≥3), any
             history of anaphylaxis.

          -  Any of the following in the previous 6 months: myocardial infarction, severe/unstable
             angina, coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft, symptomatic congestive heart failure,
             cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack, deep vein thrombosis or
             symptomatic pulmonary embolism.

          -  Vaccination within 4 weeks of the first dose of avelumab and while on trial is
             prohibited except for administration of inactivated vaccines (for example, inactivated
