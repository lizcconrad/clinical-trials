      The purpose of the protocol is to demonstrate the safety and the efficacy of a single
      injection of a new formulation of Clostridium Botulinum toxin type A haemagglutinin complex
      (BTX A HAC NG) to improve the appearance of moderate to severe glabellar lines (the lines
      between the eyebrows) and to assess the long term efficacy and safety of BTX-A-HAC NG after
      repeated injections.

      This is a multicentre study conducted in two periods. Subjects will first be enrolled to
      enter the double blind (DB) period Cycle 1. Subjects who are eligible for retreatment will
      then be offered to enter open label (OL) Cycles 2 to 5 as DB roll-over subjects. Once
      recruitment of the DB period is complete, the study will enrol additional BTX-na√Øve subjects
      (hereafter referred to as OL de novo subjects) into the OL period Cycle 1. All OL de novo
      subjects who are eligible for retreatment will also be offered to enter OL Cycles 2 to 5. A
      total of 580 subjects (180 subjects randomised in the DB period and an additional 400 de novo
      subjects in the OL period) are planned to complete the study.

          -  Have moderate or severe (Grade 2 or 3) vertical glabellar lines at maximum frown at

             scale.

          -  Have moderate or severe (Grade 2 or 3) vertical glabellar lines at maximum frown at

             childbearing potential is defined as post-menopausal for at least 1 year, surgical
             sterilisation at least 3 months before entering the study, or hysterectomy.

          -  Treatment with an experimental drug or use of any experimental device within 30 days
             prior to the start of the study and during the conduct of the study.

             participation in the study.

          -  Use of medications that affect neuromuscular transmission, such as curare-like non
             depolarising agents, lincosamides, polymyxins, anticholinesterases and aminoglycoside
             antibiotics, within the past 30 days.

          -  A history of facial nerve palsy.

          -  Marked facial asymmetry, ptosis, excessive dermatochalasis, deep dermal scarring, or
             thick sebaceous skin.

          -  The presence of any other condition (e.g. neuromuscular disorder or other disorder
             that could interfere with neuromuscular function), laboratory finding or circumstance
             that, in the judgement of the investigator, might increase the risk to the subject or
             decrease the chance of obtaining satisfactory data to achieve the objectives of the
             study.
