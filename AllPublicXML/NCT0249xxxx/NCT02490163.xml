  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a study performed in 2012, the investigators demonstrated that in ECP setting , the new
      automated device (Spectra Optia-MNC) released by Terumo BCT for MNCs collection based on
      intermittent flow is safe and ensures high-quality MNC collection and yield.(5, 6) More
      recently (in 2013), Terumo BCT released another automated system that allows to collect stem
      cells and MNCs basing on a continuous collection flow.(7, 8) The aim of this cross-over study
      is to compare yield (i.e. collection efficiency, CE) and quality (i.e. purity and
      contamination) of MNCs collected from patients undergoing ECP with two different automated
      systems: MNC and CMNC (Terumo BCT) processing 1.5 blood volumes during every collection
      procedure.

      Two-sequences-in-four-periods cross-over, with the same patients randomized to both devices
      within each ECP cycle in two consecutive cycles, open-label.

      Cycle 1 Cycle 1 Cycle 2 Cycle 2 Day 1 Day 2 Day 1 Day 2 Sequence A CMNC MNC MNC CMNC Sequence
      B MNC CMNC CMNC MNC There might be some carry over effect between procedure 1 and 2 within
      each cycle, because during the procedure the patient is administered fluids, and therefore
      cell counts/ml in the second day might be lower than in the first day; this it is intrinsic
      to the clinical procedure and can not be modified, but will be taken into account in
      statistical analyses. Carry over effect between first and second cycle is not expected, since
      they are performed at least 7 days apart; this allow the patient's cell blood count to be
      restored to baseline values; however, this will also be considered in statistical analyses.

    <description>The Spectra OptiaÂ® Apheresis System is an automated centrifugal system that separates whole blood into its cellular and plasma components. The device is comprised of three major sub-systems, 1) the apheresis machine itself, 2) a sterile, single-use, disposable blood tubing set, and 3) embedded software.
Terumo BCT developed a completely automated apheresis system: the Spectra Optia MNC and CMNC based on an automatic interface-controlled technology that allows MNCs collection without the intervention of an operator. The optical sensors continuously control and adjust the buffy coat layer by adjusting the plasma flow.
The Spectra Optia MNC collects MNCs by intermittent flow: MNCs accumulate and are flushed from a secondary chamber at intervals during the procedure. On the other hand, the very recently released Spectra Optia CMNC (developed especially to collect stem cells that reside in the MNCs layer) is able to collect MNCs by continuous flow.</description>
