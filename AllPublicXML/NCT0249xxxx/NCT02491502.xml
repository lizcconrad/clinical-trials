      This study evaluates the efficacy of the HIFU for the treatment of benign thyroid nodules
      with the FastScan version using assessment of patient experience and adverse event reporting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Echopulse is specially designed, manufactured and CE marked for treating benign thyroid
      nodules. HIFU is a completely alternative to surgery which utilizes high-energy ultrasound to
      deliver a large amount of sound energy to a focal point to rapidly induce tissue heating to
      85-90°C.This initiates tissue coagulation followed by tissue necrosis ablating the targeted
      area.

      In a previous european feasibility study performed at 1 site (Bulgaria), 20 benign thyroid
      nodules were treated. The HIFU treatment was well tolerated and showed efficacy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female patient 18 years or older.

          -  Patient presenting with at least one thyroid nodule with no signs of malignancy:

               1. Non suspect clinically and at ultrasonography imaging

               2. Benign cytological diagnosis at FNAB (fine-needle aspiration biopsy) from the
                  last 6 months

               3. Normal serum calcitonin

               4. No history of neck irradiation

          -  Normal TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone)

          -  Targeted nodule accessible and eligible to HIFU

          -  Absence of abnormal vocal cord mobility at laryngoscopy

          -  Nodule diameter ≥ 10mm measured by ultrasound

          -  Composition of the targeted nodule(s) : predominantly solid

          -  Patient has signed a written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Head and/or neck disease that prevents hyperextension of neck

          -  Known history of thyroid cancer or other neoplasias in the neck region

          -  History of neck irradiation

          -  Macrocalcification inducing a shadow in the thyroid significant enough to preclude the
             HIFU treatment

          -  Posterior position of the nodule if the thickness of the nodule is &lt;15mm

          -  Pregnant or lactating woman

          -  Any contraindication to the assigned analgesia/anaesthesia.
