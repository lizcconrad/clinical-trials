    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to demonstrate rifaximin 200-mg tablets (test) and Xifaxan® 200 mg
      tablets (reference ) are clinically bioequivalent with respect to the clinical cure rates
      when administered 3 times a day (TID) for 3 days in subjects with travelers' diarrhea.

      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled bioequivalent study with a clinical endpoint in the
      treatment of travelers' diarrhea. After three unformed stools are recorded within the 24
      hours immediately preceding randomization, subjects are to be randomized to receive the
      generic rifaximin 200 mg oral tablet, the reference listed drug (RLD) 200 mg oral tablet or
      placebo three times daily for 3 days (i.e., on study Days 1, 2, and 3). The primary endpoint
      is clinical cure at the test of cure (TOC) visit on study Day 5.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adult male or nonpregnant female aged ≥ 18 years non-indigenous travelers (e.g.,
             visiting students/faculty or international tourists) affected by naturally acquired
             acute diarrhea. Diarrhea is defined as the passage of at least three unformed stools
             in a 24-hour period. Stools are classified as formed (retains shape), soft (assumes
             shape of container), or watery (can be poured). When using this classification, both
             soft and watery stools are unformed and abnormal.

          2. At least three unformed stools recorded within the 24 hours immediately preceding
             randomization.

          3. At least one of the following signs and symptoms of enteric infection:

               -  abdominal pain or cramps

               -  nausea

               -  vomiting

               -  fecal urgency

               -  excessive gas/flatulence

               -  tenesmus

          4. Women of child-bearing potential have a negative pregnancy test prior to beginning
             therapy and agree to use effective contraceptive methods during the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant, breast feeding, or planning a pregnancy.

          2. Immediately prior to randomization, acute diarrhea for &gt; 72 hours.

          3. Presence of:

               -  fever (≥ 100 °F or ≥ 37.8 °C), or

               -  hematochezia (blood in stool), or

               -  clinical findings suggesting moderate or severe dehydration.

          4. Active, uncontrolled, or clinically significant diseases or disorders of the heart,
             lung, kidney, GI tract (other than infectious diarrhea in travelers), or central
             nervous system.

          5. Administration of any of the following:

               -  any antimicrobial agents with an expected activity against enteric bacterial
                  pathogens within 7 days preceding randomization

               -  more than two doses of a symptomatic antidiarrheal compound such as antimotility
                  agents, absorbent agents, and antisecretory agents within 8 hours preceding
                  randomization

          6. Use of any drug such as aspirin or ibuprofen (Advil), which can cause GI bleeding.
             Acetaminophen (Tylenol) or paracetamol is acceptable.

          7. If required during the study antimalarial prophylactic treatment, including
             doxycycline, is permitted prior to and during the study
