    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to assess the responses of pregnant women and their
      social network to six videos about health in pregnancy. Our goal is to assess a)
      acceptability and b) understanding of core messages about healthy eating, exercise and weight
      gain during pregnancy. We will also assess c) non-clinical sources of health information
      during pregnancy.

      Many women engage in suboptimal lifestyle behaviors during pregnancy. Many women do not
      realize that unhealthy diet, exercise and weight gain behaviors can be dangerous for their
      pregnancy and have harmful long-term consequences for their baby. There is great need for
      strategies to promote accurate knowledge about healthy behaviors during pregnancy. The
      purpose of this study is to assess responses to a brief (&lt;1minute) video about healthy
      behaviors during pregnancy. The study sample will include pregnant women and members of their
      social network. Participants will be asked to watch a brief video and complete an anonymous
      online survey measuring their response to the video, and their basic demographics. The
      surveys will also assess how family and friends impact pregnant women's health behaviors.
      Online surveys are entirely anonymous. We will recruit pregnant participants from two
      sources: the University of Michigan Health System's prenatal clinics and a social media
      website (Facebook).

    <description>During June, 2015, approximately 1200 women will be recruited through Facebook advertisements targeted at English-speaking women age 18-50 years living in the United States. Advertisements will contain 3 key features: an image, a caption, and &quot;ad copy&quot; followed by a link to the survey website. Individuals who click on the study link in the advertisement will be redirected to the study's Qualtrics web page where they will take a 15 web-page, multiple choice survey developed by the research team. The survey covers these domains: reaction to video, understanding of core message, self-efficacy around lifestyle behaviors, attitudes, beliefs and intentions regarding vaccination during pregnancy, key health information sources during pregnancy, and demographics.</description>

    <description>During June-August, 2015, approximately 500 women will be recruited at routine obstetric visits to the University of Michigan's outpatient clinics. Women who check in for an Ob appointment will be offered the opportunity to participate in an anonymous online survey. Individuals who express interest in participating will be provided with a laptop and headphones and directed to the survey Qualtrics site where they will take a 15 web-page, multiple choice survey developed by the research team. The survey covers these domains: reaction to video, understanding of core message, self-efficacy around lifestyle behaviors, attitudes, beliefs and intentions regarding vaccination during pregnancy, key health information sources during pregnancy, and demographics.</description>

    <description>Once a pregnant participant completes the survey, she will be asked to provide her email address. If she is willing to do so, Qualtrics will automatically send her an email containing a weblink to the survey for her social network. She can then provide this link to 1 or 2 social network members that she feels influence her health behaviors during pregnancy. These members are asked similar questions about their response to the video, as well as some additional questions about how they advise their pregnant person about different health topics. It is necessary to provide a unique weblink to her, so that the survey responses from the pregnant woman and her unique social network members can be linked.</description>

        Women recruited via either the social media, clinical, or online approach will be eligible
        for participation if they are aged 18 years and older, pregnant, and English-speaking.
        Women will be excluded if they deny being currently pregnant, do not identify as living in
        the US and aged 18 years or older, or if they report having previously participated in the
        study. The Qualtrics survey will automatically conclude if potential participants provide
        answers to screening questions that deem them ineligible. Participants will not be excluded
        based on racial-ethnic groups. Males will be excluded, as this is a study involving
        pregnant women.
