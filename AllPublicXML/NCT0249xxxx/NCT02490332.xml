  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of otitis media among Greenlandic children is one of the highest in the world
      and twenty per cent of schoolchildren have impaired hearing in the frequencies for normal
      speech. Yet, there are no national guidelines to ensure prevention and treatment of recurrent
      acute otitis media and chronic otitis media with effusion and impaired hearing in Greenlandic
      children. International studies from the developed part of the world have shown that otitis
      prone children may benefit from tubulation of the tympanic membrane. However, it is unknown
      if these results can be applied to Greenlandic children.

      This PhD project will conduct a randomised controlled trial comparing tubulation of the
      tympanic membrane, in Greenlandic children aged 9-36 months with recurrent acute otitis media
      and/or chronic otitis media with effusion, to conservative treatment. The children will be
      followed for two years. Outcome measures will include number of visits to health clinics,
      number of tympanic membrane perforations, number of episodes with acute otitis media
      according to medical records, Quality of life, measured by the validated questionnaires OM6
      and Caregiver Impact Questionnaire, number of episodes where per oral or intravenous
      antibiotics have been administered according to medical records and serious adverse events

      The trial will be conducted in collaboration with the Greenlandic health authorities and
      Copenhagen Trial Unit.

      With this trial the investigators hope to decrease the number of episodes with acute otitis
      media, the number of Greenlandic children with chronic perforations of the tympanic membrane
      and hearing impairment and increase quality of life.

      The results will add important knowledge to the effect of ventilation tube treatment also in
      an international aspect. There are to date only less than a handful of high quality studies
      concerning this issue on an international basis. The study will be among the first addressing
      this problem among populations with high risk of otitis media and is also of interest to
      other indigenous populations and the developing part of the world.

             or three episodes of acute otitis media in six months according to medical records or
             four episodes of acute otitis media in 12 months according to medical records

          -  Signed informed consent, signed by the legal guardian Exclusion criteria

          -  Children with orofacial cleft, Downs syndrome or known generalised immune deficiency

          -  Lack of signed informed consent, signed by the legal guardian.

        Description of experimental and control intervention Experimental intervention: The

        in general anaesthesia Control intervention: The control intervention is based on the
        current practice in Greenland, which includes systemic antibiotic treatment as well as
        aural toilette and topical antibiotics. Ventilation tube insertion during the study period
        is not accepted in the control group.
