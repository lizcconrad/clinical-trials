  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol use and alcohol-related disorders are highly prevalent in soup kitchen users, and
      this population is overrepresented by minorities and disproportionately affected by
      alcohol-related morbidity and mortality. Contingency management is a behavioral intervention
      effective in reducing substance use, but few studies have evaluated the efficacy of
      contingency management in the context of soup kitchens or homeless programs. The
      investigators found that contingency management, using a twice weekly testing and
      reinforcement schedule, had benefits for decreasing drinking in individuals receiving
      services at a homeless shelter. This study will replicate and extend these earlier findings
      to a soup kitchen population using more sophisticated alcohol monitoring procedures to better
      assess the extent of drinking in this group and in response to a contingency management
      intervention reinforcing submission of negative breath samples. Specifically, 40 hazardous
      drinkers recruited from a soup kitchen will be randomly assigned to one of two conditions:
      alcohol monitoring or the same plus reinforcement for provision of daily negative breath
      alcohol samples. The interventions will be in effect for 3 weeks, and all participants will
      also wear transdermal continuous alcohol monitors during the intervention period. Objective
      and subjective indices of alcohol consumption will be evaluated and compared between and
      within the treatment conditions. This pilot project will provide information regarding the
      effect size of contingency management reinforcing negative breath samples in an important
      health disparities group, and results from this study will guide subsequent grant
      applications focusing on methods to decrease drinking in this underserved population.
