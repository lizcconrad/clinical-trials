    <textblock>
      This study targets patients with cisplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy and will allow us
      to: a) study peripheral neuropathy in diverse human sensory neurons in ways that were not
      possible previously; b) gain insight on druggable targets to treat or prevent this
      devastating side effect of chemotherapy; c) provide a human cellular model that can be used
      for screening of drugs to determine if they are neurotoxic. The combination of patient
      information and in vitro measurements provides a highly relevant and clinically useful model
      for studies aimed to impact treatment selection for the individual cancer patient.

      Primary Objective-To establish a biobank of specimens that allows for the future creation of
      iPS cells with the potential to make human neurons for functional studies of specific
      genes/genetic variants.

      Secondary Objectives-To develop a clinically relevant in vitro model of cisplatin induced
      peripheral neuropathy to be used to 1) screen new drugs for the treatment or prevention of
      peripheral neuropathy; 2) evaluate candidate genes for their role in cisplatin induced
      neuropathy.

      Study Procedures-Subjects who wish to participate will undergo the following study
      procedures, which will be performed after the informed consent document is obtained:

        1. Sample Collection-A trained phlebotomist will conduct a blood draw for the collection of
           SIX samples for peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) isolation and infectious
           disease testing.

        2. Patient Self-Report of Toxicities-All patients in the study will be asked to fill out
           the Patient-reported Toxicity Form. This will take approximately 10 minutes to complete
           and consists of 20 questions related to patient symptoms describing toxicities
           experienced secondary to receiving cisplatin chemotherapy. They will be asked to fill
           out the form twice: (1) describing the peripheral neuropathy they currently are
           experiencing and (2) describing the worst peripheral neuropathy toxicity they
           experienced as a result of cisplatin therapy. These paper forms will be filled out at
           time of enrollment in the study.

        3. Physician Report of Toxicities-The patient's physician or the designatee will complete
           an adverse event form at day of enrollment detailing the physician's assigned grade of
           toxicities (according to CTCAE version 4.3) experienced from cisplatin. Other
           information regarding the particularly severe neurotoxicity may also be collected from
           physicians (e.g. patient use of walker or wheelchair, patient application for disability
           based on neuropathy).

        4. General Information- This information will be collected at the same time point as all of
           the other study procedures (i.e., Day One). This will include but may not be limited to:
           age, height, weight, patient-identified race and ethnicity, information about the
           chemotherapy regimen, total cisplatin dose administered and date of last cisplatin dose.

        5. Cisplatin Dose-Total cumulative dose of cisplatin administered will be recorded. Outside
           records will be obtained where needed.

        6. Follow-up and Duration of Follow-Up-There will be no subsequent patient follow-up after
           time of enrollment. Subjects may withdraw consent for specimen use by contacting the PI
           in writing.

      Whole blood samples will be obtained from all patients so that peripheral blood mononuclear
      cells (PBMCs) can be isolated and stored for the eventual creation of iPS cells. iPS cells
      have the potential to make human neurons that the researchers would like to use for
      functional studies of specific genes/genetic variants. All samples will also be tested for
      infectious diseases (Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, HIV 1 and HIV 2).

        This study will consist of two groups: testicular cancer patients with severe neuropathy
        (experimental group) and testicular cancer patients without neuropathy (control group). One
        control subject will be recruited for each experimental subject with severe neurotoxicity.
        Controls will be matched based on age (within 10 years), tumor type, race, ethnicity, and
        chemotherapy regimen and cumulative dose of cisplatin during which the toxicity occurred.
