    <textblock>
      A study to investigate if inhaled Interferon beta-1a is safe and tolerated, and can prevent
      or reduce the severity of asthma attacks when administered to asthma patients at the onset of
      symptoms of common cold or influenza
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>

      The study will consist of a Pre-Treatment Phase followed by a Treatment Phase. Patients are
      screened and enter the Pre-Treatment phase where they remain until they develop symptoms of a
      common cold or the flu. During this Pre-Treatment Phase patients will be asked daily if they
      think they have a common cold or the flu. When the patient answers yes to the question that
      he/she is coming down with a common cold or the flu, arrangements are made to evaluate the
      patient at the study site and, if eligible, enters the Treatment Phase. Baseline assessments
      are performed and the patient is randomized 1:1 to receive 24 μg (metered dose) inhaled
      Interferon beta-1a or placebo once daily for 14 days (delivered by the I-neb® device [Philips
      Respironics]). Treatment should start as soon as possible but no later than 48 hours after
      the onset of the first of the common cold or flu symptoms. Patients will be assessed with
      regards to exacerbations and changes in respiratory symptoms and reliever medication use at
      home using an ePRO device. Lung function will be measured both at home by the patients and at
      the study site. There will be five clinical visits during the Treatment Phase and two visits
      after the end of treatment; efficacy and safety will be monitored until 2-3 weeks after end
      of treatment when a final follow-up visit will take place.

      The study population will comprise adult asthmatic patients on a maintenance treatment of
      medium to high dose inhaled corticosteroids and a second controller medication (eg, long-
      acting β2 agonist), with a documented history of at least two severe exacerbations within the
      last 24 months, of which at least one has occurred during the last 12 months, and it is
      suspected by the patient that these aforementioned exacerbations were triggered by an upper
      respiratory tract infection (ie, related to symptoms of a common cold or the flu).

             equivalent daily) plus second controller medication for at least 12 months prior to
             the date the informed consent is obtained, with or without another controller such as
             oral corticosteroids (OCS), theophylline, tiotropium, or leukotriene receptor
             antagonists. The maintenance treatment must have been kept at the same or at a higher

             to a methacholine or histamine challenge (a decrease in FEV1 by 20% [PC20] at ≤8
             mg/mL) performed according to ATS/ERS guidelines (American Thoracic Society 2000) or
             proof of positive response to mannitol challenge (a decrease in FEV1 by 15% [PD15] at
             ≤635 mg) (Anderson et al 2009) documented within 5 years prior to Visit 1. If
             historical documentation is not available, reversibility or proof of a positive
             response to a methacholine, histamine or mannitol challenge must be demonstrated and
             documented at Visit 1

          5. Must answer &quot;Yes&quot; to the question &quot;Does a cold or flu make your asthma worse?&quot;

          6. To have had at least two documented severe asthma exacerbations within the last 24
             months that were suspected by the patient to have been caused by a common cold or flu
             and To have had at least one documented severe asthma exacerbation within the last 12
             months that was suspected by the patient to have been caused by a common cold or flu

          7. Female patients must be 1 year post-menopausal, surgically sterile, or using an
             acceptable method of contraception.

             of the research and its treatment including its risks and benefits

         10. Ability to read and write and use the electronic devices, including demonstrating an
             acceptable technique when using the ePRO device, home spirometer and the I-neb

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients should not enter the study if any of the following exclusion criteria are
        fulfilled:

          1. Involvement in the planning and/or conduct of the study (applies to both AstraZeneca
             staff and staff at third party vendors or staff at the study sites)

             Investigator

          5. Patients with ≥4 severe exacerbations during the last 12 months that the patient
             suspected were triggered by something else than an upper respiratory tract infection

             left ventricular hypertrophy

         10. Prolonged QTcF &gt;450 ms (for both gender) or shortened QTcF &lt;340 ms or family history
