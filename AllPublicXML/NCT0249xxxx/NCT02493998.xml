    <textblock>
      Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIB (MPS IIIB, also known as Sanfilippo Syndrome Type B) is a
      severe neurodegenerative disorder. The purpose of this study is to learn more about the
      health problems in patients with MPS IIIB and how to measure these problems over time. It
      will particularly look at how the disease develops in young children. This is an
      observational study, so no experimental drug will be given. The results from this study will
      help us design future studies to measure whether these health problems get better when we
      give experimental drug for MPS IIIB.

      This is a multicenter, multinational, longitudinal, observational study in subjects 1 through
      10 years of age who have been diagnosed with MPS IIIB. Data will be prospectively collected
      from 20 to 30 subjects to understand the clinical progression of MPS IIIB in terms of
      neurocognitive function, behavior, quality of life, imaging characteristics, genotype, and
      biochemical markers of disease burden. This information may help inform the design and
      interpretation of subsequent interventional studies.

        Study Population: Subjects diagnosed with MPS IIIB

        Males and females 1 through 10 years of age (ie, until they turn 11) with a documented
        diagnosis of MPS IIIB are eligible to participate in this observational study. Up to
        approximately 5 subjects 6 to 10 years old, inclusive, will be enrolled; the remaining
        subjects will be 1 to 5 years old, inclusive. Additional entry criteria follow.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals eligible to participate in this study must meet all of the following
             criteria:

          -  Has deficient NAGLU enzyme activity at Screening. Blood for NAGLU enzyme activity will
             be collected and analyzed centrally.

          -  Is ≥ 1 and ≤ 10 years of age and has an age-equivalent of ≥ 12 months on the VABS-II

          -  DQ ≥ 50 (determined by BSID-III or KABC-II)

          -  Has presented with signs/symptoms consistent with MPS IIIB; for individuals who have
             not presented with signs/symptoms of disease (e.g., siblings of known patients), the
             determination of eligibility will be at the discretion of the BioMarin medical monitor
             in conjunction with the site investigator.

          -  Written informed consent from parent or legal guardian and assent from subject, if
             required

          -  Has the ability to comply with protocol requirements, in the opinion of the
             investigator

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has another neurological illness that may have caused cognitive decline (e.g., trauma,
             meningitis, or hemorrhage) before study entry

          -  Requires ventilation support, except for noninvasive support at night

          -  Has received stem cell, gene therapy or ERT for MPS IIIB

          -  Has contraindications for neurosurgery (e.g., congenital heart disease, severe
             respiratory impairment, or clotting abnormalities)

          -  Has contraindications for MRI scans (e.g., cardiac pacemaker, metal fragment or chip
             in the eye, or aneurysm clip in the brain)

          -  Has a history of poorly controlled seizure disorder

          -  Is prone to complications from intraventricular drug administration, including
             patients with hydrocephalus or ventricular shunts

          -  Has received any investigational medication within 30 days prior to the Baseline visit
             or is scheduled to receive any investigational drug during the course of the study

          -  Has a medical condition or extenuating circumstance that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, might compromise the subject's ability to comply with protocol
             requirements, the subject's wellbeing or safety, or the interpretability of the
             subject's clinical data.
