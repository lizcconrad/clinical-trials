      The total duration of study participation for an individual subject is approximately 112 days
      (16 weeks) consisting of a Screening visit, followed within 21 days by Randomization and a
      Treatment Period of 84 days, and a Follow-up Period of 28 days after the last day of study
      drug treatment. A window of ± 3 days will be considered acceptable for conduct of each
      scheduled visit following the first visit.

      This study will require eight (8) scheduled subject visits:

      x Visit 1: Screening (Up to Day 21) x Visit 2: Baseline (Day 0) x Visit 3: Day 14 Interim (±
      3 days) x Visit 4: Day 28 Interim (± 3 days) x Visit 5: Day 42 Interim (± 3 days) x Visit 6:
      Day 56 Interim (± 3 days) x Visit 7: Day 84 End of Treatment/Unscheduled/ET (± 3 days) x
      Visit 8: Day 112 Follow-up (± 3 days)

               -  Identification of a target psoriatic lesion with a score of 3 on the Target
                  Lesion Assessment scale (5-point ordinal scale) for Scaling. (Other psoriatic
                  lesions may have lower scaling scores.)

          -  Females of reproductive potential must not be pregnant

          -  Female subjects with reproductive potential, if sexually active, must agree to use
             reliable means of contraception

          -  The subject must agree to avoid prolonged exposure to the sun and avoid the use of
             tanning booths or other ultraviolet light sources during the study.

          -  The subject must provide signed and dated written informed consent to participate in
             the clinical study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Females of reproductive potential who are not using reliable contraception.

          -  Presence of any non-psoriatic uncontrolled (in the Investigator's medical opinion)
             systemic disease. i

          -  Unstable forms of psoriasis, e.g. guttate, erythrodermic, exfoliative, palmoplantar,
             nail, or pustular.

          -  Use within 6 months of biologic treatment for psoriasis

          -  Use within 24 months of chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

          -  Use within 2 months of any systemic immunosuppressive therapy.

          -  Use within 1 month of (1) systemic corticosteroids, (2) systemic antibiotics, (3)
             systemic antipsoriasis treatments (e.g. methotrexate, corticosporin, hydroxyurea), (4)
             PUVA therapy, (5) UVB, (6) systemic anti-inflammatory treatment.

          -  Use within 2 weeks of topical antipsoriasis drugs or topical corticosteroids or
             topical retinoids.

          -  Presence of a condition (e.g., history of frequent consumption of substantial
             quantities of alcohol, or an untreated psychiatric condition) that makes it unlikely
             that the requirements of the protocol will be completed.

          -  History of any previous use of a Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) blocker or other
             immunomodulating drug as therapy for psoriasis within the 6 months prior to screening.

          -  History of any allergic reaction to any formulation of abacavir.
