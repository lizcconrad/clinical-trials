  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endometriosis is a benign gynecological disease, characterized by the presence of
      endometrium-like tissue outside the uterine cavity that affect up to 10-15% of women in
      reproductive age worldwide, with an extensive impact on women's wellbeing and their
      reproductive life. Endometriosis lesions are heterogeneous and three phenotypes of the
      disease are well recognized and are fundamentally different from each other: superficial
      peritoneal endometriosis (peritoneal implants), ovarian endometrioma (cyst ovarian
      endometriosis), and deeply infiltrating endometriosis (invasive nodules greater than 5 mm).

      The investigators performed a prospective multicenter comparative study to assess the
      maternal and fetal risks related to endometriosis during pregnancy, regarding disease
      phenotype, This study will evaluate with sufficient power the risk of prematurity and
      obstetrical complications associated with endometriosis according to disease phenotype.

      This study aims to provide new informations to pregnant women with endometriosis, guide the
      monitoring of pregnancy, optimize management strategies based on the nature of complications
      and ultimately to improve the health of women and their unborn child

      Design selected and justification: the study ENDOBST is a

        -  exposed / unexposed type

        -  in superiority

        -  with two comparative groups (endometriosis / without endometriosis)

        -  Ratio of distribution of subjects in study groups = 1: 2

      ENDOBST is a comparative prospective multicenter study presentation exposed - unexposed type.
      The study aims to compare the outcomes of pregnancy in the whole exposed group to controls
      and then according to the three disease phenotype (superficial, ovarian, and deep
      endometriosis).

      Endobst aims to test the hypothesis that women with endometriosis have an increased risk of
      preterm delivery (primary endpoint) and an increased risk of pregnancy complications
      (secondary endpoints) when compared to diseases-free women. Comparisons will be performed
      according to disease phenotype.

      These analyzes will be conducted after taking into account factors likely to influence the
      occurrence of preterm birth such as particularly social characteristics (education level,
      employment status), age and body mass index of women, pathological medical and obstetrical
      history and behavioral factors (tobacco).

      Secondary analyzes will be conducted to investigate the link between endometriosis, and other
      adverse pregnancy outcomes (premature rupture of membranes, intrauterine growth restriction),
      complications related to the surgical treatment endometriosis prior to pregnancy.

      Regarding the previous surgical treatment, the subgroup of women operated for their
      endometriosis will be compared to the subgroup of non-operated endometriosis in women and
      free subset of women. Particular attention will be paid to the phenotype of endometriosis and
      the nature of previous surgical treatment for pregnancy to control bias indication inherent
      in observational studies. These associations will be studied from multivariate regression
      models.
