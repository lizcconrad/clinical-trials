      A prospective, interventional, monocentric, controlled and randomized study will compare a
      conventional surgical technique to a surgical technique with the assistance of the Acetabular
      Cup Orientation Guide (ACOG, Materialise) System during total hip replacement (THR).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: The Acetabular Cup Orientation Guide(ACOG) System from MATERIALISE NV was
      developed and is intended to be used as a surgical instrument to assist in the positioning of
      acetabular cup components intra-operatively using anatomical landmarks of the pelvis that are
      clearly identifiable on preoperative computed tomography (CT) imaging scans.

      Use of ACOG is a relative new technique. ACOG, based on CT imaging data, fit directly into
      the patient's anatomy and enable primary total hip replacement . Data showing extra benefit
      of this technique compared to conventional THR technique are not widely available.

      Aim: To determine the safety of this new surgical technique compared to conventional THR.

      Methods: 30 participants will be randomized to 2 groups. One group will be operated for a THR
      with the conventional technique and the other group will be operated for a THR with the
      assistance of the ACOG System. CT imaging will be taken pre and post operatively to measure
      cup orientation.
