      Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) is a severe form of blistering skin disease
      caused by mutations in COL7A1 gene. This study aims to assess the safety of intradermal
      injections of gene-modified autologous fibroblasts in 5-10 adults with RDEB.

      This is an open-label single-centre phase I study with primary objective to evaluate the
      adverse and serious adverse events over 12 months' follow-up period. Secondary objectives
      include (1) analysis of type VII collagen (C7) expression and morphology of anchoring fibrils
      in the injected areas of the skin; (2) analysis of immune response to newly expressed C7.

      Each study participant will receive three intradermal injections of COL7A1 gene-modified
      autologous fibroblasts on Day 0 only. Each subject will undergo an initial screening
      including a physical examination and assessment of disease severity. Blood analyses and skin
      biopsies will be performed at various time points as per the monitoring schedule over 12
      months.
