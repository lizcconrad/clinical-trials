      This study has the following objectives:

        1. To raise the awareness of female smokers about the harmfulness of tobacco towards their
           life issues

        2. To encourage female smokers to stop using tobacco

        3. To assess the effectiveness of mindfulness approach for smoking cessation in women

      We will use cluster randomisation. About 40 companies (5 smokers / company) involved in the
      study will be matched on the company characteristics (e.g. company size, the industry the
      company belongs to). Using random generator in Excel, random number will be first generated
      to each pair i.e. there will be 1-40 random numbers. For each pair, the two companies will be
      randomly assigned to 0 or 1. Companies who are assigned to 1 will be allocated to
      intervention . Interviewers (assessors) in the follow-ups will not be involved in the
      randomization process and be totally blinded to the group assignment (allocation
      concealment).

      Invitation letter will be sent to beauty and retail industries or other women-related
      industries by Lok Sin Tong. Health talks on smoking and its hazard will deliver to each
      company. For those who join the workshops after the health talks will fill in pre- and post-
      workshop questionnaires (Appendix 4-5). Women who attend the health talk will be recruited on
      site. Women will be screened by the criteria of eligibility form (Appendix 1) and all
      eligible women smokers will be asked to sign on informed consents (Appendix 2, 3) before they
      participate in the programs. After they consent to participate, they will fill in a baseline
      questionnaire (Appendix 6), and will be assigned to intervention or control group according
      to the allocation of their company. Some of the eligible women may miss the health talks and
      directly join the intervention program, because of this situation the intervention group will
      be further divided into Group A and B: women in Group A will attend health talks and
      intervention program, women in Group B will only attend intervention program.

      Intervention group (Mindfulness Smoking cessation program): Women in intervention group will
      be provided 2 sessions mindfulness training within 2 weeks. Each session will last for 2
      hours with 8-20 participants. For mindfulness training, it aims to understand women smokers'
      own life planning, stressors and their correlation with smoking; to help women smokers sit
      with negative affect and alleviate stress through mindfulness; to educate women smokers gain
      the self-control and replace the smoking habit; to teach women smokers how to prevent craving
      and relapse. The tentative agenda is shown below:

      Session 1 (Introductory) Contents

        1. Pre-questionnaire

        2. Introducing mindfulness and managing craving with mindfulness

        3. Understanding the components of craving and its management

             -  The relationship between habitual response and learned association

             -  The physiological and psychological withdrawal symptoms

        4. Mindfulness yoga practices

      Responsible person* Smoking Cessation Program in Workplace (SCPW) staff &amp; Yoga teacher

      Session 2 (Advanced)

      Contents

        1. Knowledge about impacts of smoking on women's health

        2. Recapture the management of craving through mindfulness

        3. Mindfulness exercises

        4. Mindfulness yoga practices

      Responsible person* SCPW staff &amp; Yoga teacher

      * SCPW staff would be responsible for the whole session except for the part &quot;stress reduction
      and self-control through mindfulness yoga&quot;. It would be held by the yoga teacher.

      Control group (Self-help smoking cessation booklet): Only the self-help booklet related to
      quitting will be provided to the participants.

      Evaluation: 1-month telephone interviews will be conducted for control group at 1- (Appendix
      97) and 6-month follow-ups will be conducted for both groups (after the last interventions)
      by trained interviewers (blinded to the group assignment). Participants who have reported
      abstinence in past 7 days from smoking at 6-month follow-ups will undergo a non-biochemical
      validation to check their quitting status. They will be invited to have biochemical
      validation tests (saliva cotinine test and exhaled CO test) at 6-month follow-up.

      In-depth face-to-face interview will be conducted by trained interviewers in 10 randomly
      selected participants in each group (in total 20 participants) to better understand their
      quitting process, quitting difficulty, and their own feeling and experience in the project.
