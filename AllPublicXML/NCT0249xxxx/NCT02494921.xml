  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase Ib/II open label clinical trial in patients with metastatic castration
      resistant prostate cancer. The objective of the phase Ib portion of the study is to establish
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of docetaxel (75 mg/m2 IV
      q21 days) and prednisone (5mg orally BID) in combination with ribociclib in escalating oral
      daily doses in patients with metastatic CRPC with prior resistance to abiraterone and/or
      enzalutamide who have not undergone prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Up to three
      cohorts will be enrolled to determine the MTD and DLT profile of this combination during
      Phase 1b. Dose escalation will follow the standard 3+3 design. The dosing schedule is being
      chosen to allow patients to be exposed to the most efficacious dosing schedule of docetaxel
      (75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks). If there is excess toxicity observed with the treatment combination
      at the first dose level (dose level I), an alternative dosing schema may be pursued with
      weekly docetaxel treatment (35 mg/m2 weekly), which has demonstrated activity in mCRPC and
      decreased risk of cytopenias compared with every 3 week dosing schedule.

      The Phase II portion (N = 29) of the study is a single arm, two stage, open-label study of
      ribociclib (dosed at the RP2D) in combination with docetaxel and prednisone to determine the
      efficacy and further define the safety of the treatment combination. Patients will be treated
      with the combination of ribociclib plus docetaxel + prednisone for up to 9 cycles. If there
      is no evidence of radiographic or clinical disease progression after 9 cycles of protocol
      therapy, patients may continue on single agent maintenance ribociclib until the time of
      disease progression. Patients will have the option of starting maintenance ribociclib after 6
      cycles of docetaxel if stable disease or better on re-staging scans. The dose of ribociclib
      used during maintenance will be the same dose as that immediately preceding cessation of
      docetaxel treatment.
