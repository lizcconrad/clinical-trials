  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy, safety and tolerability of
      IDP-121 Lotion and vehicle in the treatment of subjects with acne vulgaris.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, vehicle-controlled, 12-week
      study to evaluate relative changes in inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts, as
      well as treatment success using an Evaluator's Global Severity Scale (EGSS) in subjects with
      moderate to severe acne. IDP-121 is a lotion for the topical treatment of acne.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Absolute change in inflammatory lesion count from baseline to Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>At each visit the Evaluator will count the total number of inflammatory lesions (papules, pustules, and nodules) on the subject's face.
Inflammatory lesions are defined as follows:
Papule - a small, solid elevation less than 5 mm in diameter. Most of the lesion is above the surface of the skin.
Pustule - a small, circumscribed elevation less than 5 mm in diameter that contains yellow-white exudate.
Nodule - a subcutaneous lesion greater than or equal to 5 mm in diameter.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Absolute change in non-inflammatory lesion count from baseline to Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>At each visit the Evaluator will count the total number of non-inflammatory lesions (open and closed comedones).
Non-inflammatory lesions are defined as follows:
Open comedones (black head) - a lesion in which the follicle opening is widely dilated with the contents protruding out onto the surface of the skin.
Closed comedones (white head)- a lesion in which the follicle opening is closed, but the sebaceous gland is enlarged by the pressure of the sebum build up, which in turn causes the skin around the follicle to thin and become elevated with a white appearance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of subjects who have a least a 2 grade reduction at Week 12 from baseline in the Evaluator's Global Severity Score and were Clear or Almost Clear</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>At each visit the severity will be determined based on evaluator-blinded evaluations of the signs and symptoms of acne vulgaris. Evaluations will be scored on a scale of 0-4 (Evaluator's Global Severity Score), with 0 being clear and 4 being severe. Please see below for complete definitions.
0 - Clear - Normal, clear skin with no evidence of acne vulgaris
Almost clear- Rare non-inflammatory lesions present, with rare non-inflamed papules (papules must be resolving and may be hyperpigmented, though not pink-red)
Mild- Some non-inflammatory lesions are present, with few inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules only; no nodulo-cystic lesions)
Moderate-Non-inflammatory lesions predominate, with multiple inflammatory lesions evident: several to many comedones and papules/pustules, and there may or may not be one nodulo-cystic lesion
Severe- Inflammatory lesions are more apparent, many comedones and papules/pustules, there may or may not be up to 2 nodulo-cystic lesions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent change in inflammatory lesion count from baseline to Week 4, 8, and 12</measure>
    <time_frame>4, 8, and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>At each visit the Evaluator will count the total number of inflammatory lesions (papules, pustules, and nodules) on the subject's face, and the percent change will be calculated.</description>
