    <textblock>
      Unintentional weight loss and undernutrition are well described problems in elderly
      inpatients, occurring in around 23% to 62% of hospitalised elderly in developed countries.
      Not only are a large number of elderly patients undernourished at admission but a substantial
      proportion will lose weight and become malnourished during their hospital stay, putting them
      at increased risk of morbidity, mortality, poor clinical outcomes and prolonged length of
      hospital stay. However, as it is frequently impossible to correct undernutrition prior to
      hospital admission, every effort should be made to prevent weight loss and correct
      undernutrition during hospitalization. Therefore, screening and identification of predictors
      of patients at risk of weight loss and undernutrition at admission, and identification of
      modifiable factors (e.g. eating preferences and poor food hospital intake), where
      intervention might be helpful, are important aspects in the management of these patients.

      Before designing a food intervention study, there is a need to, firstly:

        1. describe hospital food intake, eating habits and preferences in elderly inpatients
           during hospitalization

        2. describe predictors of hospital food intake in elderly during hospitalisation

        3. compare energy and protein intake in elderly inpatients during hospitalisation with the
           United Kingdom Dietary Reference Values (DRVs)

      This study is a hospital based observational study. Eligible participants will be 125
      patients (aged â‰¥ 65 years old) admitted to the geriatric wards of 2 hospitals in the West of
      Scotland. Eligible participants will be seen 96 hours after admission in order to explain the
      study process and to obtain written consent. The researcher will record basic body size
      measurements and will ask the patient questions about living conditions, feelings, memory,
      health, eating habits, opinions about the hospital food service. Nursing staff will be asked
      about patient's functional activity. The researcher will also take pictures of a subset of
      patients' main meals (breakfast, lunch and dinner) on a single day, prior to and after
      eating. The researcher will meet each patient three times in total. The first time 4 days
      after admission; a second time, during the hospital stay and, finally, around the time of
      discharge to repeat some measurements including weight, BMI, skinfold, mid upper arm
      circumference, grip strength and calf circumference.
