      This research study is evaluating the feasibility and impact of an intervention to improve
      sexual function in stem cell transplant survivors on participants' sexual function, quality
      of life, and mood.

      - It is expected that about 50 stem cell transplant survivors will take part in this research
      study.

    <textblock>
      Frequently survivors of stem cell transplantation report significant problems with their
      sexual function that impacts their quality of life, mood, and their intimacy and relationship
      with their partners. These issues can be very distressing to patients and their loved ones.
      The study doctors want to know if the introduction of an intervention focused on improving
      sexual function may improve a participant's overall care and quality of life.

      The intervention includes a comprehensive assessment by a transplant clinician who is trained
      in sexual dysfunction assessment to explore the reasons for sexual dysfunction and focus on
      ways to improve the participant's symptoms. The study will use a series of questionnaires to
      measure a participant's sexual function, quality of life, and mood.

      The main purpose of this study is examine whether this intervention is feasible and helpful
      for participants in terms of improving their symptoms and overall quality of life.
