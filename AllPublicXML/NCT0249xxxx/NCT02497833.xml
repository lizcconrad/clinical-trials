  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate the effects of retinoic acid on the HDL-PON1 activity
      and cholesterol efflux capacity in hypercholesterolemic subjects.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Paraoxonase 1 (PON1), an enzyme associated with high-density lipoprotein, is reported to have
      antioxidant and cardioprotective properties. And all-trans-retinoic acid revealed the
      ameliorating atherosclerosis effects in many reports.There maybe some correlations between
      retinoic acid and PON1 activity and the study aim to prove it.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>PON1 activity</measure>
    <time_frame>changes from baseline in PON1 activity at 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PON1 activity is assayed in HDL isolated from plasma of subjects from the placebo and retinoic acid groups by using UV spectrophotometry in a 96-well plate format using phenyl acetate or paraoxon as substrates.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lp-PLA2 activity</measure>
    <time_frame>changes from baseline in Lp-PLA2 activity at 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Lp-PLA2 activity in apoB-depleted plasma after the sedimentation of all apoB-containing lipoproteins with dextran sulfate-magnesium chloride is determined using the trichloroacetic acid precipitation procedure using 2-thio platelet-activation factor as a substrate.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>cholesterol efflux capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>changes from baseline in cholesterol efflux capacity at 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The cholesterol efflux capacity of the two groups at baseline and after intervention is quantified by a modified method with J774 mouse macrophages. After plated and radiolabeled with 3H-cholesterolper, J774 macrophages are incubation with cAMP and apoB-depleted serum successively. Liquid scintillation counting is used to quantify the efflux of radioactive cholesterol from the cells.</description>
