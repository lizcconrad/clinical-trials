  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare two different weight management delivery methods,
      social media versus a traditional care model.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a major public health issue as 68% of the US population is either overweight or
      obese. Weight loss and weight loss maintenance is difficult. Traditionally, successful weight
      loss programs are weekly behaviorally-based clinics which utilize a combination of calorie
      restriction and physical activity. Traditional &quot;face to face&quot; weekly meetings may not be
      feasible for everyone.

      An alternative to provide weight loss and weight maintenance created by KUMC researchers uses
      weekly group phone conference calls. While this method produced equal weight loss with fewer
      burdens to participants when compared to the traditional &quot;face to face&quot; format, weight regain
      during maintenance was still high.

      This study will investigate a new delivery method (social media platform &quot;Facebook&quot;) compared
      to the group phone conference calls. In the social media platform participants will be able
      to socialize with other participants in their group by commenting on posts from other
      participants or posting messages themselves. Social media delivered programs have potential
      to be a more a cost-effective approach to reach a large group of individuals.

      Participants who are eligible and decided to be in this study will take part in study related
      activities for 6 months.
