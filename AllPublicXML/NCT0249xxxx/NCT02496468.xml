  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite its common occurrence, still little is known about pathomechanisms determining
      different wheeze and asthma trajectories and phenotypes in children, and those beginning in
      adulthood. Therefore, deciphering underlying determinants for different childhood and adult
      asthma phenotypes is urgently needed to develop personalized treatment approaches targeting
      distinct underlying mechanisms. Thereby, secondary prevention early in the disease process
      can also be achieved. The decoding of such mechanisms and their translation to the individual
      patient is the aim of the Disease Area Asthma Allergy of the 'German Centre for Lung
      Research' (DZL).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      About 25-30% of children have at least one episode of wheeze before their 3rd birthday, but
      considerable clinical heterogeneity exists. Many of these children become symptom-free
      between 3 and 8 years of age, but some go on to persistent asthma in later childhood and
      adulthood. Despite its high prevalence, still little is known about pathomechanisms
      determining the different wheeze trajectories and phenotypes in children, and those beginning
      in adulthood. Frequency and severity of exacerbations may play an important role in the
      chronification process but underlying mechanisms are equally not well understood. Therefore,
      deciphering the role of airway mechanics, genetic, environmental and molecular determinants
      for different childhood and adult asthma phenotypes for exacerbations and chronification
      processes is urgently needed to develop personalized treatment approaches targeting distinct
      underlying mechanisms. Thereby, secondary prevention early in the disease process can also be
      achieved.

      In order to do so, a clinical cohort for childhood asthma has been set up with identical,
      standardized instruments (quality assurance plan: standard operating procedures (SOPs) for
      clinical and lab modules, shipment, biobanking and analysis as well as quality control
      measures via audits and site visits have been developed) across the participating 'German
      Center for Lung Research' (DZL) sites. Here, new-onset steroid/leukotriene receptor
      antagonist (LTRA) na√Øve wheeze/asthma patients and wheeze/asthma patients under controller
      therapy are being recruited in addition to healthy controls. Following recruitment, yearly
      follow-ups and exacerbation visits of included patients are being performed with identical
      study instruments and meticulous quality control checks as at baseline.

      PROJECT HYPOTHESES:

        1. Specific molecular phenotypes are associated with distinct wheeze/asthma phenotypes and
           trajectories. Thereby, underlying mechanisms as well as predictors and biomarkers for
           persistent asthma will be identified.

        2. Individuals at risk for exacerbations can be identified by clinical and molecular
           biomarkers, which will become novel targets for therapy and secondary prevention.

      WORK PROGRAM:

      1) Identification of molecular phenotypes, predictors and biomarkers for distinct
      wheeze/asthma phenotypes and trajectories.

      The investigators aim to recruit in total 360 cases and 150 controls to ensure sufficient
      statistical power for multivariate statistical analyses. Recruitment of study participants
      will be continued and cases will undergo 'deep phenotyping' as described below. In addition,
      healthy age and sex matched controls will be recruited from outpatient clinics. Cases and
      controls undergo a comprehensive clinical assessment including questionnaires (browser-based
      online data entry into extensive database with audit trail, plausibility and quality control
      checks implemented, data dictionary accessible), physical examination and lung function tests
      (spirometry and bodyplethysmography including bronchodilator response, multiple breath
      washout, exhaled nitric oxide). Biomaterials will be collected for the following analyses: i)
      blood samples; ii) nasal secretions; iii) pharyngeal swabs; iv) induced sputum; v) stool
      samples. Furthermore, epithelial cells will be collected by nasal brushings. Breath samples
      will be collected for analyses of volatile organic compounds. The cases will be followed up
      yearly using the same clinical tools and collecting the same biomaterials as at the initial
      visit to assess trajectories over time. Two closely interacting working groups have been
      established for all aims described herein: one lab and one data management/analysis group,
      each headed by expert members of the participating sites. The lab group will initiate and
      supervise all measurements of biomaterials; the data management/analysis group will expand
      the combined and shared data base and coordinate statistical analyses across sites. A common
      publication policy has already been developed. Using advanced bioinformatics, systems biology
      and machine learning approaches, the investigators will develop predictive (diagnostic)
      algorithms including clinical and molecular biomarkers for transient and persistent
      wheeze/asthma phenotypes and heir trajectories. These analyses will also identify underlying
      mechanisms and thereby potential targets for future personalized therapy comparing childhood
      and adult findings. During data collection. The investigators attempt to minimize missing
      data. In all cases where missing data will reduce power for subsequent analyses, imputation
      will be used in order to omit power loss.
