  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a respiratory disease starting point
      characterized by multiple systemic effects as cognitive dysfunction. This one seems to have
      an impact in activity daily living, considered mainly as a cognitive-motor dual task
      situations. Yet to date, no study has specifically focused in the cognitive-motor performance
      in patients with COPD or on the effects during a rehabilitation program. The main objective
      of this work was to evaluate the impact of cognitive dysfunction in COPD, comparing
      performance between COPD patients and healthy subjects in a single and dual task
      cognitive-motor situation. The secondary objective was to assess the impact of a
      rehabilitation program on these performances.
