    <textblock>
      Background:

      High risk patients with lung disease who undergo cardiac surgery are at significant risk of
      postoperative complications leading to prolonged hospital stay. One method of reducing the
      risk of lung complications is to treat patients with non-invasive ventilation or continuous
      positive airways pressure postoperatively. However, this often requires admission to a high
      dependency unit or intensive care, and is uncomfortable because of the need for a tight
      fitting mask, as well as being labour intensive and costly. Nasal high flow oxygen
      (Optiflow™) is a new alternative as it provides warmed humidified oxygen at high flow, and
      also has been shown to assist breathing and improve recovery. It is comfortable during use
      and indeed may be more comfortable than standard (dry) oxygen via a facemask (Hudson type) or
      nasal prongs. It may be administered on a normal ward, however its routine use in high risk
      patients with lung conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, recent
      chest infections and heavy smokers has not been tested before.

      Aims/Objectives:

      The primary aim of this clinical trial is to determine if prophylactic nasal high flow oxygen
      (Optiflow™) therapy in cardiac surgical patients at high-risk of developing post-operative
      pulmonary complications is associated with shorter hospital length of stay.

      Methods:

      High risk adult patients who are scheduled to undergo cardiac surgery will be recruited with
      full ethical approval and informed consent. Before surgery, each patient will perform a 6-
      minute walking test under the supervision of a physiotherapist. This simple tests measures
      how far patients can walk in 6 minutes. Additionally, patients will undergo spirometry
      testing which is used to assess how well the lungs work by measuring how much air the patient
      inhales and exhales and how quickly they exhale. Patients will thereafter undergo surgery
      under general anaesthesia as they would normally. After the operation they will be looked
      after following our recovery protocols, incorporating pain relief, regular physiotherapy,
      early mobilisation and eating and drinking, and removal of chest drains and tubes as soon as
      possible.

      On arrival in the critical care area after their surgery, patients will be randomly assigned
      to receive supplemental oxygen via a soft facemask (Hudson Type) (standard group), or via
      high-flow nasal cannulae(Optiflow™) (intervention group). Patients will be administered
      oxygen for at least 24 hours after surgery.

      Patients who develop breathing difficulty will receive treatment based on their clinical
      need. On the fifth or sixth postoperative day they will repeat the walking test and
      spirometry. The investigators will use a short questionnaire to determine if there is any
      difference in how patients feel they recovered before they leave hospital and how quickly
      they returned to normal activities after discharge, and also to evaluate how they tolerated
      either the facemask (Hudson Type) or high flow nasal cannulae (Optiflow™).

      The investigators have used data from previous studies to calculate that a total of 74
      patients will be needed to take part, in order to evaluate whether high flow nasal oxygen
      (Optiflow™) leads to reduced length of hospital stay after high risk cardiac surgery compared
      with usual care oxygen therapy.

    <description>In patients randomised to receive high flow nasal oxygen therapy (HFNO) the gas flow through the HFNO will be calculated for each patient, based on their body characteristics, and comfort level. The standard starting flow rate will be 30 L/min, and this will be adjusted up or down between a range of 20-50 L/min with the aim of achieving both patient comfort and a respiratory rate of less than 16 breaths per minute.</description>

    <description>Patients randomised to receive standard oxygen therapy will be fitted with a soft face mask or nasal prongs, and the oxygen flow titrated to provide pulse oxygen saturation of at least 95% (93% for those at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure such as confirmed COPD patients and morbidly obese patients). The standard oxygen therapy group will have their oxygen gas flow reduced to the minimum level which provides saturations of at least 95% (93% for those at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure such as patients with confirmed COPD and morbidly obese patients).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients are eligible for inclusion if:

          -  they are aged over 18 years

          -  are undergoing elective cardiac surgery (coronary artery bypass grafting, valve
             surgery or both)

          -  they have one or more patient-related risk factor for post-operative pulmonary
             complications (COPD, asthma, lower respiratory tract infection in last 4 weeks, body
             mass index≥35 kg/m2 current (last 6 weeks) heavy smokers (&gt; 10 packyears)).

          -  they are capable of performing a 6MWT - The 6MWT is a clinical exercise test, and is
             popular in clinical practice because it aids clinical decision making, and because of
             the belief that it provides a better estimate of functional capacity than resting
             cardiorespiratory measurements (24). The 6MWT is the most popular clinical exercise
             test, which is used for postoperative evaluation after lung surgery and has also been
             validated in cardiac surgery

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Contraindication to high flow nasal oxygen such as nasal septal defect.

          -  Not met extubation criteria by 10am the day after surgery (Day 1).

          -  Need for CPAP pre-operatively.
