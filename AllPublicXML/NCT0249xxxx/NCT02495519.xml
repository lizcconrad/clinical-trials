    <textblock>
      Aggressive fibromatosis (AF, also known as desmoid tumor) is a fibroproliferative neoplasm
      that typically arises in the abdomen but can develop at other anatomic sites, most commonly
      in the extremities. These tumors have a relatively high local failure rate after primary
      treatment using surgery and/or radiotherapy, and although rarely giving rise to distant
      metastases, can be multifocal and, therefore, not surgically resectable. Moreover, tumor may
      recur adjacent to the site of surgical resection, underscoring the limitations of surgery in
      the palliative setting. Therefore, effective medical therapies for AF are needed to maintain
      quality of life and prolong survival.The goal of the current study was to better define the
      activity of imatinib in the treatment of AF and to determine the molecular basis for
      response/nonresponse
