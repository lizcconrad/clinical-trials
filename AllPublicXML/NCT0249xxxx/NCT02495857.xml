    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, three-arm, parallel group, clinical
      study to evaluate the superiority of 3 weekly intra-articular (IA) doses of 2 mL of
      Investigational hyaluronate as compared to placebo injected into the target knee for the
      treatment of pain in subjects with Osteoarthritis (OA).The safety and effectiveness of the
      investigational product will also be compared with Euflexxa.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of 3 weekly IA doses of 2
      mL of hyaluronate viscosupplement as compared to placebo injected into the target knee for
      the treatment of pain in subjects with OA As secondary objectives, the study will evaluate
      the safety and effectiveness of 3 weekly IA doses of 2 mL of Viscosupplement as compared to
      Euflexxa injected into the target knee for the treatment of pain in subjects with OA. In
      addition, to assess the effect of Viscosupplement on pain, stiffness, and physical function
      of the target knee, as well as functional health and general well-being
