  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is being conducted in Hypophosphatasia, a bone disorder caused by gene
      mutation(s) resulting in bone defects. These gene mutations cause low levels of an enzyme
      needed to harden bone. The purpose of this study is to provide access to treatment in a
      disease where no approved treatment exists. This is an experimental treatment provided under
      specific treatment guidelines in which safety endpoints will be collected.

    <description>Patients participating in this program will receive 6 mg/kg/week asfotase alfa (administered at a dosage regimen of 1 mg/kg 6 times per week or 2 mg/kg 3 times per week at the discretion of the Investigator) by SC injection. During follow-up visits, dose adjustments to account for changes in body weight will be made. Additional incremental dose adjustments for lack of efficacy or safety reasons may also be decided upon by the Investigator in consultation with the Alexion Medical Monitor.</description>

             the performance of any program-related procedures and must be willing to comply with
             program procedures. Where appropriate and required by local regulations, patient
             assent for participation must also be obtained.

          2. Patient must have a documented diagnosis of HPP as indicated by a documented history
             of HPP-related skeletal abnormalities and one or more of the following:

               -  Documented tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP) gene mutation(s)

               -  Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level below the age-adjusted normal range AND
                  plasma pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP) above the upper limit of normal at Screening.
                  NOTE: Historical results for PLP may be used to determine patient eligibility.
                  The criterion for plasma PLP is not applicable if the patient is receiving
                  pyridoxine treatment.

                  be using highly effective contraception consisting of two forms of birth control
                  (at least one of which must be a barrier method) as described below starting at
                  Baseline and continuing for 3 months after program completion.

                    -  Simultaneous use of condom, and for the female partner established use of
                       hormonal contraceptives (eg, oral, injected, implanted) or intra-uterine
                       contraceptive device

                    -  Simultaneous use of condom, and for the female partner occlusive cap
                       (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with intravaginally applied spermicide

          5. Female patient is:

               -  Of non-childbearing potential, defined as:

                    -  Prepubertal; OR

                    -  Post-menopausal (defined as absence of menses for 12 months prior to
                       Baseline or bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy with bilateral
                       oophorectomy at least 6 months prior to Baseline); OR

                    -  Surgically sterile (defined as having hysterectomy or tubal ligation at

             postmenopausal or surgically sterile as defined in inclusion criteria 5 above) must
             have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test at Screening.

        Exclusion Criteria

        the following exclusion criteria:

          1. Patient has geographic access to and qualifies for enrollment (as determined by the
             Sponsor and Investigator) in any other Alexion-sponsored clinical trials of asfotase
             alfa that are open to enrollment (eg, ENB-010-10).

          2. Patient is pregnant, trying to become pregnant, or is lactating.

          3. Patient has a documented sensitivity to any of the components of asfotase alfa.

             Screening.

          5. Patient is currently enrolled in any other program or study involving an
             investigational new drug, device, or treatment for HPP (eg, bone marrow
             transplantation).

          6. Patient has any other medical condition, serious intercurrent illness, or other
             extenuating circumstance that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may significantly
             interfere with program compliance, including all evaluations and follow-up activities.
             Patients who previously received treatment with asfotase alfa may be considered for
