    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open label, Phase 1 dose-escalation study of DSP-7888 Dosing Emulsion
      administered to adult patients with advanced malignancies. Patients will be administered
      escalating doses of DSP-7888 Dosing Emulsion intradermally or subcutaneously in accordance
      with the following regimen: once weekly for four weeks during the Induction Phase, once every
      7 to 14 days for 6 weeks during the Consolidation Phase, and once every 14 to 28 days until a
      discontinuation criterion is met during the Maintenance Phase. Once RP2D is determined from
      either the intradermal or subcutaneous group, an additional 40 patients evaluable for
      response may be enrolled as an expansion cohort at this dose and route of administration to
      confirm safety and tolerability. Separate from the dose-ascending cohort and RP2D expansion
      cohort described previously, and once the intradermal dose-ascending cohort is completed, up
      to 20 MDS patients who are refractory to treatment with hypomethylating agents (HMAs) will be
      enrolled into an MDS expansion cohort. Of these 20 MDS patients, one-half will receive
      DSP-7888 at 10.5 mg according to the modified schedule employed in Phase 1 (every week for 4
      weeks, every 2 weeks until Week 24, and then every 4 weeks; [MDS Cohort 1]). The other half
      of the MDS patients will receive DSP-7888 at 10.5 mg in an alternative dosing schedule where
      DSP-7888 is administered every 2 weeks until Week 24, after which it will be administered
      every 4 weeks (MDS Cohort 2).
