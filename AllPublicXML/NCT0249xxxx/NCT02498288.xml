  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, crossover, randomized, single dose, three treatments, three periods
      and six sequences, single dosage, balanced study to determine Bioequivalence of Isotretinoin.
      Bioequivalence will be compared between the reference medication one (T1) vs the test
      medication (T3): (T1 vs T3); and the reference medication two (T2), vs test medication (T3):
      (T2 vs T3). Finally, treatments T1 vs T2 will be compared statistically to determine if they
      are bioequivalent.
