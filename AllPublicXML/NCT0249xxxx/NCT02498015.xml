  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A total of 100 people with chronic HCV and recent injection drug use or recipients of opioid
      substitution therapy will be enrolled in 5 countries and 21 study sites. Participants with
      genotype 1a infection or cirrhosis will receive 12 weeks of open-label
      paritaprevir/ritonavir/ombitasvir and dasabuvir (&quot;3D&quot;), and twice-daily ribavirin.
      Participants with genotype 1b infection without cirrhosis will receive 12 weeks of open-label
      &quot;3D&quot;. The study consists of a screening phase (6 weeks), treatment phase (12 weeks) and
      follow-up phase (96 weeks) to evaluate treatment response and reinfection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 100 people with recent injection drug use or recipients of opioid substitution
      therapy will be enrolled from drug and alcohol clinics, tertiary liver and infectious
      diseases clinics and community health centres across Canada, Europe, New Zealand, France, and
      Australia. This will include at least 30 participants with F3/F4 liver disease. Participants
      will be considered recent injection drug users if they have used injection drugs in the 6
      months prior to consent. Participants receiving stable opioid substitution therapy (stable
      dose for &gt;2 weeks) will also be included. Patients with frequent drug use that is judged by
      the treating physician to compromise treatment safety will be excluded. The study drugs
      consisting of two tablets of the co-formulated paritepravir/ritonavir/ombitasvir (75/50/12.5
      mg) once daily, one dasabuvir tablet (250 mg) twice daily, ribavirin (1000 mg) daily in two
      divided doses (genotype 1a only and/or cirrhosis). Electronic blister packs will be used to
      improve and monitor treatment adherence. This innovative strategy with the &quot;3D&quot;
      interferon-free regimen could considerably enhance the capacity to scale-up HCV treatment
      among PWID, and is therefore being evaluated in this phase IV study within a well-defined
      PWID population.
