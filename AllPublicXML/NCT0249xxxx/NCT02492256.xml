    <textblock>
      Although circumferential pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) has been considered as the
      cornerstone for atrial fibrillation ablation, there has been a substantial recurrence rate.
      The investigators designed a prospectively randomized study to evaluate whether additional
      atrial ganglionated plexi ablation guided by the SUMO technology improves the clinical
      outcome in patients with persistent AF.
