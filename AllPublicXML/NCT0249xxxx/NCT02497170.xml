      Translational study based on the American Association of Diabetes Educators 7 behaviors to
      manage Type 2 diabetes

      The Primary Investigator will meet with patients that attend routine visits for Diabetes 2 in
      the primary care office on a monthly basis to set behavior goals. Behavior goals will be set
      by patient's choice of 4 out of 7 of the AADE7 recommendations. The goals are health eating,
      being active, monitoring,taking medications, problem solving, healthy coping, and reducing
      risk. Once the goal is chosen, the PI and patient will make a plan to address the goals on a
      monthly basis for four months. There will be pre and post questionnaires that will evaluate
      diabetes knowledge and self-efficacy. There will also be a pre and post measure of the
      patient's Hemoglobin A1c which is a measurement that helps determine the extent of glycemic
      control over a three-month period.

      The goal of the study is to determine if translation of the AADE7 behavioral goals into the
      primary care setting will make a difference in diabetes knowledge, self efficacy, and
      Hemoglobin A1c.
