  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, study of TGR-1202, a PI3K delta inhibitor, administered
      together with ruxolitinib in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (specifically:
      polycythemia vera, primary myelofibrosis, PPV-MF or PET-MF) and MDS/MPN.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The escalation will include 2 initial sequential stages. Stage 1 will include myelofibrosis
      or hydroxyurea-resistant/refractory PV patients already taking therapeutic levels of
      ruxolitinib, but who are not achieving maximal response at the highest tolerated dose of
      ruxolitinib as discussed among investigators. Only TGR-1202 will be escalated in a modified
      3+3 dose escalation algorithm to determine the MTD of TGR-1202 to be given with any given
      dose of ruxolitinib.

      Stage 2 will include myelofibrosis or hydroxyurea-resistant/refractory PV patients who have
      never been on JAK-STAT inhibitory agents, and includes simultaneously initiation of both
      ruxolitinib and TGR-1202. In Stage 2, JAK Inhibitor naïve patients will receive TGR-1202 at
      the recommended dose established in Cohort 1, and ruxolitinib. As patients in Stage 1 will be
      on ruxolitinib at different doses, dose levels in Stage 2 will expand to meet requirements
      for safety analysis.

          -  Any major surgery, chemotherapy, or immunotherapy within the last 21 days (limited
             palliative radiation is allowed ≥ 2 weeks); concurrent hydroxyurea is allowed if less
             than 2 grams daily and on stable dose for ≤ 14 days prior to study entry;

          -  Patient has received wide field radiotherapy (including therapeutic radioisotopes such
             as strontium 89) ≤ 28 days or limited field radiation for palliation ≤ 14 days prior
             to starting trial medications or has not recovered from side effects of such therapy;
