      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Apatinib combined with
      cytokine-induced killer cell (CIK) vs Apatinib alone as the third line therapy for advanced
      lung adenocarcinoma patients with wild-type EGFR

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      400 patients with stage IIIB &amp; IV lung adenocarcinoma who had received surgery and
      chemotherapy,will be randomly divided into group A（Apatinib plus CIK treatment ) or group
      B（Apatinib), and the randomize ratio will be 1:1. Patients in group A will receive 3 cycles
      of CIK treatment (every 1 year) and Apatinib (continuous).Patients in group B will receive
      only Apatinib (continuous) .
