      This Study is a collaborative project with partners (people with scleroderma and
      stakeholders) designed to refine an internet program for patients with scleroderma and to
      compare the internet program to an authoritative educational book (Taking Charge of Systemic
      Sclerosis [TOSS]). During a 16-week comparative effectiveness 16-week randomized controlled
      trial, the investigators will recruit up to 250 patients who will be randomized to either
      TOSS or authoritative book for patients, The Scleroderma Book: A Guide for Patients and
      Families.
