  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) is a growing problem and few people have access to
      adequate diagnosis and treatment. The current recommended treatment regimen for MDR TB has a
      minimum of 20 months duration with high toxicity. Scale up of MDR TB treatment is associated
      with high default rates, and experience in the Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) programme in
      Uzbekistan shows that the current standard treatment greatly limits the ability to scale up
      to meet the high rates of MDR TB in the region.

      Evidence from Bangladesh in 2010 showed that a 9-month short-course regimen could achieve a
      relapse-free cure rate of 88%. Several countries in West Africa started implementing similar
      regimens with similar outcomes. Evidence of effectiveness of this shortened regimen among
      regions with high second line drug use and resistance is still limited.

      The investigators propose an observational study under programmatic conditions to evaluate
      the effectiveness of a shortened course MDR TB regimen in the high MDR/extensively drug
      resistant (XDR) TB prevalence and high second-line drug resistance setting of Karakalpakstan,
      Uzbekistan.

      A prospective observational study has been designed. The study regimen is composed of an
      intensive phase of at least 4 months duration of Pyrazinamide (Z) + Ethambutol (E) +
      Isoniazid (H) + Moxifloxacin (Mfx) + Capreomycin (or Kanamycin/Amikacin) (Cm/Km/Am) +
      Prothionamide (Pto) + Clofazimine (Cfz) and a continuation phase of oral drugs
      Z-E-Mfx-Pto-Cfz. Patients will be followed up until the end of treatment and during 12 months
      after treatment completion in order to evaluate the rate of relapse.

      Data will be recorded in patient's clinical files and electronic databases and analyzed with
      Stata 11.0.

      This study is a result of ongoing collaboration of MSF with the Ministry of Health in
      Uzbekistan; results will be shared with the national health authorities, World Health
      Organization and the rest of the scientific community and aim to influence and improve
      treatment and care of patients with MDR TB.
