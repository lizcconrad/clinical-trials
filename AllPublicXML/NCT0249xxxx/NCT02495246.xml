  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial in which healthy volunteers will be administered two experimental
      Ebola vaccines: ChAd3-EBO-Z and Ad26.ZEBOV. Four groups of volunteers will be vaccinated with
      both vaccines one after the other in a prime/boost regimen.

      All ChAd3-EBO-Z doses are 1x10^11 vp and all Ad26.ZEBOV doses are 5x10^10 vp.

      Group 1 will receive a ChAd3-EBO-Z priming vaccine and an Ad26.ZEBOV boosting vaccine 28 days
      later.

      Group 2 will receive an Ad26.ZEBOV priming vaccine and a ChAd3-EBO-Z boosting vaccine 28 days
      later.

      Group 3 will receive a ChAd3-EBO-Z priming vaccine and an Ad26.ZEBOV boosting vaccine 56 days
      later.

      Group 4 will receive an Ad26.ZEBOV priming vaccine and a ChAd3-EBO-Z boosting vaccine 56 days
      later.

      The study will assess the safety of the vaccinations, and the immune responses to
      vaccination. Immune responses are measured by tests on blood samples.

      The ChAd3-EBO-Z and Ad26.ZEBOV vaccines are called viral vectored vaccines. They are made
      from viruses which are modified so that they cannot multiply. The viruses have extra DNA in
      them so that after injection, the body makes Ebola proteins (but Ebola does not develop), so
      that the immune system builds a response to Ebola without having been infected by it.

      Healthy volunteers will be recruited in Oxford and London, England. The study will be
      co-funded by GSK Biologicals and Crucell Holland BV.
