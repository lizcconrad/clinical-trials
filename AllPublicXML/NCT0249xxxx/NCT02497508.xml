  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single arm, phase II trial in previously treated patients with MPM who
      are considered candidates for immunotherapy and repeat thoracoscopies/transthoracic biopsies.
      Nivolumab will be administered 3 mg/kg q2 weeks by intravenous injection.

      The administration of nivolumab as monotherapy will improve DCR form 20% to 40% at 12 weeks
      when compared to DCR of patients treated with best supportive care based on historical
      controls.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with histological or cytological diagnosed malignant pleural mesothelioma and
             age &gt;18 years.

          -  Progressive disease after at least one course of chemotherapy.

          -  Previous chemotherapy or experimental therapy ≥ 4 weeks ago.

          -  Medically suitable for limited surgical intervention (pleural biopsies up to limited
             pleurectomy).

          -  Not considered candidates for trimodality treatment (as part of a study).

          -  Measurable or evaluable disease (see tumor response assessment).

          -  Ability to understand the study and give signed informed consent prior to beginning of
             protocol specific procedures including the approval of a second thoracoscopy or
             transthoracic pleural biopsy after the third course.

          -  Radiotherapy is allowed when this is given for palliation, the interval is &gt; 12 weeks
             and not all tumor is within the irradiation field.

          -  Unstable peptic ulcer, unstable diabetes mellitus or other serious disabling
             condition.

          -  Impaired renal function: creatinine clearance less than 50ml/min.

          -  Concomitant administration to any other experimental drugs under investigation.

          -  Patients are excluded if they have an active, known or suspected autoimmune disease.

             replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to
             recur in the absence of an external trigger

          -  Patients are excluded if they have a condition requiring systemic treatment with
             either corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other
             immuno-suppressive medications within 14 days of study drug administration. Inhaled or
             topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses &lt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents
             are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease.

          -  Patients are excluded if they have had prior treatment with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1,
