        Inclusion Criteria for Healthy Smoking Subjects

          1. Must have signed an informed consent indicating that they understand the purpose of
             and procedures required for the study and are willing to participate in the study.

          2. Be between 18 and 75 years of age, inclusive, at informed consent.

          3. Healthy as determined by a physician, based on medical history and physical
             examination.

          4. Must have smoked regularly in the 12-month period preceding the screening visit and
             have a pack history of ≥ 5 pack years (number of pack years = number of cigarettes per
             day/20 x number of years smoked).

        Inclusion Criteria for All COPD Subjects

          1. Must have signed an informed consent indicating that they understand the purpose of
             and procedures required for the study and are willing to participate in the study.

          2. Aged between 40 and 75 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed
             consent.

          3. COPD diagnosis: Subjects with a diagnosis of COPD as defined by the American Thoracic
             Society (ATS)/European Respiratory Society (ERS) guidelines (Celli, 2004). Symptoms
             must be compatible with COPD for at least 1 year prior to screening and
             post-bronchodilator spirometry readings at screening:

               -  Post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio of &lt;0.7

               -  Post-bronchodilator FEV ≥40 % and ≤80 % of predicted normal values calculated
                  using NHANES reference equations.

        Additional Inclusion for Smoking COPD Subjects 1. Must have smoked regularly in the
        12-month period preceding the screening visit and have a pack history of ≥ 5 pack years
        (number of pack years = number of cigarettes per day/20 x number of years smoked).

        Exclusion Criteria for Healthy Smoking Subjects Any potential subject who meets any of the
        following criteria will be excluded from the participating study.

          1. Upper or lower respiratory tract infection within 4 weeks of the screening visit.

          2. Positive test for alcohol at screening.

          3. Taking prescription medication in the 14 days before screening.

          4. Subjects whose primary consumption of tobacco is via methods other than cigarettes
             (manufactured or self-rolled). Primary methods of tobacco consumption that are
             excluded include, but are not limited to pipes, cigars and e-cigarettes.

          5. Subjects who are unable to produce a total weight of at least 0.1 grams (g) of
             selected sputum at screening

          6. Urinary cotinine levels at screening &lt; 30 ng/ml.

          7. Subject is mentally or legally incapacitated.

          8. Subject is an employee of the Sponsor or contract research organization (CRO), or a
             relative of an employee of the Sponsor or CRO.

          9. Any other reason that the Investigator considers makes the subject unsuitable to
             participate.

        Exclusion Criteria for COPD Subjects Any potential subject who meets any of the following
        criteria will be excluded from the participating study

          1. Upper or lower respiratory tract infection within 4 weeks of the screening visit.

          2. Positive test for alcohol at screening.

          3. Subjects who are unable to produce a total weight of at least 0.1g of selected sputum
             at screening.

          4. Subject is mentally or legally incapacitated.

          5. Subject is an employee of the Sponsor or contract research organization (CRO), or a
             relative of an employee of the Sponsor or CRO.

          6. Any other reason that the Investigator considers makes the subject unsuitable to
             participate.

          7. A history of life-threatening COPD including Intensive Care Unit admission and/or
             requiring intubation.

          8. Taking theophylline in the 28 days before screening

          9. Change in COPD medication in the 28 days before screening

         10. Taking oral steroids in the 28 days before screening

        Additional Exclusion Criterion for Smoking COPD Subjects

          1. Subjects whose primary consumption of tobacco is via methods other than cigarettes
             (manufactured or self-rolled). Primary methods of tobacco consumption that are
             excluded include, but are not limited to pipes, cigars and e-cigarettes.

          2. Urinary cotinine levels at screening &lt; 30 ng/ml.

        Additional Exclusion Criterion for Ex-Smoking COPD Subjects
