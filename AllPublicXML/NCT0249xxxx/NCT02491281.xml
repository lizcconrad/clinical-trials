      This study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ascending single doses of
      LNA043 given intra-articularly into the human knee joint prior to its removal at total knee
      replacement surgery. In addition, this will help to establish the presence of LNA043 within
      the articular cartilage, assess pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity, and will allow
      exploration of biomarkers of hyaline cartilage repair.
