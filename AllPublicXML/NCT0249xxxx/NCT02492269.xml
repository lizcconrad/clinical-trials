  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this project is to determine the role of anesthetic management in
      children undergoing cardiac surgery utilizing CPB in the setting of fast tracking and early
      extubation. An ideal anesthetic technique would ensure abolishing or diminishing stress
      response as would be evident by the stress markers levels and the level of two cerebral
      injury biomarkers (S 100 B and NSE). This should translate to better immediate postoperative
      outcome and hopefully improve both the short and the long term neurodevelopmental outcome in
      these children. The project is prospective, randomized and blinded study. The first and
      second aim of the study should be conducted over 2 year period. Our long term aim will be
      concluded when these children reach the school age.

    <measure>Change in cytokine levels</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 24 hrs post-op</time_frame>
    <description>Cytokine levels in plasma and MUF samples will be measured at induction of anesthesia (baseline), after sternotomy, after initiation of CPB, at the conclusion of surgery (separation from CPB and administration of protamine and prior to skin closure) and at 24 hours post-operatively.</description>

    <measure>Change in hormone levels</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 24 hrs post-op</time_frame>
    <description>ACTH, cortisol, epinephrine, &amp; norepinephrine will be measured at induction of anesthesia (baseline), after sternotomy, after initiation of CPB, at the conclusion of surgery (separation from CPB and administration of protamine and prior to skin closure) and at 24 hours post-operatively.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in neurodevelopmental scores</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 1 year post-op</time_frame>
    <description>Children will have a baseline neurodevelopmental Bayley score during the preoperative period. These children will be retested prior to discharge from the hospital, at their post-op cardiology visit (usually 1-3 months post-op), six month and one year postoperatively to evaluate neurodevelopment progress.</description>
