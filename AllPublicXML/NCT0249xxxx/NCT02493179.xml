      A prospective, randomized, parallel, double blind Placebo- controlled study to examine the
      efficacy of dose regimen of serratiopeptidase (serodase 5 mg) on 112 males and females
      volunteers in the treatment of inflammation after third molar surgery, comparing drug
      treatment vs placebo over a period of 20 weeks To assess the dose effectiveness of the dose
      regimen of Serodase 5 mg; the primary outcomes are trismus and swelling while inflammation is
      a secondary outcome.the expected duration of participants participation will be around 5 days
      divided into 4 visits, the time point of the measurment are (0,2,4 and 5 days).

      The results are expected to assess the improvement of the maximal interincisal distance,
      reduction of swelling and improvment in the sensation of post-operative pain.
