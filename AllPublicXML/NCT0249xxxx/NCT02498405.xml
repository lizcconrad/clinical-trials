  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine if the Smartphone electrocardiogram (ECG)
      is an acceptable replacement for a standard ECG in the identification of ST Elevation
      Myocardial Infarction (STEMI).

      Toward this objective, this study involves the following:

        -  Obtain simultaneous recordings of a standard 12-lead ECG and the iPhone &quot;12-lead
           equivalent&quot; ECG on patients presenting with chest pain in which the STEMI protocol was
           activated.

        -  Obtain simultaneous recordings of a standard 12-lead ECG and the iPhone &quot;12-lead
           equivalent&quot; ECG on patients presenting to the Emergency Department for evaluation of
           chest pain, not necessarily presenting with STEMI.

        -  Reading of ECGs (standard 12-lead and iPhone) by three independent cardiologists, who
           are blinded to the initial clinical ECG readings, the type of ECG equipment used, and
           the patient's clinical information.

        -  Assess the operational feasibility of using the Smartphone to obtain &quot;12-lead
           equivalent&quot; ECG recordings in patients suspected to have STEMI, and

        -  Determine the possibility of pooling the data obtained from this study with data from
           other institutions conducting identical studies, and developing a future IRB-approved
           protocol and statistical analysis plan to compare the sensitivity, specificity, positive
           predictive value and the negative predictive power of the iPhone ECG, using a paired
           standard 12-lead ECG as the gold standard.

      There will be no therapeutic interventions. A single research-related procedure will be
      required, i.e. an iPhone ECG. Effort will be made to ensure that the performance of this
      procedure will not delay any treatment and/or diagnostic procedures that are part of usual or
      specialized care that the patient requires. Effort will be made to enroll 1 STEMI patient for
      every 2 non-STEMI patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female &gt;= 18 years of age.

          -  Ability to understand and sign a written informed consent form, which must be obtained
             prior to initiation of any study procedures (patient or legally acceptable
             representative).

          -  Symptoms of chest pain upon presentation at the Intermountain Medical Center Emergency
             Department.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability or refusal of the patient and/or the patient's legally-acceptable
             representative to provide written informed consent for any reason.

          -  Other conditions that in the opinion of the Principal Investigator or
             Co-Investigator(s) may increase risk to the subject and/or compromise the quality of
             the clinical trial.
