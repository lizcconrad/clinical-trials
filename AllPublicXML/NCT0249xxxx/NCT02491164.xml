  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Critically ill patients are often ventilated in dedicated critical care units to provide
      respiratory support. Despite best practice patients can often develop a condition called
      adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is characterised by deterioration in their
      respiratory function, and changes on chest x-ray. The correct management for ARDS is
      identifying the underlying condition causing the deterioration and identifying appropriate
      targeted therapy. One such cause is pneumonia, caused by a bacterial infection in the lungs
      of a ventilated patient. The patients may have been ventilated due to pneumonia but they may
      also develop pneumonia whilst ventilated. Ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) has
      significant mortality.

      Despite all the clinical and laboratory data at the investigators' disposal there remains
      great difficulty in the accurate diagnosis of pneumonia and therefore treatment is often
      given empirically. Therefore, there is an urgent clinical need for accurate methods to
      diagnose the presence of bacteria deep in the lung in ventilated critically ill patients. As
      such, the investigating team have developed and synthesised an imaging agent called BAC TWO.
      BAC TWO will be instilled directly into the lungs of 12 patients to assess whether it can
      label gram-negative bacteria in the human lung.

      The primary objective of this study is to deliver a BAC TWO microdose to 3 ventilated
      controls and 9 patients to assess the imaging parameters of BAC TWO over human
      autofluorescence and to assess if gram-negative bacteria can be detected in vivo in situ
      within the distal lung. The primary endpoint is to visualise the delivery of a microdose of
      BAC TWO and assess imaging parameters in;

        -  3 mechanically ventilated patients to provide a control population (cohort 1)

        -  3 bronchiectasis patients with predominant colonisation with gram-negative bacteria
           (cohort 2)

        -  3 bronchiectasis patients with predominant colonisation with gram-positive bacteria
           (cohort 3)

        -  3 patients with suspected pneumonia and pulmonary infiltrates in ICU (cohort 4)

      For all cohorts, eligibility will be verified by a clinical trial physician after written
      informed consent has been obtained. For all cohorts, a bronchoscopy with lavage will be
      performed to harvest broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Fibre-based endomicroscopy (FE)
      will be performed on up to three areas and up to 80μg (± 25%) in total of BAC TWO will be
      instilled in up to 3 sites.

      Participants will be asked to provide additional blood and urine samples with the intention
      of examining for systemic uptake of the BAC TWO probe. Routine blood investigations will be
      performed 4-6 hours following the administration of BAC TWO. The completion of all
      assessments at 4-6 hours post dose marks the end of the participant's participation in this
      study unless there are ongoing adverse events requiring resolution. The primary aim will be
      measured during bronchoscopy and all routine investigations will have been completed 6 hours
      post dose.
