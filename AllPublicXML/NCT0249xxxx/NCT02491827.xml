  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose of the study is to answer the question whether confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE,
      also named 'optical biopsy') might improve the results of medically necessary neurosurgery to
      prove practicability, safety and harmlessness of CLE during neurosurgical procedures

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In patients requiring neurosurgical oncological Intervention using endoscopic devices, a mini
      laser probe will be administered through the endoscopic device to characterize in vivo the
      tissue by thousandfold magnification down to the cellular level (so-called optical biopsy).
      Magnification is presented to the neurosurgeon in time to better differentiate between
      healthy and pathological tissue. Post-surgery results of in-vivo Differentiation will then be
      compared to histocytopathological findings.

             pressure &gt;120 mmHg or a combination of both

          -  Pulmonic diseases that might result in an advanced risk for anesthetic measurements

          -  Patients being vaccinated with live vaccines (14 days Prior) or contra Influenza (7
