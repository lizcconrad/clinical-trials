    <textblock>
      In order to determine the acceptability of a breast cancer-specific cognitive behavioral
      therapy intervention, as well as to obtain preliminary data to assess efficacy in managing
      symptoms, the investigators will ask 45 breast cancer survivors with moderate insomnia,
      fatigue, and/or pain to use the investigators' internet-based intervention for 8 weeks and to
      complete patient-reported outcomes assessments before and after the 8 week intervention.

    <description>PROSPECT is an internet-based exercise and behavioral symptom management program developed for patients who experience long-term side effects from cancer treatment. The cancer-specific symptom management intervention is intended as a self-management adjunct to improve cancer- and treatment-related symptoms through non-pharmacologic approaches.</description>
