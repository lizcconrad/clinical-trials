  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of Left atrial appendage closure compared to standard antiplatelet therapy in
      patients with AF who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (LLA-PCI) study is to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of implantation of left atrial appendage closure compared to
      standard antiplatelet therapy for prevention of thromboembolic events and stent thrombosis in
      subjects with AF who underwent PCI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be prospective randomized (1:1) open label pilot study. Patients with unstable
      angina and non-ST-elevation ACS and history of AF will be included in this study. After PCI
      and DES implantation TEE will be performed for assessing LAA anatomy and size eligible for
      left atrial appendage closure device implantation. After screening all patients will be
      randomized in two groups. The first (control) group will receive standard antiplatelet and
      anticoagulation therapy according to the guidelines (2), the second group of patients will
      undergo left atrial appendage closure device implantation. After the PCI the first group will
      take Triple therapy (warfarin + clopidogrel+aspirin) during 45 days and after combination of
      warfarin+clopidogrel to 6 months after procedure and then only warfarin. The second group
      will take Triple therapy (warfarin+clopidogrel+aspirin) during 45 days following PCI and
      after control TEE, warfarin will be discontinued. Then patients from the second group will
      take DAPT combination (clopidogrel+aspirin) to 6 months after procedure and then only
      aspirin. Patients will be followed at 45 day, and every 3 months during 12 months of follow
      up (Figure 1). At each follow-up visits the data regarding clinical events and healthcare
      utilization will be collected.

    <description>Left Atrial Appendage Closure Device will be implanted immediately after successful PCI procedure. It will be implanted via a trans-septal approach by use of a catheter based delivery system to seal the ostium of the LAA. The implantation will be guided by fluoroscopy and TEE to verify proper positioning and stability. The study group will take Triple therapy (warfarin+clopidogrel+aspirin) during 45 days following PCI and after control TEE, warfarin will be discontinued. Then patients from the study group will take DAPT combination (clopidogrel+aspirin) to 6 months after procedure and then only aspirin.

    <intervention_name>Left Atrial Appendage Closure Device (Watchman)</intervention_name>
    <description>This device is a self-expanding nickel titanium (nitinol) frame structure with fixation barbs and a permeable polyester fabric cover. The device ranges in diameter from 21 mm to 33 mm to accommodate varying LAA anatomy and size. It will be implanted via a trans-septal approach by use of a catheter based delivery system to seal the ostium of the LAA. The implantation will be guided by fluoroscopy and TEE to verify proper positioning and stability. The dose of warfarin will be adjusted to maintain INR 2.0 - 3.0 for 45 days. If TEE data shows no additional flow in LAA, warfarin will be discontinued: Aspirin dose: 75 mg for all period of study; Clopidogrel dose: 75 mg for 6 months after procedure.</description>
