      Infants do not routinely receive acetaminophen for pain control after circumcision. This
      study will determine if acetaminophen is effective at controlling infant pain after
      circumcision using nerve block and oral dextrose. Infants will undergo the routine
      circumcision procedure , and half will be randomly selected to receive half acetaminophen
      immediately at the end of the procedure. Afterwards, infant's vitals signs (heart rate,
      respiratory rate, oxygen saturation), NIPS (the neonatal infant pain scale), and salivary
      cortisol levels will be checked in regular intervals up to 4 hours. The NIPS is a validated
      pain scoring system based on the appearance of the infant. A reduction in NIPS for those
      infants who receive acetaminophen versus nothing will be our primary outcome to determine if
      our study is significant.

      All subjects and controls will be nil per os (NPO) ONLY 30 minutes post procedure, not before
      the procedure. Due to the cortisol collection requirements, infants will remain NPO 30
      minutes post the procedure to ensure accurate levels, per manufacturer protocol. All infants
      will undergo a standardized circumcision using a modified dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB),
      dextrose+pacifier and a Gomco clamp. Before being removed from the circumstraint, half the
      infants will receive 15 mg/kg of acetaminophen via a syringe.

      Neonates will be monitored at time -15, time 0, 30, 60, 90, 120 and 240 minutes for heart
      rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), and pulse oximetry (Sa02), for pain using standard NIPS,
      and at -15 and 30 minutes for salivary cortisol level. Time -15 minutes will be defined as
      just prior to placement in restraint, assuming about a 15 interval to the full completion of
      the procedure and time 0 as the point just prior to removal from restraint and administration
      of acetaminophen. The NIPS and vital signs will be determined by Dr. Kimon Violaris, a
      neonatologist trained in obtaining NIPS and the entire procedure will be recorded.

      In addition to usual vital sign assessments, infants will be monitored for pain using NIPS-
      neonatal infant pain score, a validated infant pain scoring system based on 6 behavioral
      criteria: 1. facial expression 0 (relaxed), 1 (grimace) 2. cry 0 (none) , 1 (whimper) , 2
      (vigorous) 3. arms 0 (relaxed/restrained) ,1 (flexed/extended) 4. legs 0
      relaxed/restrained),1 (flexed/extended) 5. state of arousal 0 (sleeping),1 (awake).

      B. Salivary cortisol levels will be collected using a salivary swab kit provided by the
      manufacturer, Salimetrics.

      C. Vital signs of HR, RR, pulse ox will be measured.
