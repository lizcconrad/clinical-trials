  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study was to analyze negative affectivity (NA) and social inhibition (SI)
      inquired by DS14 score in type D personality (distressed personality) to the relation of
      autonomic regulation of heart function (HRV) and immune response (T lymphocyte) among obese
      patients within coronary heart disease group (CHD). As stress is the key psychological
      activator of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis) and therefore an important
      risk factor for diminished immune competency and prevalence of chronic conditions such as
      obesity, investigators chose exercise as the stress release intervention, especially as
      chronic stress may have a role in obesity, related to initiation or exacerbation of the
      condition. Abnormal regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is additionally
      associated with chronic inflammatory conditions. Proinflammatory T-lymphocytes are present in
      visceral adipose tissue and may contribute to local inflammatory cell activation before the
      appearance of macrophages, suggesting that these cells could play an important role in the
      initiation and perpetuation of adipose tissue inflammation.

      This study was performed at The Institute for Preventive Medicine in cooperation with The
      Institute of Microbiology and Immunology at the Medical Faculty of Ljubljana/University of
      Ljubljana in a clinical setting as an observational type. In the group of examinees the
      investigators chose only those obese without detectable complications of coronary heart
      disease while admitted. Obese patients with angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, valvular
      heart disease and congestive heart disease had been excluded from the research. Since
      personality is the major determinant of chronic stress, according to the investigators
      hypothesis, further division on two global traits Negative affectivity (NA) and Social
      inhibition (SI) structured by Denollet has been positioned in the study. A total of 30
      patients with CHD were divided in two groups. Participants who were obese with high DS14
      score matched obese controls with normal DS14 score. In all subjects the investigators also
      observed white blood cell counts with a detailed lymphocyte analysis using flow cytometry and
      C-reactive protein (CRP) as the indicator of inflammation. Besides body mass (BM), body mass
      index (BMI) systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), heart rate (HR), and heart rate
      variability (HRV) were measured before and after three months period, while all subjects had
      been already exercising 4 times weakly (moderate walking of 5km/h) for an hour. Additionally
      STAIX-1, SWLS and QOLLTI-P questionnaires had been used.

    <measure>Change from Baseline in DS14 Score at 3 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Each examines filled in DS14 scale to determine negative affectivity (NA), social inhibition (SI) and Type D personality for early identification of high-risk CHD patients (Denollet, 2005). Subjects rated their personality on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 _ false to 4 _true. The NA and SI scales can be scored as continuous variables (range, 0-28) to assess these personality traits in their own right. A cutoff of 10 on both scales is used to classify subjects as Type D (NA _10 and SI _10).</description>

    <measure>Change in STAIX-1 questionnaire score</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The STAIX-1 Form is an administered analysis of reported anxiety symptoms. The first subscale measures state anxiety, the second measures trait anxiety.
The range of scores is 20-80, the higher the score indicating greater anxiety.</description>

    <measure>Change in Peripheral Human Blood Leucocytes</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Peripheral human blood leucocytes were collected by the venipuncture procedure and collected into Vacutainers.Two-parameter analysis was performed to determine the proportion of T cells (CD3+), T helper cells (CD3+CD4+) and cytotoxic T cells (CD3+CD8+). Isotype controls (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA) and a control of viable cells (LIVE/DEAD kit, Molecular Probes, OR) were included. At least 2000 gated cells were analyzed for each test, and signals from two light scatters and four fluorescence parameters were analyzed with the Becton Dickinson Lysis II software.</description>
