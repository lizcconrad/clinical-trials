  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed study is to determine whether the addition of inhaled
      corticosteroids to treatment with oral corticosteroids and albuterol would reduce repeat
      emergency department (ED) visits among patients treated for acute exacerbations of asthma and
      COPD discharged from the emergency department to home. The investigators hypothesize that
      patients treated with inhaled corticosteroids in addition to oral corticosteroids and
      albuterol will have lower rates of 30-day return visits to the emergency department than
      those patients treated with oral corticosteroids and albuterol only.

    <description>Subjects' medical records will be reviewed for the 30 day period following ED discharge to determine if they return to the treating ED or another regional ED for treatment of an acute asthma/COPD exacerbation. Regional ED records will be queried by use of data maintained by HEALTHeLINK, our regional health information organization system. This will allow for more complete capture of ED return visits that could be obtained by looking only at a single ED.</description>
