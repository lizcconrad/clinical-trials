  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To explore the effective dose and safety of the effect of hydronidone and entecavir on
      hepatic fibrosis in chronic viral hepatitis B.

      Primary observation indexes:

      Hepatic fibrosis Ishak score after treatment decreases by the proportion not less than 1
      compared with that before treatment.

      Secondary observation indexes :

        1. Negative conversion ratio of HBV DNA after treatment (HBV DNA＜1×103copies/mL) and
           falling range.

        2. The falling proportion of Fibrocan Kpa value after treatment compared with that before
           treatment.

        3. The falling proportion that decreases not less than 1 level and progression-free
           fibrosis after treatment compared with that before treatment.

        4. The improvement of ALT of liver function.
