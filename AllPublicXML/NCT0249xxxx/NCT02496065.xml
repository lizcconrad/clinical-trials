  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgery is the primary treatment modality for many types of cancer and the extent of surgical
      resection is directly related to patient survival. However, it is often difficult for
      surgeons to distinguish normal from neoplastic tissue or to detect metastatic disease or
      tumor-infiltrated lymph nodes. In some sites, surgical precision is also required to avoid
      damage to critical normal tissues. The purpose of this exploratory study is to evaluate the
      intra-operative and ex vivo fluorescence of BLZ-100 in tumor samples from subjects with
      breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects diagnosed to have breast cancer for which surgical resection is clinically indicated
      will be enrolled in this study.

      Upon obtaining signed informed consent, subjects will enter a Screening Period for up to 14
      days to determine eligibility. Subjects meeting all of the inclusion and none of the
      exclusion criteria will be eligible to participate in the study.

      All subjects entered into the study will be required to arrive at the hospital (or Phase 1
      unit if applicable) for BLZ-100 administration at least 2 hours before their scheduled
      surgical procedure. Following administration of BLZ-100, subjects will be continuously
      monitored for safety and any allergic reaction occurrence for 30 minutes; thereafter,
      subjects will be evaluated for 7 days after drug administration. All subjects will be
      followed for at least 30 days following drug administration to monitor for SAEs.

      Tumor samples will be imaged in situ and ex vivo with the SIRIS imaging system or equivalent
      device, processed, and sent to a central laboratory to be evaluated for ex vivo fluorescence
      using the Odyssey® CLx imaging system.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female subject aged 18 years or older.

          2. Diagnosed solid tumor scheduled for surgical excision. Subjects with recurrent disease
             will be eligible only if the duration between last tumor surgery and scheduled new
             surgery is ≥3 months.

          3. Able to provide written informed consent.

          4. If of child-bearing potential, agree to continued use of two reliable methods of
             contraceptive from study entry (time of informed consent) through 30 days after
             BLZ-100 administration. Male subjects with vasectomy do not need to use a second form
             of contraceptive.

          5. Available for all study visits and able to comply with all study requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          2. Female who is lactating/breastfeeding.

          3. Female with a positive pregnancy test or who is planning to become pregnant during the
