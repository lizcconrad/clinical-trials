      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of conversion from cyclosporine to
      tacrolimus on the changes of cardiovascular risk profiles and serum metabolites in renal
      transplant recipients.

      During the past two decades, cyclosporine has proved to be a valuable immunosuppressive drug
      that has contributed to a significant reduction in the incidence of acute rejection after
      kidney transplantation. However, cyclosporine is known as a major factor causing
      cardiovascular death in kidney transplant recipients. Moreover, cyclosporine has an adverse
      effect on the lipid profile and fibrinolytic system and result in hypertension and
      cardiovascular disease. Immunosupressive mechanism of tacrolimus is identical that of
      cyclosporine but it is 100 times more potent T cell inhibitor than cyclosporine. In
      multicenter study of Europe and United states, tacrolimus showed low incidence of acute
      rejection and was known to effective in acute rejection resistant to other therapy.
      Tacrolimus has a lot of advantages compared to cyclosporine in terms of hypertensive and
      hyperlipidemic effects although evidences are lacking. One study demonstrated cardiovascular
      risk profile and renal function has been improved in kidney transplant patients after
      randomized conversion from cyclosporine to tacrolimus Previous study analyzing metabolites of
      tacrolimus and cyclosporine revealed that differences were observed in the metabolite level
      of hypoxanthine, lactate, succinate, and taurine between two immunosupressants. The objective
      of this study is to evaluate changes in cardiovascular risk profiles and metabolite patterns
      after conversion from cyclosporine to tacrolimus in kidney transplant recipients.
