  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to characterize measures of cardiac performance and
      neuromuscular physiology in FA patients using novel techniques, including echocardiography
      and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), metabolic exercise testing, and neurophysiological
      outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Friedreich's ataxia (FA) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by a mutation in the
      frataxin gene (FXN). Although rare, FA is the most common form of hereditary ataxia,
      affecting 1 in every 50,000 people in the United States. Currently, palliative therapies are
      the only treatment for FA patients. However, current gene therapy efforts in other
      neuromuscular diseases have positioned the investigator's research program to extend these
      discoveries and techniques to FA. As new therapies become available for clinical application,
      it is crucial to identify non-invasive outcomes measures of cardiac and neuromuscular
      performance with adequate sensitivity to detect the impact of treatments.
