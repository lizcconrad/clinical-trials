  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Albiglutide, a novel analogue of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), has been developed and
      approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The primary objective of this study
      is to assess if a single dose of albiglutide can affect cholecystokinin-induced gallbladder
      emptying. To make this assessment, each study participant will receive a dose of albiglutide
      and a dose of placebo followed by cholecystokinin (CCK) infusion and ultrasound measurement
      of the gallbladder.

      The study will be comprised of two periods and 20 subjects. The screening visit will occur
      within 42 days of the start of Treatment Period 1. The Treatment Periods will be separated by
      a washout period of a minimum of 42 days. Subjects will return for a follow-up visit after 28
      days following the last dose of albiglutide or placebo. The total duration of a subject's
      participation from Screening to Follow-up will be approximately 17.5 weeks.

      This study is a post marketing commitment to the United States Food and Drug Administration
      (USFDA).

    <time_frame>Day 4 in each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>Gallbladder ejection fraction (EF) is defined as the reduction in gallbladder volume at any time point from Baseline divided by baseline gallbladder volume and multiplied by 100. Baseline gallbladder volume is the average of the 3 gallbladder volume measurements prior to CCK infusion on Day 4, for each treatment period. Gallbladder ultrasonography was done at Day 1 (-15, -10, and -5 minutes [min] relative to start of albiglutide/placebo injection) and Day 4 ([prior to CCK infusion] -15, -10, -5 min, followed by [during CCK infusion] every 5 min between 0 and 50 min, then [after CCK infusion] at 60, 70, and 80 min, relative to the start of CCK infusion).

    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this definition, associated with liver injury and impaired liver function defined as alanine aminotransferase &gt;=3 x upper limit of normal (ULN), and total bilirubin &gt;=2 x ULN or international normalised ratio &gt;1.5.

        <title>Maximum Absolute Value of Gallbladder Ejection Fraction (Emax GEF) During Cholecystokinin (CCK) Infusion, as a Measure of Maximum Effect</title>
        <description>Gallbladder ejection fraction (EF) is defined as the reduction in gallbladder volume at any time point from Baseline divided by baseline gallbladder volume and multiplied by 100. Baseline gallbladder volume is the average of the 3 gallbladder volume measurements prior to CCK infusion on Day 4, for each treatment period. Gallbladder ultrasonography was done at Day 1 (-15, -10, and -5 minutes [min] relative to start of albiglutide/placebo injection) and Day 4 ([prior to CCK infusion] -15, -10, -5 min, followed by [during CCK infusion] every 5 min between 0 and 50 min, then [after CCK infusion] at 60, 70, and 80 min, relative to the start of CCK infusion). Adjusted mean and its standard error have been presented.</description>

        <title>Maximum Change From Baseline in Main Pancreatic Duct Diameter During CCK Infusion</title>
        <description>Pancreatic duct ultrasonography was done at Day 1 (-15, -10, and -5 minutes [min] relative to start of albiglutide/placebo injection) and Day 4 ([prior to CCK infusion] -15, -10, -5 min, followed by [during CCK infusion] every 5 min between 0 and 50 min, then [after CCK infusion] at 60, 70, and 80 min, relative to the start of CCK infusion). Baseline is the average of the three diameter assessments at -15, -10, and -5 minutes relative to start of CCK infusion on Day 4. Change from Baseline was calculated as the value at the indicated time point minus the Baseline value. Adjusted mean and its standard error are presented. Baseline was calculated as the value at the indicated time point minus the Baseline value. Only those participants available at the indicated time points were analyzed.</description>

          <description>Single 12-lead ECG was obtained in a semi-supine position after 5 minutes of rest at each indicated time point using an ECG machine that automatically calculated the heart rate and measured the PR, QRS, QT, and QT corrected by Fridericia's formula (QTcF) intervals. Change from Baseline was calculated as value at indicated time point minus Baseline value.</description>

        <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this definition, associated with liver injury and impaired liver function defined as alanine aminotransferase &gt;=3 x upper limit of normal (ULN), and total bilirubin &gt;=2 x ULN or international normalised ratio &gt;1.5. AEs were classified as potentially drug-related, based on the investigator's judgement. Refer to the general AE/SAE module for a list of AEs and SAEs.</description>
