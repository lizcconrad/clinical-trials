  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To further increase the access of evidence based psychotherapies for Veterans with
      Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, we propose to offer training and intensive consultation to
      community-based providers in Cognitive Processing Therapy for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.
      However, we believe that many clinicians may not implement Cognitive Processing Therapy or
      take advantage of consultation after initial training. For this reason, we propose to examine
      the effectiveness of an enhanced training method, which would add Motivational Interviewing
      to the standard Cognitive Processing Therapy training. Motivational Interviewing is a form of
      collaborative discussion for strengthening motivation and commitment to change. We
      hypothesize that augmenting the standard Cognitive Processing Therapy training with these
      techniques will reduce providers' reluctance to fully implement the interventions.
