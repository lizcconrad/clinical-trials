      The objective of this study is to compare scalpel vs. diathermy in abdominal wall incision in
      pregnant patients undergoing repeat elective cesarean delivery.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is hypothesized that wall incisions made by diathermy compared to scalpel during repeat
      cesarean delivery will have less incision time, as well as less blood loss. A second
      hypothesis is that the use of diathermy, compared with scalpel will not increase in
      post-operative pain.

        1. This is a randomized prospective study in women undergoing elective repeat cesarean
           delivery at Medical Center Hospital in Odessa Texas.

        2. Women undergoing cesarean delivery will be randomized into two groups: One group will
           undergo diathermy to incise the entire abdominal wall ,which includes skin, subcutaneous
           tissue, rectus muscle until the peritoneal cavity is visible. On the other group scalpel
           will be used to achieve the same aim.

        3. A standardized abdominal wall incision will be made with either diathermy in cut mode or
           scalpel. Diathermy will be set in a cut mode with standard setting as per surgeons
           preference. All patients in the study will get standard skin incision in terms of length
           and depth which will be marked by a ruler.

        4. Incision time ( measured in minutes and seconds with stop watch) and amount of bleeding
           will be measured. Blood loss will be calculated by weighing (in grams) the &quot;used&quot; lap
           sponges and comparing this to the weight (in grams0 of &quot;fresh&quot; lap sponges.

        5. Post-operative pain will be measured by a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Measurements will
           be taken at 6:00 to 7:00 AM from post -op day 1 until hospital discharge.
