    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether combining of radiofrequency ablation (RFA)
      and cytokine-induced killer cells (CIK) transfusion can prolong survival of patients with
      cervical cancer.

      The primary objective is to evaluate whether RFA followed by CIK transfusion can prolong
      survival of patients with cervical cancer.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  They were systematic reviews based on randomized controlled trials (rcts). They were
             phase II rcts comparing chemotherapy with other systemic therapy agents or with no
             further treatment for recurrent, metastatic, or persistent cervical cancer.

        they reported at least one of these outcomes: complete or partial response rate, overall or
        progression-free survival rate, adverse effects, or healthrelated quality of life (rcts
        reporting on heterogeneous populations—for example, women at a range of disease stages—were
        included if results were given separately for patients with recurrent, metastatic, or
        persistent cervical cancer).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  studies evaluating the role of radiotherapy administered with chemotherapy, or second-
             or subsequent-line therapy options.
