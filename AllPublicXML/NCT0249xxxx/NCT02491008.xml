  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thyroid hormone is a key regulatory hormone for a range of physiological systems, including
      the skeleton. Previous studies have suggested that subclinical thyroid dysfunction (SCTD) may
      be associated with deleterious skeletal effects. However, controversy persists on the
      clinical relevance of SCTD as well as on optimal thresholds for treatment. Available data
      have substantial limitations: 1) limited prospective data are available to assess the
      associations between SCTD and non-cardiovascular outcomes, such as fractures 2) lack of data
      from large RCTs to investigate the pathophysiological mechanisms of associations between
      thyroid hormone and bone loss. The aim of the study is to examine the relationship between
      subclinical hypothyroidism and thyroid hormone replacement in regard to skeletal fragility,
      bone mineral density (BMD), bone loss and metabolism, and the risk of fractures in elderly
      participants. The listed parameters will be assessed by dual energy X ray absorptiometry
      (DXA) and novel bone imaging techniques at baseline, at 1 year of follow-up. The study will
      be nested in the TRUST trial (clinicaltrials.gov ID: NCT01660126), and will make use of its
      study infrastructure to determine bone biomarkers from biospecimens at baseline, and at 1
      year of follow-up from 145 Swiss participants with persistent subclinical hypothyroidism
      randomized to either thyroxine or placebo in Bern and Lausanne.

      Background

      Thyroid hormone is a key regulatory hormone for other physiological systems, including the
      skeleton. Previous studies have suggested that SCTD may be associated with deleterious
      skeletal effects. However, controversy persists on the clinical relevance of SCTD as well as
      on optimal thresholds for treatment. Available data have substantial limitations: 1) limited
      prospective data are available to assess the associations between SCTD and non-cardiovascular
      outcomes, such as fractures 2) lack of data from large RCTs to investigate the
      pathophysiological mechanisms of associations.

      Objective

      To examine, within a large RCT of elderly participants with subclinical hypothyroidism (the
      TRUST trial), the impact of thyroxine therapy on the association between SCTD and skeletal
      fragility, bone mineral density (BMD), bone loss and metabolism, and the risk of fractures.

      Methods

      The existing trial infrastructure (TRUST thyroid trial-Euresearch FP7,clinicaltrials.gov ID:
      NCT01660126) will be utilized to collect biospecimens from the 145 Swiss participants with
      persistent subclinical hypothyroidism randomized to either thyroxine or placebo in Bern and
      in Lausanne. The assessment is performed by means of dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA)
      and peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pqCT) as a novel bone imaging technique at
      baseline, and at 1 year of follow-up. In parallel, bone turnover markers in the blood plasma
      will be measured at baseline and at 1 year of follow-up.

    <description>The intervention will start with Levothyroxine 50 mcg daily (reduced to 25 mcg in subjects &lt;50 kg of body weight or if known coronary heart disease - previous myocardial infarction or symptoms of angina pectoris) vs. matching placebo; at 3 months, if the serum TSH level is &lt;0.4 mU/L, dose will be reduced by 25 mcg; TSH &gt;=0.4 and &lt;4.6 mU/L, no change to dose; TSH &gt;=4.6 mU/L, additional 25 mcg. The process will be repeated at 12 months, then annually; mock titration will be performed in the placebo group. The maximum possible dose of Levothyroxine which will be prescribed is 150 mcg (after 4 increments of 25 mcg at 3 months, 1, 2, 3 years; from the starting dose of 50 mcg).</description>
