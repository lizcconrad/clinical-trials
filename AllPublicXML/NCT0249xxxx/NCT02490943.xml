  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peginterferon-beta-1a (PEG) is an approved treatment for relapsing forms of MS that may cause
      injection related erythema. This is a randomized controlled cross-over trial of superficial
      hot and cold modalities to reduce injection site erythema caused by PEG.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The most common adverse event associated with this subcutaneously (SC) injected drug is
      injection site reaction (ISR) including redness and pain.Theoretically, both heat and cold
      modalities may improve interferon injection tolerance. Warm compress before injection may
      increase local blood flow and increase rapid systemic absorption, while cold compress
      afterward may reduce the erythema, edema and pain that often follow SC injections. A trial
      comparing heat-before and cold-after therapy is warranted to determine the relative
      effectiveness of these modalities.

      Intervention:

      Product: Reusable cold and warm compress.

      Patients will receive written instructions for microwave heating and freezer cooling of the
      compress.

      Warm compress: Pre-heating in microwave oven, per instructions. Apply warm compress for 5
      minutes prior to injection. The initial compress temperature will be about 43 degrees Celsius
      (range 40-46 degrees Celsius) and slowly decline during application. Administer drug soon
      after removal.

      Cold compress: Cooling in a freezer as per instructions. Soon after drug injection, apply
      cold compress for 10 minutes. The initial compress temperature will range 15-18 degrees
      Celsius.

        -  Timers will be utilized to mark 5-minute and 10-minute treatment intervals

        -  Participants will be encouraged to maintain constant practices with regards to
           non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use during the study

      Study Objectives:

        1. To assess and compare the impact on erythema of two thermal treatments: warm compress
           prior to PEG injection and cold compress following PEG injection

        2. To assess the natural history of PEG-erythema over time. This will be accomplished with
           18 weeks of observation in the control group.

    <description>This is a 5 point visual assessment scale. Participants will be asked to observe the change in skin color at the site of injection. They will rate the intensity of skin color change (erythema) using the scale below. These assessments will be recorded at the following time points: 24 hours, 7 days, and 14 days</description>
