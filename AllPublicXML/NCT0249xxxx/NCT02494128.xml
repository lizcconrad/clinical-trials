  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All parents in Sweden are offered group based parental support within Child Health Service
      (CHS) but only 40% participate. Nurses feel insecure in their group leadership and express a
      need for education in group leadership and group dynamics. Most CHC nurses do not have formal
      education or training in group leadership and the aim of this study was to evaluate a group
      based education program in group leadership for Child Health Care (CHC) nurses.

      The study follows the guidelines for complex interventions (MRC) and was set up as a
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluated with questionnaires before and after the
      intervention. Focus group interviews 6 months after the intervention will be performed with
      the CHC nurses participating in intervention group. 3 groups with 25 CHC nurses in each group
      are to participate in a three day education in group leadership and group processes. The
      education aims to provide knowledge and awareness about group dynamics, group processes and
      group leadership and also aims towards increased self-awareness in the role as group leader.

    <measure>Change in experience of group leadership</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks before and 6 months after the education</time_frame>
    <description>Change in experience of group leadership will be measured by a previously used questionnaire (Wallby, T (2008) parental support un Sweden today - What, when and how. Swedish National Institute of Public Health. (Föräldrastöd i Sverige idag - Vad när hur?) and Lefevre et al, 2013. Managing parental groups during early childhood: New challenges faced by Swedish child health nurses. Journal of child health care).The questionnaire consists of 38 questions concerning structure, content and extent of parental groups as well as questions about group leadership and background characteristics. Analysis will be performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) and will be presented in a descriptive way</description>

    <time_frame>After completed intervention, intervention has an expected average duration of 12 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>A course evaluation form previously used in educations with primary health care nurses will be completed after the intervention is completed, before leaving site. It consists of seven questions about the content and relevance of the course.Four questions were arranged with a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 &quot;poor&quot; to 5 &quot;excellent&quot;, and three questions were open-ended given the possibility to respond in free text.The numeric questions will be summarised and presented descriptive and the answers in text will be analysed by content analysis in a manifest way.</description>
