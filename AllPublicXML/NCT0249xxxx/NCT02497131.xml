  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter, clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of Brentuximab Vedotin (BV) as a single agent in relapsed/refractory CD30+ PTCL
      patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BV will be administered as a single IV infusion on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle. Measures of
      anti-cancer activity will be assessed using the revised response criteria for malignant
      lymphoma (Cheson et al. 2007).

      Computed tomography (CT) scans (chest, neck, abdomen, and pelvis) and PET scan will be
      performed at baseline and Cycles 3, 8, 12, and 16. Patients will have an End of Treatment
      (EOT) assessment 30 ± 7 days after receiving their final dose of study drug. Patients with at
      least stable disease will enter short follow up phase till month 24 with radiology assessment
      every 6 months and visit every 12 weeks. After month 24 and for all patients with progressive
      disease, long-term follow-up assessments (including survival, disease status and next therapy
      information) will be performed every 12 weeks until either patient death or study closure,
      whichever occurs first.
