    <textblock>
      Intraoperative tumor localization and resection can be enhanced using intraoperative
      fluorescence imaging and radiodetection. Girentuximab specifically recognizes carbonic
      anhydrase IX expressed on &gt; 95% of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Therefore
      Indium-111-DOTA-girentuximab-IRDye800CW is a perfect dual-labeled antibody for dual-modality
      image-guided surgery in RCC.

      The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility and safety of intraoperative dual-modality
      imaging with Indium-111-DOTA-girentuximab-IRDye800CW in renal cell carcinoma patients.

    <textblock>
      In oncologic surgery complete tumor resection is important for treatment outcome and patient
      survival. Intraoperative tumor localization and resection can be enhanced using
      intraoperative imaging techniques (e.g. targeted radioguided or fluorescence guided surgery).
      A powerful synergy can be achieved by combining radiotracers (e.g. Indium-111) and optical
      tracers (e.g. IRDye 800CW) conjugated to an antibody against a tumor-associated antigen.
      Girentuximab specifically recognizes carbonic anhydrase IX expressed on &gt; 95% of renal cell
      carcinoma (RCC). Therefore Indium-111-DOTA-girentuximab-IRDye800CW is a perfect dual-labeled
      antibody for dual-modality image-guided surgery in RCC. The concept has been shown in
      preclinical studies with mice and the investigators will translate this to the clinic.

      Eligible patients with renal cell carcinoma scheduled for (partial) nephrectomy will receive
      dual-labeled girentuximab 7 days before surgery. At day 4 or 5 a SPECT/CT of the abdomen will
      be obtained. Surgery at day 7 will be extended with the use of a near-infrared fluorescence
      camera and a gamma probe.

      The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility and safety of intraoperative dual-modality
      imaging with Indium-111-DOTA-girentuximab-IRDye800CW in renal cell carcinoma.
