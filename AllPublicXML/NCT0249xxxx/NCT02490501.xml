  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open, randomized, rehabilitation-controlled study in subjects with complete
      Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury, where the active treatment consists of a surgical implantation
      of SC0806 (a biodegradable device with heparin-activated FGF1 and nerve implants).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a single dose study in up to 3 sequences in subjects with complete Traumatic
      Spinal Cord Injury. In each sequence, 6 subjects will be randomized to a surgical procedure
      where SC0806 will be implanted into the spinal cord and receive specific walking training,
      and 3 subjects will be randomized to specific walking training only. Interim analyses of
      safety parameters will be performed. If a positive effect and no major safety concerns have
      been demonstrated after completion of all sequences, the control subjects will be given the
      opportunity to receive treatment with SC0806 after completion of their rehabilitation
      periods.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury.

          2. Male or female subjects aged between 18 and 65 years.

          3. BMI ≤35, body weight ≤125 kg and height ≤ 195 cm at Screening.

          4. Complete SCI (ASIA Impairment Scale level A, no voluntary bladder function, negative
             motor and sensory evoked potentials).

          5. A single spinal cord lesion injury at the neurologic level between T2-T11.

          6. A Baseline MRI that indicates a pathology consistent with a traumatic SCI

          7. Minimum of 4 months and maximum 10 years post injury with no evidence of neurological
             improvement prior to implantation surgery unless there is a complete anatomical
             cut-off of the spinal cord.

          8. Females must not be lactating or pregnant at Screening and Baseline (as documented by
             pregnancy tests).

          9. All females that are postmenopausal (amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive months,
             in the appropriate age group, and without other known or suspected cause) or have been
             sterilized surgically (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation, total hysterectomy, or
             bilateral oophorectomy, all with surgery at least 1 month before dosing).

         10. Females of childbearing potential must not have had unprotected sexual intercourse
             within 30 days before study entry and must agree to use a highly effective method of
             contraception (e.g., total abstinence, an intrauterine device, a double-barrier method
             [such as condom plus diaphragm with spermicide], a contraceptive implant, an oral
             contraceptive, or have a vasectomized partner with confirmed azoospermia) throughout
             the entire study period. If currently abstinent, the subject must agree to use an
             effective method as described above if she becomes sexually active during the study
             period. Females who are using hormonal contraceptives must have been on a stable dose
             of the same hormonal contraceptive product for at least 4 weeks before dosing and must
             continue to use the same contraceptive during the study.

         11. Written informed consent obtained prior to any study specific procedures.

         12. Eligible for surgery and specific walking training as judged by the investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Other life-threatening injury.

          2. Serious co-existing medical condition or mental disorder.

          3. Results from neurophysiological examination preoperatively are inconsistent with a
             spinal cord injury of one thoracic segment or less.

          4. Current or prior (within the past 8 weeks or within 5 half-lives of use of such a
             medication prior to screening) participation in any other investigational medication
             or device trial.

          5. Known hypersensitivity to FGF1 or heparin.

          6. Subjects unable to tolerate or undergo MRI scanning, including subjects with
             claustrophobia unless sedation can be used, cardiac pacemaker/defibrillator,
             ferromagnetic metal implants e.g., in skull, cardiac devices, other than those
             approved as safe for use in MR scanners.

          7. Ongoing drug or alcohol abuse or dependence.

          8. Positive serology for Hepatitis B or C, or Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) at
             Screening.

          9. Positive test for Methicillin-resistent Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) at screening.

         10. Any disease, concomitant injury, condition or treatment that interferes with the
             specific walking training, the performance or interpretation of the neurological
             examination.

         11. Has a condition or has received medical treatment that, in the judgment of the
             investigator, precludes successful participation in the study.

         12. Previous radiation treatment (e.g. cancer treatment) in the region of the spinal cord
             injury.
