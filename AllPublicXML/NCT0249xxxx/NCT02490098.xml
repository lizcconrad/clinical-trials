  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current intensive insulin therapy in T1D involves prandial insulin boluses depending on the
      carbohydrate content of each ingested meal. Carbohydrate content of ingested meals is the
      main determinant of post-meal glucose excursion. Therefore, accurate carbohydrate counting is
      a critical aspect of managing postprandial blood glucose levels in type 1 diabetes in order
      to avoid too much or too little insulin resulting in hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia,
      respectively. Precision of carbohydrate counting is associated with better glycemic control.
      However, accurate carbohydrate counting is a challenging task for many patients with type 1
      diabetes. Recent developments of continuous glucose sensors and insulin infusion pumps have
      motivated the research toward &quot;closed-loop'' strategies to regulate glucose levels in
      patients with type 1 diabetes. In a closed-loop strategy, the pump insulin infusion rate is
      altered based on a computer generated recommendation that rely on continuous glucose sensor
      readings. A dual-hormone closed-loop strategy has also been recently proposed to regulate
      glucose levels. In a dual-hormone strategy, subcutaneous insulin delivery is accompanied by
      subcutaneous glucagon infusion. Postprandial meal glucose control with closed-loop strategy
      still needs some improvements. The objective of this study is to test in outpatient
      unrestricted settings whether, in the context of closed-loop strategy, conventional meal
      carbohydrate counting could be reduced to a simplified qualitative meal size estimation
      without a significant degradation in overall glycemic control in children and adult patients
      with type 1 diabetes. The investigators hypothesize that 1) dual-hormone closed-loop strategy
      with qualitative meal size estimation is equivalent to dual-hormone closed-loop strategy with
      CHO counting in terms of mean glucose; 2) single-hormone closed-loop strategy with
      qualitative meal size estimation is equivalent to single-hormone closed-loop strategy with
      CHO counting in terms of mean glucose;

    <description>Variable subcutaneous insulin infusion rates will be used to regulate postprandial glucose levels. Patient's usual fast acting insulin analog (Lispro, Aspart or Glulisine) will be infused using a subcutaneous infusion pump (MiniMed® Paradigm® Veo™, Medtronic). Every 10 minutes, the glucose levels as measured by the sensor (Enlite sensor®, Medtronic) will be transferred automatically to the Smartphone platform, that harbors the algorithm, that will calculate the recommended doses and will send it wirelessly to the infusion pump. Each subject insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio will be used to calculate the insulin bolus to be given.</description>

For this strategy, meal size will be defined as: snack as any meal less than 30g, regular meal as any meal between 30g and 60g CHO, large meal as any meal between 60g and 90g CHO, very large meal for anything above 90g CHO. The meal size assessment will be done by the patient.</description>
