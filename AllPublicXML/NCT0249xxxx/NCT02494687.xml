  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastroparesis is a digestive disorder in which motility of the stomach is either slowed or
      absent. The gastroparesis prevents normal digestion from occurring. The purpose of this study
      is to provide oral Domperidone offered under the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      expanded access program, to patients that, based on the treating doctor's assessment, could
      benefit from , a prokinetic effect for the relief of refractory gastroesophageal reflux
      disease with upper gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, gastroparesis, and chronic constipation.

      At the discretion of the Investigator, 10-30 mg of oral domperidone is administered QID (four
      times a day). The Investigator will be starting patients on 10 mg four times a day for 2
      weeks, then increase to 20 mg four times a day for 2 weeks. The participant will be evaluated
      at each time point. If the participant still is not having relief of symptoms the
      investigator may increase their dose to 30mg four times a day.

          3. Symptoms or manifestations secondary to GERD (e.g., persistent esophagitis, heartburn,
             upper airway signs or symptoms or respiratory symptoms), gastrointestinal motility
             disorders such as nausea, vomiting, severe dyspepsia or severe chronic constipation
             refractory to standard therapy.

          4. Patients must have a comprehensive evaluation (physical exam and also may include EGD,
             gastric emptying study, as clinically necessary) to eliminate other causes of their
             symptoms.

          5. Patient has signed informed consent for the administration of domperidone that informs
             the patient of potential adverse events including:

               -  increased prolactin levels

               -  extrapyramidal side-effects

               -  breast changes

               -  cardiac arrhythmias including QT prolongation and death

        Exclusion Criteria:

        History of, or current, arrhythmias including ventricular tachycardia, ventricular
        fibrillation and Torsade des Pointes. Patients with minor forms of ectopy (PACs) are not
        necessarily excluded.

          1. Clinically significant bradycardia, sinus node dysfunction, or heart block. Prolonged
             QTc (QTc&gt; 450 milliseconds for males, QTc&gt;470 milliseconds for females).

          2. Clinically significant electrolyte disorders.

          3. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage or obstruction

          4. Presence of a prolactinoma (prolactin-releasing pituitary tumor).

          5. Pregnant or breast feeding female

          6. Known allergy to domperidone
