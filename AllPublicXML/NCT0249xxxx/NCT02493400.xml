      To investigate the effect of exercise or PAP prescription 3 months after completion of the
      study &quot;Should elderly patients with atrial fibrillation be offered physiotherapist group
      exercise or can physical activity on prescription (PAP) be used as an alternative?&quot; regarding
      level of physical fitness, physical activity, heart rate and health related quality of life
      (HR-QoL). Also if any of the investigated variables can predict the possible change in
      physical fitness.

      Patients who have completed study will be offered a follow-up after 3 months regarding
      physical fitness, physical activity, heart rate and HR-QoL. Physical fitness will be measured
      by a symptom limited bicycle test and a muscle endurance test. Physical activity will be
      measured by accelerometer and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and a
      physical activity diary, HR-QoL will be measured by short form (SF-36).
