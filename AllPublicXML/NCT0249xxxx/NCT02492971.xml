  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Appropriate assistive devices are important factors for the activity participation of the
      disabled. These devices should be prescribed by the specialists based on their functional
      needs. However, most individuals in need of assistive devices locate in the household,
      school, or nursing institute, in which the professional interventions are not always
      available on demand. Consequently most assistive devices are used without thorough
      evaluation, therefore do not necessarily meet the exact needs of the individual. Hence an
      easy-to-access and easy-to-use assistive technology device indexing system based on the
      functional needs of the subjects is necessary. The goals of this two-year study are twofold:
      assistive technology indexing system application(APP) development and promotion. First, the
      multidisciplinary research team, composed of specialists from assistive technology,
      rehabilitation, computer science, and special education fields, is going to integrate and
      refine the current resources and develop an assistive technology indexing system App based on
      the functional needs of the disabled. Second, in cooperation with the disabled community and
      special schools, the team is going to promote the use of the App and evaluate its usability
      via System Usability Scale. This App will be beneficial to the individuals in need of
      assistive device application. It can also be used as an assistive device manual for the
      specialists. The App will guide the individuals step by step to the proper assistive devices
      based on their functional capacities. The complete system will include details of each
      assistive device and link up with the related service resources. With its registering
      function, the statistics collected via user clicks can serve as references for further design
      adjustments and assistive device related policy modifications. All together this App can
      provide comprehensive services to the disabled in need of assistive devices.
