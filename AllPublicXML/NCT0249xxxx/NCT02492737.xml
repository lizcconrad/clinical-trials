  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase I, multicenter study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics,
      pharmacodynamics and clinical activity of AG-881 in advanced hematologic malignancies that
      harbor an IDH1 and/or IDH2 mutation
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first portion of the study is a dose escalation phase where cohorts of patients will
      receive ascending oral doses of AG-881 to determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the
      recommended Phase II dose. The second portion of the study is a dose expansion phase where
      patients will receive AG-881 to further evaluate the safety, tolerability, and clinical
      activity of the recommended Phase II dose. Anticipated time on study treatment is until
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs or the patient is removed at the
      discretion of the investigator.

        Patients must have an advanced hematologic malignancy with an IDH1 and/or IDH2 mutation

        Patient must be able to understand and willing to sign an informed consent

        Patients must have ECOG PS of 0 to 2

        Patients must have adequate hepatic function as evidenced by serum total bilirubin ≤1.5
        upper limit of normal (ULN), unless considered due to Gilbert's disease or leukemic
        involvement

        Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase
        (ALP) ≤3.0 × ULN, unless considered due to involvement by the neoplasm under consideration
        for treatment

        Patients must have adequate renal function as evidenced by a serum creatinine ≤2.0 × ULN or
