  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Poor glycemic control in critically ill patients can increase their mortality, while safe and
      efficient glucose control is laborious and time-consuming. The Space GlucoseControl which is
      installed with eMPC(enhanced Model Predictive Control) can get the blood glucose target range
      safely and effectively through regulating insulin dose rate. This study is a random
      controlled trial involving the patients with mechanical ventilation in intensive care unit in
      order to evaluate the difference of safety and efficacy of blood glucose control between SGC
      directed and conventional treatment. At last, the trial results can determine whether the
      Space GlucoseControl can control blood glucose safely and effectively in the patients with
      mechanical ventilation in intensive care units.

      Design: The study was conducted as a single-centre, open randomized controlled, parallel
      trial.

      Study population: Adult medical ICU patients who were mechanically ventilated and assumed to
      require at least 3 days of intensive care were recruited. Patients fulfilling the inclusion
      criterion of glucose≥9.0 mM were randomly assigned using serially numbered to either the
      intervention group (BG control by SGC) or the control group (conventional empiric BG
      management). The both group aim to establish the BG levels 5.8-8.9mM.

      Study protocol: BG measurements were performed using glucometer to test the fingertip
      capillary blood sample for the BG levels. As for patients with shock or required vasopressor,
      arterial BG was sampled to measure through the glucometer. Insulin [40 IU of Actrapid HM
      (Wanbang Biopharmaceuticals, Jiangsu province, China)/40ml of 0.9% sodium chloride] was
      infused intravenously applying the standard perfusor of the ICU (Perfusor®Space, B. Braun
      Melsungen AG, Melsungen, Germany). All trial-related activities were carried out until the
      end of the patient's ICU stay, or for a period of 72 hours. Meanwhile, enteral and parenteral
      nutrition was administrated to patients according to their condition.

      Statistical analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis. The percentage of values
      in the target range (5.8-8.9mM) was defined as primary end point for the assessment of
      glucose control. Data are reported as mean±SD values if not otherwise indicated. Data
      analysis was performed using SPSS19.0.
