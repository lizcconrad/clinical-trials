      Estrogen receptor,ERa36, predominantly localizes on the plasma membrane and in the cytoplasm
      and mediates a membrane-initiated &quot;nongenomic&quot; signaling pathway. Membrane-initiated estrogen
      signaling has been linked to rapid responses to estrogen and generally activates signaling
      pathways like the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinases
      (MAPK/ERK), phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase, and protein kinase C pathways. Preclinical study
      demonstrated that ERa36 was expressed in tumor cells and might be the driving force of breast
      cancer cell proliferation. 40% of breast cancer tumors which used to be considered as ER
      negative also express ERa36. In the former study the investigators found that 40% of
      ERa66-positive breast cancer patients express high levels of ERa36 in their tumors, and this
      subset of patients are less likely to benefit from tamoxifen treatment compared with those
      with ERa66-positive/ERa36-negative tumors.

      Icaritin is a newly discovered small molecule with selective ERa36 modulating capability and
      the potential as a very promising new drug to treat advanced breast cancer and hepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC) by targeting this nongenomic pathway. Studies showed that it can inhibit the
      growth of cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. The investigators have completed the
      preclinical pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic (PK&amp;PD) and toxicity studies in animals and now
      move on to test it in a phase Ib clinical trial.
