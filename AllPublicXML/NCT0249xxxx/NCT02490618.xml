    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of the usage of a probiobitc lozenge in
      patients with residual bleeding pockets of ≥ 5mm 3 months following scaling and rootplaning.
      Simultaneously the additional benefit of subgingival application of probiotics via oil drops
      will be investigated.

      The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of the usage of a probiobitc lozenge in
      patients with residual bleeding pockets of ≥ 5mm following scaling and rootplaning.
      Simultaneously the additional benefit of subgingival application of probiotics via oil drops
      will be investigated.

      Recruitment: This study will be a single centre (Department of Oral Health Sciences,
      University Hospitals Leuven), double blind, randomized, placebo controlled clinical trial
      with within each patient a split mouth design. The randomization (by means of a computer
      program) and double blind design are thought to minimize the bias of the investigator and
      patients.

      Selection of the study population: Adults, who consult at the department of Periodontology at
      the University Hospital Leuven, and who fit the inclusion criteria will be asked to
      participate in this study.
