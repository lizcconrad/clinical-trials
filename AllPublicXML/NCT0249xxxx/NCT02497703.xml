    <textblock>
      An exoskeleton robotic knee system for stroke rehabilitation is proposed in this study. This
      robotic system has been developed to facilitate functional motor recovery by practices
      walking with a one joint motor powered exoskeleton to reduce the muscle weakness in the shank
      and reduce the hyperextension in the knee joint. The robotic knee system is able to sense the
      gait pattern from the stroke patients and assist the walking and control the knee angle. The
      clinical trial will use repeated measurements to evaluate the effectiveness of the robotic
      knee system in gait rehabilitation post stroke.

    <description>Patients can be rated on the following categories:
0: Patient cannot walk, or needs help from 2 or more persons
Patients needs firm continuous support from 1 person who helps carrying weight and with balance
Patient needs continuous or intermittent support of one person to help with balance and coordination.
Patient requires verbal supervision or stand-by help from one person without physical contact
Patient can walk independently on level ground, but requires help on stairs, slopes or uneven surfaces
Patient can walk independently anywhere</description>

    <measure>Timed 10-meter Walk Test</measure>
    <time_frame>3-month followup</time_frame>
    <description>The individual is instructed to walk a set distance (10 meters). Time is measured while the individual walks the set distance (often the individual is given space to accelerate to his/her preferred walking speed (this distance is not included when determining speed). The distance covered is divided by the time it took the individual to walk that distance.</description>

          1. Ischemic or hemorrphagic stroke with drop foot problem.

          2. Sufficient cognition to follow simple instructions and to understand the content and
             purpose of the study. (Mini-Mental State Examination &gt; 20)

          3. Capable of standing and walking independently for an extended period of time.
             (Functional Ambulation Category &gt; 3, Berg Balance Scale &gt; 40)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any medical or psychological dysfunctions that would affect their ability to comply
             with test study protocol, such as lower back pain, neuralgia, rotational vertigo,
             muscloskeletal disorders, injuries, and pregnancy.

          2. Any severe contractures in hip, knee, or ankle joint that would preclude passive range
             of motion in the lower extremity.

          3. Participation in any therapeutic treatment (&quot;outside therapy&quot;) performed with the
             lower extremity during the planned study, including the baseline and the followup.
