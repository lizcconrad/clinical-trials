    <textblock>
      In order to determine norm values for skeleton muscle disassembly due to physical exertion in
      healthy and trained population, and developing a prediction test for approval for
      rhabdomyolysis injuries to return to duty, 50 healthy subjects will undergo a series of
      different physical tests.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      50 healthy civilians volunteers will be recruited for this study. Each subject will undergo
      the physical tests: anthropometric measurements, wingate test, VO2max test, step test and
      running on the anaerobic threshold, on separate days. Blood sample, lactic acid level
      (measured in blood drop - finger sting) and urine sample will be taken before and after every
      test.

    <measure>creatine phosphokinase (CPK)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 experiment days for each subject</time_frame>
    <description>CPK is a marker for muscle damage assessed in blood test. blood sample will be taken before and after step test and running on the anaerobic threshold test.</description>

    <measure>oxygen consumption (VO2)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 experiment days for each subject</time_frame>
    <description>VO2 will be monitored continuously using a metabolic system (ERGOTEST 680, ZAN, GERMANY ) during VO2max test, step test and running on the anaerobic threshold test.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>lactic acid</measure>
    <time_frame>5 experiment days for each subject</time_frame>
    <description>lactic acid level is assessed from blood drop (finger sting), will be taken before and after every test. lactic acid is a marker for anaerobic effort evaluating.</description>

    <description>each subject will undergo the following physical tests: day 1 - anthropometric measurements, wingate test and after 1 hour rest VO2max test. lactic acid levels will be measured before and after both tests.
day 2 - step test day 3 - running on the anaerobic threshold. blood sample, lactic acid level (measured in blood drop - finger sting) and urine sample will be taken before and after every test in days 2 and 3.</description>
