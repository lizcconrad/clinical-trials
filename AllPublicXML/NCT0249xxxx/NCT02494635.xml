      This research trial studies two types of tests, an ultrasound test and a biomarker test, to
      see how well they predict how aggressive (invasive) bladder cancer is in samples from
      patients with bladder cancer. The aggressiveness of a tumor means how likely it is to invade
      the body and spread. The ultrasound test uses a fluorescent dye and stimulates cells under a
      microscope to see how they respond. This may allow doctors to predict how likely the cancer
      cells are to spread in the body. The biomarker test uses laboratory testing of samples from
      patients to study genes and other molecules that may predict the cancer invasiveness.
      Comparing two different ways of predicting cancer aggressiveness may help doctors identify
      how well they work, and may eventually allow doctors to predict aggressiveness without
      needing to take a biopsy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To establish an association between bladder cancer disease stage and the level of
      invasiveness as measured by a novel ultrasound assay.

      II. To establish an association between bladder cancer disease stage and expression of novel
      invasiveness biomarkers related to the RE1-silencing transcription factor (REST) gene.

      OUTLINE:

      Previously collected tumor tissue samples, bladder washings, and urine cells are stained with
      calcium dye, washed and immersed in external buffer solution, and then transferred to the
      ultrasound imaging system. Tissue, bladder wash cells and urine cells samples are also
      analyzed for biomarkers of invasiveness derived from or related to REST gene via quantitative
      reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), Western blot, and fluorescence in
      situ hybridization (FISH).

    <description>Data will be post-processed to determine the level of ultrasound-induced calcium response at each stimulus amplitude. Cell locations will be identified with CellProfiler image analysis software and used to extract the raw fluorescence intensities for each cell. CRI will be plotted against stimulus amplitude, a sigmoid will be fit to the curve, and threshold will be defined as the amplitude that yielded a 50% response.</description>
