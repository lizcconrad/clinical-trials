  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide continued access to rilpivirine (RPV) for
      participants who were treated with RPV in a clinical development pediatric study with
      rilpivirine and who, at the time of roll-over, experience and are expected to continue
      experiencing clinical benefit from RPV treatment.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), multicenter (more
      than 1 hospital or medical school team work on a study), roll-over study to provide continued
      access to RPV for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infected participants. All
      enrolled participants will continue to receive RPV in combination with an
      investigator-selected background regimen consisting of 2 nucleoside/nucleotide reverse
      transcriptase inhibitors (N[t]RTIs). Participants will continue to receive RPV in this study
      until they no longer benefit from RPV treatment, they meet at least 1 of the withdrawal
      criteria, or RPV is licensed for adult/pediatric use (depending on the age of the
      participant) and/or is available/accessible outside of a clinical study setting, whichever
      comes first.

             years of age and older)

          -  Participants must be human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infected and must
             have previously been treated with rilpivirine (RPV) 25 mg qd (or weight-adjusted dose)
             in a clinical development pediatric study and completed the protocol defined treatment
             period

          -  Participants must benefit from treatment with RPV, according to the efficacy and
             safety criteria as set out in the protocol of the pediatric study with RPV the
             participant was participating in prior to this rollover study, and must be expected to
             continue to benefit from this treatment in the opinion of the investigator

          -  Participants must be able and willing to comply with the current protocol requirements

          -  Participants general medical condition, in the opinion of the investigator, does not

          -  Pregnant participants

          -  Female participants of childbearing potential and non-vasectomized heterosexually
             active male participants not willing to continue practicing birth control methods
             during the study and for greater than or equal to (â‰¥)1 month after the end of the
             study (or after last intake of RPV)

          -  Participants who were withdrawn from a pediatric study with RPV that they were
             participating in prior to this rollover study, based on any of the mandatory
             withdrawal criteria
