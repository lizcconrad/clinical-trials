  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since femtosecond laser was approved for cataract surgery by FDA in 2010, femtosecond laser
      assisted cataract surgery (FLACS) has demonstrated high precision of capsulotomy, reduced
      phacoemulsification power and time, and comparable refractive outcome in clinic.

      It is still unknown whether there are toxic substances produced due to photochemical or
      high-energy physical effect of femtosecond laser during FLACS.

    <textblock>
      Phacoemulsification is one of the main surgical procedures for cataract surgery owing to the
      advantages of small incisions and rapid recovery. However, the surgical outcome of
      phacoemulsification can be negatively affected due to the problem of accuracy and
      repeatability for capsulorhexis, and the corneal endothelial cell damage by ultrasound
      energy.To overcome those problems from the phacoemulsification, femtosecond laser-assisted
      cataract surgery (FLACS) had been used in the past few years and showed unique advantages.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the preliminary clinical outcomes of femtosecond
      laser-assisted cataract surgery.This prospective comparative study enrolled consecutive
      patients,will be randomly assigned to trial group underwent FLACS and control group underwent
      conventional cataract surgery.

      The phacoemulsification time, energy, and complications during operation were recorded.

      The anterior capsule and aqueous humor were collected. Morphology of the cutting edge and
      cells of anterior capsule was assessed by light microscopy. The proteins in the aqueous humor
      were identified by mass spectrometry . Electrolyte in the aqueous humor was detected by a
      chemistry analyzer. Postoperative refraction at 1 day, 1 week, 1 and 3 months, the
      capsulorhexis size and corneal endothelial density at 1 and 3 months were also measured.
