      The objective was to evaluate the effect of the consumption of dual probiotic strains
      containing Lactobacillus curvatus (L. curvatus) HY7601 and Lactobacillus plantarum (L.
      plantarum) KY1032 on weight loss, body adiposity and inflammatory markers including
      lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) activity in overweight subjects.

      A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted on 120 subjects with age
      between 20 and 65 years, nondiabetic (fasting blood glucose &lt;126 mg/dL and 2-hour blood
      glucose &lt;200 mg/dL), and overweight (25 kg/m2 ≤ body mass index (BMI) &lt; 30 kg/m2). Over a 12
      week test period, the probiotic group consumed 2 g of powder twice a day containing L.
      curvatus HY7601 and L. plantarum KY1032, while the placebo group consumed the same product
      without probiotics for 12 weeks.
