  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether a complex, data-driven protocol for assessing patient needs
      and providing &quot;nudges&quot; (reminders to be compliant with medication prescriptions) improves
      compliance with cardiovascular medications. This will be accomplished by performing a
      12-month clinical trial of patients with an indication for statin therapy. Participants will
      be randomized to either an intervention or standard-of-care arm and will be followed via
      passive electronic means to determine if they are compliant with medication prescriptions.

    <description>Compliance with prescribed cardiovascular medications, measured as a composite of aspirin, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, P2Y12 inhibitors/antiplatelets, diuretics, angiotensin receptor blockers, antiarrhythmia medications, statins, and warfarin/anticoagulants. Compliance will be measured by examining the passively-collected data regarding the filling and refilling of the subject's prescriptions that are available electronically through SelectHealth data and calculating the proportion of time during the followup period that each subject had medication (number of days in which the medication was available after a prescription was filled divided by the total length of the follow-up period).</description>
