    <textblock>
      This is a randomized trial of two group-based models of care for buprenorphine/naloxone
      (bup/nx) patients in Substance Use (SU) specialty treatment: Standard Medical Management
      (SMM) and Intensive Outpatient Treatment (IOT). The setting is a large outpatient SU
      treatment program, where a medical management model of care has not been empirically tested
      with bup/nx patients, and where a high prevalence of patients with co-occurring psychiatric
      and medical co-morbidities are treated. SSM includes brief weekly group-based visits
      consistent with previously studied medical models, and is drawn from primary care bup/nx
      research. IOT is a predominant model of care in specialty treatment, and incorporates
      psychosocial support, 12-step, educational and relapse-prevention based approaches. The
      investigators will recruit 300 adult patients inducted onto bup/nx, randomize them to either
      SMM or IOT, and conduct telephone follow-up interviews at 6 and 12 months. Study
      investigators will examine the impact of these treatment approaches on 90-day bup/nx
      adherence, opioid and SU abstinence, quality of life, and health care and societal costs.
      Further, investigators will examine whether the effect of IOT versus SMM on adherence and SU
      treatment outcomes is greater for those with medical or psychiatric co-morbidities. This
      innovative approach includes a focus on complex patients with psychiatric and medical
      co-morbidities in specialty care, adapting a care model previously only tested in primary
      care, a 12-month follow-up, no research-forced medication taper, an examination of health
      care and societal costs, and a combination of patient self-report and electronic medical
      record data. Through this approach, the proposed study will yield critically important
      findings on how best to treat complex prescription opioid dependent patients with an
      integrative behavioral services and medication treatment model in SU treatment.

      The study will contrast and compare the effectiveness and costs of two forms of behavioral SU
      treatment services for a total of 300 opioid dependent patients seeking bup/nx treatment at
      the Kaiser Sacramento Chemical Dependency Recovery Program (CDRP). The design is a
      between-groups clinical trial using blocked randomization to the two treatments (IOT and SMM)
      with analyses based on an intent-to-treat model.

      Patients are recruited into the study and randomized after induction at the time of program
      intake. A full battery of background, concurrent status and diagnostic information will be
      collected at baseline, and repeated 6 and 12 months later to assess change in drug use, 30
      day and 6-month abstinence, and quality of life at each point. The study will test for
      illicit drug use and presence of buprenorphine with random urinalysis throughout treatment.
      In addition to urinalysis, bup/nx adherence will be measured using prescription drug refills
      and self-report. Investigators will collect self-report of prescription opioid use and
      abstinence. Finally, the number and types of services received by during treatment will be
      available from the EMR.

      Patients seeking bup/nx receive a 30-minute medical exam from a CDRP physician (e.g., for
      symptoms of alcohol or other drug withdrawal, hypertension, acute infections related to
      intravenous drug use, mental status, acute psychosis or suicidal tendencies) to assess
      appropriateness for bup/nx and discuss the treatment. After this initial evaluation, the
      induction is managed by the clinic nurse, in consultation with a clinic physician. Induction
      follows the standard of care, and occurs over 2-3 days. The average daily dose of bup/nx
      ranges from 12-24mg, but is typically 16 mg.

      After induction, the patient will be scheduled for an intake interview for admission into the
      treatment program. Following the intake session, a research staff member will describe the
      study and assess eligibility criteria. For patients who agree to participate, the research
      associate will proceed to enroll the patient in a private room. During enrollment/baseline
      appointment, the research associate will obtain informed consent and administer a baseline
      questionnaire using a laptop computer (see below). Patients will then be randomized to either
      the IOT or SMM arm using a block randomization procedure which will ensure that equal numbers
      of patients will be assigned to each treatment arm. Patients unwilling or unable to be
      randomized will meet with the intake therapist and treated in the standard manner designated
      by the treatment program's regular intake counselors, and will not be part of the study.

      At baseline, following recruitment and consent, participants will complete a computerized
      interview in a private place at the CDRP (with a research associate available for any
      computer or content questions). A full battery of background, physical and mental health and
      SU disorder information will be collected.

      Study investigators will conduct two follow-up telephone interviews whether or not patients
      complete the CDRP treatment program. At the follow-up, participants will be reminded of the
      study and permission to conduct the interview will be obtained verbally. Interviews will be
      conducted at 6 and 12 months by research staff with the same baseline measures to assess
      treatment adherence, substance use and abstinence, and quality of life. Also, patients will
      be asked to present at the CDRP within 48 hours of the 6 and 12 month interviews for a urine
      test and additional brief questions on drug use.

    <time_frame>90-day</time_frame>
    <description>Buprenorphine/naloxone adherence will be measured using KPNC's pharmacy database. Adherence will be based on prescription refills and calculated using Medication Possession Ratio methods, similar to other published KPNC studies which have measured adherence as a key outcome variable. Adherence will be defined as the patient having medication available on 80% or more of the 90 day periodâ€”that is, an MPR of .8 or higher.</description>

    <description>Standard Medical Management (SMM) is a relatively brief (1.5 hour per week for 9 weeks), medically-focused behavioral intervention for opioid dependence. The experimental arm does not involve an investigational drug, device, or biologic.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Intensive Outpatient Treatment</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>The Intensive Outpatient Treatment (IOT) arm is considered usual care and is a predominant model of care in specialty treatment. It incorporates psychosocial support, education, and relapse-prevention approaches and requires attendance at 12-step program. It is a group-based treatment, with individual counseling available as needed. During the initial, 3-week phase, treatment consists of 4-6 hours a day, 7 days a week. In weeks four through 9, treatment consists of 1.5 hours, four days each week. After 9 weeks, patients attend one-hour weekly group meetings for one year. Services include supportive therapy, psycho-education, relapse prevention, and family-oriented therapy. The program emphasis is on abstinence and is similar to many public and private intensive outpatient programs.</description>

  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Standard Medical Management (SMM)</intervention_name>
    <description>SMM is designed to provide basic advice about opioid dependence and encouragement to adhere to treatment recommendations. Sessions provide support and monitoring of medication compliance, dose, withdrawal, adverse effects, and discussion of medical complications of opioid and other drug use. Early in treatment, the focus will be on helping patients adjust to the medications (e.g., monitoring withdrawal or other adverse symptoms, tolerating discomfort, curtailing illicit drug use, and referral to self-help). As treatment progresses, the practitioner may focus more on educating the patient about the social and behavioral factors perpetuating addiction and encourage behavioral and lifestyle change to support recovery.</description>
