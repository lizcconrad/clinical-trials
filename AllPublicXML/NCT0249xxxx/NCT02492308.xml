      The objective of this trial is to determine if autologous SVF derived MSC can effectively
      reduce the need for post transplant immunosuppressant in living-relative kidney
      transplantation. 120 patients eligible for the study as described below will be enrolled,
      with 60 patients in intervention group and 60 in control group.

      The objective of this trial is to determine if autologous SVF derived MSC can effectively
      reduce the need for post transplant immunosuppressant in living-relative kidney
      transplantation. Emphasis will be placed on the safety of autologous SVF derived MSC
      infusion, dosage of immunosuppressant, GFR, percentage of acute rejection. 120 patients
      eligible for the study as described below will be enrolled, with 60 patients in intervention
      group and 60 in control group. In interventional group we will collect SVF from recipients
      with special instruments before transplantation, and culture SVF to abstain MSC. The
      abstained MSC will be infused to the recipients of living-relative kidney transplantation
      during operation and on 7, 14, 21 POD. We will assess whether induction therapy with
      autologous SVF derived MSC is feasible in living-relative donor kidney transplantation. The
      effectiveness of autologous SVF derived MSC induction therapy on reducing of
      immunosuppressant, reducing the rate of rejection, elevating patient and allograft survival,
      improving allograft function from day 0 to 12 months after transplantation. Additionally, we
      will assess the percentage of acute rejection or antibody mediated rejection by Banff
      criteria, the incidence of delayed graft function (defined as the need for post-transplant
      dialysis within one week), and the incidence of adverse events including infection, grade 3
      and above non-hematologic toxicities, and grade 4 hematologic toxicities.
