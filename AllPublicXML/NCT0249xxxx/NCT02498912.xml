  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase I study is to test the safety of different dose levels of specially
      prepared cells collected called &quot;modified T cells&quot;. In the screening part of this study the
      tumor was found to have a protein called MUC16. This protein is present on about 70% of
      ovarian cancers. The investigators want to find a safe dose of modified T cells for patients
      with this type of cancer that has progressed after standard chemotherapy. We also want to
      find out what effects these modified T cells have on the patient and their cancer.

      There are 2 phases to the study: the Screening Phase and the Intervention Phase. Only
      patients identified as eligible from the Screening Phase may enroll in the Intervention
      Phase.

      Screening Phase: After signing Informed Consent 1 (Screening Informed Consent), the patient's
      MUC16ecto tumor expression will be determined as previously described. In order to be
      eligible for this protocol, the patient's ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube
      carcinoma must express the MUC16ecto protein detectable by IHC analysis of banked (paraffin
      embedded) or fresh biopsied tumor. After signing Informed Consent 1, approximately 2 weeks
      will elapse while the patient's banked tumor is tested for MUC16ecto expression. If a
      patient's tumor is found to express MUC16ecto, she will undergo leukapheresis for the
      collection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), which will be frozen for future use.
      The leukapheresis product will be stored until the end of the study in case future research
      tests related to this study are developed.

      Intervention Phase: Patients must sign Informed Consent 2 (Intervention Informed Consent)
      before receiving treatment on the study before receiving treatment on the study.

      Once the patient is eligible to receive the CAR+ T cells, the frozen leukapheresis product
      will be thawed and used to generate the 4H11-28z/fIL-12/EGFRt+ genetically-modified T cells.
      It is expected to take approximately 4-6 weeks to prepare the autologous CAR+ T cells.

      On day 1-3 patients in cohorts V will receive conditioning chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide
      750 mg/m^2 or 300 mg/m2 cyclophosphamide concurrent with 25-30 mg/m2 fludarabine 2-7 days
      prior to the initial infusion of autologous CAR+T cells. Patients will receive autologous
      CAR+T cells in 2 infusions, the first IV and the second IP, each comprising about half the
      total dose. The IV infusion will be given first. The patient will then be closely monitored.
      One to 3 days later if clinically stable, the patient will receive the remaining dose of
      CAR+T cells IP. Patients in cohort I or -I will not receive cyclophosphamide, but will
      receive the T cells in the same manner (approximately half IV, followed by close monitoring
      and then 1-3 days later, if the patient is clinically stable, the remaining cells will be
      administered IP).

The first subject will be treated at dose level 1 (3 x 1054H11-28z/fIL-12/EGFRt+ T cells/kg). At least one week will elapse from the first patient's T cell infusions before the second patient is treated (on dose level 1) to allow for toxicity and safely assessment. 3 subjects will be enrolled in cohort I and followed for 30 days for safety assessments. If no DLT is observed after all three subjects have been observed for 30 days, a second cohort of 3 subjects will be enrolled at the same dose level (3 x 10^54H11-28z/fIL-12/EGFRt+ T cells/kg) with the addition of cyclophosphamide plus or minus fludarabine.</description>

    <description>This is a standard phase I dose escalation trial. Cohorts of 3-6 patients will be infused with escalating doses of modified T cells to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of modified T cells. There are 4 planned dose levels: 3 x 10^5, 1 x 10^6, 3 x 10^6, and 1 x 10^7 4H11-28z/fIL-12/EGFRt+ T cells/kg (Table 1). Cohort I-IV will be treated escalating dose levels. Once the MTD of T cells is established, the next cohort will receive lymphodepleting cyclophosphamide dose of 750 mg/m^2 or a regimen of cyclophosphamide dose 300 mg/m2 x 3 days concurrent with fludarabine dose 25-30 mg/m2 x 3 days 2-7 days prior to starting the T cell infusion at one dose level below the MTD. If the MTD is not established after Cohort IV, Cohort V will receive conditioning chemotherapy 2-7 days prior to starting the T cell infusion at the same dose as Cohort III.</description>
