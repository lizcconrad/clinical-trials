  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is now the optimal method of obtaining vascular access for
      dialysis. Measures such as systemic anticoagulation have been proposed as means of increasing
      patency rates but enough evidence does not exist to support their use. The investigators
      aimed to evaluate the efficacy of preoperative heparin injection on patency of AVF during the
      first 24 hours after surgery and to determine whether such measure can be used to prevent
      early thrombosis of the vascular access.

      The study was carried out on patients admitted to Shohada-e-Tajrish hospital for permanent
      vascular access placement since April 2011 through September 2012. The exclusion criteria
      consisted of having a contraindication of administration of anticuagulant agent. 150 patients
      were enrolled in the study.

      All patients were operated on by a single surgeon (Dr Mozafar. The non dominant upper
      extremity (mostly the left arm) was generally used unless unfavorable vasculature or previous
      fistula placement changed the preference. The anastomosis technique was either end-to-side or
      side-to-side using a number 6.0 prolene suture. 75 patients were randomly assigned to receive
      100units/kg of heparin after dissection prior to anastomosis while the other 75 received no
      intraoperative heparin injection. Auscultation of bruit and palpation of thrill was used to
      assess arteriovenous fistula patency in the first 24 hours after AVF placement.

      Data analysis was performed using SPSS v.20. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered as
      statistically significant. Bivariate analysis in the form of Chi-square tests, T-test and
      Fischer's exact test were calculated.

      Patient enrollment was voluntary and no costs were imposed on the patients. The study
      protocol was in accordance with 1975 Declaration of Helsinki.
