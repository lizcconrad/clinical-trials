  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regional lymph node metastasis is a major determinant of local recurrence and overall
      survival rates in patients with colorectal cancer. Because of the poor prognosis associated
      with the presence of lymph node metastasis, stage III colorectal cancer patients should
      receive adjuvant treatment with chemo and / or radiation therapy according to the site of
      tumor. Several authors have investigated the use of revealing solutions for lymph node
      clearance in colorectal cancer. Most studies comparing conventional histopathological
      specimen examination to any lymph node clearing technique showed that the use of revealing
      solutions increases the mean number of lymph nodes harvested, usually in a statistically
      significant manner. It is still controversial the impact of the use of revealing solutions
      for upstaging of lymph node status and consequently for the indication for adjuvant therapy.
      Therefore will be conducted a randomized clinical trial to compares the performance of GEWF
      and Carnoy solutions for the histopathological examination of patients with colorectal
      cancer. The aim of this study is to determine the lymph node revealing solution with the best
      performance (increase in the mean number of lymph node harvested and lymph node upstaging) in
      patients with colorectal cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with histologically proven colorectal adenocarcinoma submitted to curative resection
      and conventional histopathological examination of the surgical specimen are randomized to
      undergo further investigation by lymph node clearing technique with Carnoy or GEWF solution.
