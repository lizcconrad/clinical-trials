      This study will maximize identification of women with Lynch Syndrome using an enhanced
      screening strategy to identify those at risk. These women will be referred to genetic
      counselling for testing and those found to have Lynch Syndrome will be asked to invite first
      degree relatives to participate and undergo genetic testing for Lynch Syndrome. Screening
      guidelines and risk reducing surgery options for participants found to have Lynch Syndrome
      will be reinforced by the study and adherence to these guidelines will be assessed annually
      for ten years following Lynch Syndrome diagnosis to assess the impact and cost-effectiveness
      of this enhanced screening approach.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lynch Syndrome increases an individual's risk for several cancers, such as colorectal,
      endometrial (EC) and certain types of ovarian cancer (OC). Lynch Syndrome is caused by
      inherited changes in mismatch repair (MMR) genes. In this study we will establish the
      proportion of EC and OC patients with Lynch Syndrome. We will screen all EC and OC patients
      by performing MMR immunohistochemistry (IHC) on their surgical specimen. These data will then
      be used along with family history data to determine which women are at high risk of Lynch
      Syndrome. We will facilitate the referral of all women at risk for Lynch Syndrome to genetic
      counselling on behalf of their treating physician. First degree relatives of those patients
      found to have Lynch Syndrome who consent to participate in the study will also be referred to
      genetics by the study PI. We will encourage all participants found to have Lynch Syndrome to
      attend regular colonoscopy screening to prevent colorectal cancer, and (for females with
      Lynch Syndrome) consideration of gynecologic risk reducing surgery to prevent endometrial and
      ovarian cancers. We will assess adherence to Lynch Syndrome screening guidelines in this
      population and will determine if our universal screening strategy is feasible and
      cost-effective for widespread implementation across Canada in an effort to prevent Lynch
      Syndrome associated cancers in women and their families. In addition to this, consenting
      patients may provide blood and tumour tissue samples for sequencing studies which will
      investigate the genetic basis for Lynch Syndrome and shed light on cases of MMR loss in the
      absence of germline mutation.

    <description>Participants found to have Lynch Syndrome will be followed after diagnosis and asked to update the study annually with information about any colorectal cancer screening (colonoscopy) and/or gynecologic risk-reducing surgery they've undergone. This information will be used to assess the success of the enhanced universal screening protocol in helping treat pre-cancerous lesions and therefore prevent a possible cancer as well as aid in detection of early malignancies that otherwise may have gone undetected.</description>

    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>This study will add data about the number of Lynch Syndrome cases among a large cohort of endometrial cancer patients in Canada, adding to previous work. This will be the first prospective study to assess Lynch Syndrome incidence in non-serous, non-mucinous ovarian cancer patients in Canada.</description>

    <measure>Discovery of novel genetic mutations and molecular events in unexplained MMR loss (Lynch-like Syndrome)</measure>
    <time_frame>3-5 years</time_frame>
    <description>This study will investigate tumour samples from women with unexplained MMR loss (MMR IHC deficient without a germline mutation) to probe what other factors may contribute to Lynch-like Syndrome. Currently these patients are believed to have an intermediate risk for Lynch-associated cancers and are counselled accordingly. Further investigation into the biology of this condition may yield more effective strategies for stratifying and managing risk for Lynch-like Syndrome patients.</description>
