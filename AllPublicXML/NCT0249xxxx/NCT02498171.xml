    <textblock>
      This study is aimed at evaluating single short spinal technique as a form of labour analgesia
      in a setting where more expensive and labor intensive techniques are not feasible.The study
      will examine the safety and efficacy of two drug combinations (intrathecal morphine+fentanyl
      vs intrathecal morphine+bupivacaine) through a randomized control trial.

      The investigators hypothesize that a single shot of either intrathecal morphine plus fentanyl
      or intrathecal morphine plus bupivacaine achieve analgesia and are safe in parturients
      experiencing normal labour.
