  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of the combination of
      rhuMab 2C4 (Perjeta) and docetaxel (Taxotere) in participants with advanced solid tumors that
      have progressed during or after standard therapy, or for which no standard therapy is
      available. Participants will be enrolled and evaluated for dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) in
      escalating-dose cohorts in order to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).

    <measure>Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Docetaxel in Combination of Pertuzumab</measure>
    <time_frame>Cycle 1 Up to Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>A prior dose level was defined as an MTD if at a certain dose level, there were greater than or equal to (≥) 2 out of 6 participants who had Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs). If there were no DLTs or DLTs were seen in less than (&lt;) 2 participants in the highest dose level, that was considered as MTD. Participants received escalating doses of docetaxel and pertuzumab until DLTs were observed. DLTs were defined as any of the following: 1) Any non-hematological toxicity ≥ Grade 3 according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0 except for fever, chills and flu-like symptoms, in spite of adequate toxicity management, 2) Grade 4 neutropenia lasting greater than (&gt;) 7 days, 3) Febrile neutropenia, 4) Thrombocytopenia Grade 4 or any thrombocytopenia requiring platelet transfusion or 5) Any subjectively intolerable toxicity felt by the investigator to be related to either one of the compounds.</description>

    <time_frame>Weeks 7 (Cycle 2),13 (Cycle 4) and Final Visit Up to 22 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Best Overall response was evaluated as Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), Stable Disease (SD) or Progressive Disease (PD). CR: complete disappearance of all target lesions. PR: at least a 30 percent (%) decrease in the sum of the longest diameters. SD: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest sum of the longest diameters since the treatment started. PD: at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of the longest diameters of the target lesions recorded since the treatment started, including screening, or the appearance of one or more new lesions. If participants withdrew due to insufficient therapeutic response or death and had no tumor measurements at the final visit, they were counted under progressive disease for final visit.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 7(Cycle 2), 13 (Cycle 4) and Final Visit Up to Week 22</time_frame>
    <description>Ejection fraction (EF) is the fraction of outbound blood pumped from the heart with each heartbeat. It is commonly measured by echocardiogram and serves as a general measure of a person's cardiac function. Changes in LVEF were assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0 criteria. The decrease in LVEF has been categorized as follows: A) Increase, no change, decrease from baseline less than (&lt;) 10%; B) Absolute value &lt;50% and decrease from baseline greater than or equal to (≥) 10%; C) Absolute value &lt;50% and decrease from baseline≥15% ; D) Other.

In Cycle 1 participants received a loading dose of 840 mg of pertuzumab as an IV infusion. Further in Cycle 1 Docetaxel was administered on Day 1 and pertuzumab was administered at least 24 h apart on Day 2. Cycle 2 onwards pertuzumab was administered on Day 1 immediately followed by docetaxel. In addition all participants received 8 mg of dexamethasone or its equivalent as corticosteroid premedication.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Decrease in Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) by Category of Decrease and Timepoint</title>
        <description>Ejection fraction (EF) is the fraction of outbound blood pumped from the heart with each heartbeat. It is commonly measured by echocardiogram and serves as a general measure of a person's cardiac function. Changes in LVEF were assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0 criteria. The decrease in LVEF has been categorized as follows: A) Increase, no change, decrease from baseline less than (&lt;) 10%; B) Absolute value &lt;50% and decrease from baseline greater than or equal to (≥) 10%; C) Absolute value &lt;50% and decrease from baseline≥15% ; D) Other. If participants withdrew due to insufficient therapeutic response or death and had no tumor measurements at the final visit, they were counted under progressive disease for final visit.</description>
