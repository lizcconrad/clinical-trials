          3. Subjects must have a Baseline ADHD-RS-IV score at or above the 90th percentile
             normalized for sex and age in at least 1 of the following categories: 1) Hyperactive

          5. Subjects who are not currently on MPH treatment must either 1) have prior experience
             with MPH treatment and have shown clinical response to therapy during that time; or 2)
             be treated with the same dose of MPH and show a clinical response with acceptable
             tolerability to MPH for â‰¥2 weeks prior to screening.

          6. Parental or legal guardian confirmation of before-school function impairment and
             difficulties performing morning routine.

          7. Regular weekday morning routine of no less than 30 minutes.

          8. Subject must be considered clinically appropriate for treatment with MPH and HLD200,
             including ability to swallow treatment capsules.

          9. Subject must be in general good health based upon medical history, physical
             examination, and laboratory results (including urine drug screen).

         10. Subject and parent or legal guardian must be able to read, write, and/or understand at
             a level sufficient to provide informed consent (parent/legal guardian) and assent
             (subject) prior to study participation and to complete study-related materials.
             Subject and a parent/legal guardian must plan to be available for the entire study
             period.

         11. Female subjects of childbearing potential (i.e., post-menarche) are required to have a
             negative result on urine pregnancy testing at screening (and will be given specific
             instructions for avoiding pregnancy during the study).

         12. A medically highly effective form of birth control must be used during the study and
             for 90 days thereafter for subjects of either sex of childbearing potential. Examples
             of medically highly effective forms of birth control are as follows:

               -  No sexual activity

               -  Use of acceptable methods of birth control including intra-uterine device, oral,
                  implantable, or injectable contraceptives.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of, or current, medical condition or laboratory result which, in the opinion
             of the investigator, unfavorably alters the risk-benefit of study participation, may
             jeopardize subject safety, or may interfere with the satisfactory completion of the
             study and study-related procedures.

          2. Serious structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart rhythm
             abnormalities, or other cardiac problems that may place the subject at increased
             vulnerability to the sympathomimetic effects of a stimulant drug.

          3. History of seizure disorder (except febrile seizures prior to age 5 and at least 1
             year prior to study participation), Tourette's disorder, or intellectual disability of
             minor severity or greater (DSM5 criteria).

             Current depression, anxiety, conduct/behavior disorder, substance use disorder, or
             other psychiatric condition which, in the investigator's opinion, may jeopardize
             subject safety or may interfere with the satisfactory completion of the study and
             study-related procedures.

          5. Active suicidal ideation as evidenced by an ideation score of 2 or greater on the
             C-SSRS.

             creatinine greater than 1.5x the upper limit of normal. Elevated bilirubin due only to
             Gilbert's syndrome is not exclusionary.

          9. History of alcohol abuse or illicit drug use.

         10. Use of prescription medications (except allowed medications; see Section 8.1.2) within
             7 days of Baseline (Visit 2), except for ADHD stimulant medication (5 days) and
             monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) (14 days), and over-the-counter medications
             (except birth control and allowed medications) within the 3 days preceding Baseline
             (Visit 2). Medications not covered in allowed medications or prohibited medications
             (Section 8.1.1) must be cleared by the medical monitor prior to enrolling the subject.

             preceding study enrollment.

         12. Previous treatment experience with HLD200.

         13. Positive screening for illicit drug use or nicotine and/or current health conditions
             or use of medications that might confound the results of the study or increase risk to
             the subject.

         14. In the opinion of the investigator, the subject may have problems complying with the
             protocol or the procedures of the protocol, or could face unnecessary safety risks
             from the study. This includes current health conditions or use of medications that
             might confound the results of the study or increase risk to the subject.

         15. Subject's systolic or diastolic blood pressure measurement exceeds the 95th percentile
             for age, sex, and height at the Baseline visit.

         16. Subject is significantly underweight based on Centers for Disease Control and
             Prevention body mass index (BMI)-for-age sex-specific values at the Screening Visit.
             Significantly underweight is defined as a BMI &lt;5th percentile.

         17. Subject is significantly overweight based on Centers for Disease Control and
             Prevention BMI-for-age sex specific values at the Screening Visit. Significantly
