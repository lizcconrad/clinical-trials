    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a TEOSYAL®
      PureSense Redensity [I] injection using MicronJet® needle in the treatment of crow's feet
      wrinkles.

      It is a monocentric, open-blind, prospective, pilot study. 3 injections sessions spaced with
      an interval of 3 weeks. The last visit will be performed 3 weeks after the last injection.

      Only, one group of 15 healthy volunteers will be included.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TEOSYAL® PureSense Redensity [I] is a viscoelastic gel of non-cross-linked hyaluronic acid
      that is sterile, non pyrogenic, colourless and of non-animal origin and contains 0.3% by mass
      of lidocaine hydrochloride, for its anaesthetic properties. Each box contains two syringes
      pre-filled with Teosyal® PureSense Redensity I. The volume of each syringe is shown on the
      cardboard box as well as on each syringe. Teosyal® PureSense Redensity I is indicated for the
      prevention of wrinkles and rehydration of the neck, neckline, face and in particular the
      crow's feet wrinkles.

      The MicronJet® needle is a 3 micro-needle (0.6 mm of length) device that is mounted on a
      standard syringe in the same manner as a conventional needle. The MicronJet® needle is used
      to inject liquid substances, allowing for controlled intradermal delivery in any procedure
      which requires administration of substances to the dermal compartment.

      For the first time, the TEOSYAL® PureSense Redensity [I] will be injected using the medical
      device MicronJet® in the superficial wrinkles.
