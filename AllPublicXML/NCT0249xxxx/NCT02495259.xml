      The purpose of this study is to compare three different standard of care methods of
      double-lumen endobronchial tube (DLT) placement in patients who are scheduled to have
      thoracic surgery in which lung isolation is required. The investigators want to evaluate the
      technique of placement of the double-lumen endobronchial tube (DLT) using an included stylet
      that has been radically bent (ZU-bend) as compared to a commercial GlideRite stylet with the
      GlideScope and direct laryngoscopy using the Macintosh laryngoscope. A double-lumen
      endobronchial tube (DLT) is a breathing tube utilized to manage the airway when lung
      separation is needed for a surgical procedure. The investigator wants to evaluate how long it
      takes for successful placement of the double-lumen endobronchial tube (DLT) and assess the
      difficulty of the procedure experienced by the physician performing the intubation.

    <measure>Mean time to place the double-lumen endobronchial tube</measure>
    <time_frame>An expected average of 120 seconds</time_frame>
    <description>The time taken for successful intubation will be recorded by the anesthetist. The total duration from the time the laryngoscope is placed at the patient's lips to the first detection of End-tidal CO2 (EtCO2), an average of 120 seconds, will be recorded in seconds. A higher duration noted is indicative of a longer time taken for successful intubation. 0 seconds (laryngoscope at patient's lips), (first End-tidal CO2 (EtCO2) detection)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Success rate of first endobronchial intubation attempt</measure>
    <time_frame>An expected average of 120 seconds</time_frame>
    <description>The rate of first intubation attempt success will be recorded by the anesthetist. A successful first attempt intubation is when the double-lumen endobronchial tube is placed during the initial laryngoscopy within 120 seconds. The average time for successful intubation is 120 seconds, which is the time from when the laryngoscope is placed at the patient's lips to the first detection of End-tidal CO2 (EtCO2). Higher numbers of successful first attempt intubations indicate better rates of success of first endobronchial intubation attempts .</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of difficulty of intubation</measure>
    <time_frame>An expected average of 120 seconds</time_frame>
    <description>The ease of successful placement of the double-lumen endobronchial tube (DLT) will be assessed by the anesthetist's responses to a multi-question form which includes the following items that are scored; overall ease of intubation, laryngoscope insertion, glottic view, double-lumen endobronchial tube (DLT) delivery and placement. The subjective scores range from 0-10; where 0=worst, 10=best. The average time for successful intubation is 120 seconds, which is the time from when the laryngoscope is placed at the patient's lips to the first detection of End-tidal CO2 (EtCO2).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of complications</measure>
    <time_frame>An expected average of 120 seconds</time_frame>
    <description>The incidence of complications during intubation will be will be assessed by the anesthetist's responses to a multi-question form which includes the following items; blood on device, SpO2 (peripheral capillary oxygen saturation) &lt;96%, lip and dental trauma and double-lumen endobronchial tube (DLT) cuff rupture. The responses are recorded as Yes or No for each item. A 'yes' response indicates a complication. The average time for successful intubation is 120 seconds, which is the time from when the laryngoscope is placed at the patient's lips to the first detection of End-tidal CO2 (EtCO2).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Voice change</measure>
    <time_frame>An expected average of 60 minutes after extubation</time_frame>
    <description>Any voice change in the patient after extubation will be assessed in the Post-Operative Admission Unit (PACU) by asking the patient if any change in voice is experienced (Yes/No). The subjective answer given by the patient will be recorded. The average time for the patient to sufficiently recover to respond is expected to be 60 minutes after extubation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Throat pain</measure>
    <time_frame>An expected average of 60 minutes after extubation</time_frame>
    <description>Any voice change in the patient after extubation will be assessed in the Post-Operative Admission Unit (PACU) by recording the patient's response to the degree of pain experienced. An analog pain scale will be used for scoring where; 0= no pain and 10= severe pain. The average time for the patient to sufficiently recover to respond is expected to be 60 minutes after extubation.</description>

    <intervention_name>ZU-bend stylet</intervention_name>
    <description>Laryngoscopy and intubation after induction of anesthesia will be done using the GlideScope and the ZU-bend stylet. The ZU-bend is a specific shaping technique of the intubating stylet that is closely related to the GlideScope blade curvature. Zu-bend stylet is withdrawn as a part of placement procedure during the DLT advancement. Thereafter, GlideScope is removed and placement of the double-lumen endobronchial tube is verified with capnography and fiberoptic bronchoscopy in the usual manner.</description>

    <description>Laryngoscopy and intubation after induction of anesthesia will be done using the the GlideScope technique. The GlideScope is a video laryngoscope that provides a real-time view of the airway and tube placement during intubation. GlideScope is removed after DLT is in the trachea, and placement of the double-lumen endobronchial tube is verified with capnography and fiberoptic bronchoscopy in the usual manner.</description>

    <description>Laryngoscopy and intubation after induction of anesthesia will be done with the GlideScope using the GlideRite stylet. The GlideRite stylet is specifically designed to work with the GlideScope and provides the necessary rigidity and curvature to an otherwise flexible tube. GlideRite stylet is withdrawn as a part of placement procedure during the DLT advancement. Thereafter, GlideScope is removed and placement of the double-lumen endobronchial tube is verified with capnography and fiberoptic bronchoscopy in the usual manner.</description>
