      The overall purpose of this study is to evaluate the reliability and usability of the
      reusable BrownieForSymphony pump set in home use.

      The primary objectives of this study is to asses and compare the System Usability Scale (SUS)
      score of the BrownieForSymphony pump set and the current used Symphony pump set.

      Secondary Objectives

      The secondary objectives of this study are:

      to evaluate the rate of usability problems with the BrownieForSymphony pump set

        -  to evaluate the pragmatic quality (task/goal fulfilment) of the BrownieForSymphony pump
           set

        -  to evaluate perceived comfort during pumping with the BrownieForSymphony pump set
