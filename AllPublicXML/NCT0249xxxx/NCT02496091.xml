      The study is designed as a retrospective and multi-center study. The study population is US
      individuals previously restored with titanium and gold-shaded titanium ATLANTIS abutments.
      The study includes retrospective data collection from the medical records and data collection
      from one prospective study visit with a clinical examination.The primary objective is to
      evaluate success. Success is defined as that the study implant and abutment are in situ and
      no Adverse Device Effects related to the study implant, abutment or adjacent peri-implant
      tissues are reported during the study.

        The study population is individuals who received ATLANTIS abutments, between 2010 and 2013,
        connected to implants from BIOMET 3i, Straumann, Nobel Biocare or DENTSPLY Implants (only
        ASTRA TECH Implant System) replacing one or more teeth, in any position in the mouth, as
        part of a permanent prosthetic restoration. The partially dentate individuals have received
        either single-unit crowns or fixed partial or full dentures. The abutments need to be
        titanium or gold-shaded titanium.
