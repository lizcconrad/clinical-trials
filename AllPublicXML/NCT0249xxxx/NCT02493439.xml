  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to test the efficacy of an intervention focused on promoting positive
      emotions (Best Possible Self - BPS) to improve the psychological wellbeing of Romanian
      immigrants living in Spain. It is hypothesized that the BPS intervention will significantly
      improve a series of positive mental health outcomes, i.e., optimism, future expectancies, and
      affect, compared to the Control group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have shown that groups of immigrants may face a series of problems unique to
      the process of immigration, such as working, legal, social, and mental and physical health
      problems.

      BPS is a guided imagery exercise that requires participants to envision themselves in the
      future, achieving desired goals in different areas of their lives. This exercise has shown
      efficacy improving optimism, future expectancies and positive affect compared to a control
      condition, in general population. Taking into account the prior literature, the aim of the
      present study is to carry out a randomized controlled study in order to replicate the
      findings about the effects of BPS on optimism, mood and affect in an immigrant population.
      The design employed in this study is similar to the used in other studies.
