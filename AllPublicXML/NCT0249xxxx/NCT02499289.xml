    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has a heterogeneous clinical presentation comprising
      reproductive (hyperandrogenism, menstrual irregularity, anovulation, infertility, pregnancy
      complications), metabolic [insulin resistance (IR), increased type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)
      and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors] and psychological features (worsened quality
      of life and increased anxiety and depression) Whether prolonged fasting during Ramadan breaks
      the insulin resistance state of polycystic ovarian syndrome and subsequently improve the
      ovulation and spontaneous pregnancy will happen without ovarian stimulation.

      Question of the study:

      The question is raised whether prolonged fasting during Ramadan breaks the insulin resistance
      state of polycystic ovarian syndrome and improve the metabolic syndrome does prolonged
      fasting decrease glucose level, insulin level, insulin resistance markers such as adipokines
      and subsequently improve ovarian function and causes spontaneous ovulation.
