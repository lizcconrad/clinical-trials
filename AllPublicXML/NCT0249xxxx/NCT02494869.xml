  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to look at the effect that different amounts of progressive exercise
      training has on risk factors associated with developing breast cancer. These risk factors
      include exercise capacity, body weight, and body composition, as well as the expression of
      certain genes and levels of inflammatory factors in your breast tissue.

    <description>The ultimate goal is for participants to complete 75 minutes/week of structured aerobic training per week at 55% to 100% of the individually determined exercise capacity (VO2peak) determined from the (CPETs performed at baseline, midpoint, and Study Follow-Up. The 75 min/wk will be achieved via 3 individual supervised aerobic training sessions at approximately 25 minutes/session. This arm is closed to accrual.</description>

The 300 minutes/week will be achieved by completing 5 aerobic training sessions/week for approximately 60 minutes/session. A minimum of 3 sessions/week are required to be supervised while the remaining 2 sessions can be supervised or unsupervised home-based.</description>

    <description>Usual care patients will receive a home-based, general physical activity program. Specifically, all patients assigned to general physical activity will receive an initial, in-person consultation with staff exercise physiologist outlining a structured home-based aerobic walking program with a goal up to 150 minutes per week outside of their normal daily activity. Patients will be provided with a fitness tracker (e.g. FitBit) to evaluate exercise duration and intensity. Patients will be asked to records type, duration, and average heart rate during sessions in an exercise log to assess compliance. Staff exercise physiologists will contact patients by telephone or in person on a monthly, or less, basis to check progress, answer questions and record compliance.</description>
