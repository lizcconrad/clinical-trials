      The Holding Area LINQ Trial is a clinical trial designed to compare the benefits in
      conducting impant procedures in the holding area of a hospital operating room vs cardiac
      catheterization/electrophysiology laboratory.

      The Holding Area LINQ Trial is a prospective, non-randomized, single center post-market
      clinical trial designed to occur in the holding area of a hospital operating room or cardiac
      catheterization/electrophysiology laboratory. The primary objective is to characterize the
      rate of procedure-related complications within 90 days of the implant procedure which require
      resolution by surgical intervention. Twenty (20) patients with established clinical
      indications for the LINQ ICM (Reveal LINQ Insertable Cardiac Monitor) will be implanted using
      standard of care techniques and procedures. Implants will be required to take place in a
      hospital holding area rather than the traditional facility locations such as the hospital
      operating room, cardiac catheterization lab, or electrophysiology lab. A physical description
      of the holding area is a small patient examination room separated from other patient exam bay
      by walls and a door. There is a sink in the patient exam room, laminate flooring, ceiling A/C
      vent, wall mounted Hemodynamic monitoring equipment, and wall mounted oxygen/suction lines.
      Patient sedation will be limited to local anesthetics and/or oral anti-anxiety medications.
      Intravenous access will be obtained only for emergency resuscitative measures. Due to the low
      complication rate for this type of implant and practical limitations on the sample size,
      there are no formal hypotheses tested in this trial. This study will characterize all
      procedure-related adverse events that occur within 90 days of the implant procedure. Data
      will be collected at implant, 7-10 day post-op visit, and 90-day post-implant visits.

    <description>Device functionality post-implant will be characterized by collecting R-wave amplitudes on the day of implant and at the 90-day follow-up visit. Following each implant, R-wave amplitude will be collected and recorded on the Implant e-CRF. In addition, R-wave amplitude will be collected and recorded at the 90-day follow-up visit or at an unscheduled visit should the patient exit the study prior to the 90-day follow-up visit. Summary statistics and/or graphical methods will be used to summarize the R-wave amplitude.</description>
