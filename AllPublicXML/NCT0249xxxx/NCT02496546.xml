          -  Subject with Atopic Dermatitis (AD) as defined by Hanifin and Rajka criteria and with
             mild to moderate disease severity (IGA 2 or 3) as assessed by a dermatologically

             (complete AD lesion or part of an AD lesion); Total Sign Score (TSS) of at least 5 on
             both ETAs; difference in TSS not greater than 2 between the two ETAs; sign score for
             erythema ≥ 2 on both ETAs; difference in Investigator´s Treatment Area assessment of
             disease severity not greater than 1 between the 2 ETAs
