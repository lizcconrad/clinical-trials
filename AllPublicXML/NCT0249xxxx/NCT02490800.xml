      First in human, open-label, sequential dose escalation and expansion study of oral BAL101553
      in adult patients with advanced solid tumors and adult patients with recurrent or progressive
      glioblastoma or high-grade glioma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is the first study of the oral formulation of BAL101553. BAL101553 will be administered
      once daily during each day of a 28-day treatment cycle in capsule form to adults with
      advanced or recurrent solid tumors or recurrent or progressive glioblastoma or high-grade
      glioma who have failed standard therapy, or for whom no effective standard therapy is
      available.

      The primary goal of the study is to find the highest dose of BAL101553 that can safely be
      given to humans and to assess what side effects occur. The study will start by treating
      patients with a low dose. Once it has been shown that this low dose is well tolerated, new
      patients will be treated at higher dose levels (&quot;dose escalation&quot;). Once the highest, well
      tolerated dose is identified, additional patients will be treated at that dose (this part is
      called &quot;dose expansion&quot;) to further assess the tolerability and potential anticancer activity
      of oral BAL101553. The study will also measure pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamic effects and
      assess biomarkers.
