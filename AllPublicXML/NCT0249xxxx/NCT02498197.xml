  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is high prevalence of back pain and neck-shoulder pain among blue collar workers.
      Physical excessive exposures such as heavy lifting or working with a bended or twisted back
      are independent risk factors for back pain among workers in the construction industry.
      Participatory ergonomic initiatives increase the success of interventions aimed at reducing
      physical excessive exposures.

      The objectives are in two phases to; 1) determine which work-tasks in selected job-groups
      involve the highest load of the back and shoulders during a normal working day (using EMG,
      Actigraphs, Video). 2) investigate whether a participatory intervention can reduce physical
      workloads, drawing on information from objective measurements from phase 1.
