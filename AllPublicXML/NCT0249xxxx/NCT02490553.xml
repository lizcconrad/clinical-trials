      The ELISABET STUDY is across sectional Survey on a representative sample of two urban area
      conduct on a representative sample. The main objective of the project is to compare the
      prevalence of the obstructive ventilatory disorders (OVD) in the Urban Community of Dunkirk
      touched by the industrial pollution in relation to the one recovered in the Urban Community
      of Lille (CUDL) less industrialized.

      Airflow obstruction include Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstruction and asthma. Identification
      of Airflow obstruction is through Functional Tests Lung. In the 1950s, high pollution levels
      were associated with increased mortality. Despite a reduction of air pollution, it has been
      established that pollution peaks have short-term effects on acute respiratory episodes. The
      Urban Community of Dunkirk (CUD) focuses many large pollutant emitters. The long term effects
      of industrial pollution on TVO are unknown.

      The main objective of the project is to compare the prevalence of Airflow obstruction in the
      Urban Community of Dunkirk affected by industrial pollution compared to that found in the
      Urban Community of Lille (CUDL) less industrialized. Secondary objectives are: 1) To assess
      the relationship between air pollution from industrial and biological markers, particularly
      the plasma concentrations of heavy metals 2) To assess the prevalence of TVO general
      population in French populations 3) Establish a baseline epidemiological and biological bank.

    <description>Forced expiratory volume per second (FEV1) to forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio below 0.7. mesured by standardized spirometry
Spirometry testing was performed mostly at home using Micro 6000 spirometers (Medisoft; Sorinnes, Belgium), according to the 2005 ATS/ERS guidelines. The spirometers were calibrated weekly. No bronchodilators were administered. For each participant, the spirometry test was repeated (up to seven times) until three acceptable, reproducible flow-volume loops were obtained, following the same guidelines. The greatest reproducible values of FEV1 and FVC were selected for the statistical analysis (regardless of whether these two values came from separate curves or from the same curve). All spirometry data were validated by an experienced, specialist physician.</description>

        The participants were selected from electoral rolls by random sampling, with stratification
        for gender, age and centercentre (Lille or Dunkirk). All participants were all recruited
        between January 2011 and November 2013. Each selected participant received a letter asking
        him/her to contact the coordinating team and make an appointment for data collection. In
        the absence of a reply, participants were contacted by telephone. Data was collected at
        home (occasionally during a consultation in a healthcare establishment). In all cases, a
        trained, registered nurse administered a detailed questionnaire and performed spirometry
        testing.
