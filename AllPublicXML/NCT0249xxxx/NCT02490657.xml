      The inhaled Iloprost, approved for pulmonary hypertension, caused increase in oxygenation,
      and increase exercise tolerance in ARDS or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Inhaled
      iloprost has been researched in animal study, but not yet in human during one-lung
      ventilation. The investigators will enroll patients who diagnosed moderate to severe chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease, preoperative pulse oximetry (SpO2) of below 95% at room air or
      PaO2 /FiO2 ratio&lt; 150 mmHg after initiating one-lung ventilation. The primary outcome is
      pulmonary oxygenation expressed by PaO2 /FiO2 ratio. And secondary outcome is assessment of
      cardiac function including Tei-index during nebulizing iloprost. The investigators
      hypothesized inhaled iloprost will improve oxygenation and decrease the FiO2 in chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease during one-lung ventilation.

    <description>Nebulized agents (Iloprost or normal saline) were randomized by computer-generated randomization. The patients and anesthesiologist, who administered inhalation and conducted all this trial, were blinded to the medication allocation. An anesthesiologist, who responsible for preparation of medication, was the only person recognizing of the randomization code during trial.
Enrolled patients were received 20 μg iloprost or placebo (norma saline). Iloprost was diluted in normal saline to obtain 2ml solution. Control group were inhaled comparable dose of normal saline. Iloprost or normal saline was inhaled through an ultrasonic nebulized system in inspiratory limb.</description>
