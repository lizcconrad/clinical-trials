    <textblock>
      This is a Phase III multi-center, double-masked, vehicle-controlled, randomized, parallel
      group study evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of EBI-005 as compared to
      vehicle given as a topical ophthalmic solution in each eye to subjects with moderate to
      severe allergic conjunctivitis (AC) three times daily for 4 weeks.

      Approximately 250 subjects at approximately 8 centers in the US will be screened and enrolled
      into the study.
