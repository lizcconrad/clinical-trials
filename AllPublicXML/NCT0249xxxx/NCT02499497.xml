  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying the use of a targeted therapy called LY SARM, which is an
      investigational drug from a new class of molecules called Selective Androgen Receptor
      Modulators (SARMs) as a possible improvement in quality of life for participants who have
      undergone radical prostatectomy. Androgens are a group of hormones that play a role in male
      traits and reproductive activity.

      The names of the study interventions involved in this study are:

      - LY2452473

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being
      studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved LY SARM/LY2452473 as a
      treatment for any disease.

      In this research study, the investigators are studying a new investigational drug called LY
      SARM (LY2452473). Concerns about the potential adverse effects of testosterone on the
      prostate have led to the development of molecules called SARMs (Selective Androgen Receptor
      Modulators). This investigational drug may improve sexual function, quality of life, muscle
      and bone mass in men with prostate cancer. This molecule was chosen because there is some
      evidence that shows it may help to improve sexual function and aid in the improvement of
      muscle mass while not having any influence on the prostate.
