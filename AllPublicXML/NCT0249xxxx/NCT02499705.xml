  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of dietary exposure to artificial
      sweeteners on taste sensitivity, preference and brain response in adolescents using fMRI,
      psychophysical measures, and questionnaires. The investigators hypothesize that dietary
      exposure to artificial sweeteners (sucralose) will decrease sensitivity to taste, shift
      preference of sweet and savory taste to a higher dose, and reduce brain response in amygdala
      to sweet taste compared to sucrose.

      We aim to identify neural factors that contribute to taste intensity perception in humans and
      to determine environmental mechanisms that contribute to variation in taste sensitivity.
      Significant controversy surrounds the possibility that consumption of artificial sweeteners
      (AFS) leads to weight gain. Given that the five FDA approved AFSs are found in thousands of
      foods (Yang 2010) this marks a clear and significant gap in knowledge. Our preliminary data
      demonstrate a 3-fold decrease in sweet taste sensitivity following consumption of a beverage
      sweetened with two packets of Splenda for just 10 days. These data provide strong evidence
      that repeated exposure to sucralose reduces perception of sweet taste intensity, most likely
      by down-regulation of the sweet taste receptor. Adolescents may be more sensitive to exposure
      to AFS because of changes in metabolism during this period of development. Physiologic
      insulin resistance occurs during adolescence (Moran, Jacobs et al. 1999); this change in
      insulin sensitivity may predispose adolescents to greater impairments in sweet taste
      intensity by altering the relationship between sweet taste and post-ingestive reward, as
      suggested by the Davidson and Swithers model (Davidson and Swithers 2004). Therefore, it is
      imperative that we gain a greater understanding of the physiological consequences of AFS use
      in adolescents, since alterations in sweet taste perception, metabolism and brain reward that
      occur in response to AFS exposure may promote weight gain.

    <description>At baseline and after on average 2 weeks, subjects will rate intensity of sucrose, sucralose, mono potassium glutamate, sodium chloride and citric acid using the General Labeled Magnitude Scale (gLMS). It is a vertical line with quasi-logarithmic spaced labels that start at the bottom with 'barely detectable' to 'strongest imaginable' at the top, recoded to 0-100.</description>
