    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of ceftazidime and avibactam
      (CAZ-AVI )versus cefepime in children from 3 months to less than 18 years old with
      complicated urinary tract infections.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a single-blind, randomised, multi-centre, active controlled trial.
      Patients aged from 3 months to less than 18 years with complicated urinary tract infections
      (cUTIs) will be randomised to 1 of 2 treatment groups (3:1 ratio): Ceftazidime and avibactam
      (CAZ AVI )or cefepime. Randomisation will be stratified by age cohort.

      Patients will receive intravenous (IV) treatment for a minimum of 72 hours (3 full days, ie,
      9 doses if given 3 times daily, or 6 doses if given twice daily) before having the option to
      switch to an oral therapy . The decision to switch to oral therapy is entirely at the
      Investigator's discretion, if the patient has good or sufficient clinical response, and the
      patient is tolerating oral fluids or food.

      Patients will be assessed for safety and efficacy throughout the study, and blood samples
      will be taken for pharmacokinetic assessment. The duration of each patient's participation in
      the study will be a minimum of 27 days to a maximum of 50 days after start of study treatment
      including (intravenous treatment or oral switch therapy) 7 to 14 days of active treatment.
      The late follow-up visit (LFU) is to be performed 20 to 36 days after the last dose of any
      treatment.

      The assessments at the test of cure (TOC) visit should be performed in person 8 to 15 days
      after last dose of any study drug Maximum duration of study drug or oral switch therapy is up
      to Day 14.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Must be ≥3 calendar months to &lt;18 years of age. Patients aged ≥3 calendar months to &lt;1
             year must have been born at term (defined as gestational age ≥37 weeks).

          2. Written informed consent from parent(s) or other legally acceptable representative(s),
             and informed assent from patient (if age appropriate according to local regulations)

          3. If female and has reached menarche, or has reached Tanner stage 3 development (even if
             not having reached menarche) (refer to Appendix E for further details on Tanner
             staging), the patient is authorised to participate in this clinical study if the
             following criteria are met:

             At screening:

             (i) (a) Patient reports sexual abstinence for the prior 3 months or reports use of at
             least 1 of the acceptable methods of contraception, including an intrauterine device
             (with copper banded coil), levonorgestrel intrauterine system (eg, Mirena®), or
             regular medroxyprogesterone injections (Depo-Provera®); or (b) Patient agrees to
             initiate sexual abstinence from the time of screening until 7 days after end of
             treatment with study drug; and (ii) Patient is advised to avoid conception from the
             time of screening until 7 days after receipt of study drug and agrees not to attempt
             pregnancy from the time of screening until 7 days after end of treatment with study
             drug; and (iii) Patient is provided guidelines regarding continuation of abstinence,
             initiation of abstinence, or about allowed contraception; and (iv) Patient has a
             negative serum β-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) test just prior to study entry.
             Since serum tests may miss an early pregnancy, relevant menstrual history and sexual
             history, including methods of contraception, should be considered. Note: if the result
             of the serum β-hCG test cannot be obtained prior to dosing of investigational product,
             a patient may be enrolled on the basis of a negative urine pregnancy test, though a
             serum β-hCG test result must still be obtained.

          4. Patient has a clinically suspected and/or bacteriologically documented cUTI or acute
             pyelonephritis judged by the Investigator to be serious and requires the patient to be
             hospitalised for treatment with intravenous (IV) therapy

          5. Patient has pyuria:

             Cohorts 1 to 3 as determined by a midstream clean catch or clean urethral
             catheterisation urine specimen with ≥10 white blood cells (WBCs) per high power field
             on standard examination of urine sediment or ≥10 WBCs/mm3 in unspun urine Cohort 4a
             and 4b as determined by a midstream clean catch or clean urethral catheterisation
             urine specimen or urine specimen obtained using urine collection pads(or supra-pubic
             collection if standard procedure in the assigned sites) ≥5 WBCs per high-power field
             on standard examination of urine sediment or ≥5 WBCs/mm3 in unspun urine

          6. Patient has a positive urine culture: 1 midstream clean catch or clean urethral
             catheterisation urine specimen taken within 48 hours of randomisation containing ≥105
             colony-forming units (CFU)/mL of a recognised uropathogen known to be susceptible to
             the IV study therapy (CAZ-AVI and cefepime) Note: If patients meet all of entry
             criteria except for positive urine culture as outlined above, the patients may be
             enrolled before urine culture results are available if the results are likely (based
             on urinalysis and clinical findings) to be positive and study drugs are considered
             appropriate empiric therapy. If a patient urine culture is negative after 24 or 48
             hours of treatment but the patient is improving, the Investigator can keep the patient
             on treatment. If the urine culture is negative and the patient is not improving, study
             treatment will be stopped, and the patient will be followed for the rest of the study
             including undergoing all safety assessments until late follow up (LFU).

          7. Demonstrates either acute pyelonephritis or complicated lower UTI as defined by the
             following criteria:

               1. Qualifying criteria: patients must have at least 1 of the following
                  signs/symptoms (signs/symptoms must have onset or have worsened within 7 days of

The infusion was administered to participants every 8 hours for a minimum of 72 hours and up to a maximum duration of 14 days. Dose of CAZ-AVI was reduced to 50 percent if CrCl of participant drops below to 50mL/min, and participant was removed from study therapy, if CrCl drops below 30mL/min. After having 72 hours of IV treatment, participants had option to switch to an oral therapy at investigator's discretion.</description>

An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged in-patient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent AEs were events between first dose of study drug and up to late follow-up (LFU) visit (20 to 36 days after last dose of study treatment [IV or oral]) that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. AEs included both SAE and non-SAE.</description>

        <description>CrCl is a measure of glomerular filtration rate (GMFR), an index of kidney function. It is the volume of blood plasma that is cleared of creatinine by the kidneys per unit time. Percentage of participants with CrCl in the following categories were reported: &lt;30 mL/min/1.73 m^2, &gt;=30 to &lt;50 mL/min/1.73 m^2, &gt;=50 mL/min/1.73 m^2 to &lt;80 mL/min/1.73 m^2, and &gt;=80 mL/min/1.73 m^2.</description>

The infusion was administered to participants every 8 hours for a minimum of 72 hours and up to a maximum duration of 14 days. Dose of CAZ-AVI was reduced to 50 percent if CrCl of participant drops below to 50mL/min, and participant was removed from study therapy, if CrCl drops below 30mL/min. After having 72 hours of IV treatment, participants had option to switch to an oral therapy at investigator's discretion.</description>

        <description>Favourable clinical response was defined as a CR of improvement and cure. Cure was defined as resolution of all acute signs and symptoms of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs) or improvement to such an extent that no further antimicrobial therapy was required. Clinical Improvement included all the participants who had switched to oral therapy and had meet the following criterion: afebrile (temperature &lt;=38.0°C) for at least 24 hours, absence of new and improvement in at least 1 symptom or sign (fever, pain, tenderness, elevated WBCs, elevated c-reactive-protein) from baseline and worsening of none. EOIV visit occurred within 24 hours after completion of last infusion of the study drug.</description>

The infusion was administered to participants every 8 hours for a minimum of 72 hours and up to a maximum duration of 14 days. Dose of CAZ-AVI was reduced to 50 percent if CrCl of participant drops below to 50mL/min, and participant was removed from study therapy, if CrCl drops below 30mL/min. After having 72 hours of IV treatment, participants had option to switch to an oral therapy at investigator's discretion.</description>
