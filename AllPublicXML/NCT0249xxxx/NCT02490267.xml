  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The management of childhood glaucoma (CG), childhood cataract (CC) and other birth defects
      affecting the eyes requires frequent hospital attendances and often multiple surgical and
      medical interventions, and are often associated with poor vision. Chronic medical conditions
      and vision impairment can affect quality of life (QoL). The QoL of children with the above
      conditions has not previously been evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We wish to evaluate health related and vision related quality of life (HRQoL, VRQoL) in
      children age 2 to 16 years with childhood glaucoma (CG), childhood cataract (CC) and
      congenital eye defects microphthalmia, anophthalmia or coloboma (MAC).

      We will recruit children who attend the children's eye clinics at Moorfields Eye Hospital at
      City Road. We will include the following subgroups:

      A) children with primary or secondary glaucoma B) children with cataract or previously
      treated for cataract C) children with microphthalmia, anophthalmia or coloboma D) control
      group: agematched children without eye and vision problems. We will ask children and their
      carers to complete two age appropriate, validated questionnaires, the PedsQL (health related
      quality of life) and the Cardiff Visual Ability Questionnaire for Children. From the medical
      notes, we will record diagnosis and best corrected visual acuity with both eyes open. We will
      also record details of previous and current treatment, such as number of previous surgical
      interventions (sum of interventions right and left eye) and number of current topical
      medications (sum of eyedrop applications per day right and left eye).

        We will recruit children who attend the children's eye clinics at Moorfields Eye Hospital
        at City Road. We will recruit children with healthy eyes and normal vision amongst the
        siblings who accompany new patients in Child Vision Clinics and the paediatric A&amp;E. This
        approach will ensure that families have not previously been burdened with frequent hospital
        appointments.
