  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 50% of postmenopausal women frequently suffer from atrophic vaginitis or vaginal
      atrophy with symptoms including vaginal dryness, irritation, burning, itching or discomfort.
      Vaginal atrophy is a consequence of the lining tissue of the vagina becoming thinner, drier,
      and less elastic due to lack of estrogen. In addition, vaginal atrophy is associated with an
      increased pH, which creates an environment more susceptible to infections.

      Menopausal hormone therapy is a common treatment for vaginal atrophy. However, menopausal
      hormone therapy has been shown to coincide with an increased incidence of breast cancer,
      heart attack and stroke. Some women experience adverse reactions such as uterine bleeding,
      perineal pain, and breast pain with menopausal hormone therapy. Many women are also reluctant
      to initiate estrogen treatment, due to a general negative view of menopausal hormone therapy
      in the society. There are also many contraindicated conditions like undiagnosed vaginal
      bleeding, thromboembolic disease, breast cancer, other estrogen-sensitive cancers, or liver
      disease. Women suffering from vaginal atrophy and presenting with these conditions have
      extremely limited options for effective therapy.

      Oxytocin is a peptide hormone, normally released into the circulation via the pituitary.
      Oxytocin has been shown in vitro to exert positive effects on the proliferation of human
      vaginal mucosal cells from postmenopausal women. Local application of oxytocin, in the form
      of a vaginal gel, Vagitocin, has been investigated in previous studies on postmenopausal
      women, as a new effective and safe option for the treatment of vaginal atrophy. Vagitocin
      appeared to reverse the manifestation of vaginal atrophy by stimulating vaginal mucosal
      growth, reducing symptoms of vaginal atrophy and increasing the patients' wellbeing and
      quality of life. Overall, treatment with Vagitocin was safe and well tolerated by the
      subjects in the studies.

      In this study, the clinical efficacy of Vagitocin as a potential treatment for postmenopausal
      women suffering from moderate to severe symptoms of vaginal atrophy, vaginal
      irritation/itching and vaginal discomfort and/or pain associated with sexual activity will be
      explored. In addition, the dose relationship and lowest effective dose of Vagitocin will be
      investigated.
