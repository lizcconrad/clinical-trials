      The purpose of this study is to investigate how healthy youth and adults' cortisol levels and
      other hormone levels relate to anxiety levels while they participate in a behavioral task
      called the Trier Social Stress Task.

      Data from these healthy participants will also be compared to those of anxious youth and
      adults collected as part of the in the Principal Investigator's ongoing study titled,
      &quot;Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Extended Long-term Study (NA00035687).&quot;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the independent and interactive associations linking
      salivary cortisol (a marker of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activity or HPA activity) and
      alpha amylase (a marker of autonomic nervous system activity or ANS activity) in a sample of
      healthy controls. Data from these healthy controls will be compared in the future to
      clinically anxious youth. In this study, participants are asked to complete a one-time
      assessment consisting of interviews, questionnaires, and a behavioral task (called the Trier
      Social Stress Task) involving a short public speaking task and an arithmetic task in front of
      study staff. Throughout the behavioral task, study staff will collect four, small saliva
      samples using a straw-like tube from each participant. The assessment will take approximately
      3 hours. Participants will be fully debriefed regarding the purposes of the stress procedure
      and assessed for any signs of residual distress. Since there is no treatment or
      randomization, blinding of study staff is not applicable. Participation in this study will
      not affect any current or future medical or psychiatric treatment.

      AIMS: To examine whether a) salivary cortisol and alpha amylase response and recovery to the
      Trier Social Stress Task is associated with anxiety in non-psychiatrically ill participants.

    <measure>Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Psychological Disorders-IV, Child and Parent Versions (C/P-ADIS), and Adult Versions (Client-ADIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The C/P and Client-ADIS' are semi-structured diagnostic interviews used to assess symptoms of anxiety, depression, and behavioral issues.
This interview will be administered by a trained staff member and will utilize information from both parents and children (if child is under 18 years of age) or from the adult participant (if the participant is 18 years of age or older).
This interview will be used to determine the presence or absence of an anxiety disorder for participants in this study.
The ADIS is administered one time because each participant only completes a single study visit.</description>
