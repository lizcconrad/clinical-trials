    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate effects of interdisciplinary group based patient
      education in patients with low back pain.

      The patients will be recruited to four group based patient education lessons during a two
      months period. The study is a randomized controlled trial and the patients will be randomized
      to standard treatment or standard treatment and patient education. The patient education will
      be led by physiotherapists, nurses and physicians. The outcomes are functions, pain, quality
      of life, self-efficacy, and depression. The data are reported in questionnaires.

      Design: Randomized controlled trial; intervention study. Patients: Patients with low back
      pain; referred to Nordsjaellands Hospital, Denmark. Inclusion criteria: adults, low back pain
      minimum scored 4 on numeric rating scale, able to conduct exercise training. Exclusion
      criteria: unable to understand Danish, psychiatric disorder, dementia, approaching operation,
      current or approaching settlement regarding working ability or compensation as a result of
      low back pain. Intervention: Randomization to usual care or usual care and four times two
      hours group based patient education with an interdisciplinary focus on self-management of low
      back pain. The patient education will be delivered by physiotherapists, nurses and
      physicians. Outcome: functions, pain, quality of life, self-efficacy, and depression. The
      data are reported in questionnaires. Sample size: 74 participants.
