      This is a clinical research study to see if switching to Darunavir/Cobicistat ((PREZCOBIX™,
      DRV/COBI ) and Dolutegrivir (Tivicay®, DTG) in HIV-infected individuals with undetectable HIV
      viral load on nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)-containing therapy will be
      effective in maintaining virologic suppression at 48 weeks of treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NRTIs have been a stalwart for treatment in both the pre- and post-ART eras. However, NRTIs
      have numerous toxicities partly due to the fact that they are analogs of naturally occurring
      nucleotides and interfere with the activity of numerous cellular functions. In highly
      treatment-experienced individuals with more than two active drugs in their salvage regimens,
      an NRTI-sparing regimen has been shown to be non-inferior to an NRTI-containing regimen [33].
      However, studies with NRTI-sparing regimens not consisting of more than two active
      medications have generally been disappointing.

      One limitation of earlier NRTI-sparing regimens has been a higher pill burden than more
      standard regimens. However, the approvals of DTG and the co-formulated DRV/COBI, both with
      well-established antiviral activities, may allow for a compact, effective, NRTI-sparing
      regimen. A switch to DTG/DRV/COBI in virologically suppressed HIV-infected individuals has
      the potential to avoid NRTI-associated toxicity while maintaining virologic suppression.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        1. HIV-1 infection, as documented by any licensed ELISA test kit and confirmed by Western
        blot at any time prior to study entry. A second antibody test by a method other than ELISA
        is acceptable as an alternative confirmatory test or a previous detectable HIV RNA level.

        2 .Age ≥ 18 years

        3. HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/mL while on a stable antiretroviral regimen for at least 6 months
        prior to study entry excluding blips (i.e., a single measurement &lt;200 copies/mL preceded
        and followed by measurements &lt;50 copies/mL)

        4. At screening, patient on a stable antiretroviral regimen containing at least one NRTI
        and a PI, NNRTI, or INSTI

        5. No changes in antiretroviral regimen in the six months prior to screening (except for a
        switch to a coformulated tablet from the component tablets)

        6. A desire to switch off current antiretroviral therapy due to: a) Renal dysfunction
        (microalbuminuria/proteinuria or CrCl&lt;70 mL/min/1.73 m2) on tenofovir disoproxil fumarate
        (TDF) of tenofovir al; b) Osteopenia or osteoporosis on a TDF-containing regimen (i.e.,
        lowest T-score ≥1.0 standard deviation below the young adult mean measured by dual-energy
        x-ray absorptiometry); c) Peripheral neuropathy or lipoatrophy at least partially
        attributable to ongoing NRTI use; d) Intermediate or high Framingham risk (i.e., ≥10%
        10-year risk) on an abacavir-containing regimen; e) Patient preference.

        7. Laboratory values within six months of screening visit

          -  Calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥45 mL/min as estimated by the Cockcroft-Gault
             equation:

        For men, (140 - age in years) x (body weight in kg) ÷ (serum creatinine in mg/dL x 72) =
        CrCl (mL/min)*

        *For women, multiply the result by 0.85 = CrCl (mL/min)

        8. For women of reproductive potential, negative serum or urine pregnancy test at screening
        and a negative urine pregnancy test at the entry visit prior to randomization and also
        agreeable to using a contraceptive of choice during the study period.

        &quot;Women of reproductive potential&quot; are defined as women who have not been post-menopausal
        for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., who have had menses within the preceding 24
        months) and have not undergone surgical sterilization (i.e., hysterectomy, bilateral
        oophorectomy, or tubal ligation)
