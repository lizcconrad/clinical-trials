      Comparative randomized, single dose, two-way crossover open-label study to determine the
      bioequivalence of Sofosbuvir from Heterosofir 400 mg F.C.T (Pharmed Healthcare Co., Egypt)
      versus Sovaldi 400 mg F.C.T (Gilead Sciences, Ireland) in Healthy Human Volunteers Under
      Fasting Condition.

      Primary Pharmacokinetic Parameters: Cmax, Area under cover (AUC0→t and AUC0→∞ ) Secondary
      Pharmacokinetic Parameters: Ke, tmax and t1/2e. ANOVA using 5% significance level for
      transformed (with the 90% confidence intervals) and untransformed data of Cmax, AUC0→t and
      AUC0→∞ and for untransformed data of Ke, tmax and t1/2e. The confidence intervals of
      logarithmically transformed Test/Reference ratios for Cmax, AUC0→t and AUC0→∞ to be within
      80.00-125.00%.

      A comprehensive final report will be issued upon the completion of the study.
