  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to define at the bedside the &quot;Titrated-PEEP&quot; level for
      obese patients that increases the likelihood of extubation and ventilator liberation.

      The investigators hypothesized that a titrated level of PEEP (&quot;Titrated-PEEP&quot;) during SBT
      will keep the lung recruited, maintain oxygenation, and decrease the work of breathing
      resulting in successful ventilator liberation. In addition, post-extubation the investigators
      hypothesize that these patients will require noninvasive ventilatory support in the form of
      CPAP at the level of &quot;titrated-PEEP&quot; used during the SBT.

    <textblock>
      The high WOB of morbidly obese patients is associated with respiratory muscle fatigue and
      failure in extubation. The investigators hypothesized that the use of a titrated PEEP level
      prior to and after extubation might improve successful extubation rates and avoid
      re-intubation.

      In this study, patients will be awake and ventilated in the pressure support ventilation
      (PSV) mode. The investigators will apply different PEEP levels to measure WOB, transpulmonary
      pressure and characterize the response of the respiratory system to increasing or decreasing
      PEEP. The &quot;Titrated-PEEP&quot; will be identified as the PEEP level associated with the lowest
      value of respiratory system elastance and an end expiratory transpulmonary pressure of 2
      cmH2O. Then the participants will have two spontaneous breathing trials; one at PEEP 0-5
      cmH2O, and the other at the &quot;Titrated-PEEP&quot; level, with PSV=0 and FiO2 unchanged. After
      extubation, the participants will first receive CPAP set at &quot;Titrated-PEEP&quot;, then spontaneous
      breathing. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT), respiratory system mechanics and gas
      exchange will be recorded during the study.

      The investigators believe that the real-time determination of &quot;Titrated-PEEP&quot; can guide the
      treatment of mechanical ventilation and give us a better understanding of the physiology and
      pathophysiology of morbidly obese patients. As a result, this study will improve patient
      safety; reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation, complications and healthcare costs.
