  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thoracic traumas are frequent causes of emergency department admissions and the third most
      common cause of death from trauma. Although emergency management of major thoracic traumas
      that have high mortality and morbidity were discussed and well-understood in detail in the
      literature, there are limited information regarding diagnosis, emergency management,
      treatment and follow-up after discharge of patients with minor blunt thoracic traumas.

      The investigators aimed to investigate demographic data, physical examination findings, and
      the relationship between lung injury, emergency department final diagnosis, hospitalization,
      discharge and re-admission rates, effects of prescribed analgesics on pain and re-admissions
      of patients with a pre-diagnosis of minor blunt thoracic trauma on first admission.
