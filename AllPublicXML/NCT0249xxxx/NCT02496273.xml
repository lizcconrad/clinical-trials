    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical safety and preliminary efficacy of CEA
      specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes induced by dendritic cells infected by recombinant
      adeno-associated virus with CEA gene in the treatment of stage IV gastric cancer patients.

    <textblock>
      Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) describes a set of highly related glycoproteins involved in
      cell adhesion.CEA is normally produced in gastrointestinal tissue during fetal development,
      but the production stops before birth. The serum levels are raised in some types of
      cancer,such as Gastric Cancer.The expression of CEA in these cancers and succedent
      unfavourable prognosis such as tumor hyperplasia, recurrence make CEA become the desirable
      therapeutic target.

      Cancer immunotherapy is the use of the immune system to treat cancer. Immunotherapies fall
      into three main groups: cellular, antibody and cytokine.Cellular therapies involve the
      removal of immune cells from the blood or from a tumor. Immune cells specific for the tumor
      are activated, cultured and returned to the patient where the immune cells attack the cancer.
      Cytotoxic T cells and dendritic cells can be used in cell-based immunotherapy.

      This study is for patients that have a stage Ⅳ gastric cancer with elevated serum CEA
      concentration. This research study uses special immune system cells called CEA-specific
      cytotoxic T lymphocytes , a new experimental therapy.

      Blood will be collected from the patient and the CEA-specific CTLs will be made.The cells
      will be injected by IV into the patient.The investigators will follow the patient from their
      last infusion,monitor side effects of immunotherapy and learn more about the way the T cells
      are working in the patient's body.The investigators will use blood samples to see how long
      the T cells last and to look at the immune response to the patient's response to cancer.

    <description>Mononuclear cells (Dendritic Cell,DC precursor) were isolated from the peripheral blood of gasric cancer by density gradient centrifugation and infected with rAAV/CEA virus.Maturation of the DC was induced by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-4 (IL-4) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha(TNF-alpha). On day 7, the DCs were collected and mixed with T cells at the ratio of 1 to 20 to induce cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL).The cells will be proliferated and infused by intravenous (IV) infusion into the patient.</description>
