    <textblock>
      Throat swabbing by two port germ Amines agar (copan) swabs,then the swabs were randomly
      labeled as swab A and swab B.Swab A was processed for rapid streptococcal test and swab B was
      processed for culture in Colombia blood agar.All patients were followed up after 48-72 hours
      with the final culture results that ultimately determined the need to continue or discontinue
      treatment.
