    <textblock>
      Using a cluster randomized controlled design, this study will evaluate effects of in-store
      healthy food marketing strategies on sales and purchase of specific healthier items in six
      product categories (milk, frozen entrees, beverage checkout coolers, salty snacks, bread and
      cheese); and examine the effects of changes in in-store food marketing environments on sales
      of healthier foods. If these strategies are found to be effective, they could be used widely
      to encourage healthy retail sales, complement food access initiatives, and reduce health
      disparities in obesity and other diseases. Supermarkets will be the unit of randomization,
      intervention, and analysis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As the prevalence of obesity has increased, public health experts have increasingly focused
      on the environments that shape overeating and unhealthy food choices. Retail grocery stores
      are pivotally positioned to influence choices and favorably affect energy balance. Greater
      availability of healthier foods, if translated to health-promoting purchases, can positively
      affect diet quality among those at greatest risk for obesityâ€” low-income, ethnic minorities.

      The aims of the proposed study are:

        1. To evaluate, in a cluster randomized controlled trial design, effects of in-store
           healthy food marketing strategies on sales and purchase of healthier items in six
           product categories (milk, frozen entrees, beverage checkout coolers, bread, salty snacks
           and cheese); and

        2. To evaluate the association of changes in supermarket food marketing environments with
           changes in sales of specific healthier food items in the same six product categories;
           and

        3. To examine the relationships between neighborhood characteristics and changes in sales
           and purchases of healthier items in the six product categories.

      Investigators hypothesize that sales of targeted products will be significantly higher, and
      that more health-focused food marketing environments will be associated with higher sales of
      healthy food items.

      The study will be conducted in 32 supermarkets in urban, low-income, high-minority
      neighbor-hoods in the mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions. Intervention strategies will
      include prime placement, increased visibility of healthier products, call-out signs, and
      taste-testing for milk. Control stores will be assessment-only. Supermarket chains will help
      implement the strategies and provide data on sales of targeted products. Interventions will
      be conducted for 2 years, with an emphasis on scalability and long-term sustainability. The
      primary outcome measures of purchasing will be weekly sales per store for each product.
      Individual purchasing will be assessed in a cohort of shoppers by interviews and shopping
      receipts. The Grocery Marketing Environment Assessment (GMEA) tool will be used to assess
      marketing environments.

      The research team completed a randomized pilot study of a 6-month intervention in eight
      supermarkets, which demonstrated the impact of the interventions on three food categories.
      The proposed study will provide an expanded and extended, larger-scale, rigorous test of
      novel and widely applicable strategies to encourage healthy retail sales, complement
      increased-access initiatives, and reduce health disparities in obesity and related diseases.

    <description>Supermarkets will be the unit of randomization, intervention, and analysis. During randomization, stores are paired by size and percent sales of Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) funding. The intervention will last for 2 years, and will consist of in-store marketing of healthier (lower calorie) products through placement and promotion strategies in 6 food and beverage categories: milk; frozen meals; beverages in checkout coolers; bread; salty snacks; and cheese.</description>

    <description>In-store marketing strategies will focus on placement and promotion of healthier items (lower calorie options) in the milk, frozen food, beverage checkout cooler, bread, salty snacks, and cheese sections of the store.
Intervention efforts in the dairy section promote lower calorie milk (skim, 1%, and 2%), while diminishing the presence of whole milk. The visual order of the milk displays will be changed, and the number of facings, or the fronts of packages the consumer can see, of whole milk will be decreased by 30% while increasing the facings of the lower calorie milk. In the other product categories, target products will be moved to eye level and the number of facings will be increased.
Call-out signs will be placed by the target products that list the name and price of the product. No health information or claims will be included. Signage will be rotated monthly to increase the chances that customers will notice them.</description>
