  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In contrast with bisphosphonates,discontinuation of denosumab results in gradual loss of bone
      mineral density gains. The investigators aim to evaluate whether in patients treated with
      denosumab, a single zoledronic acid infusion would prevent the anticipated bone loss.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Discontinuation of denosumab results in a rebound rise of bone turnover markers and gradual
      loss of the achieved bone mineral density gains. In contrast, bisphosphonates, such as
      zoledronic acid, remain within the skeleton acting for several months or even years after
      discontinuation while maintaining bone mineral density despite the cessation of treatment. In
      this study, the investigators aim to evaluate changes in bone mineral density of the lumbar
      spine and the femoral neck, as well as in bone turnover markers one year after treatment
      discontinuation both in denosumab-treated women and in denosumab-treated women who switched
      to zoledronic acid infusion one year before treatment discontinuation.
