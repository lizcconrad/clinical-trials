  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to test whether daily ischemic conditioning of the arms over 30 days could
      reduce the frequency and severity of angina pectoris and improve the life quality of
      refractory angina pectoris patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Refractory angina pectoris denotes &quot;chronic stable angina that persists despite optimal
      medication and when revascularisation is unfeasible or where the risks are unjustified&quot;.
      These patients could potentially be relieved by non-conventional treatments like remote
      ischemic conditioning, and actually this effect has been observed in several cases in the
      center of the sponsor. This study is a pilot study to measure the efficacy and safety of this
      method in this group of patients.
