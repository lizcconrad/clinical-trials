      Background:

      - There are no established treatments for people with certain advanced kidney cancers. These
      tumors often don t respond well to currently available treatments. Researchers believe that
      two drugs that treat other diseases metformin and vandetanib could help people with advanced
      kidney cancer.

      Objective:

      - To test the combination of metformin and vandetanib in people with advanced kidney cancer.
      Phase I of the study will determine a safe dose for the drugs. Phase II will test this dose
      in people with certain kidney cancers.

      Eligibility:

        -  For Phase I, people 18 and over with advanced kidney cancer

        -  For Phase II, people 18 and over with advanced hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell
           cancer (HLRCC), succinate dehydrogenase renal cell carcinoma (SDH-RCC), or advanced
           papillary renal cell carcinoma not related to a hereditary syndrome

      Design:

        -  The study will last many months.

        -  Participants will be screened with medical history and physical exam.

        -  Participants will take the study drugs by mouth every day.

        -  Participants will measure and record their blood pressure every day.

        -  Participants will have many tests:

        -  Blood and urine tests

        -  MRI, CT, PET scan, and other imaging tests: they will lie in machines that take pictures
           of their body.

        -  ECG: soft electrodes will be stuck to the skin. A machine will record the heart s
           signals.

        -  Bone scan

        -  Some participants may have a gynecology evaluation or photos of skin tumors taken.

        -  Participants will have an optional tumor biopsy.

        -  After they stop taking the drugs, participants may have medical history, physical exam,
           and blood tests. They will be contacted once a year by phone to find out how they are
           doing.

      BACKGROUND:

        -  The management of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) continues to remain a challenge,
           particularly for patients with papillary and non-clear cell variants of RCC, for whom
           there is no standard therapy of proven benefit.

        -  Inactivation of the Krebs cycle enzyme Fumarate Hydratase (FH) in tumors associated with
           hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC) results in a metabolic shift
           characterized by a) reliance on aerobic glycolysis for energy production, b)
           upregulation of HIF 1- and its downstream targets that promote glucose delivery and
           uptake to fuel aerobic glycolysis, and c) downregulation of AMPK, resulting in
           activation of the mTOR pathway and increased macromolecule synthesis.

        -  Inactivation of another Krebs cycle enzyme, Succinate Dehydrogenase (SDH), is also
           associated with a familial form of kidney cancer which shares some of the above
           metabolic features.

        -  Vandetanib is a dual VEGFR/EGFR inhibitor that reverses the metabolic phenotype
           associated with FH (and SDH) inactivation and has potent preclinical activity in FH-/-
           and SDH -/- tumors. Metformin activates AMPK and has demonstrated potent synergy when
           combined with vandetanib, in preclinical models of FH -/- tumors.

        -  In this phase 1/2 trial, we first propose to establish the safety and dosing parameters
           of combined vandetanib and metformin therapy. We then propose to test the activity of
           vandetanib in combination with metformin in patients with HLRCC or SDH-associated RCC,
           as well as those with sporadic forms of papillary RCC.

      OBJECTIVE:

      Phase I Component:

      -Establish the safety and maximum tolerated dose of the combination of vandetanib with
      metformin in patients with advanced RCC.

      Phase II Component:

      -Determine the overall response rate (RECIST 1.1) following treatment with combine
      vandetanib/metformin in patients with 1) advanced RCC associated with hereditary
      leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC) or succinate dehydrogenase renal cell
      carcinoma (SDH-RCC), and 2) advanced sporadic papillary renal cell carcinoma.

      ELIGIBILITY:

      Phase I Component:

        -  Diagnosis of advanced RCC

        -  Patients with clear cell RCC must have either declined, be unable to receive, progressed
           on, or be intolerant of high-dose IL-2 or established first and second line VEGF and/or
           mTOR targeted agents

        -  No prior therapy is required in patients with non-clear cell RCC, but prior therapy is
           allowed

      Phase II Component:

        -  Diagnosis of advanced RCC associated with HLRCC or SDH-RCC (cohort 1) or
           sporadic/non-HLRCC papillary RCC (cohort 2)

        -  No more than 2 prior regimens with VEGF-pathway antagonists

      General requirements for both Phase I and II:

        -  Age greater than or equal to18

        -  Brain metastases or spinal cord compression that requires treatment, unless the
           treatment ended at least 4 weeks before starting protocol therapy and the condition has
           been stable without steroid treatment for at least 10 days

        -  No major surgery within four weeks or inadequately healed wounds prior to study
           enrollment

        -  Adequate organ function

      DESIGN:

      Phase I Component:

        -  Combination vandetanib and metformin will be administered at starting doses of 300 mg QD
           and 250 mg BID, respectively.

        -  The study design is based on a single arm, fixed order dose-escalation Phase 1 study
           using a modified Fibronacci schema.

        -  Up to 6 patients may be enrolled in a specific dose combination cohort. Based on the
           assumption that 3 dose levels will be evaluated, the total number of evaluable patients
           will be 18. To allow for a few patients who may be inevaluable, the accrual ceiling for
           this portion of the study will be set at 21. Based on how dose escalation proceeds and
           the adverse events seen, the total number of patients to be accrued may be changed via a
           protocol amendment.

      Phase II Component:

        -  Once the MTD is determined, the appropriate combination dose will be evaluated in the
           phase 2 component.

        -  Patients will be accrued into one of two independent, parallel cohorts:

             -  Cohort 1 Patients with advanced HLRCC or SDH associated RCC.

             -  Cohort 2 Patients with advanced sporadic/non-HLRCC papillary kidney cancer.

        -  Patients will be evaluated for response every 8-12 weeks using RECIST 1.1.

        -  The study is based on open label two-stage optimal phase II design.

        -  The accrual ceiling for this portion of the study will be 21 patients for each cohort.

              12. Previous or current invasive malignancies of other histologies requiring
                  treatment within the last 2 years, with the exception of adequately treated basal

             least 24 hours apart] for a total of 3 ECGs. The average QTcF from the three

             screening ECGs must be less than or equal to 450 ms in order for the patient to be
