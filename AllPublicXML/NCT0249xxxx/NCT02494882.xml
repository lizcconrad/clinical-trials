  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of a new combination of three oral drugs in
      Ph+ ALL. These drugs are dexamethasone, dasatinib, and ruxolitinib. All three drugs have been
      studied before in humans.

      This is a phase I study in which ruxolitinib dose will start low for the first patient
      together with dexamethasone plus dasatinib. If this dose does not cause a bad side effect,
      the ruxolitinib dose will slowly be made higher as new patients take part in the study. This
      will help the investigators find the right dose of ruxolitinib to give together with
      dexamethasone and dasatinib that will be used in future studies
