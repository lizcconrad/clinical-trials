  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early prognosis of cardiac arrest - nearly 40000 new cases per year in France - has been
      extensively studied, highlighting a poor outcome (less than 8% at hospital discharge).
      However, little is known on mid and long-term prognostic factors and how these patients do
      survive from the event.

      Using a regional cohort, the aim of the study is to describe long-term survival rate of
      cardiac arrest survivors, and to assess the influence of treatment strategies on survival and
      functional outcome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The collection of clinical and biological data of patients who experienced cardiac arrest and
      survive from hospital, including a regular follow-up with qualitative data (functional,
      neurological and quality of life) may provide important benchmark on the evolution of these
      patients and on the impact of acute interventions (such as cardio-pulmonary resuscitation,
      defibrillation, emergent coronary revascularization, neuroprotective treatments).

      Using a large identified cohort of survivors of cardiac arrest, we aim to describe the
      qualitative long-term prognosis of these cardiac arrest patients (functional, neurological
      and quality of life status). Secondarily, we intend to identify the long-term prognostic
      factors, and particularly the role of early interventions, using a long-term and qualitative
      combined endpoint (vital status, functional scales, SF36).

      This project is observational and will include all patients over 18 admitted alive after
      non-traumatic cardiac arrest in the area of Ile-de-France (France), whatever the cause of the
      cardiac arrest. Patients or their proxies, refusing their participation, will not be
      included.

      We will collect all pre- and in-hospital information related to the event and performs
      prospectively interviews at 3 months and every year anniversary. The questionnaire will
      include vital status, cardiovascular events, medication and a complete qualitative report
      (SF36, ADL scale, OPC, CPC, social-professional activities).

      This project will provide important data over time on the evolution of these patients.
      Findings will help in measuring the role of different strategies on long-term prognosis and
      consequently improve the overall management of cardiac arrest.
