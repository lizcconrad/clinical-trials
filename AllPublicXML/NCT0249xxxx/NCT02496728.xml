    <textblock>
      Freshman college students at Northwestern University will be cluster randomized to two groups
      based on their dorm. The intervention for one group will target smoking, physical activity,
      BMI and consumption of fruits and vegetables. The intervention in the second group will
      target traveling behavior, sexual risk behaviors, sunscreen use and hydration. Baseline
      health and lifestyle measures will be assessed for each participant prior to intervention.
      Health assessments will measure height, weight, fasting glucose, total cholesterol and carbon
      monoxide. The lifestyle measure will ask questions about physical activity, diet, alcohol and
      tobacco use, safe sex practices, driving habits, and sunscreen use. These same measures will
      be repeated during the fall of the students' sophomore and junior years.

      Participants will be given a mobile application and encouraged to track some behaviors. In
      addition, participants will be asked to answer weekly questions regarding health behaviors.

    <description>Participant's Simple 7 score is the sum of 7 cardiovascular health metrics attained at ideal levels as defined by American Heart Association. 1) physically active - Exercising at least 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity per week. 2) Good diet quality - Eating 5 servings of fruits and vegetables per day, at least 3 servings of whole grain, and no more than 16 oz. of soda per day, rarely or never eats high sodium foods or processed meats. 3) nonsmoking - nonsmoker for at least a year. 4) not overweight - BMI &lt; 25 kg/m2. 5) normoglycemic - fasting glucose &lt; 100 mg/dl. 6) not hypercholesterolemic : total Cholesterol &lt; 200 mg/dl. 7) not hypertensive. Blood Pressure &lt;120/&lt;80.</description>

    <description>Participants will be given the results of their health assessment and feedback regarding their health behaviors and overall health. Recommendations for change will be given if warranted. Participants will download the study's mobile health application on their smartphone. They will then be asked to report once a week about their health behaviors on the application. Participants will also be asked to self-monitor health behaviors that are not already at ideal levels using the study application (environmental cues). Participants will be asked to join a secret Facebook group where informational materials will be posted, participants can post about study health behaviors and social interaction around health behaviors can occur (social support and environmental cues).</description>
