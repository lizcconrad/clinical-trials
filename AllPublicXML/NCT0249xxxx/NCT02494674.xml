  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 1-month study that will examine the use of podcasting and a wearable wrist-worn
      device to track calorie intake and promote weight loss. A podcast is a digital audio file
      that can be listened to on portable media players, like iPods, and personal computers. This
      study will run from July 14, 2015 to August 11, 2015. In this study, you will receive weight
      loss information delivered via twice weekly podcasts. You will also track each meal you eat
      by wearing a provided watch-like device.

      This study will last approximately 1 month (about 4 weeks). Participants will need to attend
      one 1.5-hour orientation meeting, baseline assessment, and training meeting, and then weekly
      1-hour meetings for four weeks (5 meetings total). Participants will listen to 2 podcasts per
      week and will be encouraged to monitor exercise and body weight and track each meal using the
      provided wearable, wrist worn device. Each of the podcasts will take about 15 - 20 minutes to
      listen to and so participants should expect to spend 30 - 40 minutes each week listening to
      podcasts and up to 3 hours completing other study-related activities each week—including
      attending the weekly meetings—for a total of about 4 hours per week.
