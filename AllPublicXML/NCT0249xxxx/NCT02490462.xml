    <textblock>
      The Physical Therapy for children with Cerebral Palsy is of great complexity, in addition to
      improving the neuromotor components at the level of structure and body function, must empower
      them to carry out their activities and daily tasks and enable their social participation. In
      this way, the goals of Physical Therapy are related to promote the independence and
      functionality of the individual in situations of daily life. The participation of caregivers
      in the rehabilitation process can contribute to potentiate the gains obtained by physical
      therapy as well as to which they are incorporated into the day to day management of children
      with cerebral palsy. Objective: To assess whether Physical Therapy associated with the
      education of caregivers is effective in improving the functioning and quality of life of
      children with cerebral palsy. Hypothesis: The combination of Physical therapy with the
      education of caregivers improves in 15% the parameters analyzed against only 10% in those who
      are only Physical Therapy. Methods: 60 children with cerebral palsy after acceptance and
      signature in the term of informed consent will be randomly divided into 2 groups (G1:
      Physiotherapy and education of caregivers and G2: only Physical Therapy) to do 3 sessions of
      Physical Therapy and 1 weekly session of group education with duration of 45 min during 12
      consecutive weeks. The evaluation will be carried out by means of the System of
      Classification of Motor Function Gross (GMFCS), the evaluation of Motor Function through the
      scale GMFM-88 (Gross Motor Function Measure - 88 ) and the Activity and Participation will be
      evaluated by the Inventory of Evaluation of Pediatric Disability (PEDI). The analysis of the
      results will be carried out using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS)
      using descriptive statistics for social and demographic characteristics and inferential for
      normality of data (test Kolmogorov-Smirnov ), mean comparison test to check for differences
      between the groups and measures of association through the coefficient of correlation. The
      level of significance of 5% will be established

      Randomized clinical trial (RCT) in accordance with the recommendations of the Report of
      Consolidated Standards Trials (CONSORT) held in Clinical School of Physical Therapy, Federal
      University of Bahia (UFBA), Salvador, Bahia, with cerebral palsy patients and their
      caregivers. Selection of the population: Inclusion criteria 's own diagnosis of cerebral
      palsy for children, children will be included presenting grade I, II, III, IV and V in the
      System Gross Motor Function Classification (GMFCS) aged 1 year to 12 years old, and a parent
      or caregiver who dedicate themselves in full-time child, comply with the intervention
      protocol and sign the free and informed consent (IC). They will be deleted: Patients will be
      excluded disease of the peripheral nervous system or brain stem, children with other chronic
      diseases receiving palliative care, and children who have bone deformities such as scoliosis
      structured Cobb &gt; 30 and lower limb deformity. A sample of 20 patients group is required. The
      sample size for the study was calculated, considering a statistical power of 80% to 5% alpha.
      Evaluation procedures: To measurement of motor function were used the Gross Motor Function
      Measure (GMFM-88) scales . The range consists of 5 sizes and each size is an engine
      development phase that is related to the first quarters of life. The GMFM-88 with respect to
      motor development stage presented by the child and the evaluator should assess only the
      dimensions that represent the stages of engine development for age. To check the Activity and
      Participation will be used Inventory Pediatric Disability Assessment (ASK). applied in
      children from 6 months to 7.5 years. It can also be used with older children who have
      functional limitations with performance below the expected for their age compared to typical
      children of the normative sample and can be used with children with various types of
      disabilities.

      The ASK can be applied by any member of the interdisciplinary team through interviews with
      the caretaker. Each item is a task and the ability to realize it is scored as (1) whether the
      child is able and (0) if it is not able to perform it. Evaluates functional abilities and
      their performance in the areas of self-care (73 items), mobility (59 items) and social
      function (65 items).

      Measures also the amount of assistance given by the caregiver when performing these tasks and
      the possible use of adaptations and changes in the environment. In caregiver assistance area
      for self-care are 8 items, 7 items mobility and social function 5 items. The score ranges
      from 0 to 5 (total dependence to complete independence).

      To investigate the Quality of Life will use the Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ - PF50), in
      its version for parents, applicable to children through fifteen in health. Each concept has a
      score of 0-100, with higher scores indicating better health status, satisfaction and
      well-being, and result in two summary scores - physical and psychosocial (0-70). This
      questionnaire has been validated for children with cerebral palsy. All these measures will be
      evaluated in the pre-intervention, 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks after initiation of therapy.

      Procedure: Using Education will be a protocol for caregivers of children with cerebral palsy
      for the intervention group, once a week, while children in the control and intervention
      groups will receive conventional physical therapy twice a week. The established training
      period will last twelve weeks. Software to create randomization lists (randListÂ®) is used in
      order to ensure that all individuals have equal chances allocation in groups.

    <description>To investigate the change in the gross motor function of children with cerebral palsy after physiotherapy intervention associated with an education program for parents.
To measurement of motor function were used the GMFM-88 scales (Gross Motor Function Measure). The scales will be implemented before the start of the intervention and after six months of physiotherapy. The GMFM-88 consists of 88 items organized in five dimensions, the first lying and rolling, Sitting, crawling and Kneeling, Standing, Walking , Running and Jumping . The items are sorted within each dimension according to the practicality of execution within the overall assessment and difficulty. For each item, 0-3 notes are set, and the value 0 corresponds to the inactivity of the child in the requested activity.</description>

During the parents or legal guardian meetings will be oriented to stimulate the drive to your child or ward during everyday activities such as bathing, dressing, eating, transferring, going to the bathroom. Parents will receive a diary to record the activities in the home environment. The orientation day for parents will take place in different days of the day the child will receive physical therapy, so that the physiotherapist responsible for the training of parents is shrouded in relation to the randomization of the subjects. This program will be associated with conventional physical therapy program that provides for movements based on neurodevelopmental concept.</description>
