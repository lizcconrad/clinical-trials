    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, open, parallel group, active-controlled study. The study

    <textblock>
      After the screening visit, all patients who met all inclusion criteria and do not meet any of
      the exclusion criteria were randomized into the experimental group or the controlled group.
      The subjects in the experimental arm will receive insulin aspart injection combined with
      basal insulin (Lantus ®), and the subjects in the controlled arm will receive NovoRapid ®
      (active control) combined with basal insulin (Lantus ®). The experimental drug or the
      controlled drug will be administered subcutaneously prior to three meals (or can be
      administered immediately after meal if necessary), and the basal insulin (Lantus ®) will be
      administered at bedtime. The treatment period is 24 weeks, during which the subjects will be
      followed up at the clincic cetres at 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 18, 24 weeks of treatment. At the end of
      24-week treatment, if the adverse events continue, the subjects will be followed until
      recovery or stabilization of the AEs.
