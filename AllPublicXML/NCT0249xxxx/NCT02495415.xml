    <textblock>
      This study addresses the hypothesis that intermittent treatment with fenretinide intravenous
      emulsion will induce objective responses in patients with relapsed or refractory Peripheral
      T-cell Lymphoma (PTCL) who have failed at least one prior systemic therapy and will result in
      acceptable toxicities.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, single arm efficacy and safety study in patients with
      relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma, who have failed at least one prior system
      therapy.

      Approximately 140 patients will be enrolled. Patients will be treated with fenretinide
      (4-HPR) intravenous emulsion administered as a continuous intravenous infusion for 5 days,
      once every 3 weeks until there is disease progression or unmanageable treatment-related
      toxicities.

      The primary study endpoint is objective response rate (ORR). Responses will be categorized
      using criteria established by the International Harmonization Project on Lymphoma. Safety
      will be evaluated during the study and for 30 days after the last administration of study
      drug. Adverse events and laboratory studies will be graded according to NCI-CTCAE v. 4.03.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patients &gt; 18 years with histologically or cytologically confirmed Peripheral
             T-cell lymphoma (PTCL)

          -  Diseases refractory/relapsed after one or more systemic cytotoxic therapies; patients
             must have fully recovered from the acute toxic effects of all prior chemotherapy,
             immunotherapy, or radiotherapy prior to entering this study.

          -  Patients with an ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2, and estimated survival of &gt; 12
             weeks.

          -  Patients with at least ONE of the following sites of measurable disease according to
             International Workshop Criteria87: A) Measurable tumor on MRI or CT scan. Measurable
             is defined as at least one lesion 20 mm in at least one dimension; for spiral CT,
             measurable is defined as 10 mm in at least one dimension. For patients with persistent
             disease, a biopsy of bone marrow, or bone, or a soft tissue site, must have
             demonstrated viable tumor. If lesion was radiated, biopsy must have been done at least
             4 weeks after radiation completed. B) Bone marrow with tumor cells seen on routine
             morphology (not by NSE staining only) of bilateral aspirate and/or biopsy on one bone
             marrow sample, except for patient who tested positive subsequent to their last
             treatment regimen or patients who had a negative marrow within three months of study
             entry.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unable to give written informed consent

          -  Patients who have received chemotherapy within 3 weeks of first fenretinide treatment,
             or who have received investigational drugs within 6 weeks of first fenretinide
             treatment. Patients must have otherwise recovered from toxicities of prior therapy.

          -  Patient is not eligible if radiation was given to the only site of measurable disease
             unless there has been subsequent disease progression at that site, or a biopsy of that
             site showed viable tumor at least 4 weeks after radiation was completed. Patients must
             not have received small field (focal) radiation for a minimum of 2 weeks prior to
             study entry. A minimum of 6 weeks is required following prior large field radiation
             therapy (i.e. TBI, craniospinal therapy, whole abdomen, total lung, &gt; 50% marrow
             space)

          -  Patients who have uncontrolled systemic infections, coagulation disorders, or other
             major medical illnesses of the cardiovascular or respiratory systems.

             attribution. B) Who have active CNS disease or a history of cranial irradiation are
             excluded due to concerns regarding toxicity attribution. Patients with previously
             treated leptomeningeal disease or brain metastases without evidence of remaining tumor
             by PET, MRI scan, or spinal fluid will be eligible; however such patients currently
             taking steroids as prophylaxis against seizures are not eligible.

          -  Patients with documented allergy to egg products.

          -  Known history of, or positive test result for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
             infection.

             drugs, they can be eligible for enrollment into the study (screening visit) one week
             or 5-half lives of the drug in question, whichever is the longer, after the
             discontinuation. For patients requiring any of these medications, entry is permissible
             only with permission from the medical monitor.

          -  Patients with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus with fasting serum glucose
             concentration over 200 mg/dl or a hemoglobin A1C over 7.5%.
