      The purpose of the study to evaluate Five-Dimensional Ultrasound in automated measurement of
      the fetal femur length at third trimester of pregnancy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Prospective pilot study that will be performed at the Fetal Care Unit at Ain Shams
      University Maternity Hospital.

      Ninety pregnant women will be recruited from the the Fetal Care Unit who will fulfill the
      inclusion criteria. They will be counseled to be included into the study.

      All cases will be subjected to:

        1. Full history taking including patient's age, parity, last menstrual period, estimated
           gestational age by dates, past history of medical disorders, clinical examinations
           (General and abdominal).

        2. Two-Dimensional Ultrasound and Five-Dimensional Ultrasound will be done for all cases
           for assessment of fetal femur length .

      The FL at Two-Dimensional Ultrasound (Gold standard) will be made from the center of the 'U'
      shape at each end of the bone.

      The FL at Five-Dimensional Ultrasound will be measured by Pressing Five-Dimensional
      Ultrasound long bone Button to extract Fetal Long Bones automatically.

      The estimation of gestational age by femur length by Two-Dimensional Ultrasound and
      Five-Dimensional Ultrasound will be compared to gestational age calculated by accurate dates
      of the last menstrual period.

    <description>The femur length at Five-Dimensional Ultrasound: To obtain 3D volume data, the entire bone length of the femur was identified on the screen, as in the 2D-ultrasound measurement, and the long axis of the femur was placed in the direction of the x axis in the image in which the ultrasound beam was perpendicular to the bone. The 5D LB set key was pressed on the system, wherein the system automatically analyzed the 3D volume data, reconstructed the 3D image of the long bones, and displayed the measured length of the femur length on the screen was measured by pressing 5D LB Button to extract Fetal Long Bones automatically.

        <title>Gestational Age Calculated by Femur Length Measurement by Five-Dimensional Ultrasound</title>
        <description>The femur length at Five-Dimensional Ultrasound: To obtain 3D volume data, the entire bone length of the femur was identified on the screen, as in the 2D-ultrasound measurement, and the long axis of the femur was placed in the direction of the x axis in the image in which the ultrasound beam was perpendicular to the bone. The 5D LB set key was pressed on the system, wherein the system automatically analyzed the 3D volume data, reconstructed the 3D image of the long bones, and displayed the measured length of the femur length on the screen was measured by pressing 5D LB Button to extract Fetal Long Bones automatically.
