  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study was to compare the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy
      (CBT) and physical therapy (PT) on pain and psychosexual outcomes in women with provoked
      vestibulodynia (PVD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Provoked vestibulodynia (PVD) is the most common condition leading to painful intercourse and
      is currently best understood within a biopsychosocial framework. Although the usefulness of
      non-medical treatment options for vulvar pain is recognized by many, there is limited
      research investigating the effectiveness of these treatments using a biopsychosocial approach
      to outcome measurement. Furthermore, there is little evidence to support the mechanisms by
      which these treatments lead to pain reduction. This study aimed to address these gaps by
      investigating two non-medical treatment options: individual cognitive-behavioural therapy
      (CBT) and physical therapy (PT).

    <description>The PT treatment protocol included the following procedures: (1) education about PVD; (2) targeted PFM exercises focused on contraction and relaxation including in-session practice and feedback; (3) manual techniques; (4) surface electromyographic biofeedback (sEMG); (5) progressive vaginal penetration activities through the use of four silicone vaginal dilators of varied diameter; (6) stretches of the hip muscles; (7) deep breathing and global body relaxation exercises; and (8) additional methods of managing pain and counseling about different sexual positions.</description>
