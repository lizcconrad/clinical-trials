  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pituitary down regulation is widely used during in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedures. It
      can suppress the spontaneous luteinizing hormone (LH) surge, and can also make follicles
      growth evenly.

      At present, standard gonadotropin releasing hormone analogue (GnRH-a) long protocol is used
      in around 85% patients in the investigator's center. However, patients have to inject short
      term GnRH-a 0.05mg or 0.1mg daily for around 3 weeks in one IVF cycle.

      Long term GnRH-a, which is usually used in patients with endometriosis,has been shown to
      increase IVF outcome by altering endometrial receptivity. Moreover, it is also very
      convenient because patients do not have to inject GnRH-a daily. In order to make patients
      feel more comfortable during IVF treatment, the investigators have used a new ovarian
      stimulation protocol since the beginning of 2015. The investigators give patients long term
      GnRH-a (3.75mg) once at menstrual cycle D2, and begin the use of Gn to stimulate follicle
      growth around 30 days later based on the hormone levels and follicle size. In the pilot
      observational study of several patients, no LH surge occurred during ovarian stimulation.

      The aim of this randomized controlled study is to compare the efficiency of this new protocol
      and standard GnRH-a long protocol in the investigator's center.

      The primary outcome is ongoing pregnancy rate. Other parameters include number of oocytes
      retrieved, 2 pronucleus (2PN) fertilization rate, high quality embryo formation rate,
      implantation rate, spontaneous abortion rate, and ectopic pregnancy rate.

Once pituitary down regulation is achieved,controlled ovarian hyperstimulation using gonadotropins is initiated. During ovarian stimulation, short GnRH-a is used daily at the dose of 0.05mg until human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) trigger.</description>
