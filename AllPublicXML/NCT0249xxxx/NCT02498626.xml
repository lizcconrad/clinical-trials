      This study was designed to examine if venous saturations from the central venous line and
      from the venous side of the heart lung machine are interchangeable or not with mixed venous
      saturation from the pulmonary artery in children undergoing open heart surgery for correction
      of various congenital heart defects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Forty children aged from 1-15 years undergoing correction for different congenital heart
      procedures with cardiopulmonary bypass [CPB] were included in this study. Simultaneous
      samples were taken from the central venous line, pulmonary artery, and from venous side of
      the heart lung machine. Samples were taken after 10 minutes on full CPB and at the end of
      surgery before end of CPB. Bland and Altman plots were used to study the agreement between
      venous saturations.
