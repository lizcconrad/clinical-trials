    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Factor VIII (FVIII) Inhibitors</measure>
    <time_frame>From Day 1 up to 28 calendar days after End of Treatment (participants had received treatment for 6 months or when participants had achieved 50 exposure days [EDs] whichever occurred first).</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants with the product medically important event (MIE) (FVIII inhibitor development during the study).</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With All Causality Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) or Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Day 1 up to 28 calendar days after End of Treatment (participants had received treatment for 6 months or when participants had achieved 50 EDs whichever occurred first).</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence without regard to causality in a participant who received study drug. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. An AE was considered treatment emergent if it started for the first time in a participant on or after the first day of active treatment, or the event started before the first day of active treatment but increased in severity during active treatment. AEs included both SAEs and non-serious AEs.</description>

    <measure>Response Assessment of On-Demand Treatment of Bleeds</measure>
    <time_frame>From Day 1 up to participants had received treatment for 6 months or when participants had achieved 50 EDs whichever occurred first.</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of infusions (initial and subsequent for a bleed) in each response category (excellent, good, moderate, no response) was reported. Excellent: Definite pain relief and/or improvement in signs of bleeding starting within 8 hours after an infusion, with no additional infusion administered. Good: Definite pain relief and/or improvement in signs of bleeding starting within 8 hours after an infusion, with at least 1 additional infusion administered for complete resolution of the bleeding episode or definite pain relief and/or improvement in signs of bleeding starting after 8 hours following the infusion, with no additional infusion administered. Moderate: Probable or slight improvement starting after 8 hours following the infusion, with at least 1 additional infusion administered for complete resolution of the bleeding episode. No Response: No improvement at all between infusions or during the 24 hour interval following an infusion, or condition worsens.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Infusions Needed to Treat Each New Bleed for On-Demand Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>From Day 1 up to participants had received treatment for 6 months or when participants had achieved 50 EDs whichever occurred first.</time_frame>
    <description>The number of Xyntha infusions administered to treat a bleed was determined. This was calculated by adding the on-demand initial treatment and any on-demand follow-up infusions for the same bleed (same bleed start date/time).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Frequency of Xyntha Infusions to Treat Each New Bleed for On-Demand Group</measure>
    <time_frame>From Day 1 up to participants had received treatment for 6 months or when participants had achieved 50 EDs whichever occurred first.</time_frame>
    <description>The number of bleeds resolved with 1, 2, 3, 4, or &gt;4 infusions was reported for each of the categories (1, 2, 3, 4, or &gt;4 infusions needed to treat the bleed), in which the numerator was the number of bleeds falling into each category, and the denominator was the total number of new bleeds across all participants.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hemostatic Efficacy for Surgical Prophylaxis Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>From day of surgery to postoperative period (at least 1-3 days post operation or until adequate wound healing for minor surgery or 4-6 days post operation or until threat resolved or adequate wound healing for major surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of hemostatic efficacy was determined by the investigator and/or surgeon using the 4 point Surgical Hemostasis Efficacy Rating Scale. Excellent: Achieved hemostasis comparable to that expected after similar surgery in a non hemophilic participant. Good: Prolonged time to hemostasis, with somewhat increased bleeding compared to that expected after similar surgery in a non hemophilic participant. Moderate: Obviously delayed hemostasis, but manageable with additional infusions. No Response: No hemostatic response. The percentage of observations in each hemostatic efficacy response category (excellent, good, moderate, none) was reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Actual Estimated Blood Loss for Surgical Prophylaxis Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>From day of surgery to postoperative period (at least 1-3 days post operation or until adequate wound healing for minor surgery or 4-6 days post operation or until threat resolved or adequate wound healing for major surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants with blood loss in each category (Abnormal, Normal, and Absence). Blood loss during the intraoperative and the postoperative period were assessed by investigator or surgeon, which were rated as Abnormal, Normal, and Absence. Abnormal blood loss meant the blood loss was higher over the expectation for the non hemophilic participant.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Transfusion Requirement for Surgical Prophylaxis Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>From day of surgery to postoperative period (at least 1-3 days post operation or until adequate wound healing for minor surgery or 4-6 days post operation or until threat resolved or adequate wound healing for major surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants with transfusion requirement for surgical prophylaxis treatment. Transfusion requirements during the intraoperative and the postoperative period were assessed by investigator or surgeon. The number of units and types of blood products transfused were recorded if applicable.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Average Infusion Dose and Total Factor VIII Consumption for On-Demand Treatment and Surgical Prophylaxis Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>On-Demand Group: Day 1 up to 6 months or 50 EDs whichever occurred first. Surgical Prophylaxis Group: Day of surgery to postoperative period. The duration of postoperative period is specified in previous endpoints.</time_frame>
    <description>The total amount (IU) infused for each Xyntha infusion recorded in the study drug infusion log case report form (CRF) was summed to calculate the total factor VIII consumption for each participant. The average infusion dose for each participant was calculated as his total factor VIII consumption (in IU) divided by the number of infusions administered. The total factor VIII consumption, divided by number of infusions, was summarized similarly to average infusion dose (IU).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Less Than Expected Therapeutic Effect (LETE) in the On-Demand Setting</measure>
    <time_frame>From Day 1 up to participants had received treatment for 6 months or participants had achieved 50 EDs whichever occurred first.</time_frame>
    <description>LETE occurred in the on-demand setting if 2 successive &quot;No Response&quot; ratings were recorded after 2 successive Xyntha drug infusions, respectively.The infusions must have been administered within 24 hours (less than or equal to 24 hours) of each other for treatment of the same bleeding event in the absence of confounding factors (prespecified). Therefore, LETE in the on-demand setting was based on the response to treatment of a bleeding episode (including those occurring during the surgical prophylaxis period). Note that on-demand treatments administered during the surgical prophylaxis period were also to be included.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Confirmed LETE in the Low Recovery Setting</measure>
    <time_frame>From Day 1 up to participants had received treatment for 6 months or when participants had achieved 50 EDs whichever occurred first.</time_frame>
    <description>LETE could also be lower than expected recovery of FVIII in the opinion of the investigator following infusion of Xyntha in the absence of confounding factors. The only confounding factors for low recovery were: known presence or subsequent identification of a FVIII inhibitor; known compromised Xyntha; faulty administration of Xyntha, including inadequate dosing.</description>

The average infusion dose for each participant was calculated as his total factor VIII consumption (in IU) divided by the number of infusions administered. The total factor VIII consumption, divided by number of infusions, was summarized similarly to average infusion dose (IU).</description>
        <time_frame>On-Demand Group: Day 1 up to 6 months or 50 EDs whichever occurred first. Surgical Prophylaxis Group: Day of surgery to postoperative period. The duration of postoperative period is specified in previous endpoints.</time_frame>
