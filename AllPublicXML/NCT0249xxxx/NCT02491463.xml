    <textblock>
      The purpose of this first time in human (FTiH) study is to assess the safety, reactogenicity
      and immunogenicity of 2 doses of the RSV investigational vaccine, when administered
      intramuscularly according to a 0, 1 month schedule, in healthy adults aged 18 to 45 years.
