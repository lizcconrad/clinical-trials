  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The possible relationship between posture and instability of the masticatory muscles related
      to occlusion thus becomes the reason, the objective of this study. In this way, it will be
      possible to evaluate both postural alignment and postural balance in patients with signs and
      symptoms of temporomandibular joint disorder before and after the use of an occlusal plate.
      Our research will take place at the School of Odontology of the University of São Paulo in
      the clinics of the Occlusion and TMJ Services (SOA) and of the Envelhecer Sorrindo program,
      and the data will be collected in the Biophysics Laboratory of the School of Physical
      Education and Sports of the University of São Paulo. The population studies will be made up
      of 120 patients, 60 being part of the sample and the other 60 in the control group. All the
      patients in this study are over 20 years of age and are of both genders; the research
      criteria will be diagnosed by way of filling out the questionnaire of the RDC-TMD and
      complemented by way of diagnostic imaging via MRI of the temporomandibular joint. The study
      will be a clinical, randomized, controlled, prospective study and intervention. After the
      subjects' alignment is evaluated by way of photographs and their postural balance by way of a
      force platform, the group will the randomized; the sample group will receive an occlusal
      plate with criteria for occlusal stability (simultaneous, bilateral contacts with an absence
      of interference in the canine and anterior guides). The occlusal plate will be made from
      &quot;Vacuum Form&quot; acetate with a thickness of 1.5 mm; the simultaneous, bilateral, occlusal
      contacts and the canine and anterior guides will be obtained by way of autopolymerizable,
      acrylic resin with the mandible in a centric relationship. The occlusal plate will be
      controlled weekly. The control group will only receive orientation to do physiotherapeutic
      exercises seeking to correctly position the mandible in the resting position (maxillar teeth
      should be approximately 2 mm away from the mandibular teeth) while the tip of the tongue is
      positioned and accommodated on the roof of the mouth over the incisive papilla on the hard
      palate (without touching the teeth). The exercise will consist of repeatedly opening the
      mouth with the tongue cleaving to the roof of the mouth, 3 times per day, each period
      consisting of 3 sets with 15 repetitions. After 3 months, the two groups will be re-evaluated
      in terms of postural alignment and balance.

      The data will undergo the pertinent statistical treatment. The supposition is that those who
      undergo re-education of their neuromuscular system will see improvement in their coordination
      and understanding in relationship to TMJ, re-establishing the function by way of the occlusal
      stability.
