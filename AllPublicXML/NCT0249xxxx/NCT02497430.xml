      The ARIES GBS Assay is a real-time PCR based qualitative test designed to detect Group B
      Streptococcus (GBS) nucleic acid from Lim Broth enriched vaginal-rectal specimen swabs
      obtained from pregnant women between 35 - 37 weeks gestation.

      The ARIES GBS Assay is a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based qualitative in vitro
      diagnostic test designed to detect Group B Streptococcus (GBS) nucleic acid from Lim Broth
      enriched vaginal-rectal specimen swabs obtained from pregnant women.

      The objective of this study is to establish the diagnostic accuracy of ARIES GBS Assay
      through a multi-site, method comparison on prospectively collected, left-over enriched Lim
      broth specimens.

      Diagnostic accuracy will be expressed in terms of clinical sensitivity and specificity.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. An exemption from the requirement for Informed Consent has been granted by the site
             IRB to include the left-over patient specimens in the study.

          2. Demographic information, including age, geographic location, and number of gestation
             weeks, is included with the specimen.

          3. The specimen is from a female patient who is at 35 - 37 weeks gestation.

          4. The specimen was collected in unexpired liquid Transport Media (e.g., Liquid Stuart or
             Liquid Amies).

          5. Enrichment in Lim broth was grown for ≥18 hrs to ≤24 hrs.

          6. The specimen is received in good condition (no leakage or drying of the specimen) and
             was accepted for testing by the site in accordance with established laboratory
             procedures.

          7. The volume of the patient specimen after enrichment is sufficient (≥ 1.75mL) for
             completion of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The specimen was collected at a site which is not covered under the study IRB.

          2. The specimen is from a patient for whom demographic data - age, geographic location
             and/or gestation weeks cannot be obtained.

          3. The specimen was not properly collected, identified, transported, processed or stored
             according to the instructions provided by the Sponsor.

          4. The specimen was enriched in Lim broth for &lt;18 hrs or &gt;24 hrs.

          5. A swab specimen that cannot be placed in Lim broth within 4 days of collection.

          6. Inconclusive latex agglutination results - weak agglutination, agglutination that
             occurs in more than one latex reagent or the results are otherwise considered
             inconclusive based on established laboratory procedures or the instructions included
             with the latex agglutination test kit.

          7. Any specimen that was not tested per the complete testing algorithm provided by the
             Sponsor.
