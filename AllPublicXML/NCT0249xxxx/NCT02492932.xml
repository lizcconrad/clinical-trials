      Two approaches are possible when the first finder needle attempt of the internal jugular vein
      cannulation fails; the needle can be turned slightly laterally or the puncture point can be
      moved slightly medially. This study is an ultrasonographic stimulation study to evaluate the
      success rate of turning the needle laterally and moving the puncture point medially, and to
      determine the proper angle or distance for the second try of internal jugular vein
      cannulation.

      Immediately after induction of general anesthesia, the patient's head is turned slightly, and
      the table is tilted at 10 degrees, and the puncture point estimated by the anatomical
      landmarks are marked on the patient's skin. The investigators obtain a sonographic view at
      the estimated puncture point. It is recorded &quot;success&quot; when the internal jugular vein is
      visualized on the ultrasonography, and the estimated needle path passes the internal jugular
      vein. It is recorded &quot;failure&quot; if the internal jugular vein is not visualized on the
      ultrasonography, and the estimated needle path does not pass the internal jugular vein. After
      &quot;failure&quot; of the first attempt, the probe is either turned laterally or moved medially until
      the internal jugular vein is visualized on the ultrasonography, and the estimated needle path
      passes the internal jugular vein. The angle and distance is recorded. The location of the
      carotid artery is always marked on the ultrasonography for evaluation of complications.
