      Introduction: immersion cold water is a recuperative strategy commonly used, however, are not
      yet fully understood the real effects of this technique on specific conditions. Objective: To
      analyze and to compare the effects of the immersion cold water during the intense
      post-exercise recovery, using different times and temperatures on biological, clinical and
      metabolic variables. Method: 105 male subjects were divided into five groups: one control
      group (CG) and four recoveries (G1: 5' at 9±1 degrees Celsius; G2: 5' at 14±1 degrees
      Celsius; G3: 15' at 9±1 degrees Celsius; G4: 15' at 14±1 degrees Celsius). The volunteers
      were submitted an exhaustion protocol that consisted of a program of jumps and the Wingate
      test. Immediately after the exhaustion protocol, volunteers were directed to a tank with
      water and ice, which were immersed up to the height of the anterior superior iliac spine to
      the recovery procedure, during which blood samples were collected for later analysis lactate
      and creatine kinase (CK). Variables were collected prior to the exercise, 24, 48, 72 and 96
      hours after the end of it. Furthermore, the perception of pain and recovery of the lower
      limbs were also collected at specific moments by means respectively of the Likert scale of
      perceived effort and visual analogue scale pain. Appropriate statistical analysis was used to
      compare the groups and the moments, considering the 5% level of significance.
