      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of LOFT Therapy in breast
      cancer survivors. In a previous study, the investigators found that many patients are more
      debilitated at diagnosis than previously recognized. Both chemotherapy and anti-estrogen
      therapy have a large effect. Within 6 months patients replace muscle with fat leading to a
      significant reduction in muscle power and endurance. Our data suggests that common exercise
      recommendations for at least 150 minutes of exercise a week would be far beyond many of our
      patients' physical ability after therapy, leading to the soreness, injury, frustration, and
      early discontinuation (or failure to initiate an exercise program in the first place). The
      degree of muscle loss seen in our patients is similar to that documented in US astronauts
      after long-term space flight. Our collaborator Dr. Yvonne Cagle, retired USAF flight surgeon,
      noted that the cosmonauts were in better shape (had less muscle atrophy) than the astronauts.
      This difference was more than could be explained by the rigorous Russian exercise program.
      The only key distinction was the compressive, &quot;penguin suits&quot; used by the Russians. This
      observation lead Dr. Cagle to develop a technique called low intensity, off
      loaded-compressive therapy (LOFT) to replicate the impact of the Russian penguin suits for
      patients who were debilitated, whether by space flight or by chronic conditions such as
      arthritis, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis. The LOFT method does not require
      excessive exertion or strain on the joints. In field observations, LOFT therapy improved
      muscle strength, muscle mass, endurance, sleep quality, and fatigue. This pilot study is the
      first to evaluate the safety, feasibility, and biologic impact of LOFT on breast cancer
      survivors.

      Objectives This pilot trial will provide feedback on the feasibility and impact of LOFT in
      breast cancer survivors. The investigators will also explore the relationship of the LOFT
      intervention to changes in insulin resistance, growth hormone levels, body mass index,
      patient reported physical activity, fatigue, and overall quality of life.

      Primary Objective Evaluate the safety and feasibility of LOFT training in breast cancer
      survivors (&lt; 3 years from diagnosis) treated with either chemotherapy and/or anti-estrogen
      therapy.

      Secondary Objectives

        1. Estimate the effect size of LOFT training on muscle power, endurance, daily activity,
           fatigue, and quality of life.

        2. Estimate the effect of short-term LOFT training on biochemical parameters of
           inflammation, metabolism, anabolic hormone secretion, and bone turnover.

      LOFT Therapy™ Summary LOFT Therapy™ is a form of exercise that requires less energy for
      movement. LOFT Therapy™ will be performed 2 times a week for 4 weeks a total of 8 sessions.
      The patient will be wrapped with fabric cuffs, on up to four limbs. The cuffs are applied to
      the widest part of the biceps and upper thighs at pressures between 80-100 mmHg with minimal
      venous encroachment. The patients will ride a recumbent bike for 18 total minutes of
      sub-maximal exertion (up to 70% repetition maximum ), with the option of up to 2 periods of
      15-second higher intensity exertions as tolerated, followed by individualized respiratory
      recovery periods determined by the relative decrease in breathing effort.

      The 18-minute session will be preceded by a two-minute compression check, where the wraps
      will be adjusted based on any signs or symptoms of nerve or vessel impingement. Patients will
      undergo an intake and outtake assessment with each session to collect subjective data and
      patient feedback. Two compression sessions will be conducted for 4 weeks, for a total of 8
      sessions.

      This study will enroll 15 patients. A 20% dropout rate for this group was taken into
      consideration so the investigators assume analysis will be done on at least 12 patients.
