  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the effectiveness of a weekly village distribution of canned herring for
      prevention of malnutrition in children aged 2-5 years old during a food-insecure time of the
      year in rural villages in Guinea-Bissau. The study will use community health workers to
      conduct the herring distribution, making this a test that will provide valuable information
      on what could become a practical food aid supplementation practice. The primary study
      hypothesis is that distribution of canned herring as a weekly food supplement to families
      with young children at the beginning of the rainy season will prevent a seasonal decrease in
      weight-for-age Z-score (primary variable) of children with mild to moderate malnutrition at
      baseline.

    <description>Participants in this arm will receive the Canned Herring intervention. Families with children in this study arm will receive a weekly ration of herring throughout the 8-10 week study period (2 cans herring/day per study child), which will be distributed weekly by community health workers. Families will be instructed to feed the study child half a can of herring per day (without reducing usual home food given to the child), and to not share the remaining herring with individuals who are in the Delayed Herring study arm. When families come to collect their weekly distribution they will be asked to bring in at least 7 empty herring cans in order to receive the next ration, and will answer a question about how often the child eats the herring.</description>

    <description>Families with children in this study arm will not receive any herring during the 8-10 week period when Immediate Herring families receive a weekly ration of herring.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Village leaders willing to allow the study to take place in their village

          -  Village must have community health workers who are willing to do the weekly
             distribution of herring to enrolled families and are able to keep the necessary
             records documenting the distribution.

          -  Children age 2-5 currently living in a selected village

          -  Parents willing to participate in the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  There are no eligibility exclusions for this study.

          -  If a child is identified with severe malnutrition at the baseline measurement, the
             family will be advised to take the child for treatment rather than participate in the
             study.
