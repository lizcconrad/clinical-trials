    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the added value of PET-CT with [18F]FDOPA tracer for
      Assessment of the Myocardial Sympathetic Denervation in patients with or suspected with
      Parkinson's disease.

      The investigators expect to see normal values of uptake ratio of [18F]FDOPA , in patients
      with no synuclein underline pathology or previously known cardiovascular disease (no history
      of high blood pressure or take medications that influence the sympathetic system- exclusion
      criteria). Low values of uptake ratio is presumed to be found in patients diagnosed with
      Parkinson's disease or other synuclein pathology.

      The expected normal ratio of Heart/liver uptake values will be determined from scans of
      patients refered to [18F]FDOPA scan and were found to have normal [18F]FDOPA scan of the
      basal ganglia and no cardiovascular diseases.

      L-3,4-dihydroxy-6-[18F]fluoro-phenylalanine ([18F]FDOPA) might be a useful tracer for
      assessing myocardial sympathetic denervation in Parkinson's disease (PD) Patients. Compared
      to the routinely used I123 MIBG scan, [18F]FDOPA seems to have an advantage for the following
      reasons:

        1. meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) is a false analog of norepinephrine while [18F]FDOPA is
           the radiolabelled form of DOPA, a direct precursor of dopamine which is subsequently
           converted to norepinephrine

        2. 123I MIBG, un-like norepinephrine, dose not undergo intracellular metabolism (19) while
           [18F]FDOPA undergo complex intracellular metabolism (17)

        3. Studies have shown that I123 MIBG reuptake is almost exclusive by uptake mechanism 1.
           Uptake-2 mechanism of 123I-MIBG by the myocardium is not significant. Reuptake of
           norepinephrine (NE) in the synaptic cleft and is mainly by uptake 1 system but also in
           small amount by uptake 2 systems. The investigators assumption is that this double
           mechanism of reuptake will increase the concentration of [18F]FDOPA for better imaging

Normal uptake will be calculated by the mean uptake ratio in the healthy population (plus minus standard deviation) and used to compare to patients with abnormal [18F]FDOPA scan of the basal ganglia.</description>
