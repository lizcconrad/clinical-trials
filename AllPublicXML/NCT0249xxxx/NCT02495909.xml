      Objective and Hypotheses: This project has the overall objective of implementing and
      evaluating new approaches to reducing the current and future burden of urinary
      schistosomiasis in young children using the antihelminthic drug Praziquantel. The project
      aims to (1) determine the operational health benefits of treating schistosome infections
      early on re-infection and morbidity reduction, (2) determine if gut or urine microbiome
      structure (species diversity or abundance) is a risk factor for S. haematobium infection or
      morbidity, and (3) elucidate the factors and underlying mechanisms mediating the
      reduction/reversal of schistosome-related morbidity and resistance against
      infection/re-infection in young children.

      This study aims to refine current paediatric treatment of schistosomiasis using the drug
      Praziquantel (PZQ) to improve the current and future health of pre-school children and
      infants. Praziquantel is cheap, highly efficacious and safe, presenting a realistic
      opportunity of using a pre-existing tool in a modified way to benefit child health and
      development. The study will focus on children aged 3 to 5 years of age, comparing the impact
      of early vs. later treatment with PZQ on the current and future health status of the
      children. By killing worms PZQ stops the morbidity related to the presence of worms and eggs
      such as anaemia, abdominal pain, diarrhoea and blood in the urine as well as induced immune
      responses associated with reduced re-infection rates. Therefore the study will investigate
      the immediate health benefits of treating pre-school children and infants and the effects of
      treatment on re-infection rates.
