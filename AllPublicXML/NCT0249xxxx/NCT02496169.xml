          6. Target vessel Reference Vessel Diameter (RVD) of 2.25mm - 4.00mm by operator visual
             estimate.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has clinical symptoms and/or electrocardiogram (ECG) changes consistent with
             acute ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) within 72 hours prior to the index
             procedure. Hemodynamically stable non-STEMI (NSTEMI) subjects are eligible for study
             enrollment.

          2. Subject is presenting cardiogenic shock.

          3. Subject is pregnant and/or breastfeeding or intends to become pregnant during the
             duration of the study.

          4. Subject has a known allergy to contrast medium that cannot be adequately
             pre-medicated, or any known allergy to thienopyridine, aspirin, both heparin and
             bivalirudin, L-605 cobalt-chromium (Co-Cr) alloy or one of its major elements (cobalt,
             chromium, tungsten and nickel), Polylactic-Co-Glycolic Acid (PLGA), sirolimus

          5. Revascularization of any target vessel within 9 months prior to the index procedure or
             previous PCI of any non-target vessel within 30 days prior to the index procedure.

          6. Planned treatment of a lesion not meeting angiographic inclusion and exclusion
             criteria during the index procedure or after the index procedure.

          7. Planned surgery within 6 months of index procedure unless dual antiplatelet therapy
             can be maintained throughout the peri-surgical period.

          8. History of a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within 6 months prior to the
             index procedure.

          9. Subjects with active bleeding disorders, active coagulopathy, or any other reason, who
             are ineligible for Dual Antiplatelet Therapy (DAPT).

         10. Subject will refuse blood transfusions.

         11. Subject has documented left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 30% within 90 days
             prior to the index procedure.

         14. Subject has leukopenia (i.e. &lt; 3,000 white blood cells/mm3), thrombocytopenia (i.e. &lt;
             100,000 platelets/mm3) or thrombocytosis (i.e. &gt; 700,000 platelet/mm3).

         15. Subject is receiving oral or intravenous immunosuppressive therapy (inhaled steroids
             are permitted), or has known life-limiting immunosuppressive or autoimmune disease
             (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus, systemic lupus erythematosus; diabetes mellitus
             is permitted).

         16. Subject is receiving chronic anticoagulation (e.g. coumadin, dabigatran, apixaban,
             rivaroxaban or any other agent).

         17. Subject has life expectancy of &lt; 1 year.

         18. Subject is participating in another investigational (medical device or drug) clinical
             study. Subjects may be concurrently enrolled in a study, as long as the study device,
             drug or protocol does not interfere with the investigational treatment or protocol of
             this study.

         19. In the investigator's opinion, subject will not be able to comply with the follow-up
             requirements.

        Subjects will be excluded from the trial if any of the target lesions/vessels meets any of
        the following angiographic criteria:

          1. Target lesion is located within a saphenous vein graft or arterial graft.

          2. Target lesion involves a side branch of &gt; 2.0 mm in diameter. Note: Lesions within 3
             mm of the origin of the right coronary artery may be treated.

          3. Target vessel/lesion is excessively tortuous / angulated or is severely calcified,
             that would prevent complete inflation of an angioplasty balloon. This assessment
             should be based on visual estimation.

          4. Target vessel has angiographic evidence of thrombus.

          5. Target vessel was treated with brachytherapy any time prior to the index procedure.
