  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A novel disposable sheathed gastroscope system has been shown to be safe and more efficient
      in clinical practice during gastroscopy. This novel disposable sheathed endoscope system
      could effectively prevent cross-infection by simply taking off the contaminated sheath after
      examination of a patient and placing a new sheath on the endoscope. In this way,
      investigators can save the endoscopic reprocessing time and also decrease the need for
      endoscopic cleaning and disinfecting equipment.

      Participants may think that placing a new sheath on the endoscope can decrease the success
      rate of cecal intubation in patients undergoing screening colonoscopy. With a new sheath on
      the endoscope during scope insertion can probably increases distension of the colonic lumen
      and loop formation. The probable adhesion may increase the discomfort of investigators and
      participants. But a previous clinical study by investigators' team showed that the
      participants' feeling were no significant difference (Z = -1.783, P = 0.075) between sheathed
      and conventional groups. No significant differences were observed in optical clarity, or
      pathology detection rate. There were no complications, and no microbial contamination was
      detected. Based on this study, investigators hypothesize that compared with conventional
      group, placing a new sheath on the endoscope does not significantly reduce the success rate
      of cecal intubation in average patients.

      The aim of the study is to compare the outcome of colonoscopy placing a new sheath on the
      endoscope versus the conventional method in average participants. The primary outcome is
      cecal intubation success rate. The secondary outcomes include cecal intubation time, maximum
      pain score during colonoscopy, overall pain score after colonoscopy and adenoma detection
      rate.
