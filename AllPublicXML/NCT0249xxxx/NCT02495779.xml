  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to investigate the acceptability, perceived need and uptake of
      short-term episodic Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention among men who have sex
      with men (MSM). The overall objective is to determine the feasibility of a clinic-based
      Epi-PrEP implementation pilot project for 50 MSM (25/each of the 2 study sites) who report
      occasional condomless sex and who anticipate a period of high-risk while away from home (e.g.
      vacation) during the study period.

      This proposed study is designed to investigate the acceptability, perceived need and uptake
      of short-term episodic Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV prevention among men who have sex
      with men (MSM). Long-term PrEP may be unnecessary for the many HIV-uninfected men who have
      episodic contextually defined high-risk periods, particularly when away from their home
      setting. Alternative dosing strategies, such as short-term fixed-interval episodic PrEP
      (Epi-PrEP), may be a more realistic, feasible, acceptable, and useful option with high public
      health impact for the majority of MSM. The overall objective is to determine the feasibility
      of a clinic-based Epi-PrEP implementation pilot project for 50 MSM (25/each of the 2 study
      sites) who report occasional condomless sex and who anticipate a period of high-risk while
      away from home (e.g. vacation) during the study period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Self-identify as MSM: (1) born male who (2) has sex with men

          -  Age: 18 or older

          -  Sexual Risk: has had condomless anal sex with 2 or more men or any transactional sex
             with a man within the past 12-months.

          -  Vacation: identified an upcoming period of episodic risk away (i.e. vacation) from
             their home city that will last at least 7 but not more than 14 days during which they
             anticipate having at least one high-risk sexual event.

          -  Able and willing to provide informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  HIV positive

          -  Glomerular filtration rate &lt; 60 mL/min (calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault formula)

          -  Hepatitis B surface antigen positive

          -  Symptoms suggestive of acute HIV seroconversion at screening or enrollment

          -  Have used PrEP or PEP within the previous 3 months

          -  Currently enrolled in another study involving medications, investigational drug, or
             medical device

          -  Has other conditions (based on opinion of investigator or designee) that would
             preclude informed consent, make the study unsafe, complicate interpretation of study
             outcome data, or otherwise interfere with study procedures
