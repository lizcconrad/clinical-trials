  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In orthopaedic manual therapy translatoric grades of movement are used to determine the
      intensity of force applied during the mobilization. Different clinical effects are described
      for each translatoric grade of movement but there are not published studies evaluating these
      clinical effects.

      The objective of this trial is to determine if force magnitude during hip traction in resting
      position affects immediate and short-term outcomes (pain, physical function, hip muscle
      length and hip range of motion) in patients with hip osteoarthritis. For this purpose,
      investigators conduct a randomized clinical trial, double-blind (patient and physical
      therapist examiner). Participants entering the study were randomized into 1 of 3 treatment
      groups: grade I- grade IISZ mobilization, grade IITZ mobilization or grade III mobilization.
      Participants attend three sessions on alternate days (monday, wednesday, friday) and at the
      same hour. Measurements are taken prior to treatment, immediately after each session
      treatment.

      The participants are recruited from physiotherapy groups or referred by general practitioners
      and orthopedic surgeons.

      Participants were assigned to 1 of the 3 study groups through concealed allocation (sealed
      envelopes) and independent blocked randomization, using a random number generator.

      One physical therapist enroll patients in the study, while an independent research assistant
      performed the randomization and prepared the sealed envelopes, which are opened after
      baseline data collection by the physiotherapist performing the treatments. Participants are
      treated in a private treatment area and have no knowledge of treatments received by other
      participants.

      A second experienced orthopaedic manual therapist applies the standardized hip traction
      mobilization in resting position at either level of force, during 10 minutes. This amount of
      mobilization is consistent with clinical practice and previous studies in osteoarthritis
      patients.

      Two physiotherapists (third and fourth) with 5 years of experience, who were blinded to
      participant group, performed all measurements.The outcome measures are pain, physical
      function, hip muscle length and hip passive range of motion. Pain is registered with visual
      analogic scale (VAS), Pressure Pain Threshold ( PPT) and WOMAC pain subscale. Physical
      function is registered using Timed Up &amp; Go test (TUG), the 20-Meter Walking Test (20MWT) and
      the physical function subscale of WOMAC index. The hip muscle length is measured using Ely´s
      test, Active Knee Extension test and modified Ober´s test. The passive hip range of motion is
      measured using inclinometer or goniometer.
