  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are looking for better ways of diagnosing and treating pancreatic cancer. It is
      believed that looking for low levels of oxygen (hypoxia) in tumours may give a better
      understanding of how certain tumours grow or respond to certain treatments. This study will
      look at hypoxia in pancreatic tumours while participants are receiving treatment with the
      combination of gemcitabine and TH-302/placebo in the EMR 200592-001 clinical research study.

      This study will use positron emission tomography (PET) scans to look at hypoxia in tumours.
      PET is an imaging test that can be used to measure hypoxia in tumours. For this study, a
      radioactive tracer called Fluoroazomycin Arabinoside (FAZA) will be used to &quot;label&quot; areas of
      hypoxia in tumours. Determining the levels of hypoxia in tumour tissue using FAZA-PET scans
      and comparing these levels with the patient's response to treatment with gemcitabine and
      TH-302/placebo for pancreatic cancer may help the researchers to determine the relationship
      between hypoxia and response to this treatment.

      The main purpose of this study is to see how useful looking at hypoxia in tumours are when
      they are done at different centres.
