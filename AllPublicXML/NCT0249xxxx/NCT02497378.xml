  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the tolerability and safety of JNJ-54767414
      (daratumumab) in Combination With Bortezomib and Dexamethasone (D-Vd) in Japanese
      participants with relapsed (the return of a medical problem) or refractory (not responding to
      treatment) multiple myeloma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all participants and study personnel will know the identity of the
      study treatments) and multicenter (study conducted at multiple sites) study in Japanese
      participants. The study will include a Screening Phase (21 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1);
      open-label treatment phase (from Cycle 1 Day 1 until study treatment discontinuation, disease
      progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other reasons), and a Follow-up Phase. Bortezomib and
      Dexamethasone will be administered along with JNJ-54767414 for first 8 treatment cycles.
      Follow-up Phase begins immediately following the End-of-Treatment Visit, and will continue
      until 8 weeks after last study treatment, death, loss to follow-up, consent withdrawal for
      study participation, or study end, whichever occurs first. Participants' safety will be
      monitored throughout the study.

             M-protein greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 1 gram per deciliter (g/dL) (&gt;=10 gram per

             the treatment, whichever is longer, before the date of daratumumab first
             administration. The only exception is emergency use of a short course of
             corticosteroids (equivalent of dexamethasone 40 milligram per day [mg/day] for a
             maximum of 4 days) before treatment. A list of anti-myeloma treatments with the
             corresponding pharmacokinetic half-lives is provided in the Site Investigational
             Product Procedures Manual (IPPM)

          -  Has a history of malignancy (other than multiple myeloma) within 3 years before the
             date of daratumumab first administration
