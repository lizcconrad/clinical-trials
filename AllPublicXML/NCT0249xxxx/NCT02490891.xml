  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to measure tumoral angiogenesis modifications by RGD-K5 PET/CT before
      and after 2 cycles of chemotherapy in patients with lymphoma and a large tumoral mass
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After inclusion PET scans with FDG tracer and with a specific tracer of angiogenesis will be
      performed on patient with lymphoma. After two cycles of chemotherapy PET scans with the same
      tracers will be performed.

      Overall survival and disease free survival will be monitored during 18 months.
