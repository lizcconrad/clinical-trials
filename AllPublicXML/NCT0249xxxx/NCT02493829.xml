      The study will be an open label, single arm, phase I study intended to identify the safety
      and tolerability of &quot;AML Cell Vaccine&quot; given to eligible MDS RAEB-2 and AML patients who have
      achieved a best response of complete remission or partial remission following their first or
      second course of standard induction chemotherapy.

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of MDS RAEB-2 or primary (de novo) or secondary AML defined according to the
             WHO classification either as a new diagnosis or as a relapse.

          -  Patients for whom the optimal therapy in CR1 would be to undergo allogeneic bone
             marrow transplantation, but for whom this procedure is either not recommended (e.g.
             due to comorbidities) or not available (e.g. lack of a suitable donor).

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with MDS RAEB-2 or AML and favourable prognostic profile (good risk
             cytogenetics: t(15;17)(q22;q12~21), inv16(p13q22)/t(16;16)(p13;q22), t(8;21)(q22;q22)
             or cytogenetically normal AML with NPM1 mutation and absence of Flt-3 ITD).

          -  Patients unsuitable for standard induction chemotherapy.

          -  Patients who have previously undergone or will be able to undergo allogeneic
             transplantation.

          -  Patients who have had previous or current treatment with any form of investigational
             immunotherapy.
