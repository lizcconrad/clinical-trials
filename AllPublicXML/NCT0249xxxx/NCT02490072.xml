    <textblock>
      Dexmedetomidine is a selective α2 adrenergic agonist that can be considered a primary
      anesthetic, an adjuvant to propofol or inhalational anesthetics. Dexmedetomidine mediate its
      cardiovascular effect through activation of receptors in central and peripheral nervous
      system. The classic cardiovascular response of dexmedetomidine is the biphasic with initial
      shorten-increase in blood pressure followed by long-lasting decrease in BP and HR. There were
      several reports about these hemodynamic changs of dexmedetomidine, but not the evaluation of
      direct cardiac function of patients who was preexisted diastolic dysfunction. The purpose of
      this study is to evaluate the effects of dexmedetomidine as an anesthetic adjuvant in
      diastolic dysfunction by using the echocardiography.

    <description>Formula for administrated were randomized by computer-generated randomization. The patients and anesthesiologist, who administered and conducted all this trial, were blinded to the medication allocation. An anesthesiologist, who responsible for preparation of medication was the only person, recognized of the randomization code during trial. 10 minutes after anesthetic induction, dexmedetomidine group would start the loading of dexmedetomidine (1μg/kg) during 10 minutes followed infusion of dexmedetomidine(0.5 μg/kg/min). Bispectral index was monitored continuously targeting 40±5. Target concentration of remifentanil and fresofol were controlled stepwise in accordance with BIS. Using the transesophageal echocardiography, we will evaluate the changes of cardiac function including Tei index and cardiac output.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        The inclusion criteria included patients who estimated lateral e' velocity &lt;10 cm/s or
        septal e' velocity &lt;8 cm/s from the mitral annuli and averaged E/e' ≧ 9 in preoperative
        echocardiographic evaluation. For patients of old age (&gt; 60 yr) who did not undergo
        preoperative echocardiographic evaluation, written consent was obtained and TTE was
        performed to evaluate presence of diastolic dysfunction; patients with diastolic
        dysfunction, as previous defined, were included and those without were excluded

        echocardiographic evaluation.
