  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is prevalent and add a burden on families
      in Egypt and Middle East due to lifelong diet restriction, non-fava beans diet is main food
      for most families in the region and parents and doctors consider it as a prohibited food
      whatever the genetic or clinical phenotypes. The effective management is avoiding a spectrum
      of food and drugs causing oxidative stress. No data is available about the hazards of
      consumption of non-fava beans diet.

      Investigate the effect of challenge of non-fava beans diet on occurrence of hemolysis in both
      common and rare mutations causing G6PD deficiency in Egyptian children as well as making a
      genotype-phenotype correlation. Patients and Methods: The study will include all G6PD
      deficient children who were regularly followed up in Pediatric Hematology Center, Ain Shams
      University over last decade from 2004-2014 who stopped eating non fava-bean diet since their
      diagnosis as G6PD deficient and willing to participate in the diet challenge. They will be
      enrolled in a one year prospective study involving quantitative analyses for enzymatic
      activity, and molecular typing of G6PD enzyme using a polymerase chain reaction-amplification
      refractory mutation system (PCR-ARMS) technique. Patient's medical records will be reviewed
      as history of blood transfusion and G6PD level at diagnosis. Initial phase will be dietetic
      challenge with ingestion of non-fava beans taken in small amount (10-20 gm/day for 3
      successive days ) for children with haemoglobin level ≥ 11 gm/dl with daily clinical and
      laboratory monitoring by complete blood count, and markers of hemolysis as well as
      measurement of malondialdehyde (MDA) level both basal and at study end. A drop of Hb of ≥0.5
      gm/dl and / or appearance of hemoglobinuria is considered a significant hemolysis. Patients
      who will not meet the definition of significant hemolysis will be prospectively followed up
      for one year with follow up during their chronic exposure by complete blood count and
      hemolysis markers/ 3 months.
