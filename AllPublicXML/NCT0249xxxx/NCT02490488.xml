      The objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of masitinib in combination with
      gemcitabine in refractory ovarian cancer patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Masitinib Mesylate is a novel tyrosine kinase inhibitor that mainly targets c-Kit and PDGF
      receptors.

      C-KIT and platelet-derived growth factor and its receptor (PDGF-PDGFR), which promote tumour
      cell growth and angiogenesis are found to be over-expressed in 70% of ovarian cancers.
      Masitinib exhibits anti-tumoral immunotherapy activity in vivo with a potential to extend
      overall survival.

        Main inclusion criteria:

          1. Female patient, with histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced / metastatic
             epithelial ovarian cancer either :

               -  refractory to first line platinum treatment (defined as progressive disease while
                  receiving or persistent disease after platinum-based therapy, according to GOG),
                  or

               -  candidate to third line treatment.

          2. Patient has recovered of all acute toxic side effects of prior therapy or surgical

             patient and one for the partner) of medically acceptable forms of contraception during
             the study and for 3 months after the last treatment intake.

        Main exclusion criteria:

          1. Patient intolerant to gemcitabine

          2. Patient who has not recovered from any significant treatment toxicities prior to
