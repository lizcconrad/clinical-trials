      This study in patients with IBS-C is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      parallel-group clinical trial with 12 weeks of study drug therapy.

      Screening/Baseline: Patients will undergo an up to 28-day Screening/Baseline period to allow
      for any necessary diagnostic procedures, allow for required washout of medications and to
      determine study eligibility. If otherwise eligible based on screening criteria, patients will
      undergo a 2-week baseline assessment using an electronic diary where they will record daily
      assessments of bowel movements (BMs), stool consistency (Bristol Stool Form Scale-BSFS),
      abdominal pain and other IBS-related symptoms. Data from the two-week electronic diary
      assessment just prior to the randomization visit will be used to confirm IBS-C and study
      eligibility as well as define the patient's baseline from which change will be determined.

      Treatment: Patients who meet all entry criteria will be randomized (1:1:1) to one of three
      blinded treatment groups on Day 1 of the Treatment period. Patients will take an oral dose of
      study drug OD for 12 weeks and continue the daily electronic diaries (BMs, rescue medication
      use, abdominal pain, and other symptoms). During treatment weeks 4, 8, and 12, patients will
      return to the clinic to undergo safety and efficacy assessments.

      Post-Treatment: For 2 weeks after completing dosing, patients will continue to complete daily
      electronic diaries. Patients will then return to the clinical site for a final follow-up
      visit during Week 14 following randomization.

      The planned duration of participation in this study will be at least 116 days from signing of
      informed consent through post-treatment or up to approximately 135 days with visit windows
      considered.
