      This is an exploratory study to characterize the ex vivo immune response to RO6871765 or
      RO7011785 stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) extracted from healthy
      volunteers and chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients.

          -  Any other diseases or clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a
             disease or condition (including, but not limited to, cancer, lupus erythematosus,
             rheumatoid arthritis, or other autoimmune disease) that could confound the result of
             the study
