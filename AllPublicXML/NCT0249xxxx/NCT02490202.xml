      Safety and efficacy study of SANGUINATE on reduction of delayed graft function (DGF) in
      patients who will be recipients of a donation after brain death (DBD) donor kidney.

      Phase 2: Sixty (60) adult subjects who will be recipients of a donation after brain death
      (DBD) donor kidney and who meet all eligibility criteria will be randomized 1:1 within 48
      hours prior to transplant surgery to receive: two infusions of SANGUINATE at a dose of 320
      mg/kg or placebo on the day of surgery and approximately 24 hours after surgery. Patients
      will be hospitalized for up to 5 days and the study duration will be 30 days. Results will be
      used to inform the study design characteristics for Phase III, including sample size.

      Phase III: The same inclusion/exclusion requirements, dosing schedule, hospitalization stay
      and outpatient visits as in Phase II with additional visits scheduled at Day 90, Day 180 and
      Day 365. Study duration will be 365 days.
