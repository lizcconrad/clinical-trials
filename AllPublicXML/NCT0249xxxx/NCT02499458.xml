  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) have prognostic value in several tumor types, and increasing
      evidence suggests that molecular characterization of CTCs can serve as a &quot;liquid biopsy&quot; to
      understand and address treatment resistance. The goal of this proposal is to demonstrate that
      CTCs can be accurately enumerated and characterized in metastatic clear cell renal cancer
      (CCRC) and can serve as prognostic/predictive biomarkers to improve treatment. The challenge
      surrounding CTC analysis in CCRC is that most CTC technologies (including the clinical
      gold-standard CellSearch®) depend in epithelial markers such as EpCAM that are expressed at
      low or heterogeneous levels in CCRC. Members of the research team have developed a novel CTC
      microfluidic technology that can effectively detect CTCs that are completely undetectable by
      CellSearch® because of very low EpCAM expression, as well as allowing for CTC recovery for
      downstream molecular characterization. The goal of this proposal is therefore to test the
      hypotheses that (1) The microfluidics CTC technology will have better sensitivity/specificity
      relative to the CellSearch in metastatic CCRC; and (2) Enumeration of CTCs in metastatic CCRC
      patients (n=66) will have prognostic value, while molecular characterization of CTCs for
      expression of biomarkers (VHL, VEGF, mTOR, HIF1/HIF2, AKT) related to CCRC etiology will be
      predictive of response/resistance to targeted therapies. Although CCRC is relatively
      uncommon, the lack of established adjuvant treatments and high cost of targeted therapies in
      the palliative setting makes the search for new prognostic/predictive biomarkers an important
      clinical goal.

    <description>For comparison of the 2 CTC platforms, a Bland-Altman plot will be constructed. This plot is superior to standard correlation statistics in that it assesses agreement rather than association. Initially we will use a Chi-Square test to compare the 2 methods at a cutoff point of ≥5 versus &lt;5 CTCs/7.5mL, with simple comparison of PFS at this level. As the cut-off point may not be the same for each method, we will also compare the methods using simple 2X2 contingency tables.</description>
