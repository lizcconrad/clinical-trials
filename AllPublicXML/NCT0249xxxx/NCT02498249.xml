    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to assess the immediate effect of irradiation with low level
      laser therapy (LLLT) on the electromyographic activity of upper trapezius muscles and the
      amount of pain felt by patients with non-specific neck pain (NS-NP).A total of 20 patients
      with non-specific neck pain will be enrolled in a randomized, single-blind, crossover study.
      Each subject will receive two forms of treatment in random order: a single session of LLLT
      and placebo LLLT. In order to eliminate carry-over treatment effects, a one-week wash-out
      period will be respected between sessions. Surface electromyography will be used to determine
      nerve conduction velocity and activity in the upper trapezius muscles before and after
      treatment. The outcome measures will be determined by a numerical pain rating scale.
      Comparisons before and after irradiation with LLLT will determine the activity of the upper
      trapezius muscles and the level of pain. The data will be submitted to statistical tests
      considering a p-value of p &lt; 0.05.

    <description>A numerical rating scale for pain will be used to assess pain intensity in the NS-NP individuals. This is an 11-point scale ranging from 0 (absence of pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). The numerical rating scale was translated and cross-culturally adapted for the Brazilian population.</description>

    <description>For the LLLT irradiation, a paper template with 9 points (area of 1cm and a distance from center to center of 1 cm) will be used, distributed in three columns and three lines. The central point of the template will be positioned above the medium point of a line traced between the acromion and the spinous process of the seventh cervical vertebra, where the treatment should be close to the fixation point of the EMG electrode. The application point of the LLLT was determined by the location of the innervation point of the upper trapezius muscle.
Individuals will be subject to application of low level laser with a total dose of 18 J</description>
