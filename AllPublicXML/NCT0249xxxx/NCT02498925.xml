  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) is relatively low in childhood (i.e.,
      1-3%), but increases substantially during adolescence. By the age of 18, approximately 15% of
      adolescents will have experienced at least one episode of MDD. A growing body of research
      implicates abnormalities in reward circuitry as playing a critical role in the development
      and maintenance of depressive symptoms in adolescents. Importantly, these reward-circuitry
      abnormalities have been linked to anhedonia (i.e., decreased pleasure or blunted reactivity
      to rewarding stimuli). Behavioral Activation (BA) represents a promising - and relatively
      simple to deliver - nonpharmacologic intervention for adolescent depression, which has been
      shown to be at least as effective as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) with regards to
      symptom reduction and lowering the risk of relapse in adult samples. More recently, promising
      data have emerged from the application of BA to depressed adolescents. BA can be
      conceptualized as a treatment directly targeting anhedonia. More specifically, BA targets
      anhedonia through behavioral change strategies aimed at gradually increasing patients'
      exposure to and engagement with rewarding stimuli and positively reinforcing experiences.
      Given this treatment focus, BA may be particularly beneficial for adolescents struggling with
      relatively elevated levels of anhedonic symptoms. Accordingly, the present study will examine
      the role of anhedonia and reward functioning in predicting treatment response in BA. In
      addition, analyses will be conducted examining the reward-related neural and behavioral
      mechanisms underlying anhedonic symptom improvement in BA.

      Participants in this research will include 35 anhedonic adolescents and 36 demographically
      matched healthy participants recruited from the greater Boston community by Dr. Webb at
      McLean Hospital's Center for Depression, Anxiety and Stress Research. The anhedonic
      adolescents will undergo 12 weeks of Behavioral Activation therapy. This study will include
      three sessions:

        -  The first session will involve a diagnostic interview, and a series of questionnaires
           and assessments.

        -  The second session will take place at the McLean Hospital's Neuroimaging Center, and
           involve an fMRI brain scan and administration of two behavioral tasks, as well as
           questionnaires.

        -  Following the 12-weeks treatment, anhedonic adolescents will return to McLean Hospital's
           Neuroimaging Center for an fMRI brain scan, two behavioral tasks, and questionnaires.
           The healthy control group will complete the same three assessments at corresponding time
           points.

    <description>12 weeks (1 50-min session per week) of Behavioral Activation for the anhedonic adolescents.
Behavioral Activation is a psychosocial treatment for depression focused on gradually re-engaging patients with sources of reinforcement and reward in their environment (e.g., increasing activites and interpersonal interactions). In contrast to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, and as the name implies, Behavioral Activation focuses on behavioral strategies to improve mood and places little emphasis on cognitive restructuring techniques.</description>
