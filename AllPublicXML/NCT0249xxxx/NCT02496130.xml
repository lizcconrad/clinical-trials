      The goal of this study is to compare common methods of tissue extraction at the time of
      minimally invasive surgery, including vaginal extraction and mini-laparotomy; both performed
      within a containment system. The primary aim is to assess return to normal daily activities
      after each of the surgical techniques. Return to daily activities will be recorded on a
      post-operative patient activity diary recording the following tasks: a) work (if applicable),
      b) domestic tasks, c) driving a vehicle (if applicable) and d) physical exercise (if
      applicable). Additional information regarding post-operative pain (measured on a Likert
      scale), potential complications of each technique, such as tearing of the bag or leakage, and
      peri- and post-operative outcomes will be collected. In order to aid in detection of leakage,
      blue dye (either indigo carmine or methylene blue) will be added to the containment bag prior
      to morcellation.
