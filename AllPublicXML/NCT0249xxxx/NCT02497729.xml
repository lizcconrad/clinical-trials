  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of a written, pre-procedure checklist and positioning the patient with the head of
      the bed elevated have been proposed as interventions capable of preventing complications
      during non-elective intubation and are used intermittently in routine care -- however neither
      have been examined in a prospective trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endotracheal intubation is common in the care of critically ill patients. Procedural
      complications including hypoxia and hypotension are frequent in urgent and emergent
      intubation and associated with an increased risk of death. The use of a written,
      pre-procedure checklist and positioning the patient with the head of the bed elevated have
      been proposed as interventions capable of preventing complications during non-elective
      intubation and are used intermittently in routine care -- however neither have been examined
      in a prospective trial. The investigators propose a randomized trial comparing use of a
      written checklist versus no written checklist and ramped versus sniffing position for
      endotracheal intubation of critically ill adults.
