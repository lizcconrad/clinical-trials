  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effects of Leukocyte reduced cold-stored platelet
      transfusions used in treatment of immediate postoperative blood loss in patients undergoing
      thoracic surgery in combination with extracorporal circulation. Today platelet concentrates
      are stored at 22 degrees C .

      This is a prospective, randomized, unblinded, non-inferiority two-arm study. Aimn of study is
      to compare platelet function in bleeding patients transfused with leukoreduced platelet
      concentrates stored cold (4 degrees C) and in room temperature (22 degrees C). Patients with
      expected time on extracorporal circulation more than 120 minutes and/or medical platelet
      inhibitors will be included.

      Platelet function will be assessed by use of Multiplate Aggregometry, Thromboelastography
      (TEG) and/or Thromboelastometry (ROTEM). In addition post operative bleeding, and adverse
      events will be recorded.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, unblinded, non-inferiority two-arm study were Arm 1
      patients will receive Leukocyte reduced cold-stored platelet concentrates and Arm 2 patients
      will receive leukoreduced room-temperature-stored (22 degrees C) platelet concentrates.
      Patients with expected time on extracorporal circulation more than 120 minutes and/or medical
      platelet inhibitors will be included.

      The number of patients included is set to 30 patients in each arm, as there is not sufficient
      information available in the literature to conduct power calculations. The hypothesis is that
      cold stored platelets are not inferior to room temperature platelet concentrates.

      Baseline patient data and information on intervention and post operative recovery will be
      collected from the Medical journals together with information on transfusion episodes and
      Blood Components. Blood samples will be retrieved from study participants at specific
      intervals: baseline, immediately after surgery, at arrival at ICU, before and after (every)
      platelet transfusion episode, 24 hours post operation, and if indicated, during hospital
      stay. Blood samples will be investigated for platelet function, coagulation parameters,
      hematologic parameters, and other risk factors for adverse events. If transfusion reactions
      occur, additional test of patient and the Blood Component(s) transfused will be performed.
      Samples will be collected and stored in the biobank for cytokines, complement and allergy
      analysis.
