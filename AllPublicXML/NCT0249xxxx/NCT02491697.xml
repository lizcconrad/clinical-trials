  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prognosis of advanced breast cancer does not improve much recently although varies of
      adjuvant drugs have been tried.Dendritic cells co-cultured with cytokine-induced killer
      cells(DC-CIK) immunotherapy has been proved to improve survival in several cancers, but its
      role in advanced breast cancer stains unclear. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of DC-CIK immunotherapy combined with capecitabine versus capecitabine
      monotherapy for the treatment of advanced breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1.400 patients with advanced breast cancer should be definitively diagnosis based on
      histopathology, according to the 7th American Joint Committee on Cancer(AJCC) Cancer Staging
      Manual.

      2.All patients will be randomly divided into group A（DC-CIK immunotherapy combined with
      capecitabine ) or group B（capecitabine monotherapy).

      3.Patients in group A will receive 4 cycles of DC-CIK treatment (every 1 year) and
      capecitabine(continuous).Patients in group B will receive only capecitabine
      monotherapy(continuous) .

      4.The response is assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor Group (RECIST)
      guidelines.
