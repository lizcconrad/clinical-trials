  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) in children have been increasing
      in parallel at an alarming rate. In particular, the increasing prevalence of type 2 DM is
      attributable to genetic factors, clinical (waist circumference, adiposity and physical
      condition) and biochemical (insulin secretion and sensitivity, lipids and inflammation) risk,
      each of which represents an independent risk.

      As has already studied and published in the investigators' group, the child population of
      Toluca has greater expression of cardiovascular risk factors than their counterparts in
      Bogota, Colombia. The metabolic characterization of the young population of Toluca and Bogota
      with new biomarkers such as homocysteine and leptin is an activity that aims to provide more
      metabolic data affecting young people.

      Hypothesis:

      After six months of follow-up there will be a greater relative risk in Mexican population to
      have identified another component of metabolic syndrome compared to the young population of
      Colombia.

      Objective:

      To compare the expression levels of cardiovascular risk markers in young people between 5 and
      12 years of Toluca, Mexico and Bogota, Colombia.

      Material and methods:

      Type of study: prospective, descriptive, comparative, and longitudinal.

      Sample Calculation:

      For a cohort study and taking into account that in the investigators' previous publication in
      the Colombian population only 13% (sick rate in unexposed group) had an altered metabolic
      parameter; accepting an alpha risk of 0.05 and a beta of 0.2 on a risk bilateral contrast, 57
      subjects were required in the exposed group (Mexican population) and 57 in unexposed to
      detect a minimum relative risk of 3 to find other alteration to metabolic syndrome after six
      months follow-up.

      Measurements:

      The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) will be applied to all children.
      Dietary history of three days and physical examination (height in cm , weight in kg and waist
      circumference in centimeters) and blood pressure (mmHg) data will be recorded. Blood samples
      will be taken to analyze glucose, cholesterol, HDL, triglycerides, homocysteine and leptin.

      Statistics:

      Variables will be tested for normality through the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk
      formulas. Variables related to the physiological and metabolic functions and anthropometric
      measurements will be reported in mean and standard deviation. The differences in the
      laboratorial and anthropometrical variables will be analyzed with the Student t test. A
      difference will be considered significant with a p value ≤ 0.05. The statistical program used
      is the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 19.

    <description>After six months of a basal evaluation, children will be re-examined in each component of the metabolic syndrome.
Metabolic syndrome component detection will be determined by the measure of glucose (mg/dl), cholesterol (mg/dl), triglycerides (mg/dl), high-density lipoproteins (HDL), waist circumference (cm), hip circumference (cm) and blood pressure (mmHg).</description>
