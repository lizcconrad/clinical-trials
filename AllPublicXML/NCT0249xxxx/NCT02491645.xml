  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Around 69-95% of children with Autistic Spectrum Disorder are known to have sensory
      processing abnormalities .Tackling these problems would help in better quality of life, both
      for the parents and the children. Sensory integration therapy, an individualized clinic based
      therapy have been shown to have a positive effect on those children with sensory
      abnormalities. Hence the investigators are doing this study , to primarily look into the
      efficacy and feasibility of home based sensory interventions in autistic children with
      sensory processing abnormalities.

    <description>Children would receive both standard therapy and home based sensory interventions as described below,
Standard therapy - children would receive measures like speech and language services, behavioral interventions and educational program regularly as and when decided by the primary care physician. They would be individualized to child specific needs .
Home based sensory interventions - children would receive home based sensory interventions targeting visual and auditory system, tactile abnormalities, proprioceptive and vestibular abnormalities.These interventions would be carried out daily , at least 5 days a week, for a minimum duration of 1hour/day.</description>
