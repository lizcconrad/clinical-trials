    <textblock>
      The goal of this retrospective chart review is to evaluate if the implementation of lumbar
      plexus block placement for postoperative pain have improved conditions in the postoperative
      period for patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty when compared to the placement of
      epidurals for postoperative pain management.

      Primary outcome: 48 hour opiate consumption in patients following THA. ' Secondary outcome:
      Time to first ambulation, assistance needed with ambulation, opiate and regional related side
      effects, time to discharge orders.

    <description>This is a retrospective, cohort study utilizing electronic medical records to examine patients who underwent primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) at our institution from July,1 2012 till December 17, 2014. Based on previously published studies, 48 hour morphine consumption in the epidural group was expected to be 30mg +/-4mg. Assuming 30mg consumption in the epidural group, a sample size of 58 subjects per group was needed to provide 80% power to detect a 10% change from 30mg in morphine consumption between the epidural and lumbar plexus patients for a two-sided test at a significance level of Î± = 0.05. Calculations were based on a t-test hypothesis testing framework. Since the analysis involved repeated observations of each subject, power was likely underestimated.</description>
