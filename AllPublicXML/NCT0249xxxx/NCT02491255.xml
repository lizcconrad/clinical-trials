      The objective of this study is to confirm the safety and effectiveness of the Lotus™ Valve
      System in the Japanese medical environment for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR)
      in symptomatic subjects with calcific, severe native aortic stenosis who are considered at
      high or extreme risk for surgical valve replacement.

      A prospective, multicenter trial designed to confirm that the safety and effectiveness of the
      Lotus Valve System in the Japanese medical environment are consistent with the REPRISE III
      results for TAVR in symptomatic subjects who have calcific, severe native aortic stenosis and
      who are at extreme or high risk for surgical valve replacement.

        extreme operative risk for surgical valve replacement (see note below for definitions of
        extreme and high risk, the required level of surgical assessment, and CRC confirmation) and
        that TAVR is appropriate. Additionally, subject has at least one of the following.

                  replacement (CRC must confirm agreement with site heart team that subject meets
                  high or extreme risk definition)

        surgeon) assessment that the subject is likely to benefit from valve replacement.

        returning to the study hospital for all required scheduled follow up visits.

        IC8. Subject must be at least 20 years old.

        IC9. For subjects not suitable for iliofemoral access (because of caliber of the
        iliofemoral vessels, severe tortuosity or other factors preventing safe iliofemoral
        access), trans-aortic access is deemed appropriate by the heart team and confirmed by the
        CRC. This inclusion criterion is only applicable to the TAo substudy and the 21mm substudy
        if the transaortic approach is used.
