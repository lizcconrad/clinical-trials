      METHODOLOGY STUDY DESIGN. The study will be a prospective study. All the patients will be
      randomized into two groups, B and BD. In group B, patients will receive 1 ml/kg bupivacaine
      0.25% (maximum volume = 20 ml). In group BD, patients will receive a mixture of 0.2 mg/kg
      dexamethasone in 1 ml/kg bupivacaine 0.25% (maximum volume = 20 ml). The total volume
      injected will be 1 ml/kg in all patients.

      RESEARCH SETTING. The study will take place at Gbagada, Alimosho and Ifako Ijaye General
      Hospitals in Lagos.

      They are all secondary health care facilities with 800 bed spaces in Gbagada, 400 at Alimosho
      and 300 at Ifako Ijaye. General Hospital Gbagada was established in 1983 and situated in
      Gbagada, Alimosho in 2006, situated at Igando while Ifako ijaye was created in 2005 and
      located at Ifako. These three areas are densely populated suburbs of Lagos.

      SAMPLE SIZE ESTIMATION. The minimum sample size for this study was calculated with the
      formula below 21

      n= z 2 x p x q d2 Assuming a 95% interval, 5% level of precision and a proportion of 90% 21 .

      Where n =minimum sample size Z =a constant (1.96 ;) a percentage point on standard normal
      deviation corresponding to 95% confidence interval.

      P =proportion of patient with positive dexamethasone analgesic effect obtained from a past
      study. (90%) 21 Q = complimentary probability; equivalent to (1-p) d =predetermined level of
      precision equivalent to 5% n= (1.96) 2 x 0.90 x.055 0.05 =76.0 approximated to 80 Sample size
      will be increased by 20% to provide for attrition=16 Therefore, sample size will be 80+16=96

      RANDOMIZATION After local ethics committee approval and a written informed consent has been
      obtained from parents or legal guardians, 96 patients undergoing elective unilateral inguinal
      herniotomy will be selected for this prospective randomized-controlled trial.

      Patients would be distributed into two equal groups: group B (n = 48), in which the caudal
      block will be performed using only bupivacaine, and group BD (n = 48), in which the caudal
      block will be performed using dexamethasone added to bupivacaine. The distribution will be by
      simple randomization method using computer generated random numbers.

      Numbers 1-96 will be randomly distributed into the two groups with each group having a total
      of 48 patients.

      ALLOCATION CONCEALMENT MECHANISM The patients will be seen at least a day before surgery for
      preoperative assessment.

      All patients would be fasted according to the AMERICAN SOCIETY OF ANESTHESIOLOGY (ASA)
      guidelines (2 h for clear fluids; 4 h for breast milk; 6 h for formula milk or light meal).
      No premedication will be administered and an informed written consent form will be filled by
      parent or guardian after adequate explanation of the scope of the study to parent or guardian
      and the older child as the case may be.

      All patients will have routine investigations performed. There will be two residents
      recruited as research assistants.Post emergence, the first ,assistant(who is also unaware of
      the group allocation)is to observe patient in the recovery room post operatively hence
      methods of pain assessment post operatively will be discussed with this research assistant.

      The second research assistant assigns participants to interventions and prepares the drugs.
      This assistant stays outside the operating room but within the theatre environ as he holds
      the key to the code.

      Using the sealed envelope technique, numbers 1-96 is placed in an envelope from which a
      research assistant allows patients parent or legal guardian to randomly pick a number.

      The research assistant then compares with the computer generated random sequence to determine
      which of the groups the patient belongs.

      Both the patient and investigator will be blinded to the allocation. All drugs will be
      prepared aseptically by this research assistant. The assistant would prepare the drugs. On
      arrival at the operating room, routine standard monitors would be applied
      (Electrocardiograph, noninvasive blood pressure, and pulse oximetry) and baseline vital signs
      taken.

      General anesthesia would be induced by the investigator (who is unaware of the group
      allocation) with incremental dose of halothane from 0.5- 2% in 100% oxygen. After induction
      of anesthesia, an intravenous line would be placed, followed by the insertion of an
      appropriately sized laryngeal mask airway which will be secured with tapes.

      When an adequate depth of anesthesia is attained, anesthesia would be maintained using
      isoflurane 1-2% in 100% oxygen. No muscle relaxants will be administered and the patients
      would breathe spontaneously using Mapleson F till the end of surgery. After properly securing
      the laryngeal mask airway, patients will be turned to the left lateral position.

      Under complete aseptic conditions caudal block will be performed using a 25-G short beveled
      needle. Correct placement of the needle will be confirmed by the characteristic 'pop' felt as
      the sacrococcygeal membrane when penetrated.

      The stilet will be removed while the plastic cannula is secured. Correct placement in the
      epidural space will be confirmed by absence of cerebrospinal fluid flow and absence of
      swelling during injection of drugs which occurs with a subcutaneous insertion.

      The investigator, who is the anesthesiologist performing the block would be blinded to the
      identity of the drug used as the epidural injectate for all patients would be presented in a
      20 mls syringe containing 20mls of a colourless, odourless, non-particulate solution of which
      the investigator who is the performer of the caudal block gives a dose of 1ml/kg.

      The codes B and BD are only known to the research assistant who prepared the drugs and only
      discloses the codes at the end of the study or in the event of an adverse reaction to any of
      the drugs used in the study.

      The end of injection will be taken as zero time. Surgery would commence 10 min after the
      block is performed to allow for the drugs to take effect.

      A standardized intraoperative fluid therapy will be used in all patients (10 ml/kg/h of
      normal saline solution). Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and arterial
      oxygen saturation (SpO2) would be recorded using non invasive blood pressure monitor and
      pulse oxymetry before induction and then every 5 min after induction of anesthesia till the
      end of surgery.

      During the intraoperative period, adequacy of analgesia would be assessed by hemodynamic
      stability, which would be defined by the absence of an increase of more than 20% in HR or MAP
      compared with pre incision values. An increase of more than 20% in HR or MAP would be
      considered an indication of inadequate analgesia and managed by a bolus dose of intravenous
      paracetamol 15 mg/kg, followed by further doses of intravenous diclofenac 1mg/kg if needed.
      The need for intraoperative analgesics would be recorded.Such patient will be considered as
      part of attrition.

      At the end of surgery, isoflurane is switched off and LMA is extubated when patient is awake.

      Emergence time (the time from end of surgery to opening of the eyes on calling the patients
      name) and a delayed anesthetic emergence (considered if 20 minutes elapsed from the end of
      surgery to exiting the operating theatre) were noted.

      After recovery, when the patients are able to maintain a patent airway, they would be
      transferred to the recovery room, where they remain for at least 2 h before being transferred
      to the ward. Post operative pain and hemodynamic variables (MAP and HR) would be recorded at
      the recovery room and then every 30 min till the patient is discharged to the ward after 3
      hours. Postoperative pain will be assessed using a modified Objective Pain Score (mOPS) every
      30 min for the first 2 h and at 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 18, and 24 h postoperatively. This score
      includes five criteria: crying, agitation, movement, posture, and localization of pain. Each
      criterion is assigned a score from 0 to 2, with 2 being the worst, to yield a possible total
      score of 0-10 [5]. If the mOPS score is 4 or more, rescue analgesia in the form of
      paracetamol 15 mg/kg orally would be administered. Further boluses of paracetamol 15 mg/kg
      would be administered orally every 4 h if required.

      Residual motor block and sedation level will be also assessed at 30 min and at 1, 2, 4, and 6
      h after surgery. Motor block will be assessed using a modified Bromage scale consisting of
      four points [0 = full motor strength (flexion of knees and feet), 1 = flexion of knees, 2 =
      little movement of feet only, 3 = no movement of knees or feet] [29]. The sedation score
      will; be assessed using a four-point scale (1, alert and aware; 2, asleep, arousable by
      verbal contact; 3, asleep, arousable by physical contact; and 4, asleep, not arousable).

      After transferring to the ward, rescue analgesia consumption, pain scores,the occurrence of
      postoperative vomiting during the first 24h after surgery will be recorded. Any other
      complications including itching, urine retention (no voiding of urine for 6 hour
      postoperative), respiratory depression (respiratory rate&lt;10 breaths/min), hypotension (MAP
      decreased&gt;20% of baseline), or bradycardia (HR decreased&gt;20% of baseline) would be recorded
      by a research assistant for 24 hours. Any undesirable effect will be treated as follows; for
      shivering, patient is covered, given warm intravenous fluids, theatre room temperature is
      increased, for itching; intravenous chlorpheniramine is given, metoclopramide for vomiting,
      for urinary retention a catheter is passed.

      The time to first supplemental oral paracetamol from the end of surgery to the first modified
      objective pain score of greater than or equal to 4 will be recorded.

      The time to first micturition post caudal block and the incidence of bladder catheterization
      would also be recorded.

      The postoperative data in the recovery room would be recorded by the second research
      assistant mentioned above, this is the second research assistant mentioned above, a resident
      who was also blinded to the drugs used during the caudal block.

      The assistant would be with the patient in the recovery room for at least 3 hours before
      being transferred to the ward.

      MEASUREMENT Data will be collected using a data collection form designed by the investigator.

      Patients' blood pressure is measured with a noninvasive blood pressure monitor, heart rate
      and arterial oxygen saturation (SPO2) will be measured with a pulse oximeter and respiratory
      rate will be counted. These vital signs will be recorded at 2 minutes, 5 minutes and
      thereafter at 10 minutes interval throughout the course of surgery.
