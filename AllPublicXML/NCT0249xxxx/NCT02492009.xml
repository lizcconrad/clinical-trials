  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) of an electronic patient
      decision aid (PDA) for antidepressant use in pregnancy. The overall aim of this pilot RCT is
      to establish the feasibility of future large international RCT of the PDA's effectiveness.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression in pregnancy is common, affecting up to 10% of women and represents serious risk
      to mother and infant. Unfortunately, antidepressant medication, a first-line treatment for
      depression in pregnancy, also comes with risks, making this a complex decision. Clinical care
      appears to be insufficient for ensuring that women make decisions that are consistent with
      their own values and with which they feel satisfied. Patient decision support tools can
      address such barriers. Canadian colleagues have created a patient decision aid (PDA) that has
      the potential to improve the decision-making process for women regarding antidepressant use
      in pregnancy in conjunction with clinical care. This study is a pilot RCT of the above PDA in
      London, to be conducted in parallel with a pilot RCT in Toronto.The overall objective of this
      project is to inform the development of a larger, international RCT to assess the efficacy of
      this PDA for antidepressant use in pregnancy. To achieve this objective, the investigators
      will assess the feasibility of the trial protocol to evaluate the PDA and determine the
      preliminary effect size for a larger multisite efficacy study. The primary outcome for this
      pilot study is the feasibility of conducting a large randomized controlled trial to evaluate
      the efficacy of the PDA. This includes feasibility (how well the trial protocol can be
      implemented), acceptability (usability and tolerability of the intervention) and adherence
      (the degree to which the trial protocol is followed). It is hypothesized that the protocol
      will be feasible, that the PDA will have a high degree of acceptability, and that adherence
      to the protocol will be high.
