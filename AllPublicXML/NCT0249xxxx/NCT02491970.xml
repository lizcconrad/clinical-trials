    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate superiority of Fluticasone/Formoterol
      (Flutiform®) to Fluticasone/salmeterol based on the small airway function by assessing the
      Impulse Oscillometic System (IOS) in uncontrolled asthma patients requiring ICS/LABA
      concomitant treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adult (over 19 years) asthma patients

          2. Patients who have a history of mild-to-moderate-severe, persistent asthma for at least
             6 months prior to Screening.

          3. Patients who were required to demonstrate a FEV1 of ≥ 40 % and ≤ 85% of predicted
             normal values during screening period following appropriate withholding of asthma
             medications (if applicable).

          4. Patients who were required to show reversibility of ≥15% FEV1 after salbutamol
             inhalation (2 actuations, 100µg per actuation) from the pre- salbutamol value at
             screening

          5. Patients who have uncontrolled asthma by Seretide® 250/50 defined as ACT less than 20

          6. Patients who showed R5-20 more than 0.1 kPa/L/s

          7. Blood eosinophil count &gt; 300/µL on screening visit

          8. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at
