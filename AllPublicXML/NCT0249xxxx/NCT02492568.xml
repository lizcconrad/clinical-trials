  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the increase in Overall Response Rate (ORR) in the pembrolizumab alone arm
      compared to the pembrolizumab after SBRT arm at 12 weeks
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that in a significant subset of patients with recurrent NSCLC
      immunotherapy after SBRT will be superior to treatment with immunotherapy alone and that
      SBRT, given to a single metastatic site of the tumor, will augment the immune response to the
      tumor. Objectives: Disease Control Rate (DCR), defined as the percentage of patients having a
      complete response, partial response or stable disease at 12 weeks, PFS, defined as time from
      randomization to disease progression or death, OS, defined as time from randomization to
      death (of any cause). Toxicity.

             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial
             treatment.

          3. Has had a prior monoclonal antibody within 4 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not
             recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to agents
             administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          4. Has had prior chemotherapy or targeted small molecule therapy within 4 weeks prior to
             study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse
             events due to a previously administered agent.

               -  Note: Subjects with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this criterion and
                  may qualify for the study.

               -  Note: If subjects received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately
                  from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting

        evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the
        results of the trial, interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of
        the trial, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of
        the treating investigator.

        13. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
        cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

        14. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
        projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit through
        120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.

        15. Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CD137, or
        anti-Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) antibody (including ipilimumab or
        any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or checkpoint
        pathways).

        16. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).

        17. Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA
        [qualitative] is detected).

        18. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment.
