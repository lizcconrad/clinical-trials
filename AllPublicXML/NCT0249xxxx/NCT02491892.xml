  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of pertuzumab (rhuMAb 2C4) in participants
      with metastatic breast cancer which has progressed during or after standard chemotherapy and
      which is not amenable to curative therapy. Those who are maintaining a response to therapy or
      who have stable disease at the end of the formal study period will continue treatment until
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Approximately 120 participants will be
      enrolled.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving a Best Overall Response of Confirmed Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 1 year (at Baseline; every 6 weeks for the first 8 cycles, then every 12 weeks until progression or death; and up to 4 weeks after initial response)</time_frame>
    <description>Objective tumor response was assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Confirmed CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions, and confirmed PR was defined as at least at 30 percent (%) decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions. Response was to be confirmed at follow-up assessment completed within 4 weeks of the first documented response. The percentage of participants achieving a best overall response of CR or PR was calculated as [number of participants meeting the above criteria divided by the number analyzed] multiplied by 100.</description>

    <description>Objective tumor response was assessed using RECIST. Confirmed CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions, and confirmed PR was defined as at least at 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions. Response was to be confirmed at follow-up assessment completed within 4 weeks of the first documented response. Time to response was defined as the time from treatment start to first documented response (ie, CR or PR). Participants with stable disease (SD) were censored from the last tumor assessment, and those with progressive disease (PD) or death were assigned an artificial censoring time of 1000 days.

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving a Best Overall Response of Confirmed Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR)</title>
        <description>Objective tumor response was assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Confirmed CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions, and confirmed PR was defined as at least at 30 percent (%) decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions. Response was to be confirmed at follow-up assessment completed within 4 weeks of the first documented response. The percentage of participants achieving a best overall response of CR or PR was calculated as [number of participants meeting the above criteria divided by the number analyzed] multiplied by 100.</description>

        <title>Time to Response Among Participants Achieving a Best Overall Response of Confirmed CR or PR</title>
        <description>Objective tumor response was assessed using RECIST. Confirmed CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions, and confirmed PR was defined as at least at 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions. Response was to be confirmed at follow-up assessment completed within 4 weeks of the first documented response. Time to response was defined as the time from treatment start to first documented response (ie, CR or PR). Participants with stable disease (SD) were censored from the last tumor assessment, and those with progressive disease (PD) or death were assigned an artificial censoring time of 1000 days. Time to response was estimated using Kaplan-Meier and expressed in weeks.</description>

        <title>Volume of Distribution at Steady State (Vss) of Pertuzumab</title>
        <description>Serum samples were obtained for PK assessment using a receptor-binding ELISA. Pertuzumab concentrations at each collection point were used to determine the Vss by non-compartmental analysis, defined as the theoretical volume at which the total amount of pertuzumab would be uniformly distributed to produce the desired concentration. The derived value was averaged among all participants and expressed in milliliters (mL).</description>
