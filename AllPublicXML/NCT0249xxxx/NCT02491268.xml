  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidemiological, clinicopathological and animal studies show that vascular disease in various
      forms contributes to cognitive decline. Increasing age is the strongest risk for dementia
      irrespective of whether it results from a vascular etiology or neurodegenerative disease
      processes such as in Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD and vascular cognitive impairment, the two
      most common causes of dementia, represent two extremes of a spectrum of disorders; however, a
      number of entities, which possess varying degrees of neurodegenerative and vascular
      pathologies, occur in between. The pure forms of the disorders are preferred for convenience
      to label, treat or manage but conditions within the spectrum are the norm rather than the
      exception as dementia advances. Therefore, combinatorial therapy directed at both vascular
      and neurodegenerative aspects of dementia is a promising approach for the treatment of
      dementia in the elderly.

      Cilostazol acts as an antiplatelet agent and has other pleiotropic effects based on
      phosphodiesterase-3-dependent mechanisms. Increasing evidence suggests that cilostazol offers
      endothelial protection, via pleiotropic effects. Intriguingly, cilostazol has been shown to
      decrease amyloid beta (Abeta) accumulation and protect Abeta-induced cognitive deficits in an
      experimental model. In a pilot study of 10 patients with moderate AD (mean MMSE score, 11.9
      points) who received donepezil, cilostazol add-on treatment for 5-6 months demonstrated
      significantly increased MMSE score in comparison to baseline. Moreover, cilostazol was shown
      to be effective in preventing cognitive decline in patients with AD with cerebrovascular
      diseases, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and mild dementia who received donepezil.

      These results highlight the need for a comprehensive prospective cohort study to analyze the
      effect of cilostazol on the preservation of cognitive function in patients with early-stage
      cognitive impairment, namely MCI.
