    <textblock>
      A single visit &amp; single arm study in 80 subjects with diabetes to determine if a short
      educational experience with a new blood glucose meter feature improves the ability of each
      subject to better classify glucose results into acceptable glucose ranges.

    <description>Subjects experience a computer stimulation of a new meter feature ( colour range indicator) to help subjects interpret whether blood glucose results are low, in-range or high based on accepted guidance.</description>

    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Education with new meter feature.</intervention_name>
    <description>The blood glucose meter has default settings for the colour range indicator which can be customized by the subjects and/or their healthcare professional. This colour range indicator will be presented to the subjects as a computer simulation to show subjects a range of typical blood glucose values and how this new feature would classify these results as being low (blue), in-range (green) or high (red).</description>
