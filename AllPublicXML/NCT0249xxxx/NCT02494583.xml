  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) as first-line treatment for participants with
      advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma. Participants will be
      randomly assigned to one of the three treatment arms of the study: pembrolizumab as
      monotherapy, or pembrolizumab + cisplatin + 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or capecitabine, or placebo
      + cisplatin + 5-FU or capecitabine. The primary study hypotheses are that pembrolizumab in
      combination with chemotherapy is superior to chemotherapy alone in terms of Progression-free
      Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS) in participants with programmed death-ligand 1
      (PD-L1) Combined Positive Score (CPS) ≥1 and that pembrolizumab combination with chemotherapy
      is superior to chemotherapy alone in terms of OS in participants with PD-L1 CPS ≥10. Primary
      study hypotheses also are that pembrolizumab monotherapy non-inferior to chemotherapy alone
      in terms of OS in participants PD-L1 CPS ≥1 and is superior to chemotherapy alone in terms of
      OS in participants with PD-L1 CPS ≥1 and in participants with PD-L1 CPS ≥10.
