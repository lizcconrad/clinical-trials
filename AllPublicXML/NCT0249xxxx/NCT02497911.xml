  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective randomized controlled trial comparing intraarticular catheters and
      adductor canal catheters for postoperative analgesia following a primary Total Knee
      Arthroplasty (TKA).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial comparing two methods of
      postoperative analgesia following primary TKA. Eligible primary TKA patients must be ASA I -
      III and require less than 20 mg oxycodone daily (or its equivalent). Exclusion criteria are:
      allergy to anesthetics, contraindication to regional anesthesia, sensory/motor disorder
      involving operative limb, non-english speaking, ASA IV or greater, psychiatric or cognitive
      disorders, incarceration, renal insufficiency with Cr &gt; 2.0 and hepatic failure. When
      patients agree to participate in the study the following data will be collected by the
      research staff: ASA physical status, age, height, weight, gender, quantitative opiate use,
      numeric pain score with visual descriptors, painDETECT score (form included), WOMAC score
      (form included) and baseline Pain Management Questionnaire. When designated through
      randomization, intra-articular catheters will be placed intraoperatively by the surgeons, per
      usual protocol. ACC's will be placed postoperatively in the PACU. The catheters will exit the
      bandage in a similar fashion to blind the personnel collecting data, postoperatively. Those
      collecting data will not be blinded from identifying patients in the control group, as no
      catheter will exit the bandage. Potential risks for each procedure, which will be explained
      to the patient, include: bleeding, local infection, local anesthetic toxicity in the form of
      seizure and cardiac arrest and neuropathy. The preceding are commonly listed though
      infrequent complications of both procedures. Continuous ultrasound will guide the placement
      of the ACC.

    <description>Postoperatively, patients will be brought to the PACU. The needle insertion site, approximately 10cm proximal to their operative knee, will be exposed. A sterile field will be utilized and the femoral artery is identified with a high frequency linear transducer proximal to the operative knee. 18g insulated Tuohy needle will be inserted in an out-of-plane approach through the sartorius muscle to a final location in close proximity to the saphenous nerve. Once satisfied with needle placement and following negative aspiration, 15 cc's of 0.5% ropivicaine will be injected through the needle under visualization. A 20-g multi-orifice catheter will be inserted approximately 4 cm beyond the needle tip and secured.</description>
