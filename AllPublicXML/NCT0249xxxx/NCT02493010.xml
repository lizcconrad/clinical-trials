  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to examine the safety, usability and preliminary
      efficacy of a novel arousal-based biofeedback system in alleviating social anxiety. The
      investigators hypothesize that after 4 weeks of hour-long interventions, participants will
      show reductions pre- and post-intervention in their Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale scores.

  <detailed_description>

      The investigators plan to conduct a waitlist control trial.

      Intervention consists of a combination of computerized cognitive behavioral therapy and
      arousal-based Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy. During the latter component, the
      physiological variables of participants, such as pulse rate and EEG, will be continuously
      monitored and presented as feedback to them. Participants will have to deliver speeches to
      videotaped audiences while striving to regulate their physiological arousal.

    <description>Participants will undergo a 4-week intervention (once per week, 1 hour each session). Each intervention session consists of approximately 30 minutes of computerized cognitive behavioral therapy, and 30 minutes of Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy with our novel arousal-based biofeedback system. For Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy, the physiological variables of participants will be continuously monitored and presented to them as feedback. Participants will have to deliver speeches to videotaped audiences while striving to regulate their physiological arousal.</description>
