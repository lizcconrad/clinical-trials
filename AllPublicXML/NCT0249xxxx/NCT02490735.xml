  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy is the main treatment method for patients with Esophageal Cancer. However,
      Relapse remains the major cause of treatment failure.Biological therapies such as CIK
      stimulate the immune system and stop tumor cells from growing. A series of studies reported
      that cytokine-induced killer cells (CIK) have a broad anti-tumor spectrum. The investigators
      suppose that CIK will improve the prognosis. Combining chemotherapy with biological therapy
      may kill more tumor cells. In this study, the patients will be treated with CIK cells after
      chemotherapy. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of CIK for Esophageal
      Cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      About 2000 patients with staging I-III of Esophageal Cancer, after accepting chemotherapy,
      will be randomly divided into group A (receive CIK treatment) or group B (just regularly
      follow up), and the randomize ratio will be 1:1. Patients in group A will receive 3 cycles of
      CIK cells treatment (every 12 weeks). Patients in group B will have no anti-tumor therapy.
