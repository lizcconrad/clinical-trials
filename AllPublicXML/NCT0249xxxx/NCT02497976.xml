      A Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo Controlled Trial of Certolizumab Pegol in Women with
      Refractory Interstitial Cystitis/Bladder Pain Syndrome
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Interstitial cystitis (IC) is a chronic disabling bladder syndrome characterized by urinary
      frequency, nocturia, urinary urgency, and pain or discomfort with bladder filling. There is
      no cure for IC and the treatment options are suboptimal. Patients with IC report significant
      negative effects on their physical and mental quality of life. The etiology of IC is unknown.
      Certain aspects of IC suggest that autoimmunity may play a role in initiating or sustaining
      the chronic inflammatory response. Bladder biopsies of patients with IC demonstrate an
      increase number of mast cells. Mast cell activation with the release of tumor necrosis factor
      (TNF) may mediate this bladder inflammation. Cimzia (certolizumab pegol) is a medication that
      blocks the effect of TNF. Cimzia (certolizumab pegol) is FDA approved for the treatment of
      rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and Crohn's disease. These
      diseases are similar to IC. In this study, the hypothesis being tested is that Cimzia
      (certolizumab pegol) will show efficacy in improving the symptoms of patients with IC.

    <time_frame>Week 2</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-reported global response assessment (GRA) such as &quot;Compared to when you began this trial, how would you rate your IC symptoms now?&quot; Study subjects reported their response to treatment of their pain, urgency, and overall status compared to their condition at trial start with a symmetric scale global response assessment (GRA) 28 at weeks 2, 4, 10, and 18. Possible responses were markedly worse (100% worse), moderately worse (50% worse), slightly worse (25% worse), no change (0% improvement), slightly improved (25% improvement), moderately improved (50% improvement), and markedly improved (100% improved). Treatment responders were defined by rating the GRA as moderately improved or markedly improved.</description>

    <measure>IC/BPS Symptoms Assessment With the Interstitial Cystitis Symptom Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Value at Weeks 2, 4, 10 and 18 minus Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Interstitial Cystitis Symptom Index is one of the two O'Leary-Sant Interstitial Cystitis Symptom and Problem Indexes. This scale has a 0 if the patient has no symptoms and a maximum of 19 with severe symptoms. Lubeck et al. validated ICSI as a valid measure of change in treatment outcome studies. A change of -4.03 in the ICSI score was the same as a 2 point improvement in GRA. Propert et al. validated the ICSI as responsive to change in IC/BPS symptoms and was recommended as secondary endpoints in clinical trials. A change of -2.4 in the ICSI score was the same as a 2 point improvement in GRA.</description>

          <description>Subjects rated the presence and extent of IC/BPS symptoms by completing the O'Leary-Sant Interstitial Cystitis Symptom Index and the O’Leary-Sant Interstitial Cystitis Problem Index (ICPI) at baseline and at weeks 2, 4, 10, and 18. Lubeck et al validated ICSI as a valid measure of change in treatment outcome studies. Propert et al validated the ICSI as responsive to change in IC/BPS symptoms and was recommended as secondary endpoints in clinical trials. No urinary symptoms would have a score of 0. The most severe symptoms would be a maximum of 35. Normal patients have a value of 7 or less.</description>

        <description>Patient-reported global response assessment (GRA) such as “Compared to when you began this trial, how would you rate your IC symptoms now?” Study subjects reported their response to treatment of their pain, urgency, and overall status compared to their condition at trial start with a symmetric scale global response assessment (GRA) 28 at weeks 2, 4, 10, and 18. Possible responses were markedly worse (100% worse), moderately worse (50% worse), slightly worse (25% worse), no change (0% improvement), slightly improved (25% improvement), moderately improved (50% improvement), and markedly improved (100% improved). Treatment responders were defined by rating the GRA as moderately improved or markedly improved.</description>

This scale has a 0 if the patient has no symptoms and a maximum of 19 with severe symptoms. Lubeck et al. validated ICSI as a valid measure of change in treatment outcome studies. A change of -4.03 in the ICSI score was the same as a 2 point improvement in GRA. Propert et al. validated the ICSI as responsive to change in IC/BPS symptoms and was recommended as secondary endpoints in clinical trials. A change of -2.4 in the ICSI score was the same as a 2 point improvement in GRA.</description>
