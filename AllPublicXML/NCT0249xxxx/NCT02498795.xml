    <textblock>
      The accomplishment of a treatment with Intratissue Percutaneous Electrolysis of additional
      form to the accomplishment of eccentric exercise's program in patients with chronic patellar
      tendinopathy is more effective than the accomplishment of an additional treatment with dry
      needling or eccentric exercise's program realized of isolated form.

      Experimental study randomized with double blind, whose purpose is to compare three protocols
      in those who apply different protocols of physical therapy to themselves in three groups of
      intervention with patients with chronic patellar tendinopathy.

      There take part in this study young women of both sexes, of Zaragoza and of different sports
      clubs of entity 18 and 40 years, that they realize of habitual form (minimum 3 times a week)
      a sport. All of them present chronic patellar tendinopathy.
