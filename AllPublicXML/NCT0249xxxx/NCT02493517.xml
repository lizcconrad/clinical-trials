    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has active acromegaly defined as elevated GH and IGF-1 levels (measured at a
             central laboratory) as outlined below:

               -  A serum level for IGF-1 ≥1.3 x upper limit of normal range (ULN) during the
                  screening period (applicable to both treatment naïve subjects and subjects who
                  have stopped treatment and undergone a washout period prior to Visit 1(Week -4).

               -  Subjects must have mean serum GH concentration ≥2.5 μg/L in a GH cycle (5 samples
                  taken at 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes) during the screening period.

          -  The subject has undergone surgical removal of an adenoma for acromegaly at least 3
             months prior to Screening, or is likely to require pituitary surgery in the future but
             not before completing at least 32 weeks of study treatment plus an additional follow
             up of 8 weeks for subjects taking part in the pharmacokinetics (PK) extension, or for
             whom pituitary surgery is not an option (due to contraindications, refusal etc.) and
             is therefore never likely to undergo pituitary surgery.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has been treated with radiotherapy within 10 years prior to Screening.

          -  The subject has been treated with lanreotide Autogel, lanreotide PR, pegvisomant,
             cabergoline or octreotide LAR within 3 months of Screening or octreotide immediate
             release (IR) or bromocriptin within 2 weeks of Screening.

          -  The subject has a history of or currently presents with clinically significant
             ventricular or atrial dysrhythmias ≥Grade 2, using the National Cancer Institute
             Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v4.0.

          -  The subject has uncontrolled diabetes (glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) &gt;8.5%).
