  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Viral self-limiting infections in respiratory organs among children are common in primary
      care. Serious infections have low prevalence and are challenging to distinguish from
      self-limiting infections.

      Prescription of antibiotics in primary care is still high but stable since 2009 in Norway,
      and 90% of all antibiotics are prescribed in primary care.

      C-reactive protein (CRP) has been especially popular in Norway for point-of-care testing in
      primary care, but its role in ruling-out serious infections and the cut-off value for
      prescribing antibiotics has been discussed a lot.

      The aim of this study is to identify if pretesting with CRP of all children 0-6 year with
      fever or respiratory symptoms at Out-of-Hours Services will affect the prescription of
      antibiotics and the referral to hospital for children.

      Design: A randomized controlled observational study including children 0-6 year with fever
      and/or respiratory symptoms at 4 different Out-of-hour Services and at 1 Emergency Children
      Department Clinic at a hospital (open clinic). The data consist of clinical data and
      anamnestic information from a nurse at OOH-service collected before the consultation, the
      doctor's journal and a questionnaire to parents before the consultation and 1 week after the
      consultation.
