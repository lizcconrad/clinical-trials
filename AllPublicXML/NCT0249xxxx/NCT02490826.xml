    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to develop software as a tool in speech and language therapy
      for the treatment of children (Portuguese and English) with phonologically based Speech Sound
      Disorders (SSD). Further, this project aims to test the effectiveness of this approach with
      two groups of preschool and school aged children with phonologically based SSD, with one
      group consisting of European Portuguese (EP) speakers and one group of British English (BE)
      speakers. Performance across the two groups will be compared. The total duration of the
      project will be 30 month.

      The Table to Tablet (T2T) project aims to develop software as a tool in speech and language
      therapy for the treatment of children (Portuguese and English) with phonologically based
      Speech Sound Disorders (SSD). Further, this project aims to test the effectiveness of this
      approach with two groups of children aged between 3 years and 6 months and 6 years and 6
      months with phonologically based Speech Sound Disorders (SSD).

      One group consists of European Portuguese (EP) speakers and one group of British English (BE)
      speakers. Each group should include 20 children with the referred criteria and the
      performance across the two groups will be compared.

      The total duration of the project will be 30 month (software development over the first 12
      months and an intervention study during following 18 months).

      The T2T team includes 3 Speech and Language Therapists and 3 engineers/researchers plus a
      designer that will develop the T2T material.
