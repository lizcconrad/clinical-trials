    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well obinutuzumab works as maintenance treatment
      in patients with central nervous system lymphoma who have achieved the disappearance of all
      signs of cancer in response to treatment (complete response). Monoclonal antibodies, such as
      obinutuzumab, may kill cancer cells that are left after chemotherapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effect of maintenance obinutuzumab on duration of complete response (CR)
      in patients with cluster of differentiation (CD)20+ B-cell primary central nervous system
      lymphoma (PCNSL) who attain CR to first-line treatment with high-dose methotrexate-based
      chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate overall survival after CR (overall survival [OS]-CR). II. To evaluate
      neurocognitive function, quality of life, and neuroimaging as indicators of neurotoxicity.

      III. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival will be calculated.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I (MAINTENANCE THERAPY): Patients receive obinutuzumab intravenously (IV) on days 1 and 2
      for the first course, and on day 1 for the subsequent courses. Courses repeat every 60 days
      for 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II (OBSERVATION): Patients undergo observation for a total of 3 years.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  CD20+ B-cell primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) confirmed at the time of
             diagnosis by histology, cytology, or immunocytochemistry from cerebrospinal fluid
             (CSF); diagnosis must be documented by pathology report

          -  Must have undergone first-line treatment with a high-dose methotrexate-based
             chemotherapy regimen with or without brain radiotherapy; high-dose methotrexate is
             defined as &gt;= 3 grams/m^2; methotrexate dose reduction for creatinine clearance &lt; 100
             ml/min is permitted

          -  Must be within 90 days of completion of first-line treatment regimen; must have
             achieved complete response (CR/unconfirmed complete response [CRu]) to first-line
             treatment

          -  Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) documenting CR must be obtained within 30 days
             of study enrollment

          -  If CSF was positive for lymphoma cells at diagnosis or during first-line treatment
             and/or a slit lamp examination was positive at diagnosis or during first-line
             treatment, then the CSF and vitreal studies must have been repeated and must have
             indicated CR; Note: CR requires complete disappearance of all enhancing abnormalities
             on gadolinium-enhanced MRI; if CSF was positive for lymphoma cells at diagnosis or
             during first-line treatment and/or slit lamp examination was positive at diagnosis or
             during first-line treatment, then the CSF and vitreal studies must have been repeated
             and must have indicated CR; for CRu, some patients will have a small but persistent
             enhancing abnormality on MRI related to biopsy or focal hemorrhage; it is often
             difficult to ascertain whether this represents a residual nidus of tumor or scar
             tissue; if the abnormality does not change or slowly involutes without therapy and
             corticosteroids, it is reasonable to categorize as a CRu; at the time CR/CRu is
             determined, the patient should not have used corticosteroids for at least two weeks

          -  Karnofsky performance status (KPS) &gt;= 60; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 0,

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) =&lt; 5 x ULN

          -  Platelet &gt;= 75,000 cells/mm^3

          -  Hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL

          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1.5 x 10^9 cells/mm^3

          -  Surgically sterile or agree to use effective contraception using an adequate measure
             of contraception such as oral contraceptives, intrauterine device, or barrier method
             of contraception in conjunction with spermicidal jelly while receiving obinutuzumab
             and &gt;= 12 months after the last dose of obinutuzumab for women, and 3 months after the
             last dose of obinutuzumab for men

                  a malignancy that has been treated, but not with curative intent, will also be
                  excluded, unless the malignancy has been in remission without treatment for &gt;= 2
                  years prior to enrollment

          -  Known active bacterial, viral, fungal, mycobacterial, or other infection (excluding
             fungal infections of nail beds) or any major episode of infection requiring treatment

                  inclusion in the study on a case-by-case basis if they are hepatitis B viral
                  deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) negative and are willing to undergo ongoing HBV DNA
                  testing by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR); patients with positive
                  serology may be referred to a hepatologist or gastroenterologist for appropriate
                  monitoring and management

               -  Hepatitis C (HCV): patients with positive hepatitis C serology unless HCV
                  ribonucleic acid (RNA) is confirmed negative and may be considered for inclusion
