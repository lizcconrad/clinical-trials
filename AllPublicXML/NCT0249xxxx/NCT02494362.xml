      The purpose of the study is to determine whether a novel computer gaming hand exercise
      regimen would improve hand and arm function and be feasible in people with hemiplegia after
      Stroke affecting the hand.

      A novel computer gaming hand exercise regimen has been designed for people with hemiplegia
      after Stroke affecting the hand. The design allows a broad range of common objects of daily
      life to be seamlessly transformed into 'therapeutic' input devices by instrumenting with a
      small motion sense mouse. Based on individual abilities and treatment needs, objects are
      selected to train specific fine/ gross dexterous functions. The object manipulations
      (therapeutic exercises) are then used to control and play any commercially available computer
      game, making practice challenging and engaging.

      The study is of twelve weeks duration comparing the computer gaming and conventional hand
      exercises in ten people with hemiplegia after Stroke affecting the hand. The investigators
      hypothesize that the game based exercises will improve hand function and will be feasible. A
      mixed-effect repeated measures analysis of variance will be conducted to test pre to post
      treatment outcomes.

    <description>A novel, paddle game based hand function assessment tool has been developed designed to: 1) Objectively quantify the quality of finger hand movements (task performance) during manipulation of broad range of common objects independent of physical properties, anatomical requirements and task goal/context, 2) Track changes in finger hand function over time and 3) Aid in clinical decision making.</description>
