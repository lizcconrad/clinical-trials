    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, non-randomized, dose escalation and tumor-expansion phase
      I trial to evaluate safety and tolerability of INCSHR01210 in patients with advanced solid
      tumors. The trial will enroll subjects with advanced solid tumor who have failed current
      standard anti-tumor therapies.

    <description>3 dose levels are designed in this study: 1, 3 and 10 mg/kg.3 to 6 patients (traditional &quot;3+3&quot; design) will be enrolled in each dose cohort. INCSHR01210 injection at a dose of 1, 3 or 10 mg/kg is administered every 2 weeks (q2w, except in the first cycle).</description>

    <description>Part1: INCSHR01210 injection at a dose of 1, 3 or 10 mg/kg is administered every 2 weeks (3+3,q2w, except in the first cycle, in which subjects will be only dosed once on Day 1 for PK samplings and dose limiting toxicity observation). Response is assessed by every 2 cycles (4 weeks each cycle) by using irRECIST.
Part2: Additional patients (200mg dose cohorts will be enrolled in Part 2, depending on the data outcomes in Part 1, to further explore preliminarily clinical benefits of INCSHR01210 as well as the other objectives of the study.</description>
