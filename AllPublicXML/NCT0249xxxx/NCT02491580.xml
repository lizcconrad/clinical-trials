  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with previous malignancies have increasingly been accepted for renal
      transplantation. However, post-transplant malignancy risk and survival rates of these
      patients are unknown. Our aim was to assess if previous malignancies pose an unnecessarily
      high risk of post-transplant malignant tumours and if the organs as a resource are too
      limited for investment in this patient group.
