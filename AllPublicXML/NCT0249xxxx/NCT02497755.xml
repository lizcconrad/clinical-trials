      This research is a feasibility pilot study of a smartphone app using mixed methods. The
      research seeks to answer the question: &quot;Is a mobile health tool for patient self-management
      feasible, useful, appropriate, and acceptable for patients and care managers for patients
      with depression or anxiety treated in an integrated primary-care based behavioral health
      program?&quot;

    <measure>App Acceptability as Measured by Number of Patient App Users Who Rate App Easy to Use and Time Spent Reasonable</measure>
    <time_frame>Four weeks after intervention started</time_frame>
    <description>The number of patients who rated the app was easy to use and the amount of time spent using the app as reasonable when asked about app acceptability in a qualitative interview and via a quantitative survey. Specific survey items included &quot;The technology requires little effort to use,&quot; &quot;The technology was easy to learn how to use,&quot; &quot;The Ginger.io app is easy to use,&quot; and &quot;The time required to answer questions in the Ginger.io app is reasonable.&quot; All patients who expressed agreement (&quot;Somewhat Agree,&quot; &quot;Agree,&quot; or &quot;Strongly Agree&quot;) to these items and to similar questions in the qualitative interview were included in the count of patients who found the app acceptable.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Technology Acceptability as Measured by the Obtrusiveness Scale for Pervasive Technology (Modified)</measure>
    <time_frame>During weeks 3 and 8</time_frame>
    <description>The mean total of patient app users' responses to the modified version of the Obtrusiveness Scale for Pervasive Technology, with a mean score of 13-39 indicating that the app is generally perceived as unacceptable/obtrusive, 40-64 indicating neutrality, and 65-91 indicating that the app is generally perceived as acceptable/unobtrusive.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Satisfaction as Measured by the Ginger.io Product Feedback Survey.</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 30, 56</time_frame>
    <description>The mean total of patient app users' responses to the Ginger.io product feedback survey, with a mean score of 7-21 indicating satisfaction with the app, 22-34 neutrality, and 35-49 expressing dissatisfaction.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Use of the App as Measured by Percentage of App Surveys Completed.</measure>
    <time_frame>Eight weeks after intervention started</time_frame>
    <description>The mean percentage of surveys presented to users through the app that were completed by patient app users in their first 8 weeks of using the app. App survey questions included weekly PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scales and daily measures of mood and medication use as well as satisfaction surveys.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Care Team Communication as Measured by the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) - Communication Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 4 and 8</time_frame>
    <description>The mean total of patient app users' responses to the 6 items in the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) - Communication scale, with a mean score of 0-5 indicating that participants never or almost never experienced good communication with their care team, 6-11 indicating that participants sometimes experienced good communication with their care team, 12-17 indicating that patients usually experienced good communication with their care teams, and a score of 24 indicating that patients always experienced good communication with their care team.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Care Process Measures as Measured by the Number and Type of Contacts With Care Manager.</measure>
    <time_frame>Eight weeks after intervention started</time_frame>
    <description>The mean number of Follow-Up contacts between patient and care manager during the 8 weeks following the patient's activation of the app. (Other types of contacts with the care manager include Initial Assessment and Contact Attempt, but neither of these occurred during the time frame of app use.)</description>

          <title>Patient Mobile App Users</title>
          <description>Participants installed an app for smartphone to add to their treatment for depression and/or anxiety. This smartphone app sent psychoeducation and reminders to patients to complete self-report data, collected passive data, and provided aggregated information to a provider dashboard. Participants used the app for at least 4 weeks, with the option to continue use for up to 12 weeks. After 4 weeks, the research coordinator conducted a phone interview on satisfaction with the app.</description>
