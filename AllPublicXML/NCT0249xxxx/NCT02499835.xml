    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot trial studies vaccine therapy and pembrolizumab in treating patients
      with prostate cancer that does not respond to treatment with hormones (hormone-resistant) and
      has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). Vaccines made from deoxyribonucleic acid
      (DNA), such as pTVG-HP plasmid DNA vaccine, may help the body build an effective immune
      response to kill tumor cells. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may find tumor
      cells and help kill them. Giving pTVG-HP plasmid DNA vaccine and pembrolizumab may kill more
      tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety of pembrolizumab in combination with pTVG-HP (pTVG-HP plasmid DNA
      vaccine) in patients with castration-resistant, metastatic prostate cancer.

      II. To determine the 6-month progression-free survival and median time to radiographic
      progression in patients with castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer treated with
      pembrolizumab in combination with pTVG-HP.

      III. To evaluate the anti-tumor response rates (objective response rate and prostate specific
      antigen [PSA] response rate, using Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 [PCWG2]
      criteria) in patients with castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer treated with
      pembrolizumab in combination with pTVG-HP.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether either treatment sequence, or prostatic acid phosphatase
      (PAP)-specific immune response, is associated with prolonged (6-month) radiographic
      progression-free survival.

      II. To evaluate effects of schedule (concurrent versus delayed administration of
      pembrolizumab) on the magnitude of PAP-specific T-cell responses, programmed death receptor-1
      (PD-1) expression on circulating T cells, and ligands for PD-1 (PD-L1) expression on
      circulating epithelial cells (CEC) and on tumor biopsies.

      III. To determine the median time to radiographic progression using a concurrent
      administration schedule

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate effects of treatment on number of circulating tumor cells. II. To evaluate
      PAP-specific antibody responses following treatment with pembrolizumab and pTVG-HP DNA
      vaccine (pTVG-HP plasmid DNA vaccine).

      III. To determine whether either treatment sequence elicits immunologic antigen spread to
      other prostate-associated antigens.

      IV. To determine whether pre-existing or vaccine-induced PD-L1 expression on CEC or tumor
      biopsies is predictive of objective clinical response.

      V. To determine whether treatment elicits expression of other regulatory molecules on
      tumor-specific T cells (e.g. hepatitis A virus cellular receptor 2 [TIM3], B and T lymphocyte
      associated [BTLA], and lymphocyte-activation gene 3 [LAG3]) or tumor cells (e.g. tumor
      necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 14 [HVEM], phosphatidyl serine, ligands for
      programmed death receptor-2 [PD-2] [PD-L2]).

      VI. To determine whether PD-1-regulated antigen-specific T cells identified by trans vivo
      delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) testing can identify patients who develop objective
      clinical responses with PD-1 blockade therapy in combination with pTVG-HP.

      VII. To determine whether changes in lymph nodes and soft tissue tumor lesions are observed
      by fluorothymidine F-18 (FLT) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT)
      after treatment with vaccine with or without pembrolizumab.

      VIII. To determine if combination PD-1 inhibitor therapy in combination with pTVG-HP will
      change number and activity (SUV) in osteoblastic metastases.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive pTVG-HP plasmid DNA vaccine intradermally (ID) every other week on
      days 1, 15, 29, 43, 57, and 71 and pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes every 3
      weeks on days 1, 22, 43, and 64.

      ARM II: Patients receive pTVG-HP plasmid DNA vaccine ID as in Arm I and pembrolizumab IV over
      30 minutes every 3 weeks on days 85, 106, 127, and 148.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up 3, 6, 9, and 12 months and then
      annually for 2 years.

      ARM III: Extended Treatment. Patients received pTVG-HP + Pembrolizumab Extended Treatment

                  inhibitors prior to 28 days prior to registration may stay on these agents
                  throughout the course of therapy, but these should not be started while patients
                  are on study

               -  Diethylstilbestrol

               -  Abiraterone

          -  External beam radiation therapy within 4 weeks of registration is prohibited, or
             anticipated need for radiation therapy (e.g. imminent pathological fracture or spinal
             cord compression) within 3 months of registration

          -  Major surgery within 4 weeks of registration is prohibited

          -  Prior cytotoxic chemotherapy (for example, but not limited to, docetaxel,

             vaccine

          -  Patients who have undergone splenectomy

          -  Patients must not have other active malignancies other than non-melanoma skin cancers
             or superficial bladder cancer; subjects with a history of other cancers who have been
             adequately treated and have been recurrence-free for &gt;= 3 years are eligible

          -  Patients with known brain metastases

          -  Any antibiotic therapy or evidence of infection within 1 week of registration

          -  Any other medical intervention or condition, which, in the opinion of the PI or

             requirements over the primary 3-6 month treatment period

          -  Patients cannot have concurrent enrollment on other phase I, II, or III
