  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of treprostinil in the perioperative
      non-fenestrated, extracardiac Fontan patients in order to reduce duration of chest tube
      drainage (in days).

      The Fontan operation is performed for patients with single ventricle physiology as the final
      palliation to create a series circulation, with passive systemic venous return to the
      pulmonary arteries and the single ventricle solely providing systemic output.

      Patients undergoing extracardiac Fontan tend to have elevation of Fontan pressures
      immediately following the operation with inflammation from surgery requiring additional fluid
      administration to maintain blood pressure. Increased Fontan pressures and fluid overload lead
      to prolonged chest tube drainage.

      The hypothesis is that treprostinil, a prostacyclin drug that dilates the pulmonary arteries,
      will improve immediate postoperative Fontan pressures. Treprostinil is not FDA approved for
      this use. Anecdotally and in a small case series, prostacyclin therapy has been shown to
      assist in transitioning patients off nitric oxide. The investigators believe that this
      improvement in hemodynamics will decrease duration of chest tube drainage resulting in a
      shorter length of hospital stay.

    <textblock>
      In order to understand the effect of treprostinil on Fontan patients, this study has two
      parts:

        1. reactivity testing with inhaled treprostinil in the cardiac catheterization lab for
           pre-Fontan patients undergoing routine catheterization in anticipation of the Fontan
           operation;

        2. perioperative use of subcutaneous treprostinil starting immediately pre-op until
           postoperative day #7 to improve immediate postoperative hemodynamics and ultimately
           reduce overall length of hospital stay.

      The investigators hope to learn how pulmonary vasodilator therapy affects and/or improves
      post- operative hemodynamics following the Fontan operation. This knowledge would be very
      important in the care of single ventricle patients following the Fontan operation if there is
      improvement of immediate outcomes and reduction of hospital length of stay. On a broader
      scale, if the use of treprostinil in perioperative Fontan patients can achieve the same
      results other centers achieve with the use of a fenestration this may have wide scale
      implications in the nationwide treatment of Fontan patients.

    <description>The subcutaneous continuous treprostinil infusion will start at a dose of 2 ng/kg/min. The dose will be increased over the first 24 hours to goal 10 ng/kg/min through day five. On postoperative day six, the dose will be decreased by 2 ng/kg/min every 8 hours with plans for discontinuation on postoperative day seven.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pediatric patient undergoing Fontan operation and/or pre-Fontan cardiac
             catheterization at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital (LPCH)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Platelet count &lt; 50K (treprostinil can act as a platelet inhibitor and this may place
             patient at additional risk of bleeding if already thrombocytopenic)

          -  Dermatologic condition that renders the patient unable to tolerate a subcutaneous
             infusion (can still take part in inhaled vasodilator testing during cardiac
             catheterization)

          -  Currently receiving any vasodilator therapy specifically for the purpose of pulmonary
             vsasodilation (phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor, endothelia receptor antagonist
             and/or prostacyclin).
