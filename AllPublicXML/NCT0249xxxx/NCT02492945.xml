      Detailed Description:

      40 patients that meet the inclusion criteria on screening test are assigned to one of two
      groups(PDRN group or 15% dextrose active control group) by randomization. They take the three
      times of the ultrasonography-guided injections for four weeks(0,2,4 weeks) under
      double-blind. PDRN group take ultrasonography-guided 3ml PDRN injection for the lesion( tear
      or tendinosis about extensor carpi radialis brevis, extensor digitorum communis, radial
      collateral ligament ) of lateral epicondylitis for 4 weeks. Active control group takes the
      15% dextrose solution, 3ml for same procedure. The main outcome variables are measured at 0,
      6 weeks and 3 months after 1st injection as starting point and compared differences from
      baseline to 3 month as primary end points within each group or between both group.
      Polydeoxyribonucleotide is verified whether it has the safety and effect on lateral
      epicondylitis with comparing to prolotherapy.

    <time_frame>0, 6 and 12 weeks, 3 times</time_frame>
    <description>PPT(pressure pain threshold, Kg/cm2 or lb ) is assessed by an algometry, Commander trademark. The algometry is comprised of a gauge attached to a hard rubber tip. Pressure was applied though the rubber surface area of 1 cm2 at a rate of 2 Kg/Cm2 per second.
second. The instrument was placed perpendicular to the skin's surface at lateral epicondyle (site of maximal tenderness). The participants were asked to indicate when the pressure became painful based on this definition: &quot;When you feel the sensation changes from pressure to the slightest pain inform us&quot;. Each measure site was tested three times with 1 minutes between each test. Their average was used for statistical analyses.</description>

    <description>Its assessment is made by Takei digital hand grip dynamometer(unit = N ). For the actual testing procedure, pain-free grip strength measurements of the involved limb were conducted first. The subject was instructed to slowly squeeze the dynamometer and to stop the instant that changes from pressure to the slightest pain was experienced. Each measure site was tested three times with 1 minutes between each test. Their average was used for statistical analyses. Cf. pain-free maximum grip strength )</description>

    <description>We used ACCUVIX V20 with an 5- to 13Hz broadband linear transducer ( SAMSUNG MEDICINE, Hongchun, Gangwondo). The transducer was aligned with the long axis of the radius over the common tendon origin. Diagnostic ultrasound of the common extensor tendon is first performed to evaluate the degree of tendinosis and to fully characterize tendon abnormalities. Seven ultrasound features of the Common extensor tendon are assessed as below. A. Grade of tendinosis, B. Tendon thickness, C. Radial collateral ligament(RCL) lesion, D. Tendon hyperemia (Power doppler), E. Cortical irregularity, F. Intratendinous calcification, G. Enthesophyte</description>
