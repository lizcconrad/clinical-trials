      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of necitumumab when given together
      with osimertinib in treating patients with EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer that is
      stage IV or has come back (recurrent) and who have progressed on a previous EGFR tyrosine
      kinase inhibitor. Monoclonal antibodies, such as necitumumab, may block tumor growth in
      different ways by targeting certain cells. Osimertinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving necitumumab with osimertinib may
      be a better treatment for EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of osimertinib (AZD9291) in combination with
      necitumumab in patients with EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity in these NSCLC patients in select cohorts of
      patients with EGFR-activating mutations including EGFR Exon 20 insertion mutations.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of AZD9291 in combination with necitumumab.

      II. To explore biomarkers of response and resistance to previous EGFR-TKIs and with the
      combination by studying biopsied tumor tissue at baseline and at progression, as well as
      serial plasma deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) specimens.

      III. To create patient derived xenograft (PDX) models of patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC both
      prior to study initiation and at acquired resistance to treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of necitumumab.

      Patients receive osimertinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 and necitumumab
      intravenously (IV) over 50 minutes on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, every 12
      weeks for 1 year, and annually thereafter.

    <measure>Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of necitumumab combined with osimertinib</measure>
    <time_frame>21 days</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as the highest dose tested in which only 0 or 1 out of 6 evaluable patients experience a dose limiting toxicity, as graded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. The recommended phase II dose (RP2D) will be the MTD, pending review of other safety/tolerability considerations. The RP2D will be determined based upon the MTD in the dose escalation portion as well as other considerations such as toxicities at additional courses. After completing the 4 expansion cohorts, the dose level will be re-reviewed to confirm that the RP2D is in fact well tolerated.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of toxicity, graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>

    <measure>Objective response rate (ORR) in patients treated at the recommended phase II dose, graded according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>ORR will be calculated as the percent of patients in each of the expansion cohorts whose best confirmed response is complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). Point estimates and associated 90% confidence intervals will be calculated.</description>

    <measure>Progression-free survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Kaplan-Meier plots will be used to summarize the progression-free survival. Medians and associated 95% confidence intervals will be calculated.</description>

    <measure>Disease control rate (DCR) with combination osimertinib and necitumumab</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>DCR will be the proportion of patients in each of the expansion cohorts whose best confirmed response is CR, PR, or stable disease (SD). Point estimates and associated 90% confidence intervals will be calculated.</description>

    <description>The PK analyses will be descriptive and will permit comparison of the plasma levels of osimertinib and its metabolites in the presence of necitumumab (in this trial) with levels in other studies where osimertinib is given alone or combined with other drugs. We will estimate mean PK parameters as well as the between-patient variability. Results will be listed and plotted, by dose as well as by objective response, qualitative patterns will be described, and means and standard deviations will be calculated for use in planning follow-up studies.</description>

    <description>Will study biopsied tumor tissue as well as serial plasma deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) specimens. For each cohort alone, Fisher's exact test, and in a stratified analysis including all cohorts, an exact logistic regression model, will be used to examine the association with objective response and a Cox proportional hazards model will be used to examine the association with PFS. Odds ratio's and hazard ratio's will be estimated and associated 90% two-sided confidence intervals will be constructed. Testing will be one-sided, at the 0.05-level.</description>
