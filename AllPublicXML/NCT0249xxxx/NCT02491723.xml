      It is acknowledged that IL-18, as a product of the inflammasome, is involved in host defence
      against viral and bacterial stimuli by modulating the immune response. The aim of this study
      was to determine IL-18 levels in serum of patients with Bronchiectasis and to investigate
      whether macrolide attenuate its levels.

      Non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis is a respiratory disease characterized by persistent
      airway inflammation and dilation of bronchial wall driven by various causes. Patients with
      bronchiectasis suffer from excessive sputum production, recurrent exacerbations, and
      progressive airway destruction. It was reported that 30%-40% patients were infected with
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Major therapy for bronchiectasis is focused on breaking the &quot;vicious
      cycle&quot; of mucus stasis, infection, inflammation, and airway destruction. Currently a number
      of clinical trials have showed that macrolide effectively used in the treatment of non-CF
      bronchiectasis. Evidence has indicated that 14- and 15-membered ring macrolides possess
      immunomodulation and anti-inflammatory functions beyond their antimicrobial properties.
      However, the underlying mechanisms that account for the anti-inflammatory actions of
      macrolides have not yet to be elucidated, and the activities do not appear to be controlled
      by a single mechanism.Interleukin-18 (IL-18), along with interleukin-1b (IL-1b), is produced
      by inflammasomes when activated by a number of pathogen, environmental or host-derived danger
      signals. Inflammasomes are innate immune regulatory protein complexes which seem to play a
      key role in the host immune response of patients with Bronchiectasis. The aim of this study
      was to determine IL-18 levels in serum of patients with Bronchiectasis and to investigate
      whether macrolide could attenuate its levels.
