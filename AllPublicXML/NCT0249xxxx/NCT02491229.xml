  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether a weight reduction with &quot;Hepafast&quot; in
      combination with raw food and vegetables for two weeks followed by a meal substitution with
      &quot;Hepafast&quot; and a calorie restriction in accordance with the Low Glycemic and Insulinemic Diet
      (LOGI) for 10 weeks is superior regarding improvement of non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease
      (NAFLD) compared to a conventional weight reduction in accordance with the LOGI diet without
      use of &quot;Hepafast&quot; for 12 weeks.
