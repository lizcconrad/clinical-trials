      High fidelity simulations provide a unique opportunity for teaching and evaluation of
      knowledge, clinical reasoning, decision making and teamwork. We have developed a series of
      novel cardiac based simulations that review difficult learning objectives of cardiac
      anesthesiology rotation. We hypothesized that residents who have completed a rotation in
      cardiac anesthesiology will perceive these simulations to be both mentally challenging and a
      useful tool in preparing them for their subsequent clinical experience and for their
      anesthesiology board. For the first time, we have used the NASA Task Load Index Scale in
      evaluating Neuro Cognitive Workload during Cardiac Anesthesia Based simulation scenarios
      .Residents who have completed the cardiac rotation at least once would be assigned the task
      in small groups either a group of 2 or group of 3.The module consists of 3 different
      scenarios. The scenarios include, weaning the patient off of cardio pulmonary bypass,
      management of severe protamine drug reaction and acute hypotension from malfunction of the
      coronary graft in a simulated operating room in real time.

        1. Setting up a Simulation Lab,almost similar to real cardiac operating rooms would have
           cardio-pulmonary bypass machine,transesophageal echocardiography images upon request,all
           emergency medications with various infusions pumps,defibrillator,real time monitors
           include EKG,SpO2,invasive arterial line,CVP,PAP,ETCO2,operating room surgical
           equipment,anesthesia machine with ventilator.

        2. Tasks Assigned to the residents

        3. Feed-back and Teaching Session

        4. At the end of each session residents are encouraged to reflect upon how they performed
           and learning gaps that they perceived and areas that they felt needed to improve upon.

        5. Feedback session would be followed by interactive teaching to reinforce the knowledge.

        6. Evaluation of Hypothesis using NASA TLX Scale. Immediately following the Simulation
           based training, residents would be given the paper based NASA TLX scale to assess the
           neurocognitive workload

      The Ohio State University CSEAC Scenarios Content expert: Sujatha Bhandary MD The Ohio State
      University CSEAC 1st Scenario Development Form Scenario Name: Weaning from Cardiopulmonary
      Bypass Content expert: Sujatha Bhandary MD Date of Development: 8/29/14 Targeted Audience:
      CA-2, CA-3 anesthesia residents Simulation Platform: HPS

      Synopsis of Scenario:

      The purpose of this scenario is for the participant to take a thoughtful, systematic approach
      to weaning a patient off of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Separation from cardiopulmonary
      bypass is a task which requires attention to multiple organ systems, communication with other
      members of the patient care team (i.e. surgeon, perfusionist), and a firm grasp of
      cardiopulmonary physiology. A small randomized controlled study of residents has previously
      demonstrated that simulation-based training in weaning from CPB has translated to improved
      clinical performance in the OR. While this task can at first be overwhelming for the trainee,
      high fidelity simulation provides an opportunity to practice this complex task in a safe
      environment.

      The scenario will begin with the patient under general anesthesia and on cardiopulmonary
      bypass. The surgeon will have just completed an uncomplicated triple vessel CABG on a 57 year
      old male with 45 minutes of bypass time. When the participant takes over the case the patient
      will have a junctional bradycardia (rate 40) with a MAP of 50 mmHg, a temperature of 35
      degrees celcius, and a SpO2 of 100%. The surgeon will announce that he is planning to remove
      the aortic cross clamp at which time the resident should call for their attending. The
      participant will be informed that their attending will not arrive and they will need to
      complete the task on their own. After removal of the cross clamp the patient will go into
      ventricular fibrillation. The participant will be responsible for recognizing the arrhythmia
      and treating the condition with lidocaine and defibrillation. After defibrillation the
      patient will go back into a junctional bradycardia which the participant will need to treat
      by pacing. At this point the participant will also need to begin ventilating the patient and
      treating underlying hyperkalemia (which will become evident upon obtaining an ABG). Failure
      to treat the hyperkalemia will result in refractory ventricular fibrillation. An
      echocardiogram (if requested) will reveal a normal appearing heart with good contractility.
      After pacing the patient, ventilating, and treating the underlying metabolic disturbances the
      patient can be successfully weaned off of CPB with a low dose epinephrine drip. At this point
      the scenario will end.

      Learning Objectives:

        1. Describe the conditions necessary before attempting to wean the patient from CPB

        2. Demonstrate the steps involved in weaning the patient from CPB.

        3. Communicate effectively with other members of the patient care team (i.e. perfusionist
           and surgeon) during weaning from CPB.

        4. Recognize and treat arrhythmias and metabolic disturbances prior to weaning from CPB.

           Scenario Intro (read to learner) Your patient is a 57 year old male who is undergoing a
           triple vessel CABG (LIMA to LAD, saphenous to RCA, and saphenous to OM). In addition to
           CAD the patient has a history of type 2 DM and HLD. The surgeon has just completed the
           last graft with a total bypass time of 45 minutes. The procedure has been uncomplicated
           to this point. The patient has an arterial line, a 16 g IV, and an introducer with a
           PAC. The patient is on no infusions and is receiving isoflurance via the bypass machine.
           The patient is currently paralyzed. There is a transesophageal echocardiogram available
           upon request. The surgeon has placed epicardial pacing wires. Your task will be to wean
           the patient off of CPB.

           Facilitator briefing/ Curricular information:

           Prior to receiving hand-off and beginning the scenario the participant will be handed a
           sheet with the patient's pre-op history and physical already completed. All labs and
           imaging will be provided. The resident will have the opportunity to ask additional
           questions to the departing provider. The confederates in the room will include the
           cardiac surgeon and a perfusionist. Echocardiography will be available upon request as
           will arterial blood gases. The following infusions will already be in-line but not yet
           started: epinephrine, nitroprusside, and insulin. Other cardiac drugs (lidocaine,
           amiodarone, nitroglycerine, norepinephrine, vasopressin) will be drawn up and available.
           Epicardial wires coming from the surgical field. These can be connected to a pacing box
           which will provided upon request.

           Operator details: After receiving hand-off the surgeon will announce that he will soon
           be removing the aortic cross-clamp.

           Learner Objectives and Interventions: The participant should make sure he/she receives a
           thorough hand-off with a clear understanding of the patient's background and surgical
           course. The resident should call his/her attending physician in preparation for weaning
           from CPB.

           details: Surgeon will continue to operate without noticing the rhythm. If the
           participant does not recognize the rhythm within 30 seconds the perfusionist will
           announce that he is giving 100 mg lidocaine via the bypass machine.

           Learner Objectives and Interventions: The participant should recognize the arrhythmia
           and direct the surgeon to administer shocks to the patient.

           Learner Objectives and Interventions: Participant should ventilate the patient with
           adequate tidal volumes/rate. Ask for pacer box and begin pacing the patient. If the
           participant does not ask for it, the perfusionist will simply bring the participant a
           pacing box (pre-set to 80; v-paced)

      details: If the participant has not already asked for it at this point, the perfusionist will
      bring him/her the results for an ABG: (pH 7.4, paO2 350, paCO2 34, HCO3 22, K+ 6, Glu 250,
      Ca++ 4, Hct 24). The surgeon will ask if he can come off of bypass.

      Learner Objectives and Interventions: The participant should treat the underlying metabolic
      disturbance (mainly hyperkalemia and hyperglycemia) before allowing the surgeon to proceed
      with removal from bypass. If insulin is given the patient will progress to state: &quot;wean off&quot;.
      If no insulin is given the patient will go back to state 2: &quot;ventricular fibrillation&quot;.

      EKG: V-paced Appearance/PE: Anesthetized, paralyzed, mechanically ventilated, on CPB Operator
      details: Surgeon will ask which drips the patient is on. Learner Objectives and
      Interventions: The participant should look at the echocardiogram (which will reveal a normal
      heart). The participant should provide inotropic support (low dose epinephrine drip) at which
      point the BP will increase to approximately 110/60 over 30 seconds. The scenario will then
      end.

      The Ohio State University CSEAC 2nd Scenario Development Form Scenario Name: Protamine
      Reaction Content expert: Sujatha Bhandary MD Date of Development: 8/29/14 Targeted Audience:
      CA-2, CA-3 anesthesia residents Simulation Platform: HPS

      *Synopsis of Scenario:

      The purpose of this scenario is to expose trainees to a severe type III protamine reaction
      after weaning off of cardiopulmonary bypass. Although the most severe reaction to
      administration of protamine (severe pulmonary vasoconstriction, RV failure, systemic
      hypotesnsion) is rare, the result can be catastrophic. High fidelity simulation provides an
      opportunity for trainees to get exposure to this entity in a safe, controlled environment.
      The scenario will be followed by both a debriefing session to allow the participants to
      reflect on their performance and a short didactic session on proper administration of
      protamine and the pathophysiology of protamine reactions.

      The scenario will begin after completion of the previous scenario: &quot;Weaning from
      Cardiopulmonary Bypass&quot;. As before the patient is a 57 year old male who has just undergone
      an uncomplicated triple vessel CABG with 45 minutes of bypass time. The patient was
      successfully weaned off of CPB after treatment of hyperkalemia (see prior scenario). This
      scenario can begin either after debriefing the previous scenario or may begin without
      interruption. The surgeon will start the scenario by asking the participant to administer
      protamine. At this point the patient is hemodynamically stable (V-paced at 80, BP 110/60, PAP
      30/15, CO 5.2). The patient will start the scenario on an epinephrine drip at 0.02
      mcg/kg/min. The participant will be informed that the patient was given 30,000 unites of
      heparin in preparation for going on CPB. The last ACT was 468. The patient will not have any
      hemodynamic changes in response to a test dose of protamine, and the participant should
      continue to administer the appropriate dose. After 2 minutes without a change in vitals the
      patient will begin to undergo hemodynamic changes consistent with a type III protamine
      reaction over the course of 5 minutes (hypotesnsion, desaturation, decreased cardiac output,
      pulmonary hypertension). Upon recognizing the problem the participant should discontinue the
      protamine infusion, call for help, communicate with the surgeon, and provide supportive care
      for the patient. An echocardiogram (upon request) will demonstrate a dilated RV. Intervening
      to stop the protamine and administer vasopressors will stabilize the patient, however failure
      to act will result in cardiovascular collapse and necessitate going back on CPB.

      Learning Objectives:

      5.Demonstrate appropriate administration of protamine following cardiopulmonary bypass.

      6.Recognize the signs of an acute type III protamine reaction and respond appropriately.

      7.Describe the different types of protamine reactions, the pathophysiology of each, and the
      risk factors for developing them.

      Scenario Intro (read to learner) Your patient is a 57 year old male who is undergoing a
      triple vessel CABG (LIMA to LAD, saphenous to RCA, and saphenous to OM). In addition to CAD
      the patient has a history of type 2 DM and HLD. The procedure has been uncomplicated to this
      point. The patient has an arterial line, a 16 g IV, and an introducer with a PAC. The patient
      is currently paralyzed. There is a transesophageal echocardiogram available upon request. The
      patient as already been successfully weaned off of CPB and is hemodynamically stable on a low
      dose epinephrine drip.

      *Facilitator briefing/ Curricular information: Prior to receiving hand-off and beginning the
      scenario the participant will be handed a sheet with the patient's pre-op history and
      physical already completed. All labs and imaging will be provided. The resident will have the
      opportunity to ask additional questions to the departing provider. The confederates in the
      room will include the cardiac surgeon and a perfusionist. Echocardiography will be available
      upon request as will arterial blood gases. The patient will already be on an epinephrine
      infusion at 0.02 mcg/kg/min. Other cardiac drugs (lidocaine, amiodarone, nitroglycerine,
      norepinephrine, vasopressin) will be drawn up and available. Epicardial wires coming from the
      surgical field will be connected to a pacing box set at 80 (V-paced).

                V-paced Appearance/PE: intubated, sedated, paralyzed, on vent Operator details: Epi
                infusion running at 0.02 mcg/kg/min into patient's central line. This scenario
                state will take off directly after the final state of the prior scenario (&quot;weaning
                off CPB&quot;). The surgeon will ask for protamine to be given. If the participant asks
                the perfusionist will inform him/her that the total heparin dose was 30,000 units
                and the last ACT was 468. The test dose will be negative (no change in vital
                signs).

                Hct 23) Learner Objectives and Interventions: Calculation of proper reversal dose
                of protamine. Administration of test dose of protamine and slow administration of
                full reversal dose with careful attention to potential hemodynamic changes.

                HR BP SPO2 RR ETCO2 CVP PAP CO Temp 80 70/35 92% Vent (14) 20 28 60/45 36 EKG:
                V-pace Appearance/PE: anesthetized, paralyzed, on vent Operator details: Changes in
                vital signs will occur slowly (over 5 minutes). Surgeon will continue to operate
                without noticing the changes in vital signs. An Echo (if requested) will show a
                dilated RV. Stopping the infusion and administration of vasopressors will result in
                stabilization. Failure to stop the infusion will lead to further deterioration.

                Learner Objectives and Interventions: Discontinue protamine infusion. Communicate
                with surgeon. Call for help. Provide supportive care for the patient
                (vasopressors).

                V-paced Appearance/PE: intubated, sedated, paralyzed, on vent Operator details:
                Vitals will stabilize to current state over 2 minutes following discontinuation of
                protamine and administration of vasopressors. Surgeon will ask if the provider can
                restart the protamine now. After discussion with surgeon the scenario will end.

                Learner Objectives and Interventions: Discuss with surgeon options for reversal of
                heparin.

      EKG: V-paced Appearance/PE: intubated, sedated, paralyzed, on vent Operator details: Failure
      to stop the infusion will result in worsening of the patient's condition to the current
      state. Surgeon will now became aware of the hemodynamic changes and will insist on going
      emergently back on CPB. The scenario will end.

      The Ohio State University CSEAC 3rd Scenario Development Form Scenario Name: Coronary Air
      After Bypass Grafting Content expert: Sujatha Bhandary MD Date of Development: 8/29/14
      Targeted Audience: CA-2, CA-3 anesthesia residents Simulation Platform: HPS

      Synopsis of Scenario:

      The purpose of this scenario is for the participant to take a thoughtful, systematic approach
      to the sudden onset of ST changes and hypotension following completion of coronary artery
      bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Specifically this scenario will deal with intracoronary air,
      which if unrecognized can be fatal. Residual air has been reported to be present as in as
      much as 12% of patients undergoing CABG surgery.* This simulation will give residents the
      chance to treat this condition in a safe, constructive environment so that they will be more
      comfortable with diagnosing this rare but potentially devastating condition. The simulation
      is intended to rely on the residents' knowledge of cardiac physiology, and basic
      echocardiography interpretation.

      The scenario will start following the completion of the previous scenario (Protamine
      Reaction) at which the time patient has been successfully weaned off of bypass and the chest
      has just been closed. Immediately after beginning the scenario the surgeon will leave the
      room. At this time the fellow (confederate) will begin to suture the skin. Shortly thereafter
      the patient will have ST elevation in the inferior EKG leads. The fellow will ask if the
      echocardiogram looks okay. A mid-esophageal four-chamber view of the patient's heart will
      demonstrate air bubbles in the left ventricle. A trans-gastric short axis view of the heart
      (if requested) will show the inferior wall of the heart to be akinetic. The patient will
      become hypotensive with decreased cardiac index. The resident should simultaneously form a
      differential diagnosis and treat the symptoms while communicating to the surgeon his/her
      findings. Ultimately the resident should request that the surgeon reopen the patient's chest
      and purge the intra-cardiac air. Failing to do so will result in the patient going into
      cardiogenic shock and ventricular fibrillation.

      Learning Objectives:

      8. Form a differential for post CABG hypotension and EKG changes. 9. Diagnose intra-cardiac
      air and regional wall motion abnormalities on echocardiogram.

      10. Effectively treat cardiogenic shock with pharmacologic agents. 11. Communicate with the
      surgeon regarding the need for surgical intervention.

      Scenario Intro (read to learner) Your patient is a 57 year old male who is undergoing a
      triple vessel CABG (LIMA to LAD, saphenous to RCA, and saphenous to OM). In addition to CAD
      the patient has a history of type 2 DM and HLD. The surgeon completed the grafts with a total
      bypass time of 45 minutes. The patient has been weaned of cardiac bypass and successfully
      reversed with protamine. The chest has just been closed. The procedure has been uncomplicated
      to this point. The patient has an arterial line, a 16 g IV, and an introducer with a PAC. The
      patient is on a low dose epinephrine infusion (.0.02 mcg/kg/min). The patient is currently
      paralyzed. There is a transesophageal echocardiogram available upon request. The surgeon has
      placed epicardial pacing wires. You will be responsible for transitioning the patient to the
      cardiac ICU.

      Facilitator briefing/ Curricular information:

      Prior to receiving hand-off and beginning the scenario the participant will be handed a sheet
      with the patient's pre-op history and physical already completed. All labs and imaging will
      be provided. The resident will have the opportunity to ask additional questions to the
      departing provider. The confederates in the room will include the cardiac surgeon and a
      perfusionist. Echocardiography will be available upon request as will arterial blood gases.
      The patient is on a low dose epinephrine infusion (0.02 mcg/kg/min). Other cardiac drugs
      (lidocaine, amiodarone, nitroglycerine, norepinephrine, vasopressin) will be drawn up and
      available. Epicardial wires coming from the surgical field. These can be connected to a
      pacing box which will provided upon request.

           EKG: normal sinus rhythm Appearance/PE: intubated, sedated, paralyzed; chest closed
           Operator details: The surgeon has just finished closing the chest at which time he/she
           will give a sign out and leave the room.

           Learner Objectives and Interventions: The participant should make sure he/she receives a
           thorough hand-off with a clear understanding of the patient's background and surgical
           course.

           Transition Cue: Surgeon leaves the room Go to state: ST elevation

        2. ST Changes

           Vital signs:

           HR BP SPO2 RR ETCO2 CVP PAP CO Temp 70 110/60 100% 14 (vent) 35 12 30/15 5 36.3

           EKG: Normal sinus rhythm; ST depression in AVF, II, III Appearance/PE: intubated,
           sedated, paralyzed; chest closed Operator details: Fellow will begin suturing the skin
           and will ask the participant what the cardiac index is. At this point the patient should
           experience ST depression in the inferior leads.

           Learner Objectives and Interventions: The participant should recognize the EKG changes
           and look to the echocardiogram for clinical correlation. He/She should communicate with
           the surgical team.

           Transition Cue: Learner looks at Echocardiogram Go to state: ST Elevation

        3. ST Elevation

           EKG: normal sinus rhythm; ST elevation in AVF, II, III Appearance/PE: Intubated,
           sedated, paralyzed; chest closed Operator details: TEE four chamber view will
           demonstrate air bubbles in the LV. Trans-gastric short axis will show akinetic inferior
           wall. Patient will get hypotensive over 2 minutes, but will responds to IV epinephrine.

           Learner Objectives and Interventions: Participant should form differential for
           hypotention with ST elevation, and treat pharmacologically with epinephrine. The
           participant should communicate with the surgeon regarding the need for re-opening at
           which point the scenario will end. If he/she does not communicate with the surgical team
           the patient will decompensate and go into VFib.
