    <textblock>
      Patients initiating injectable therapy for type 2 diabetes (insulin or exenatide) in usual
      clinical practice will be enrolled and followed up for two years in order to describe actual
      practice with regards to the time on initial treatment regime, whether treatment regimens are
      being modified, what treatment modifications are made, and clinical and patient-reported
      outcomes.

    <measure>Estimates of Probability to Remain on Initial Injectable Treatment at 12 and 24 Months.</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 24</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective of this study is to estimate the time spent on initial treatment regime before significant treatment change for patients with type 2 diabetes initiating therapy with either insulin or exenatide for the first time.
Initial treatment regime is defined as the treatment regime prescribed when the patient is enrolled in the study.
Significant treatment change for patients initiated on insulin or exenatide is defined as at least one of the following:
Insulin:
Addition of a new medication for the treatment of type 2 diabetes
A change in the number of times insulin is administered per day
Discontinuation of any insulin initiated at baseline
Substitution of a human insulin for an analogue insulin or vice-versa.
Switching between brands of the same class/type of insulin is not included in the definition of significant treatment change.
Exenatide:
Addition of a new medication for the treatment of type 2 diabetes
Discontinuation of exenatide.</description>

    <measure>Higher Body Mass Index (BMI) Associated With Treatment Choice at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Higher BMI was one of the Factors evaluated for association with treatment choice at baseline. BMI was calculated as body weight in kilograms (kg) divided by height in meters (m) squared (kg/m^2). The mean BMI at baseline is provided below and the statistical analysis provides the 2 arms odds ratio for BMI=1 kg/m^2 higher. Participants were assigned to the exenatide BID or insulin cohort based the injectable treatment started at baseline; analyses were conducted irrespective of later treatment changes. Baseline was Visit T1 (prior to start of treatment).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Higher Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1) Associated With Treatment Choice at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Higher HbA1c was one of the Factors evaluated for association with treatment choice at baseline.HbA1c was reported in percent of hemoglobin. The mean HbA1c at baseline is provided below and the statistical analysis provides the 2 arms odds ratio for HbA1c=1% higher.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Older Age Associated With Treatment Choice at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Older age (1 year older) was one of the Factors evaluated for association with treatment choice at baseline. The mean age at baseline is provided below and the statistical analysis provides the 2 arms odds ratio for age 1 year older. Participants were assigned to the exenatide BID or insulin cohort based the injectable treatment started at baseline; analyses were conducted irrespective of later treatment changes. Baseline was Visit T1 (prior to start of treatment).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disinhibited Eating Associated With Treatment Choice at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Diabetes Health Profile (DHP-18) - consists of 18 items across 3 domains (psychological distress, barriers to activity, and disinhibited eating), with each item standardized score rated from 0-100; 0=no dysfunction, higher numbers=greater dysfunction. The subscale of disinhibited eating was one of the Factors evaluated for association with treatment choice at baseline. The number of participants with disinhibited eating at baseline is provided below and the statistical analysis provides the 2 arms odds ratio for disinhibited eating. Participants were assigned to the exenatide BID or insulin cohort based the injectable treatment started at baseline; analyses were conducted irrespective of later treatment changes. Baseline was Visit T1 (prior to start of treatment).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Higher Random Glucose Associated With Treatment Choice at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months prior to Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Random Glucose 1 millimole per liter (mmol/L) higher was one of the Factors evaluated for association with treatment choice at baseline. Random glucose is a glucose within the last 6 months prior to baseline. The mean is provided below and the statistical analysis provides the 2 arms odds ratio for the glucose 1 mmol/L higher. Participants were assigned to the exenatide BID or insulin cohort based the injectable treatment started at baseline; analyses were conducted irrespective of later treatment changes. Baseline was Visit T1 (prior to start of treatment).</description>

    <description>Frequent glucose self-testing (1 test/week more) was one of the Factors evaluated for association with treatment choice at baseline. The mean number of self monitoring blood glucose tests per week over the last 4 weeks prior to baseline was determined at baseline and is provided below. The statistical analysis provides the 2 arms odds ratio. Participants were assigned to the exenatide BID or insulin cohort based the injectable treatment started at baseline; analyses were conducted irrespective of later treatment changes. Baseline was Visit T1 (prior to start of treatment).</description>

The number of participants who checked yes or no during the baseline visit for prior receipt of diet/exercise advice in his/her Diabetes management is provided below and the statistical analysis provides the 2 arms odds ratio. Participants were assigned to the exenatide BID or insulin cohort based the injectable treatment started at baseline; analyses were conducted irrespective of later treatment changes.

        <title>Estimates of Probability to Remain on Initial Injectable Treatment at 12 and 24 Months.</title>
        <description>The primary objective of this study is to estimate the time spent on initial treatment regime before significant treatment change for patients with type 2 diabetes initiating therapy with either insulin or exenatide for the first time.
Initial treatment regime is defined as the treatment regime prescribed when the patient is enrolled in the study.
Significant treatment change for patients initiated on insulin or exenatide is defined as at least one of the following:
Insulin:
Addition of a new medication for the treatment of type 2 diabetes
A change in the number of times insulin is administered per day
Discontinuation of any insulin initiated at baseline
Substitution of a human insulin for an analogue insulin or vice-versa.
Switching between brands of the same class/type of insulin is not included in the definition of significant treatment change.
Exenatide:
Addition of a new medication for the treatment of type 2 diabetes
Discontinuation of exenatide.</description>

Discontinuation of any insulin initiated at baseline
Substitution of a human insulin for an analogue insulin or vice-versa.
Switching between brands of the same class/type of insulin is not included in the definition of significant treatment change.

          <description>Random Glucose 1 millimole per liter (mmol/L) higher was one of the Factors evaluated for association with treatment choice at baseline. Random glucose is a glucose within the last 6 months prior to baseline. The mean is provided below and the statistical analysis provides the 2 arms odds ratio for the glucose 1 mmol/L higher. Participants were assigned to the exenatide BID or insulin cohort based the injectable treatment started at baseline; analyses were conducted irrespective of later treatment changes. Baseline was Visit T1 (prior to start of treatment).</description>
