      This study will look for the highest tolerated dose of MK-0646 when given as a every other
      week infusion in patients with advanced solid tumors.

    <textblock>
      Trial Duration of Treatment : Patients will receive study drug for about 12 weeks. Patients
      may be able to receive MK-0646 for as long as 1 year if it seems to be stopping the growth of
      their cancer and not causing bad side effects. If the patient has a complete response to
      MK-0646, they may receive up to 8 additional weeks of treatment.

    <description>Part 1 is for determination of leading dose. It consists of three patients (up to a maximum of six) per dose level will be treated at rising dose levels of MK-0646 consisting of a loading dose (2.5, 5, 10, 15 and 20 mg/kg) followed by a subsequent every other week maintenance dose (of at least 2.5 mg/kg) starting two weeks after the completion of the loading dose.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Part 2</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Part 2 is for determination of maintenance dose. It consists of at least three new patients (up to a maximum of six) per dose level will be treated at rising maintenance dose levels of MK-0646. All patients will receive the previous determined loading infusion from Part I, followed by a subsequent every other week maintenance infusion (2.5, 5, 10, 15, 20 mg/kg) starting two weeks after the loading infusion.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Part 3</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Part 3 is refinement of safety and pharmacokinetics. At the recommended phase 2 loading and every other week maintenance dose and schedule determined from Parts I and II, an additional 14-17 patients (for 20 patients total) will be enrolled for further refinement of the pharmacokinetics and safety of MK-0646 administered at this dose and schedule.</description>
