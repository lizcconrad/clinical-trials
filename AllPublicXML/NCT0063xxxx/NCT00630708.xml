  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the present study is to assess the safety of combined treatment of
      benazepril (an ACE inhibitor) or losartan (an ARB) in non-diabetic patients with advanced
      renal insufficiency.

    <textblock>
      Interruption of the renin-angiotensin systerm (RAS) with an angiotensin-converting enzyme
      (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) slows the progression of chronic
      renal insufficiency in the presence or absence of diabetes. Even for advanced chronic renal
      insufficiency (stage 4 CKD), ACE inhibitors and ARBs can still provide renoprotection. Some
      clinical studies showed that dual RAS blockage seemed to enhance the antiproteinuric effect
      compared with single-agent ACE inhibitor or ARB and then improve renal survival. However, in
      the only one randomized controlled trial investigating the renoprotection of combined ACE
      inhibitor and ARB for mild or moderate chronic renal insufficiency (the mean creatinine value
      is 2.9mg/dl), the incidence of hyperkalemia was increased in combination therapy compared
      with monotherapy. Although increase of hyperkalemia was not statistical significant, it
      suggested that combination treatment of ACEI and ARB might increase the incidence of
      hyperkalemia in patients with advanced renal insufficiency. However, it is still undetermined
      whether combination treatment of ACE inhibitor and ARB is safe as an ACE inhibitor or ARB
      monotherapy in advanced non-diabetic chronic renal insufficiency (stage 4 CKD). The primary
      aim of the present study is to assess the safety of combined treatment of benazepril (an ACE
      inhibitor) or losartan (an ARB) in non-diabetic patients with advanced renal insufficiency.
