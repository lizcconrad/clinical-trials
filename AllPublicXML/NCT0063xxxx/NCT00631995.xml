      This study is aimed at studying quadrivalent meningococcal (A, C, Y, and W-135) Tetanus
      Protein Conjugate Vaccine (TetraMen-T) formulations in Toddlers.

      Primary Objectives: Safety and Immunogenicity:

      To describe the safety and immunogenicity profiles of:

        -  A single dose of each formulation of TetraMen-T vaccine

        -  A single dose of NeisVac-C® vaccine.
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to evaluate the safety profile and the immunogenicity response after a
      single dose of TetraMen-T in toddlers.

        Inclusion Criteria :

          -  Subject is healthy, as determined by medical history and physical assessment.

          -  Aged 12 months (± 21 days) on the day of inclusion.

             received injected or oral corticosteroids or other immunomodulator therapy within 6
             weeks of the study vaccines. Individuals on a tapering dose schedule of oral steroids
             lasting &lt; 7 days and individuals (e.g., asthmatics) on a short schedule of oral
             steroids lasting 3 to 4 days may be included in the trial as long as they have not
             received more than one course within the last two weeks prior to enrollment. Topical
             steroids are not included in this exclusion criterion.

          -  Anticipated to receive oral or injected antibiotic therapy within the 72 hours prior
             to the study blood draw. Topical antibiotics or antibiotic drops are not included in
             this exclusion criterion.

          -  Suspected or known hypersensitivity to any of the vaccine components.

          -  Thrombocytopenia or a bleeding disorder contraindicating intramuscular (IM)
             vaccination.

          -  Parent or legal guardian unable or unwilling to comply with the stu dy procedures.

          -  Participation in another interventional clinical trial in the 30 days preceding
             enrollment, or participation in another clinical trial involving the investigation of
             a drug, vaccine, medical procedure, or medical device during the subject's trial
             period.

          -  Diagnosed with any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, would pose a
             health risk to the subject or interfere with the evaluation of the vaccine.

          -  Received any vaccine in the 30-day period prior to receipt of study vaccine, or
             scheduled to receive any vaccination other than influenza vaccination and
             hyposensitization therapy in the 30-day period after receipt of any study vaccine.
             Hyposensitization therapy and influenza vaccination may be received up to 14 days
             before or 14 days after receiving the study vaccines.

          -  History of seizures, including febrile seizures, or any other neurologic disorder.

          -  Personal or family history of Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS).
