    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare whether a same total dose given up front as a single
      dose is more effective and as safe as the same dose given as a fractioned dose.

      Evaluate the Utility of the the Dry Tube Test Evaluating its Correlation with Coagulation
      Test Results (fibrinogen, platelets, INR, PT and PTT).

      Explore the Evolution of some Serum Markers (CK, DHL, metalloproteinase), Amount of Venom and
      Antivenom Levels and the Progression of Local Lesions.

    <textblock>
      Snake bite Envenomation is a Public Health Problem especially for tropical and subtropical
      countries. The WHO estimates 40 000 annual deaths in the world for this cause. In México the
      Ministry of Health estimated 3 882 cases on 2005, being the age of 15-44 the most affected.
      There are not official numbers of mortality, although the thought is that there are few cases
      of death, most of them related with a delay on treatment.

      There are a broad variety of clinical presentations depending on many factors such as
      species, snake bite variability or patient conditions. Proteolytic action of venom produces
      amines and vasoactive peptides such as bradykinin, histamine and serotonin which cause
      capillary lesions with anticoagulant effects. Coagulopathy is one of the most important
      systemic consequences. The Dry Tube Test has been proposed as an indirect test to evaluate
      coagulopathy related to this pathology.

    <description>20 vials up front in a Single Dose of Antivipmyn in 500 ml of solution IV, administered in 60 minutes. After 12 hours, it has to be perfomed a clinical evaluation of the patient. Each patient is going to have clinical studies of coagulation time and also the fibrinogen measures, this at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 48, 72, 96 hours.All patients who have received at least one dose of medication study will be contacted by telephone to investigate the presence of symptoms suggestive of continuing with effect snake venom, or the presence of an adverse event, or any signs or symptoms indicating the presence of a hypersensitivity response to Antivipmyn® including serum sickness. If symptoms suggestive of an adverse event were discovered, the patient will referred for appropriate treatment.</description>

    <description>20 vials fractionated into 4 doses of 5 vials each of Antivipmyn ®. The treatment schedule for each subject is a dose of 5 vials Antivipmyn® every 2 hours to complete 20 vials, the total duration is 6 hours of the treatment. Each dose IV shall apply in physiological solution 250ml, and finish its application in 15 minutes. For pediatric patients the volume administered should not exceed the recommended fluid volume according to your body weight. After the assessment at 12 hours, it can be administered at the discretion of more antivenom attending by the physician.</description>
