    <textblock>
      XIENCE V® India is a prospective, open-label, multi-center, observational, single-arm study
      to evaluate XIENCE V® EECSS continued safety and effectiveness during commercial use in real
      world settings.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Long term surveillance studies using a drug eluting stent (DES) may help elucidate mechanisms
      responsible for death, myocardial infarction, and late stent thrombosis risks not observed
      during controlled pre-market trials. This study will evaluate XIENCE V® Everolimus Eluting
      Coronary Stent System (EECSS) performance in the &quot;real world&quot; when used by a broad group of
      physicians at a variety of health care facilities. Consequently, this protocol will include
      all consecutively enrolled patients in India who consent to participate and receive the
      XIENCE V® EECSS, which is expected to represent the range of clinical use during
      commercialization.

      Adjunctive anti-platelet therapy is a critical factor in optimizing long term DES safety.
      Despite established guidelines that recommend 6-12 months dual antiplatelet therapy, patients
      with DES implants frequently stop taking their medication early. Consequently, XIENCE V®
      EECSS India Post-marketing Single-Arm Study (XIENCE V® India) follow-up will document patient
      adherence and persistence with adjunctive antiplatelet drug therapy at several time points
      throughout the study.

      The long term safety and efficacy of the XIENCE V EECSS have been demonstrated in the SPIRIT
      FIRST trial up to 5 years, the SPIRIT II trial up to 4 years, and in the SPIRIT III
      Randomized Control Trial (RCT) up to 3 years. In addition, these pre-approval studies have
      shown low rates of Target Vessel Failure and Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) that were
      observed to plateau or gradually decline after about 1 year and were consistently lower than
      the comparator arm of each study. This benefit in MACE is sustained for up to 5 years and is
      also independent of the first year results.

      The post approval XIENCE V India study demonstrated that the use of the XIENCE EECSS in
      complex lesions in a real-world population resulted in 1 year MACE, Stent Thrombosis and
      Target Lesion Revascularization rates that are comparable to those of the previously
      mentioned pre-approval studies which included patients with more restricted inclusion /
      exclusion criteria.

      Therefore, based on existing data from these trials, Abbott Vascular has decided to
      discontinue further follow up in the XIENCE V India study, from 5 years to after completion
      of the three year follow-up.
