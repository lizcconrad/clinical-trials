    <textblock>
      To investigate the long-term efficacy and safety of treatment with esmirtazapine (Org 50081,
      SCH 900265, MK-8265) compared to placebo, in participants with chronic primary insomnia.
      Primary efficacy variable is Total Sleep Time (TST).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia is a common complaint or disorder throughout the world. About one third of the
      population in the industrial countries reports difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep,
      resulting in a non-refreshing or non-restorative sleep. The majority of the insomniacs suffer
      chronically from their complaints.

      The maleic acid salt of Org 4420, code name Org 50081 (esmirtazapine), was selected for
      development in the treatment of insomnia. The first clinical trial with esmirtazapine was a
      proof-of-concept trial with a four-way cross-over design. All 3 esmirtazapine dose groups
      showed a statistically significant positive effect on TST (objective and subjective) and Wake
      Time After Sleep Onset (WASO), as compared to placebo.

      The current study is designed to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of esmirtazapine in
      a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group outpatient trial in
      participants suffering from chronic primary insomnia. During the 6-month treatment period,
      participants are randomly assigned to receive either esmirtazapine or placebo. Then, during
      the 7-day discontinuation period, participants who received esmirtazapine in the 6-month
      treatment period are randomly assigned to receive either esmirtazapine or placebo, while
      participants who received placebo in the 6-month treatment period continue to receive
      placebo.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Total Sleep Time (TST) - 6-Month Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and the Mean of Weeks 14-26</time_frame>
    <description>TST was defined as the time recorded for sleep diary question 6 &quot;How much time did you actually spend sleeping?&quot; as reported by participants using a LogPad (hand-held electronic data capture device). Baseline was defined as the mean TST from the Placebo Run-in Period. Change from Baseline was calculated as the mean of combined data from Weeks 14 through 26, using a last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Who Experienced Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 31 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function or chemistry of the body whether or not considered related to study drug. The number of participants who experienced AEs is combined for the 6-Month Treatment Period and the 7-Day Discontinuation Period.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Who Discontinued Study Drug Due to an AE</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 27 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function or chemistry of the body whether or not considered related to study drug. The number of participants who discontinued study drug due to an AE is combined for the 6-Month Treatment Period and the 7-Day Discontinuation Period.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and the Mean of Weeks 14-26</time_frame>
    <description>SL was defined as the time recorded for sleep diary question 3 &quot;How long did it take you to fall asllep?&quot;, as reported by participants using a LogPad. Baseline was defined as the mean SL from the Placebo Run-in Period. Change from Baseline was calculated as the mean of combined data from Weeks 14 through 26, using an LOCF approach.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and the Mean of Weeks 14-26</time_frame>
    <description>WASO was defined as the time recorded for sleep diary question 5 &quot;How much time were you awake, after falling asleep initially?&quot;, as reported by participants using a LogPad. Baseline was defined as the mean WASO from the Placebo Run-in Period. Change from Baseline was calculated as the mean of combined data from Weeks 14 through 26, using an LOCF approach.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Number of Awakenings (NAW) - 6-Month Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and the Mean of Weeks 14-26</time_frame>
    <description>NAW was defined as the number of times recorded for sleep diary question 4a &quot;How many times did you wake up during the night?&quot;, as reported by participants using a LogPad. Baseline was defined as the mean NAW from the Placebo Run-in Period. Change from Baseline was calculated as the mean of combined data from Weeks 14 through 26, using an LOCF approach.</description>

Responses could range from 0=Very poor to 100=Excellent, with a higher score indicating greater sleep quality. Baseline was defined as the mean Sleep Quality score from the Placebo Run-in Period. Change from Baseline was calculated as the mean of combined data from Weeks 14 through 26, using an LOCF approach.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Two Aggregate Measures of Short Form 36 (SF-36) Health Survey Score - 6-Month Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 is a participant-rated questionnaire that consists of 8 scaled scores: vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning, and mental health, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each of the 8 questions carries equal weight. The SF-36 can be divided into 2 aggregate summary measures: the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS). The scores can range from 0 to 100, with a lower score indicating more disability. Baseline was defined as the SF-36 score assessed at randomization.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Two Aggregate Measures of Short Form 36 (SF-36) Health Survey Score - 6-Month Treatment Period</title>
        <description>SF-36 is a participant-rated questionnaire that consists of 8 scaled scores: vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning, and mental health, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each of the 8 questions carries equal weight. The SF-36 can be divided into 2 aggregate summary measures: the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS). The scores can range from 0 to 100, with a lower score indicating more disability. Baseline was defined as the SF-36 score assessed at randomization.</description>
