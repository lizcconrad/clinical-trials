      Preliminary imaging study to test for future use of this MRI-imaging for evaluating
      anti-angiogenesis treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate new MR imaging techniques and protocols
      for non-invasive monitoring of anti-angiogenesis treatment of breast cancer. This feasibility
      study is a preliminary imaging study to test this imaging protocol on subjects already
      undergoing MR for clinical purposes.

      The specific objective of this research study is to develop and validate both MRI and
      functional MRI data acquisition methods, task paradigms, and post-processing techniques to
      ensure reliability of results.

      The information derived from this research is intended to be applied to a future study of
      subjects undergoing experimental anti-angiogenesis drug therapy.
