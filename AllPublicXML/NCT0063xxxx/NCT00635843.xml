    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to assess the safety and effectiveness of the MAVERICK™
      Total Disc Replacement as a method of treating patients with lumbar degenerative disc disease
      at one level from L4-S1, with overall success being the primary endpoint of the clinical
      trial. The primary objective is to show non-inferiority of the investigational device to the
      control treatment. If non-inferiority is established, superiority will be examined.

      For this clinical trial, there are two treatment groups, i.e., investigational patients who
      receive the MAVERICK™ Total Disc Replacement and control patients who receive the anterior
      lumbar interbody fusion procedure with INFUSE® Bone Graft/LT-CAGE® Lumbar Tapered Fusion
      Device. Each investigational site will enroll patients in a 2:1 investigational:control
      treatment randomization scheme.

    <measure>Overall Success</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Months</time_frame>
    <description>A patient will be considered an overall success if all of the following conditions are met:
pain/disability(Oswestry)success;
neurological status success;
disc height success;
no serious adverse event classified as &quot;implant associated&quot; or &quot;implant/surgical procedure associated&quot;;
no additional surgical procedure classified as a &quot;failure&quot;.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain/Disability Status</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The self-administered Oswestry Low Back pain Disability Questionnaire will be used. Success will be defined as pain/disability improvement postoperatively according to the following definition:
Preoperative Score - Postoperative Score &gt;= 15</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neurological Status</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Neurological status will be evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively. Neurological status is based on four types of measurements (sections): motor, sensory, reflexes, and straight leg raise. Each of the categories is comprised of a number of elements. Postoperative evaluations on each element on the Neurological status case report form will be compared to the preoperative evaluations. Success will be defined as maintenance or improvement in each element for the time period evaluated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disc Height Measurement</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Disc height will be measured postoperatively at each visit and compared to the measurement at 6 weeks postoperatively. Disc height success is based on either the anterior or posterior measurements meeting the following criterion:
Postoperative Disc Height- 6 Week Postoperative Disc Height &gt;= -2mm</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>General Health Status</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) will be used to assess general health status. The SF-36 results can be summarized into two components, a physical component summary (PCS) and a mental component summary (MCS). Success will be defined as a maintenance or improvement in status postoperatively as compared to the preoperative condition. To be classified as a success, the following criteria must be met:
PCSPostop - PCSPreop &gt;= 0; MCSPostop - MCSPreop &gt;= 0</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Back Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Numerical rating scales will be used to evaluate pain intensity and duration. The pain score (0 min, 20 Max) is derived by adding the numerical rating scores from the pain intensity (0-10, with a score of 0 representing &quot;no pain&quot; and a score of 10 representing &quot;pain as bad as it could be.&quot;) and duration scales (0-10, with a score of 0 being &quot;pain none of the time&quot; and a score of 10 being &quot;pain all of the time&quot;). Success for back and leg pain is described as follows:
Preoperative Score - Postoperative Score &gt;0</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Leg Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
