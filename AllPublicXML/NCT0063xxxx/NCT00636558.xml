    <textblock>
      Coxsackie A21 (CVA21) virus is to be administered by IV infusion to patients with Stage 4
      melanoma, prostate and breast cancer. This is a dose escalation, safety study.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, multiple dose, dose escalation, open label, cohort study of three
      intravenous doses of Coxsackie virus A21 in patients with stage IV solid tumours. Prospective
      patients will attend the study centre for initial screening within 28 days prior to
      commencement of treatment. They will have the nature of the study and its procedures and
      risks fully explained. Patients must then sign an informed consent form giving permission for
      tumour testing before initial screening can be commenced.

      Patients whose tumours test positive for ICAM-1 with or without DAF will attend the study
      centre for a further screening visit within 14 days prior to commencement of treatment. They
      will sign a full study informed consent form before any further screening procedures are
      carried out.

      Patients who satisfy all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will commence the
      treatment stage, which consists of one or more doses of CVA21 administered by intravenous
      infusion as per the dosage escalation chart. The first 4 cohorts will be treated as
      in-patients. The follow up period will consist of 12 weeks, during which time patients will
      attend the trial centre for up to13 follow up visits to collect safety and efficacy data.
