    <textblock>
      Although gastrointestinal endoscopy is widely accepted as fundamental to the diagnosis and
      treatment of digestive disorders in children, considerable controversy and practice
      differences persist with respect to the methods and agents used to achieve optimal endoscopic
      sedation.

      Comparison:oral midazolam vs midazolam IV in sedation and comfort scale of pediatric
      endoscopy.
