  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In varicocele the venous pressure in the prostatic bed is increased .This may result in
      raised hydrostatic pressure which in turn may stimulate prostatic hypertrophy.

      Restoring normal venous drainage is expected to lower hydrostatic pressure followed by
      inhibition of prostatic growth and possibly leading regression in prostatic dimensions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      35 male patients, aged 45 years or older, with documented benign prostatic hypertrophy
      (BPH)and varicocele as visualized by ultrasound and/or termography examination will be
      enrolled.

      Each patient will undergo a full urologic examination to exclude possible malignancy as well
      as a thorough medical examination to establish eligibility for treatment.

      In all selected patients the varicocele will be obliterated by means of embolization of the
      spermatic veins.

      The patients will be followed every three months by abdominal ultrasound as well as by serial
      PSA for a period of 6-12 months.
