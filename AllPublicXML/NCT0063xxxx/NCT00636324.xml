  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite widely used of nasal CPAP in preterm infants, uncertainties regarding aspects of its
      application remain. Clinical indications vary greatly between institutions, especially when
      combined with varieties of systems, devices, and techniques available. One of the
      controversial aspects that needs to be clarified is the level of pressure which should be
      used. The objective of the study is to compare the effectiveness of two ranges of nCPAP
      pressure that are within the spectrum of current practice for post-extubation support in very
      preterm infants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of nCPAP has been established as an effective respiratory support to prevent
      extubation failure and as treatment of other pulmonary diseases. An upsurge in its popularity
      has resulted in some controversial aspects, including the level of pressure to be used. The
      level that has been used in very preterm infants after extubation, which mostly came from
      anecdotal data, varies from 3 to 10 cmH2O.

      Physiologic studies show higher nCPAP pressures improve lung mechanical properties. Though
      potential side effects have been of concern in practical application, there is no formal
      evidence supporting the concept that increased CPAP pressure results in a higher risk of
      complications. In relatively stable preterm infants, the range of optimal CPAP level needs to
      be established in order to adequately support the upper airway and lungs, without increasing
      complications secondary to the pressure applied. Given the uncertainty of the nCPAP pressure
      that should be used in very preterm infants, we conduct a randomized controlled trial to
      compare the effectiveness of two ranges of nCPAP pressure for post-extubation support in very
      preterm infants.

      The purpose of this trial is to compare the rate of successful extubation of using the nasal
      CPAP level of 7 to 9 cmH2O compared to level of 4 to 6 cmH2O.
