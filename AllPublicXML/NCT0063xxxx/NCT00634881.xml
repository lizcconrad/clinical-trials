      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as alemtuzumab, can block cancer growth in different
      ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and
      help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of alemtuzumab in
      treating patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine the safest dose of alemtuzumab as consolidation therapy in patients in
           second remission after fludarabine phosphate alone; fludarabine phosphate and
           cyclophosphamide; fludarabine phosphate, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab; bendamustine
           hydrochloride alone; or bendamustine hydrochloride and rituximab.

        -  To determine the frequency of cytomegalovirus reactivations or infections during or
           after alemtuzumab treatment.

        -  To determine which dose of alemtuzumab is efficient to eliminate minimal residual
           disease in peripheral blood and bone marrow (i.e., to turn a clinical partial remission
           into a clinical complete remission [CR], to turn a flow cytometry-positive CR into a
           flow cytometry-negative CR, or to turn a PCR-positive CR into a PCR-negative CR).

        -  To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of alemtuzumab.

        -  To compare the pharmacokinetic profile between intravenous versus subcutaneous
           administration of alemtuzumab.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of alemtuzumab.

        -  Group 1: Patients receive escalating doses of alemtuzumab IV over 2 hours once weekly
           for 8 weeks until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.

        -  Group 2: Patients receive escalating doses of alemtuzumab subcutaneously once weekly for
           8 weeks, beginning with the MTD determined in group 1 until a second MTD is determined.

      Patients undergo bone marrow and blood sample collection periodically for laboratory and
      pharmacokinetic studies. Samples are analyzed for minimal residual disease and T-cell subsets
      (i.e., CD4 and CD8) via quantitative-PCR analysis and flow cytometry and cytomegalovirus
      antigens via PCR.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months.
