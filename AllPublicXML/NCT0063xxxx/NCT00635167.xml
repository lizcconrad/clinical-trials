  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Solid tumors, including prostate cancer, commonly exhibit tumor-associated neovascularity
      (growth of new blood vessels to feed the tumor) with increased microvessel density. Systemic,
      hormonal, and radiotherapy treatments typically decrease or suppress tumor - associated
      vascularity through several mechanisms, including apoptosis (process of cell death) and
      anti-angiogenic pathways (ways to destroy new blood vessel growth). Previously at the
      investigators' center, they have demonstrated that increased prostatic vascularity (blood
      vessels defined to prostate) detected ultrasonographically correlated with disease free
      survival after radical prostatectomy (surgical removal of entire prostate), and may be
      indicative of higher grade, higher stage disease. The significance of prostate neovascularity
      in response to treatment with external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) (standard of care) has not
      been well studied. The investigators hypothesize that prostate cancer that recurs after
      radiotherapy may exhibit measurable patterns of tumor-associated vascularity, which may
      represent a minimally invasive marker of cancer stage, grade and response to treatment. The
      investigators propose a pilot study to assess the feasibility of serial enhanced transrectal
      ultrasonography (TRUS) examinations during and after radiotherapy for prostate cancer.

    <description>Once a subject is identified TRUS schedule will be set up revolving around the EBRT treatment schedule. A schedule of 6 contrast enhanced TRUS examinations per subject is planned as follows: week 0 (prior to EBRT, baseline [Visit 2]); week 5 (middle of treatment [Visit 3]); week 10 (end of treatment [Visit 4]); week 18 (2 months after end of EBRT [Visit 5]); week 26 (4 months after end of EBRT [Visit 6]); and week 36 (6 months after end of EBRT [Visit 7]).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men aged 40 - 80 years old

          -  Biopsy proven intermediate/high risk clinically localized prostate cancer, as
             determined by a Gleason score of 7 or higher, clinical stage T2b or higher, or PSA &gt;
             10. Pathology will be confirmed by at least two reviews

          -  Patients opting for EBRT (external beam radiation therapy, standard of care) without
             hormonal ablation

          -  Ability to undergo serial TRUS procedures

          -  Ability to give informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has known hypersensitivity to octafluoropropane.

          -  Evidence of distant metastatic disease on staging evaluation

          -  Previous treatment for prostate cancer, including any form of androgen ablation

          -  Previous procedures involving the anus or rectum, making serial TRUS difficult or
             dangerous

          -  Expected life expectancy less than 10 years

          -  Baseline testosterone &lt; 200 ng/dL

          -  Subject with cardiac shunts and elevated pulmonary hypertension

          -  Subject has worsening or clinically unstable congestive heart failure.

          -  Subject has acute myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome.

          -  Subject has ventricular arrhythmias or is high risk for arrhythmias.

          -  Subject has respiratory failure, severe emphysema or pulmonary emboli.

          -  Subject has a history of cardiac shunt or pulmonary hypertension.
