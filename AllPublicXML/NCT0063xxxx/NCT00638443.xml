  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the proposed pilot study is to determine the efficacy of pregabalin
      in prolonging the time to onset of pain and reducing the severity of pain associated with
      walking in patients with neurogenic claudication. Neurogenic claudication is defined as
      movement induced leg pain, numbness, heaviness, or vague discomfort in part or all of one or
      both legs provoked with walking and standing and relieved by sitting, squatting, or forward
      flexion posturing. The secondary objective is to examine the functional benefit of pregabalin
      with respect to improvement in duration and distance of walking.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects were randomized into one of two treatment sequences: pregabalin/active placebo or
      active placebo/pregabalin. Each arm lasted 10 days, with a washout period of 10 days between
      treatments. Pregabalin was administered as a standardized two step titration, starting at
      75mg twice daily up to a maximum daily dose of 150mg twice daily; and likewise,
      diphenhydramine (active placebo) was administered starting at 6.25mg twice daily up to a
      maximum daily dose of 12.5mg twice daily. The primary endpoint was time to first symptoms of
      moderate intensity (NRS ≥ 4/10) during treadmill ambulation. Ambulation assessment was
      performed during the screening visit, and on day 10 of each period to evaluate pain intensity
      associated with walking as well as distance covered by the patients. Quantitative assessment
      of ambulation was conducted on a treadmill at 0° ramp incline at 1.2 miles per hour (mph).
      Measurement of self-reported symptom severity using the NRS at baseline, and every 30 seconds
      for a maximum of 15 minutes was recorded. The following information was also recorded: time
      to first symptoms, total ambulation time. The examination was stopped after 15 minutes or at
      the onset of severe symptoms. Severe symptoms were defined as the level of discomfort that
      would make patients stop walking in usual life situations. No one was encouraged or prompted
      to continue walking beyond this point. Patients were instructed to walk with an upright
      posture. They were not permitted to lean forward or hold onto the handrails during the
      examination. Secondary outcome measures included area under the curve of present pain
      intensity with ambulation at each specified time point, final pain intensity with walking,
      walking tolerance, time to return to baseline pain level after ambulation, as well as the
      results of a series of pain related questionnaires including: Visual Analog Scale (VAS),
      Patient Global Assessment (PGA), NRS, Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), modified
      Brief Pain Inventory short form (mBPI-sf), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and Swiss Spinal
      Stenosis (SSS).

    <measure>Time to First Symptoms of Moderate Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>10 days</time_frame>
    <description>Using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) (0=no pain, 10=worst pain imaginable)the time to first symptoms (Tfirst) with a NRS score greater than or equal to 4 (moderate pain level), with treadmill ambulation was measured.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Final Pain as Measured by NRS</measure>
    <time_frame>10 days</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects were instructed to walk on the treadmill and to tell the research coordinator to stop testing when they reached the point at which they typically would need to stop and sit down, or until 15 minutes had elapsed. At defined intervals subjects were asked what their pain level was according to the NRS. When the subject reached their maximum distance, they were asked their NRS score. This was recorded as final pain intensity. Using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) (0=no pain, 10=worst pain imaginable)the time to first symptoms (Tfirst) with a NRS score greater than or equal to 4 (moderate pain level), with treadmill ambulation was measured.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total Distance</measure>
    <time_frame>10 days</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects were instructed to walk on the treadmill and to tell the research coordinator to stop testing when they reached the point at which they typically would need to stop and sit down, or until 15 minutes had elapsed. When the subject reached their maximum distance, the treadmill testing was stopped. This was recorded as total distance based on number of minutes and seconds walked. Minutes was converted to meters based on calculation of defined speed of the treadmill.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Recovery Time</measure>
    <time_frame>10 days</time_frame>
    <description>After the subject completed the treadmill test they were asked to immediately return to the seated position. At this point a timer was started. When the subjects pain level returned to baseline (level of pain subject felt in a seated position before walking) the time was stopped. This was recorded as recovery time. Maximum recovery time is 15 minutes.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Area Under the Curve</measure>
    <time_frame>10 days</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects were instructed to walk on the treadmill and to tell the research coordinator to stop testing when they reached the point at which they typically would need to stop and sit down, or until 15 minutes had elapsed. At defined intervals (every 30 seconds) subjects were asked what their pain level was according to the NRS. The area under the curve of present pain intensity multiplied by the amount of time the subject walked.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 days</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS asked subjects to place a mark indicative of their low back pain during the past day on a 100mm line, with 0mm representing no pain and 100mm representing extreme pain.</description>

    <measure>Swiss Spinal Stenosis (SSS) Score- Symptom Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>10 days</time_frame>
    <description>The SSS is a series of questions asking about symptom severity, physical function, and satisfaction. The symptom severity section is a set of 7 questions (maximum score is 5 points per question) and asks to rate pain for each question based on no pain, mild, moderate, severe or very severe pain. The total score (maximum=35) is added up and divided by seven. The maximum score for the symptom severity section (score=5) indicates very severe symptom severity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Swiss Spinal Stenosis- Physical Function</measure>
    <time_frame>10 days</time_frame>
    <description>The SSS is a series of questions asking about symptom severity, physical function, and satisfaction. The physical function section is a series of 5 questions (maximum 4 points per question) and asks to rate function for each question based on comfortably, sometimes with pain, always with pain, no functional ability. The total score (max=20) is divided by five. The maximum score for the physical function section (max=4) indicates no ability to function.</description>

        <description>Subjects were instructed to walk on the treadmill and to tell the research coordinator to stop testing when they reached the point at which they typically would need to stop and sit down, or until 15 minutes had elapsed. At defined intervals subjects were asked what their pain level was according to the NRS. When the subject reached their maximum distance, they were asked their NRS score. This was recorded as final pain intensity.
