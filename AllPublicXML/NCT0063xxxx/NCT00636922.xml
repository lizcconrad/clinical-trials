  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of RAD001 in combination
      with low-dose cytarabine in acute myeloid leukemia patients unfit for intensive chemotherapy.
      The secondary goals are to investigate the likely causes of drug response or failure.

      A multicentre 2-stage Phase Ib/II trial of 5-Azacitidine combined with Everolimus for AML
      patients over the age of 60 or relapsed AML over the age of 18. The MTD and DLT of
      5-Azacitidine (7 doses over 9 days) given monthly combined with Everolimus orally for 17 days
      (day 5-21) each month (1 cycle) for a minimum of 6 cycles and for at least 2 cycles beyond
      achievement of CR and for a maximum of 12 cycles. Everolimus maintenance therapy alone may be
      continued at investigator's discretion until either progressive disease or dose limiting
      toxicity. Groups of 3 patients will be entered at each dose level. Dose escalation/stopping
      rules to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) are as follows:

      Number in cohort experiencing DLT by day 42 Action 2/3 or 3/3 No further dose escalation.
      Previous level is defined as MTD 0/3 Dose escalate to next level 1/3 Expand cohort to 6
      patients 1/6 or 2/6 Dose escalate to next level &gt;2/6 No further dose escalation. Previous
      level is defined as MTD

      Note that if dose escalation is still indicated at the highest dose level, then the MTD is at
      or above the last dose level. If the trial stops at the first dose, then the MTD is below the
      first dose level. In either of the above cases, the MTD is not determined from the trial.

      Once the maximum dose level has been identified, a dose expansion phase will continue
      recruiting patients at the MTD until a total of 40 patients for the entire study is accrued.

    <description>In this study, 5-azacitidine will be administered sc for 7 doses over 9 days in a 28 day cycle. Everolimus will be administered orally with the first dose starting on day 5 (first Friday) of each cycle and continued until day 21 of each cycle. Patients will be treated with combined azacitidine + Everolimus for a minimum of 6 cycles and until at least 2 cycles after documentation of CR. Upon cessation of azacitidine, the patient will be permitted to take Everolimus maintenance therapy until progression at the investigator's discretion.</description>
