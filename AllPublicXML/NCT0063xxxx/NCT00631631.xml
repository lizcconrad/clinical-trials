      The purpose of this study was to collect information regarding the safety and tolerability of
      mifamurtide (liposomal muramyl tripeptide phosphatidyl ethanolamine; L-MTP-PE).

      The drug being tested in this study is called mifamurtide (L-MTP-PE; liposomal muramyl
      tripeptide phosphatidyl ethanolamine). Mifamurtide is being used to treat people with
      osteosarcoma, a form of cancer.

      This was a patient-access study that looked at adverse events, disease progression, and
      overall survival in study participants.

      The study enrolled 205 patients, of whom 204 were treated with mifamurtide intravenously at a
      dose of 2 mg/m2 twice weekly (at least 3 days apart) for 12 weeks, and then weekly for an
      additional 24 weeks, for a total of 48 doses in 36 weeks (following surgery for primary or
      metastatic disease).

      This study was conducted in the United States. Participants could receive treatment for up to
      9 months. This study was previously mis-categorized as an interventional study.

        Had diagnosis of high grade osteosarcoma with relapsed or recurrent disease, locally or
        metastatic, with disease not completely resectable or who were unable to complete
        recommended chemotherapy due to toxicity: relapse, recurrence local or metastatic; unable
        to have standard surgical resection; abbreviated chemotherapy regimen secondary to
        toxicity.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Had signed informed consent/assent. Voluntary participation in the pharmacokinetic
             portion of the compassionate access protocol was included in the informed consent but
             not required for compassionate use participation.

          2. Had diagnosis of high grade osteosarcoma with relapsed or recurrent disease, locally
             or metastatic, with disease not completely resectable or who were unable to complete
             recommended chemotherapy due to toxicity: relapse, recurrence local or metastatic;
             unable to have standard surgical resection; abbreviated chemotherapy regimen secondary
             to toxicity (e.g. hypophosphatemia from ifosfamide, cardiotoxicity from doxorubicin,
             renal dysfunction from methotrexate, ifosfamide, or cisplatin.)

          3. Aged 2 ≤ 50 years.

             contraceptives, Lupron Depot, DepoProvera, and condom with diaphragm and spermicidal
             jelly.

          9. Performance status: Lansky 50-100% (≤ 16 years of age); OR, Eastern Cooperative
             Oncology Group (ECOG) 0-2 or Karnofsky 50-100% (&gt;16 years of age).
