      The purpose of the study is to determine the safety profile of minocycline in patients with
      PSC and to compare the effects of minocycline on the baseline values of the following
      parameters: symptoms of pruritus and fatigue, liver biochemistries, Mayo Risk Score, the
      development of clinical progression and complications of liver disease.
