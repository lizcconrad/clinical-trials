  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Determine the in-vivo mechanism of action of INF-B-1b as it's mechanisms of action are not
      completely understood. We propose that high dose exogenous recombinant IFN-B-1b induces
      tolerizing effect on DC-dependent T-cell differentiation in patients with MS by inducing the
      expression of SOCS3 in DCs.
