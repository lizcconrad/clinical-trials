    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate clinical, dosimetrical, functional, biological and
      genetic factors in predicting chemo-radiotherapy induced lung and esophagus injury.
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We propose a prospective study to investigate the combinational effect of radiotherapeutic
      dosimetric parameters [mean lung dose and percentage of lung volume receiving at least XGy
      (Vx)] and biological parameters
      [interleukin-1α(IL1α),interleukin-1β(IL1β),interleukin-6(IL6),interleukin-7(IL7),transforming
      growth factor beta (TGFB)] and manganese superoxide dismutase(MnSOD) in predicting radiation
      pneumonitis, fibrosis, and radiation esophageal injury. Eligibility included pathological or
      cytological proven thoracic cancer,ECOG performance status [PS] 0-2, no prior thoracic RT or
      chemotherapy,no distant metastasis and signed informed consent prior to study entry.

      Basic pre-treatment information will be collected, which included ECOG PS, UICC/AJCC
      stage,primary lesion site, history of smoking/coexisting lung disease/surgical resection, and
      pulmonary function test of FEV1/VC/DLCO. Computed tomography [CT] of the whole lung in
      treatment position. Blood test of IL1α,IL1β,IL6,IL7,TGFB and MnSOD by ELISA will be done
      before and weekly during RT. RT must be given by photon energies &gt;=6MV. Radiation lung and
      esophageal injury will be assessed according to common toxicity criteria adverse effect
      version3.0 [CTCAE-3.0] during RT and in every follow up visits. Genomic DNA is obtained from
      the blood drawn during RT. Chi-square test, T test, analysis of variance, logistic
      regression, and proportional hazard ratio method will be used to investigate whether the
      parameter(s) can be effective in predicting radiation related sequelae.

    <description>There is only one group in this study. The patients of this group will go through procedures as follow: basic pre-treatment information collected,treatment include platinum-based chemotherapy and 3-D conformal radiotherapy, blood test during RT 6am every Monday and follow-up visits with treatment-induced injury assessed.</description>

      Patients' blood samples will be retained for the purpose of cytokine and MnSOD assay and DNA
      detection. The samples will be left till the study ends. Paitents will have their vein blood
      drawn from left arm 6am every Monday during RT. All above is stated in informed consent form.
