  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Because bilateral lower extremity amputees do not have an intact limb for use with the
      mirror, we are now proposing to conduct a pilot trial of two treatments for phantom limb pain
      (PLP) - direct observation of another person's foot moving versus mental visualization. The
      trial will last for 4 months and during the first month data will be gathered daily on the
      number of episodes of phantom limb pain, the average length of episodes, and the average
      intensity of pain in each phantom leg. In addition, the rapidity of pain relief, the length
      of therapy needed to sustain long-lasting pain relief, and whether use of these two treatment
      methods during rehabilitation can provide sustained and/or permanent pain relief will be
      determined. This study will test the hypothesis that direct observation of a limb while
      performing phantom limb movements will reduce phantom limb pain more than mental
      visualization of the phantom limb alone in subjects who have sustained a traumatic bilateral
      lower limb amputation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of forty-two (42) subjects with bilateral lower extremity amputations will be
      enrolled. Subjects will be randomized for assignment into two treatment conditions:
      twenty-one (21) subjects will use direct observation of another person's foot movements while
      twenty-one (21) will use mental visualization of foot movements (which will serve as the
      control group). Subjects in each group will be further be randomized for assignment into six
      treatment groups: direct observation or mental visualization of right lower extremity
      movements alone, direct observation or mental visualization of left lower extremity movements
      alone, or direct observation or mental visualization of simultaneous bilateral lower
      extremity movements. Subjects will use their assigned therapy for 20 minutes daily. The
      subjects for this study will be recruited from the Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC)
      Amputee clinic. Up to sixty (50) subjects will be recruited and screened according to the
      inclusion and exclusion criteria since we expect that some may not qualify or drop-out sooner
      than the scheduled 4-month completion time.
