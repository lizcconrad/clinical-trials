  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase 1 study is to evaluate the safety and potential efficacy of Gene
      Mediated Cytotoxic Immunotherapy for pancreatic cancer. The approach uses an adenoviral
      vector (disabled virus) engineered to express the Herpes thymidine kinase gene (AdV-tk),
      followed by an antiherpetic prodrug, valacyclovir.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The AdV-tk vector is injected into the tumor or tumor bed at the time of biopsy or standard
      tumor surgery after which valacyclovir pills are taken for 14 days. Two courses of AdV-tk,
      each followed by valacyclovir, are given as adjuvant to standard of care therapies (surgery
      and/or chemoradiation) which have been shown to work cooperatively with AdV-tk to kill tumor
      cells. Arm A is for resectable tumors in which the first course is given prior to surgery and
      the second is at the time of surgery. Arm B is for locally advanced disease in which both
      AdV-tk injections are administered by needle injection into the tumor before and during
      chemoradiation. The hypothesis is that this combination therapy can be safely delivered and
      will lead to improvement in the clinical outcome for patients with pancreatic cancer.

    <description>Arm A is for resectable tumors. The first AdV-tk course is given prior to surgery by CT or EUS guided injection into the tumor followed by 14 days of valacyclovir. The second AdV-tk injection is into the tumor bed at the time of surgery again followed by 14 days of valacyclovir.</description>

    <description>Arm B is for locally advanced tumors for which chemoradiation is the planned standard of care treatment. AdV-tk is delivered by CT or EUS guided injection into the tumor. The first AdV-tk injection is given prior to starting chemoradiation and the second in week 3 of chemoradiation. Both injections are followed by 14 days of valacyclovir.

    <description>Four dose levels of AdV-tk with a fixed dose level of valacyclovir are evaluated independently in the two arms of the study due to differences in the concomitant standard of care treatments. The first AdV-tk course is given prior to surgery or radiation by CT or EUS guided injection into the tumor followed by 14 days of valacyclovir. The second AdV-tk injection is into the tumor bed at the time of surgery in Arm A or same as the first injection in Arm B again followed by 14 days of valacyclovir. The AdV-tk dose levels are: Level 1= 3x10e10 vector particles (vp), Level 2= 1x10e11 vp, Level 3= 3x10e11 vp, Level 4= 1x10e12 vp</description>
