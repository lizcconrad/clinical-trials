    <measure>Number of Participants Who Maintained an Absolute Peripheral Blood Neutrophil Count &gt;=1500/µL</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Peripheral blood neutrophil counts were performed on Day 2 and Weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the treatment period</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Sputum Absolute Neutrophil Count</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and while on study drug (up to 4 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Induced sputum samples were obtained at Baseline and at Weeks 2 and 4 of the treatment period. Samples were collected before study drug administration using the nebulizer method and sent to a central laboratory for analysis. An average was taken over all post-baseline samples collected no later than one day after the last dose of study drug.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Total Asthma Symptom Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4</time_frame>
    <description>Total Asthma Symptom Score is the sum of individual symptoms of wheezing, coughing, and dyspnea assessed twice daily (morning and evening) and is recorded on a comment diary card. Each of the symptoms receives a daily score from 0 (none) to 3 (severe), averaged over the two daily assessments. The total score ranges from 0 to 9, with a lower score indicating less severe asthma symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Post-Bronchodilator Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Spirometry was used to measure post-bronchodilator FEV1 at Baseline and before study drug administration at Weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4. Participants received 4 puffs of bronchodilator (salbutamol hydrofluoroalkane or equivalent) at 30-second intervals and spirometry was performed 30 minutes later. The mean change from baseline is based on the average change over all post-baseline assessments.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire With Standardized Activities (AQLQ[S])</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The AQLQ[S] was administered at Baseline and at Weeks 2 and 4. The assessment consists of a 32-item questionnaire covering 4 domains: symptoms, emotional functioning, impact of environmental stimuli, and activity limitation. Each item receives a score from 1 (worst, or most affected) to 7 (not at all affected). The score is the mean across all items, and ranges from 1 to 7. The mean change from baseline is based on the average change over all post-baseline assessments.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With an Adverse Event (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered study drug which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. AEs may include the onset of new illness and the exacerbation of pre-existing conditions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With an Electrocardiogram Adverse Event</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The endpoint measured was any electrocardiogram abnormality that was reported as an AE. An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered study drug which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. AEs may include the onset of new illness and the exacerbation of pre-existing conditions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With a Laboratory Adverse Event</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The endpoint measured was any laboratory (hematology, blood chemistry, or urinalysis) abnormality that was reported as an AE. An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered study drug which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. AEs may include the onset of new illness and the exacerbation of pre-existing conditions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Who Discontinued Treatment Because of an Adverse Event or a Protocol-defined Clinical Event</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered study drug which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. AEs may include the onset of new illness and the exacerbation of pre-existing conditions. A protocol-defined clinical event is an asthma exacerbation requiring addition of or increase in systemic steroids, as determined by the investigator.</description>

             Screening.

          -  Documented diagnosis of asthma (within past 5 years), determined by at least one of
             the following: &gt;=12% and 200 mL improvement in Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second
             (FEV1) post-bronchodilator, and/or airway hyperresponsiveness (eg, positive
