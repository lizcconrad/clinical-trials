      This study attempts to observe the efficacy (response time) and safety of the
      second-generation antipsychotic agent-quetiapine versus the first-generation antipsychotic
      agent-haloperidol, in treating acute schizophrenia episode and to evaluate the effect of the
      effectiveness of acute schizophrenia episode on long-term tolerability.

      Both medication and patient can affect the compliance of patients to treatment. The control
      of schizophrenia syndromes effectively and rapidly will build up the confidence of patients
      on treatments. These early effects may influence the long-term compliance and prognosis of
      patients. And the antipsychotic medications with neuroprotection effect can significantly
      improve the long-term prognosis of patients, too.In the past, we always think that there is
      &quot;delayed onset of antipsychotic&quot; by antipsychotic medications. Recently, a large sample study
      indicated that the onset of antipsychotic effect was as early as the first day after
      administration (in 24 hours). This study was carried out in order to compare the
      second-generation antipsychotic agent- quetiapine with the first-generation antipsychotic
      agent- haloperidol on the onset time of treatment.
