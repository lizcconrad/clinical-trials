    <textblock>
      Prospective, multicenter, registry of at least 11,000 (and up to 15,000) consecutive patients
      with coronary artery disease undergoing stent-assisted percutaneous coronary intervention
      (PCI) using DES without major procedural complications.

      To determine:

        1. the frequency, timing and correlates (clinical and angiographic) of drug-eluting stent
           (DES) thrombosis in a patient population with few clinical and angiographic exclusion
           criteria,

        2. the relationship of aspirin and/or clopidogrel hyporesponsiveness, and general platelet
           reactivity to early and late DES thrombosis in separate phases stratified by whether the
           patient is taking dual (aspirin plus clopidogrel) or single (aspirin alone) antiplatelet
           therapy, and

        3. combining the findings from the above 2 objectives, to identify a cohort representing a
           significant proportion of all patients at increased risk to have early and/or late DES
           stent thrombosis.

      <textblock>
        Patient undergoing PCI in whom at least one DES is implanted and in whom PCI of all treated
        lesions is successful (diameter stenosis &lt;30% with TIMI 3 flow in all treated lesions)
        without major complications (defined as freedom from procedural death, intraprocedural
        stent thrombosis, procedural myocardial infarction or sustained vessel closure, or need for
        emergency bypass graft surgery).

    <sampling_method>Probability Sample</sampling_method>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients undergoing PCI in whom at least one DES is implanted and in whom PCI of all
             treated lesions is successful (diameter stenosis &lt;30% with TIMI 3 flow in all treated
             lesions) without major complications (defined as freedom from procedural death,
             intra-procedural stent thrombosis, procedural myocardial infarction or sustained
             vessel closure, or need for emergency bypass graft surgery). One or more bare metal
             stents (BMS) may be implanted, and other lesions may be treated without stenting as
             long as at least one DES is implanted. However, the procedure must be successful and
             uncomplicated (as defined above) for all lesions (DES + BMS + non-stent).

          2. Aspirin use: Adequate aspirin loading given prior to PCI: at least 300 mg non enteric
             coated oral aspirin at least 1 hour prior to the procedure or 324 mg chewed or 250 mg
             IV aspirin at least 30 minutes prior to the procedure.

          3. Patient has Hematocrit between 30 and 52% and Platelet Count greater than 100,000/µl.

          4. For US sites: Only FDA-approved DES stents may be used in this study. For OUS sites:
             Only DES stents that are CE marked for approval may be used in this study.

          5. PCI performed with unfractionated or low molecular weight heparin, or bivalirudin as
             the procedural antithrombin.

          6. Patient or guardian able to provide informed written consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients in whom blood for Accumetrics VerifyNow platelet function testing cannot be
             drawn after the minimum clopidogrel loading duration and Glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa
             inhibitor washout duration as follows:

               1. Clopidogrel loading: Clopidogrel loading pre PCI is recommended, but post PCI
                  clopidogrel loading is acceptable per standard of care. In all patients (whether
                  or not clopidogrel is initiated pre or post PCI), prior to blood drawing for
                  VerifyNow platelet function testing, a 600 mg loading dose must have been given
                  at least 6 hours prior, or a 300 mg loading dose must have been given at least 12
                  hours prior, or the patient must have been maintained on at least 75 mg of
                  clopidogrel daily for at least 5 days.

               2. GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor washout: Eptifibatide or tirofiban must have been
                  discontinued for at least 24 hours prior to VerifyNow platelet function testing.
                  Abciximab must have been discontinued for at 10 days prior to VerifyNow platelet
                  function testing.

          2. Inability of the VerifyNow system to measure either Aspirin, P2Y12 or IIb/IIIa
             platelet responsiveness.

          3. Severe allergy to stainless steel, contrast dye, all anti-thrombin agents
             (unfractionated and low molecular weight heparin and bivalirudin), aspirin or
             clopidogrel that cannot be adequately pre-medicated.

          4. Concurrent enrollment in another trial that involves an investigational stent,
             antithrombotic or antiplatelet agent. Patient in other investigational trials that
             have not reached their primary endpoint may be enrolled in ADAPT-DES as long as the
             other trials do not involve an investigational stent, antithrombotic or antiplatelet
             agent and inclusion of such patient will have no effect on the endpoint of either
             study.

          5. Patients in whom bypass graft surgery is planned within 2 years.

          6. Patients with stent thrombosis before the performance of pre-discharge VerifyNow
             platelet function testing.

          7. Patients unwilling or unable to complete clinical follow-up for the duration of the
             study.
