      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy for the prevention of the
      recurrence for bladder cancer after TUR-Bt

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      DEP domain containing 1(DEPDC1) and M phase phosphoprotein 1(MPHOSPH1) have been identified
      using genome-wide expression profile analysis by the use of cDNA microarray in our previous
      studies. The investigators have determined the HLA-A*2402 restricted epitope peptides derived
      from DEPDC1, DEPDC1-9-294, and MPHOSPH1, MPHOSPH1-9-278. These epitopes showed strong IFN-g
      production when stimulated with the appropriate targets expressed the appropriate protein and
      HLA-A*2402. Furthermore, when vaccinated these peptides, specific CTLs were determined after
      the vaccination. Therefore we focused on the prevention of the recurrence of the bladder
      cancer after surgery using these peptides.

    <description>DEPDC1-9-294, and/or MPHOSPH1-9-278 will be administered by subcutaneously injection once every week after curative surgery 8 times and BCG in bladder simultaneously. Then, DEPDC1-9-294, and/or MPHOSPH1-9-278 will be administered once every month. These peptides are determined to administer in accordance with the protein expression using immunohistochemical staining. These peptides are conjugated with Montanide ISA 51 as an adjuvant.</description>
