  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to investigate whether administration of maintenance
      temozolomide following standard treatment could possibly prevent or delay the onset of brain
      metastases in patients with controlled non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, open-label, randomized, multicenter study of maintenance temozolomide
      versus observation in subjects with stable or responding stage III/IV NSCLC to be conducted
      in conformance with Good Clinical Practices. Subjects will be randomly assigned to a study
      drug (temozolomide) or observation arm. The study drug will be administered at a dose of 75
      mg/m^2 PO daily for 21 consecutive days, followed by a 7-day rest period, until progression
      or up to a maximum of 6 cycles, whichever occurs first. Subjects completing 6 cycles of
      treatment will be followed up for incidence of brain metastasis for up to 2 years, or until
      progression.

    <description>The time to progression (per response evaluation criteria in solid tumors [RECIST]) was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method.
Definitions of response per RECIST:
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions.
Partial Response (PR): A decrease of at least 30% in the sum of the longest
diameter of target lesions.
Progressive Disease (PD): An increase of at least 20% in the sum of the longest
diameter of target lesions.
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease.</description>

    <time_frame>from Cycle 1 Day 1 of Standard First Line Systemic Therapy to the last time of follow-up (up to 6 cycles (168 days) of study treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item questionnaire developed to assess the QoL of cancer patients. Scores range from 0 -100. For functional and global QoL scales, higher scores mean a better level of function. For symptom-oriented scales, a higher score means more severe symptoms and a decrease in QoL. The EORTC QLQ-LC13 is a 13-item questionnaire developed to supplement the EORTC QLQ-C30 in lung cancer patients. It has a score range 0-100 with higher scores representing an increase in symptoms.</description>

        <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item questionnaire developed to assess the QoL of cancer patients. Scores range from 0 -100. For functional and global QoL scales, higher scores mean a better level of function. For symptom-oriented scales, a higher score means more severe symptoms and a decrease in QoL. The EORTC QLQ-LC13 is a 13-item questionnaire developed to supplement the EORTC QLQ-C30 in lung cancer patients. It has a score range 0-100 with higher scores representing an increase in symptoms.</description>
