  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brain injury from explosive blast is a prominent feature of contemporary combat. Although
      protective armor and effective acute medical intervention allows soldiers to survive blast
      events, a growing number of veterans will have disability stemming from blast-related neural
      damage. Soldiers also return from combat with psychological disabilities caused by traumatic
      war events. The clinical presentation of individuals with blast-related neural damage and
      post-traumatic psychopathology are markedly similar and thus a clear description of the
      direct consequences of explosive blast is complicated by the emotional and cognitive sequelae
      of psychological trauma. We will use sophisticated measures of neural function and structure
      to characterize brain injury from explosive blasts in a sample of Operation Iraqi Freedom
      (OIF) National Guard soldiers who returned from deployment in the fall of 2007. Survey data
      gathered near the end of deployment indicated that over 50% of the brigade had been exposed
      to direct physical effects of explosive blasts. To fully characterize the effects of blast on
      the brain and differentiate them from post-traumatic stress disorder, we will contrast groups
      of soldiers exposed to blast and with groups experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder.
      This investigation will improve the characterization of blast-related traumatic brain injury,
      describe the essential features of the condition in terms of neural function and structure to
      inform diagnosis, and characterize mechanisms of recovery after blast-related neural injury
      to allow the creation of interventions that return soldiers to maximum levels of functioning.

      Background: The clinical presentation of individuals with blast-related brain injury and
      post-traumatic stress reactions can be markedly similar and thus a clear description of the
      direct consequences of explosive blast is complicated by the emotional and cognitive sequelae
      of psychological trauma. The inability to clearly separate the basis of symptoms for the two
      conditions has hampered clinicians in prescribing effective treatments that return soldiers
      to maximal functioning. Measures that directly assess neural disruption may be employed to
      differentiate blast-related brain injury from post-traumatic psychopathology and guide
      effective intervention..

      Objective/Hypothesis: We propose to use quantitative indices of brain electrical activity and
      diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to characterize the effects of blast injury on brain function
      and structure. We hypothesize that Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) soldiers injured by
      explosive blast will be distinguishable from those with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
      on measures of brain function and structure. Specifically, blast exposure will be associated
      with diminished P3a amplitudes to target stimuli during sustained attention and diminished
      lateralized frontal potentials during recognition of previously presented words. Individuals
      with PTSD will exhibit normal amplitudes of P3 and lateralized frontal brain potentials.
      Blast affected soldiers will also have compromised white matter integrity in supracallosal,
      inferior frontal, and superior frontal brain regions while PTSD will not be associated with
      these structural abnormalities. Finally, functional brain anomalies (e.g., P3a), and frontal
      white matter fractional anisotropy will be associated with the adaptive functioning of
      soldiers.

      Specific Aims: Using advanced quantitative analyses of electroencephalogram recordings we
      will determine the nature of functional neural anomalies related to sustained attention and
      memory deficits evident after injury from blast. We will determine white matter anomalies
      that are unique to blast injury as compared to PTSD. We will also determine which aspects of
      blast-related functional and structural brain abnormalities are associated with adaptive
      functioning in post-deployment. The long-term goals for the proposed program of research are
      to improve the characterization of traumatic brain injury (TBI) due to blast, describe its
      essential features in terms of neural function and structure to improve diagnosis, and
      characterize mechanisms of recovery after blast-related neural injury to facilitate the
      creation of interventions that target pathophysiology.

      Study Design: In May of 2007 over 2650 Minnesota National Guard troops of the 1/34 BCT
      completed a within-theatre survey on health, exposure to blast, and traumatic events.
      Fifty-one percent of surveyed troops reported being close enough to an explosive blast that
      they felt a heat or pressure wave, had trouble hearing, or had subsequent problems with
      attention or memory. The proposed study will be carried out over a four-year period and
      include a total of 180 subjects. To determine the neural consequences of blast exposure we
      will compare the functional and structural brain characteristics of individuals from the 1/34
      BCT who have blast injury, blast injury and PTSD, PTSD, and no blast injury or PTSD. There
      will be 45 demographically similar subjects in each group.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A high level of posttraumatic stress will be operationally defined &quot;moderate&quot; levels
             (a rating of 3 or more on a 1 to 5 scale) of the following symptoms according to Hoge
             et al 4: one re-experiencing symptom, three avoidance symptoms, and two hyperarousal
             symptoms. Staff will complete a screening interview via telephone in which the
             potential participant answers questions from the Blast Exposure Screen. The Blast
             Exposure Screen provides a comprehensive assessment of exposure to blast for the
             duration of deployment. Blast events will be rated for physical effects (e.g., knocked
             off balance, physically thrown by blast) and after effects (i.e., memory problems,
             headache) on the individual.

          -  Individuals who report memory lapses,

          -  Sensitivity to light or noise, headaches

          -  Difficulty with concentration shortly after the explosive blast and have any of the
             same symptoms in the past month will be invited to participate in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants will be excluded from the study if they manifest

          -  Current substance induced psychotic disorder or psychotic disorder due to a general
             medical condition than TBI

          -  Current or past DSM IV defined substance dependence other than alcohol, caffeine, or
             nicotine

          -  Current DSM IV substance abuse other than alcohol, caffeine, or nicotine

          -  A neurologic condition or DSM Axis I mental disorder prior to deployment
             (predeployment data from a sample of soldiers from the 1/34 BCT yielded an estimated
             rate of 5% of either PTSD or depression)

          -  Current or predeployment unstable medical condition that would likely affect brain
             function (e.g., clear anoxic episode, cardiac arrest, current uncontrolled diabetes)

          -  Significant risk of suicidal or homicidal behavior

          -  Head injury from a source other than blast that resulted in loss of consciousness for
             more the 15 minutes, post-traumatic amnesia, skull fracture, or hospitalization. The
             screening interview will include questions to assess subjects with respect to the
             above exclusion criteria. During the telephone contact subjects will complete a
             screening for MRI protocols in order to exclude individuals who may have metal
             fragments in their bodies.
