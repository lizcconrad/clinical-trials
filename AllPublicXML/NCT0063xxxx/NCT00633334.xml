  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Therapies involving the immune system have already shown great promise in early clinical
      trials for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma and melanoma. One of the great challenges
      now facing this field is to extend these findings to other cancers. Little is currently
      understood about the nature of the immune response to more common gastrointestinal cancers.
      The first goal of this proposal is to collect blood and tissue samples from patients with
      early or late stage gastrointestinal cancers. These samples will be evaluated to better
      understand the immune response to these two cancers. The second goal of this proposal is to
      evaluate the specimens of these patients for changes and genetic markers that correlate with
      the presence of cancer. The information gathered from these studies will directly enhance our
      ability to design, conduct and monitor novel immunotherapeutic protocols for the treatment of
      patients with gastrointestinal cancer.

      The first goal of this proposal is to collect cells from the peripheral blood, tumor draining
      lymph nodes and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in patients with early or late stage
      gastrointestinal cancers. These samples will be evaluated in a variety of immunological
      assays to better understand the immune response to these two cancers. The second goal of this
      proposal is to evaluate using novel proteomic, cellomic, and genomic techniques the serum and
      peripheral blood lymphocytes of these patients for protein, cellular changes and genetic
      markers that correlate with the presence of cancer. The information gathered from these
      studies will directly enhance our ability to design, conduct and monitor novel
      immunotherapeutic protocols for the treatment of patients with gastrointestinal cancer.

    <description>Patients will be asked to provide approximately 60-120 cc (4-8 tablespoons) of peripheral blood. Select patients who undergo surgical resection of their tumor will be asked to provide portions of the tumor and tumor draining lymph nodes for further analysis. In addition patients undergoing surgical resection may be asked to provide additional peripheral blood samples at time of routine follow-up (at least 4-6 weeks after initial blood draw and between subsequent draws).</description>

        Potential research subjects are first identified by their primary doctor/clinical team. The
        research project will be discussed and mutually agreed upon between the subject and his/her
        caregiver before the research team will contact the subject. Other subjects are referred in
        specifically for possible participation in a particular study which they or their physician
        are aware of based on publications which list clinical trials at UPMCHS.
