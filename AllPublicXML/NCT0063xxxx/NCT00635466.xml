      The purpose of this study is to examine the technical and oncological feasibility of
      laparoscopic surgery for rectal carcinoma

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recently reported randomized controlled trials demonstrated that laparoscopic surgery was
      comparable or superior to open surgery regarding the long-term outcome for colon and
      rectosigmoidal carcinoma; however, controversy persists regarding the appropriateness of
      laparoscopic surgery for patients with rectal carcinoma because of the uncertainty of the
      long-term outcome, and of concerns over the safety of the procedure. In Japan, lateral lymph
      node dissection combined with total mesorectal excision remains the standard surgical
      procedure for patients with advanced lower rectal carcinoma, and lateral lymph node
      dissection by laparoscopy is still an unexplored frontier. To examine the technical and
      oncological feasibility of laparoscopic surgery for rectal carcinoma, a phase II trial will
      be conducted in patients with a preoperative diagnosis of stage 0/I rectal carcinoma, under
      the direction of the Japan Society of Laparoscopic Colorectal Surgery, to which leading
      hospitals in laparoscopic surgery for colorectal carcinoma in Japan are members.

    <description>Laparoscopic resection of the rectum with adequate lymphadenectomy is performed according to the General Rules for Clinical and Pathological Studies on Cancer of the Colon, Rectum and Anus edited by the Japanese Society for Cancer of the Colon and Rectum. The extent of lymphadenectomy and site of ligation and division of the inferior mesenteric vessels were decided by the surgeon in charge. Pneumoperitoneal approaches are used to explore the abdomen, mobilize the left side colon, identify critical structures and ligate the vascular pedicle. Mobilization of the rectum, excision of the mesorectum, rectal transection, removal of the specimen, and reconstruction are performed by the pneumoperitoneal approach or the extracorporeal approach via a small incision (&lt;8 cm).</description>
