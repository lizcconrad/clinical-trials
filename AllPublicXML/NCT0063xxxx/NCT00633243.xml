    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that integrating Hepatitis C into methadone and buprenorphine treatment will
      improve Hepatitis C outcomes as well as drug treatment outcomes in patients who are addicted
      to opiates. We will test this hypothesis by randomly assigning patients to receive integrated
      or separated care. The first group will receive Hepatitis C treatment and substance abuse
      treatment contemporaneously at the South Central Rehabilitation Center (SCRC). They will take
      both methadone or buprenorphine and Hepatitis C medications under the daily (methadone) or
      weekly (buprenorphine) observation of a health care provider. The second group will receive
      substance abuse treatment at SCRC, and go to another facility to receive Hepatitis C
      treatment services. These participants will take their medications on their own (without
      observation).

      We will look at outcomes such as Hepatitis C viral loads, adherence to medications, and drug
      treatment outcomes such as receipt of buprenorphine and methadone and urine toxicology
      testing.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Subjects were recruited over a 3-year period (2007â€“2010) from a substance abuse treatment clinic in New Haven, CT. Those with evidence of infection with HCV were subsequently seen by a medical provider to evaluate for HCV treatment, and if found to be appropriate, were referred to the research assistant.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Subjects were eligible for participation if they were prescribed methadone and were opioid negative in the past 30 days, age 18 years or older, underwent documented HIV testing, competent to provide informed consent, had stable mental health status, and met the following criteria for HCV treatment: detectable HCV RNA and genotype testing.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Modified Directly Observed Therapy (mDOT)</title>
          <description>Subjects received modified directly observed therapy (mDOT) as part of an adherence intervention. Clinical nurses administered all methadone doses and co-administered the morning RBV dose. The evening dose of RBV was prepackaged by a pharmacist accessible for the subject to self-administer 12 hours later. PEG was administered to mDOT subjects weekly by a licensed practitioners. All mDOT subjects who earned take-home bottles for methadone also received take-home doses of RBV.</description>

          <title>Self-Administered Therapy (SAT)</title>
          <description>Subjects received their methadone remote from their site of HCV treatment. HCV treatment was provided within the Yale Liver Center, the university-based liver specialty clinic. All subjects in this arm were taught how to self-administer therapy (SAT), the PEG and RBV. Subjects followed a pre-specified time period of attending the Liver Center for clinical follow-up and blood work.</description>
