    <description>Parent and teacher reports of child behavior and side effects observed during a 4-week trail of placebo and methylphenidate at lower, medium, and higher dosages will be summarized in a decision aid. Parent treatment preferences will be elicited and parents will receive coaching in deliberation about striking a balance between benefit and tolerable side effects. Parent will then choose the week that was best for their child and plan their next steps. Parents will also receive a consultation report that contains a physician dosage recommendation.</description>
