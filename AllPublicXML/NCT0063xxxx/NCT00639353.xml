    <textblock>
      This study seeks to evaluate the clinical performance of a recently released contact lens
      designed to correct astigmatism to an established contact lens that has historically been
      used in these patients.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject is 18 to 39 years of age. (Parental consent is required for a minor child
             i.e. under the age of 20.)

          2. The subject has signed an informed consent with his/her own judgement for
             participation in the study.

          3. The subject currently is a habitual wearer of spherical or toric daily-wear soft
             contact lenses, excluding daily disposables, in daily wear bases.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject has any ocular or systemic allergies that interfere with contact lens
             wear.

          2. The subject has dry eye and lacrimal apparatus disease that could interfere with
             contact lens wear.

          3. The subject has any systemic disease or autoimmune disease that interferes with
             contact lens wear.

          4. The subject has corneal edema, neovascularization, corneal staining or other ocular
             abnormalities (Grade 3 or above) that clinically apparently interfere with contact
             lens wear.

          5. The subject has any anterior segment eye disease (palpebral abnormalities, corneal
             hypesthesia, corneal epithelial defect, bulbar conjunctival hyperemia, etc.) that
             clinically apparently interferes with contact lens wear.

          6. The subject has a history of solution reactions to the chemical cleaner/disinfectant
             to be used in this study, as far as known to the subject.

          7. The subject has ocular infection.

          8. The subject has ocular inflammation (including acute/subacute anterior segment
             inflammations and uveitis).

          9. The subject has corneal distortion resulting from previous experience of hard contact
             lens wear.

         10. The subject has infectious disease (pneumonia, tuberculosis, etc.) or
             immunosuppressive disease (HIV positive etc.), as far as known to the subject.

         11. The subject has diabetes, as far as known to the subject.

         12. The subject is pregnant or in the lactation period, as far as known to the subject.

         13. The subject uses any eye remedies (excluding artificial tear substitutes or hyaluronic
             acid drops for reducing dryness while wearing contact lenses).

         14. The subject had any ocular trauma or surgery within 8 weeks prior to participation in
             the study.

         15. The subject is a wearer of hard contact lenses (including rigid gas permeable).

         16. The subject is exposed to a dry environment on a constant basis.

         17. The subject is exposed to a living environment where dust, chemicals, etc. can easily
             enter the eye.

         18. The subject is unable to follow the principal investigator's instructions.

         19. The subject is unable to follow lens hygiene procedures necessary for contact lens
             wear.
