  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this pilot study is to evaluate the effects of two variations of the ARCC
      Intervention Program on nursing processes and outcomes (job satisfaction, group cohesion, EBP
      knowledge, EBP implementation, EBP beliefs), patient/family outcomes (e.g. pt/family
      satisfaction with care), and institutional processes and outcomes (e.g. nurse-physician
      collaboration, cost, RN turnover, incidence frequency relevant to the topic). Secondary aims
      are to test the feasibility of study methods and reliability and validity of questionnaires.

      This study is designed as a three-group randomized clinical trial with repeated measures.
      Three inpatient units (medicine, surgery, surgical intensive care) will be randomly assigned
      to one of three interventions: ARCC enhanced (didactic content presentations, use of an EBP
      tool kit which will stay on the unit, environmental EBP prompts, availability of an EBP coach
      on the unit); ARCC standard (all of the above, but without the coach); non-EBP intervention
      (didactic content and environmental prompts, but not related to EBP; placebo). The
      interventions will be implemented over an estimated 14 weeks, including a 4-week training
      period, and an estimated 10 weeks to implement an EBP initiative that the nurses on the two
      ARCC intervention units will develop.

      Baseline information and questionnaires will be collected from nurses at the start of the
      study, and again at completion of the intervention phase. Outcome data will be collected from
      nurses approximately 10 weeks after implementation of the ARCC interventions are completed
      (i.e., 22 weeks after the study is commenced). Nurse-physician collaboration data will be
      collected from physicians working with study unit nurses as well as from the nurses. Patient
      satisfaction data will not be separately collected in this study, but will include use of
      unit-level Press-Ganey scores immediately prior to and over the study time period. Unit level
      and institutional RN turnover will be tracked monthly during the entire study period and will
      be compared across units at the same time as well as compared within each study over time
      (i.e., unit retention during those same months in the previous year). Costs of each EBP
      intervention will be tracked during the study and compared descriptively. Survey data will be
      analyzed using analysis of variance statistics. Questionnaires will be tested for reliability
      and construct validity. Because this is a pilot study, statistically significant differences
      are not expected, however, effect sizes will be calculated
