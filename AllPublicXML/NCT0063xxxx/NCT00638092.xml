  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to determine whether iodide supplementation of neonates born
      under 31 weeks gestation improves neurodevelopment measured at two years of age.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Iodine is essential for the synthesis of thyroxine, and thyroxine is essential for normal
      brain development in utero and for the first 2-3 years of life. The recommended iodine intake
      in parenteral nutrition regimens is 1 μg/kg/day and commercially available parenteral
      solutions for infants reflect these recommendations. In the absence of other iodine sources,
      infants are vulnerable to negative iodine balance and insufficiency. As many preterm infants
      are fed parenterally for prolonged periods with solutions which have been shown to be
      iodine-deficient, the I2S2 Trial was designed as a UK multicentre randomised controlled trial
      to establish whether iodine supplementation of preterm infants benefits neurodevelopment.
