  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smoking rates are significantly higher among lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT)
      populations compared to the general population. LGBT individuals may be at increased risk for
      experiencing psychosocial issues, e.g., negative moods, stress, alcohol/drug use, that have
      been associated with smoking treatment failure in other groups of smokers. Technology, such
      as the Internet and telephone, can be an effective method to reach a large number of smokers
      and may be particularly effective in reaching hidden populations. Thus, the study seeks to
      examine whether Internet-based counseling and/or telephone counseling can improve quit rates
      for LGBT smokers.

      Participants (N=600) will be randomly assigned to one of four conditions: 1) a Mail-based
      Self Help (MSH) treatment; 2) MSH plus an Internet-based Smoking Treatment (IST); MSH plus
      Telephone Counseling (TC) or 4) MSH plus IST plus TC. Participants in the MSH condition will
      receive a self-help smoking cessation manual. In the IST condition, participants will receive
      the manual plus access to an Internet-based intervention that includes social support. In the
      TC condition, participants will receive the manual plus 6 telephone-based counseling
      sessions. In the fourth condition, participants will receive the manual plus access to an
      Internet-based intervention plus telephone counseling. Before starting treatment,
      participants will complete questionnaires on smoking, nicotine dependence, demographics,
      negative mood, and alcohol use. Participants will be contacted at 3, 6, and 12 months after
      enrollment to determine whether they are smoking. The data will be analyzed to compare the
      efficacy of the four treatments and to examine the possible influence of existing social
      networks and level of negative mood on treatment outcome and to examine the possible
      influence of residency (rural versus urban) on use of the Internet-based treatment.
