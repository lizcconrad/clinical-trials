      This study investigates the hypothesis that instability in mood in patients with borderline
      personality disorder will respond the mood stabilizing medication lamotrigine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Affective instability is one of the most prominent symptoms in borderline personality
      disorder. Currently there are no prospective studies of treatment of this symptom with mood
      stabilizing medications. This study examines the effectiveness of lamotrigine compared to
      placebo in reducing emotional instability of several types in borderline patients. The types
      of emotional instability studied involve anger, anxiety, depression, and elation. Subjects
      entering this 12 week study will be blind to whether they are receiving active medication or
      placebo. They will be asked to report levels of instability in their mood on a weekly basis.
      They will also be asked weekly to rate the intensity of other symptoms of borderline
      personality disorder symptoms, such as unstable relationships, self-harm, and impulsive
      behaviors.
