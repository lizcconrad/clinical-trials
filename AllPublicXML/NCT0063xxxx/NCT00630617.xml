  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To develop and evaluate a culturally appropriate childhood obesity prevention program
      targeting primary care-givers of third grade students. The cognitive-behavioral lifestyle
      intervention consisted of eight, 90-minute sessions at the elementary schools.

      Primary outcome: body mass index of third graders and their primary care-givers Primary
      objective: To engage primary care-givers of third grand children in identifying and creating
      health promoting culturally appropriate environments for young children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The sessions include information about energy balance, portion control, appropriate amounts
      and types of physical activity, physical inactivity, nutrition and self-esteem. The influence
      of the primary care-giver on the children's physical activity and nutritional behaviors may
      lead to greater or lesser rates of obesity in childhood and eventually lead to adult obesity.
      Therefore, the intention of this intervention is to educate primary care-givers so as to
      effect change (in a positive way) in the children they care for. Assessment on steps taken,
      BMI, percent body fat, diet, self reported physical activity and diet will be used to
      evaluate the impact of the sessions.
