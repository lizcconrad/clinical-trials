  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common malignant tumor of the liver. Transcatheter
      arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the traditional method for the palliative management of
      patients with HCC. Few previous studies had demonstrated that the serum level of anticancer
      drug from patients treated by TACE was similar to those treated by systemic chemotherapy. The
      defense ability of the patient treated by TACE may thus be influenced by the leakage of
      anticancer drug to the systemic circulation. Since more than 80% patients with HCC also have
      liver cirrhosis, the toxicity for those anticancer drugs with hepatic transformation will be
      increased caused by the cirrhotic liver. The severity of pancytopenia in cirrhosis will be
      exacerbated by the effect of bone marrow suppression caused by anticancer drugs. Patients are
      at high risk for infection and hemorrhage. Therefore, it is of clinical importance to prevent
      or decrease the leakage of anticancer drugs to systemic circulation in patients treated by
      TACE. The procedures of TACE performed by previous studies were not constant and the
      distributions of tumor vessels were not evaluated in detail. The possible risk factors for
      the leakage of anticancer drug have not been investigated. This project will collect 60
      patients with HCC including 30 patients with hepatitis B and 30 patients with hepatitis C.
      The blood levels of anticancer drugs (epirubicin, mitomycin C and cisplatin) will be
      determined within one hour and at the third day after TACE.
