      Determine the antimicrobial properties of a proposed new product and an already approved
      product and a placebo (no drug). Study will be conducted using methods dictated by the FDA.

      This study uses topical sampling from the abdomen and the groin on intact skin and evaluates
      the germs left on the skin after treatment with the proposed new product, the currently
      approved product and the placebo.
