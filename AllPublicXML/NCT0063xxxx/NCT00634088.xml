    <measure>Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) of Ixabepilone When Administered With Lapatinib</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1 through 21</time_frame>
    <description>The MTD is defined as the maximum dose that can be administered to 6 participants such that no more than 1 (or fewer than one third if more than 6 participants receive treatment) experiences a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), with at least 2 experiencing a DLT at the next higher dose level. The RP2D is based on the MTD and the assessment of any relevant chronic toxicities.</description>

          <description>MTD is defined as the maximum dose that can be administered to 6 participants such that no more than 1 (or fewer than one third if more than 6 participants receive treatment) experiences a DLT, with at least 2 experiencing a DLT at the next higher dose level. The RP2D is based on the MTD and the assessment of any relevant chronic toxicities.</description>
