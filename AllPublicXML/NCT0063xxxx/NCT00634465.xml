      Assessment of segmental spine motion has been and continues to be, a difficult clinical
      problem. Errors of up to 10 degrees for simple measurements of flexion, extension and side
      bending have been recorded using conventional radiographs (xrays.) These errors are usually
      associated with the inability to acquire three-dimensional positions and inaccurate reference
      points. It has, therefore, been extremely difficult to measure small changes in vertebral
      alignment, which may prove to be an early, clinically significant, indicator of potential
      problems. Radiostereometric Analysis, or RSA, is an accurate in vivo measurement technique
      using two simultaneous radiographs. It provides researchers with three dimensional motion
      analyses to look not only at routine flexion/extension, but also other rotational and
      translational changes. The measurement accuracy offered by this technique far exceeds the
      manual techniques currently used. The purpose of this study is to assess the amount of motion
      in the lumbar spine in patients with the AST Stabilimax BAR. The AST Stabilimax BAR is
      designed to allow for motion in the spine while providing the necessary stability to the
      spinal segment. The amount and degree of this motion is currently unknown clinically. By
      using tantalum bead markers placed in the spine at the time of the surgery, RSA analysis can
      determine the amount and degree of motion of the implanted construct. Two questions will be
      examined with this data: 1) what is the amount of sagittal and coronal plane motion that
      occurs in vivo with the AST Stabilimax BAR system? and 2) will this change over the 2 year
      time frame for this study?

      Radiostereometric Analysis, or RSA, is an accurate in vivo measurement technique using two
      simultaneous radiographs. It provides researchers with three dimensional motion analyses to
      look not only at routine flexion/extension, but also other rotational and translational
      changes. The measurement accuracy offered by this technique far exceeds the manual techniques
      currently used. Utilization of the RSA technology at the IHP and the United States is in its
      infancy. The investigators have placed much effort over the past 2-3 years to put the
      necessary dedicated resources and personnel in place. This has been a collaborative effort
      between the Department of Orthopedic Surgery and the Imaging Core at IHP. Preliminary work on
      the accuracy, reliability, and surgical planning for use of RSA has been completed and
      presented at national conferences.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the amount of motion in the lumbar spine in patients
      with the AST Stabilimax BAR. The AST Stabilimax BAR is designed to allow for motion in the
      spine while providing the necessary stability to the spinal segment. The amount and degree of
      this motion is currently unknown clinically, but has been biomechanically tested in vitro. By
      using tantalum bead markers placed in the spine at the time of the surgery, RSA analysis can
      determine the amount and degree of motion the implant provides. Two questions will be
      examined with this data: 1) what is the amount of sagittal and coronal plane motion that
      occurs in vivo with the AST Stabilimax BAR system? and 2) will this change over the 2 year
      time frame for this study?

        This is a single-center, non-randomized study. 10 Subjects who are identified to receive
        the AST Stabilimax BAR device will be approached to participate in this study. All subjects
        will receive 10 RSA tantalum beads (5 in each vertebra) at the time of their lumbar
        surgery. After surgery, subjects will have the biplanar xrays taken. The biplanar xrays
        will be taken from 5 standing positions: neutral, flexion (bending forward), extension
        (bending backwards), left side bending, and right side bending. RSA analysis will be
        completed to determine the amount of motion on sagittal and coronal planes.
