  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      1. This is a prospective, multi-center, post market study, which will be conducted under a
           common protocol.

        2. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate long-term efficacy of the AMS Pelvic
           Floor Repair System devices for prolapse repair.

        3. The study population is female subjects &gt; 21 years of age who require surgical
           reconstruction of their pelvic floor due to prolapse.

        4. The clinical data will be analyzed by comparing post-treatment data with the baseline
           data, with the subject acting as her own control. The follow-up is for two years after
           the procedure.

        5. Prolapse improvement measured by ICS POP-Q Stage at 12-months will be the primary
           endpoint of the study. The secondary endpoints include quality of life changes from
           baseline and adverse event rates.

    <time_frame>12-months</time_frame>
    <description>Analysis includes only subjects with posterior vaginal wall prolapse &gt;= stage II at baseline. The POP-Q primary endpoint analysis employed the last observed failure carried forward method. Subjects with a follow-up POP-Q stage ≥ stage II were counted as failures, whereas subjects with a follow-up POP-Q stage &lt; stage I were counted as successes. Subjects who missed the POP-Q at the visit of interest and had the previous visited noted as a failure were counted as failures. Subjects who missed the POP-Q at the visit of interest and had the previous visited noted as a success were counted as missing. Exact 95% confidence intervals were calculated via binomial distribution and were limited to subjects having a POPQ ≥ stage II at baseline.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        -Have been diagnosed with one or more clinically significant anterior, apical or posterior

        repair

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The Investigator determines the subject is not a candidate for surgical repair of her
             genital prolapse.

          -  Subject has had a prior prolapse implant/procedure (i.e., IVS tunneler, Perigee,
             Apogee, graft augmented repair, etc) Note: previous traditional repairs are allowed.

          -  Subject has active or latent systemic infection or signs of tissue necrosis.

          -  Subject has restricted leg motion (inability to abduct or adduct leg positioning in
             the lithotomy position) with or without a hip replacement/prosthesis.

          -  Subject is currently pregnant or intends to become pregnant during the study period.
             Note: the risks and benefits of performing the procedure if the subject is planning
             future pregnancies should be carefully considered.

          -  Subject has had radiation therapy to the pelvic area.

          -  Subject has pelvic cancer, has had pelvic cancer within the past 12 months or has been
             on cytostatic medication within the past 12 months.

          -  Subject has a known hypersensitivity to the graft material(s).

          -  Subject has uncontrolled diabetes.

          -  Subject is on any medication which could result in compromised immune response, such
             as immune modulators.

          -  Subject was involved in any other research trial &lt; 30 days of enrollment into this
             study.

          -  Subject has undergone previous pelvic surgery &lt; 6 months prior to enrollment in this
             study.

          -  Subject is unwilling or unable to give valid informed consent.

          -  Subject is unwilling or unable to comply with the requirements of the protocol,
             complete all Quality of Life questionnaires and return for all follow-up visits.

          -  Subject is contraindicated based on intended use and warnings in the AMS PFR System
             devices for prolapse repair Instructions for Use (IFU).

Subjects who missed the POP-Q at the visit of interest and had the previous visited noted as a failure were counted as failures.

        <title>Percent of Subjects With an ICS POP-Q Stage of &lt;/= Stage I at 24 Months</title>
        <description>The POP-Q primary endpoint analysis employed the last observed failure carried forward method. Subjects with a follow-up POP-Q stage ≥ stage II were counted as failures, whereas subjects with a follow-up POP-Q stage &lt; stage I were counted as successes. Subjects who missed the POP-Q at the visit of interest and had the previous visited noted as a failure were counted as failures. Subjects who missed the POP-Q at the visit of interest and had the previous visited noted as a success were counted as missing. Exact 95% confidence intervals were calculated via binomial distribution and were limited to subjects having a POPQ ≥ stage II at baseline.
Note:
Phase VI ended after 12M follow up visit because the next generation of the study device was already under clinical evaluation in Phase VII
Phase II ended early before all subjects reached their 24M visit because the study device is no longer marketed due to release of models with enhancements to the design</description>
        <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
        <population>POP-Q analysis employed last failure carried forward method, which carries subject’s objective failure at previous visits if the results are missing in the visit of interest. It’s also considers re-operation for recurrent in study compartment as failure. 95% CI calculated via binominal distribution including only subjects w/POP-Q≥II at baseline.</population>

Phase II ended early before all subjects reached their 24M visit because the study device is no longer marketed due to release of models with enhancements to the design</description>

Subjects with a follow-up POP-Q stage ≥ stage II were counted as failures, whereas subjects with a follow-up POP-Q stage &lt; stage I were counted as successes. Subjects who missed the POP-Q at the visit of interest and had the previous visited noted as a failure were counted as failures. Subjects who missed the POP-Q at the visit of interest and had the previous visited noted as a success were counted as missing.

Subjects with a follow-up POP-Q stage ≥ stage II were counted as failures, whereas subjects with a follow-up POP-Q stage &lt; stage I were counted as successes. Subjects who missed the POP-Q at the visit of interest and had the previous visited noted as a failure were counted as failures.

        <description>Analysis includes only subjects with anterior vaginal wall prolapse &gt;= stage II at baseline. The POP-Q primary endpoint analysis employed the last observed failure carried forward method (LFCF). Subjects with a follow-up POP-Q stage ≥ stage II were counted as failures, whereas subjects with a follow-up POP-Q stage &lt; stage I were counted as successes. Subjects who missed the POP-Q at the visit of interest and had the previous visited noted as a failure were counted as failures. Subjects who missed the POP-Q at the visit of interest and had the previous visited noted as a success were counted as missing. Exact 95% confidence intervals were calculated via binomial distribution and were limited to subjects having a POPQ ≥ stage II at baseline.</description>
