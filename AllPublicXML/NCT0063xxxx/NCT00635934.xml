    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to collect safety and effectiveness data concerning the
      A-MAV™ Anterior Motion Segment Replacement device as a method of treating patients with
      lumbar degenerative disc disease at one level from L4-S1. Overall success will be the primary
      clinical endpoint.

    <textblock>
      For this clinical trial, there is only one treatment group- patients receiving the A-MAV™
      Anterior Motion Segment Replacement via an anterior surgical approach in the lumbar region of
      the spine from L4-S1.
