  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The efficacy of LtSTA as a skin test antigen depends upon the sensitivity and specificity of
      the product. This study has been designed to measure the skin test responses to 15, 30, or
      50µg doses of LtSTA. The measurements of non-specific reactivity due to components of the
      antigen solution and the product's ability to sensitize lymphocytes of Leishmania naïve
      persons when administered intradermally. The presence or absence of a local inflammatory
      response to the first skin test with each of three doses of LtSTA will provide insight on the
      specificity of the antigen in a naïve population. The local inflammatory response to LtSTA
      following the first and second repeat skin tests will indicate if the antigen is sensitizing
      after intradermal administration.

    <time_frame>62 days</time_frame>
    <description>Skin test response of subjects in the trial were evaluated 48 hours post injection after each of three skin test given at 30 day intervals in naive individuals (no exposure to the Leishmania organism). (Actual times 0, 30 and 60 days).The outcome measure was designated as number of participants who became sensitized to the Leishmania antigen. This is defined as those participants that had a negative skin test result, followed by a positive response in a subsequent skin test without having been exposed to the Leishmania organism.</description>

        <description>Skin test response of subjects in the trial were evaluated 48 hours post injection after each of three skin test given at 30 day intervals in naive individuals (no exposure to the Leishmania organism). (Actual times 0, 30 and 60 days).The outcome measure was designated as number of participants who became sensitized to the Leishmania antigen. This is defined as those participants that had a negative skin test result, followed by a positive response in a subsequent skin test without having been exposed to the Leishmania organism.</description>
