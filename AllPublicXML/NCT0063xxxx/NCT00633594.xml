  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study of rituximab, bortezomib,
      and lenalidomide in the first-line or second-line treatment of patients with Mantle Cell
      Lymphoma (MCL).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The combination of lenalidomide with bortezomib has not been studied in patients with MCL,
      but feasibility and tolerability has been demonstrated in patients with multiple myeloma.
      Thus, almost every 2-drug combination of rituximab, lenalidomide, and bortezomib has been
      tested, or is being tested. We hypothesize that all three drugs are important in MCL, and
      therefore propose to combine all 3 agents (rituximab, bortezomib, and lenalidomide) in a
      schedule that is convenient to lymphoma patients.

      Approximately 18 patients may be enrolled in the Phase I portion of the study. Approximately
      45 patients are planned for enrollment in Phase II.

        <description>Response to treatment (Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR)) determined using Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson et al. 2007.) CR: complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease and disease-related symptoms; PR: 50% or greater decrease in sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of up to 6 of the largest dominant nodes or extranodal masses, no increase in the size of other nodes, liver or spleen, no new sites of disease, patients who achieve CR but have persistent morphologic bone marrow involvement; Stable Disease (SD): failing to attain PR or CR, but not fulfilling criteria for progressive disease; Progressive Disease (PD)/Relapse: appearance of new lesions more than 1.5 cm in any axis, 50% or greater increase from nadir SPD of any previously involved sites, 50% or greater increase in the longest diameter of any single previously identified node or extranodal mass more than 1 cm in short axis.</description>
