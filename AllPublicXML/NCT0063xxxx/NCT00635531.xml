  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and
      pharmacokinetics of alprazolam extended release (XR) for the treatment of adolescents with
      panic disorder
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to recruitment difficulties in this adolescent population, the clinical program for
      alprazolam XR was cancelled and this study was terminated on 1 September 2004. There were no
      safety concerns that led to this decision.
