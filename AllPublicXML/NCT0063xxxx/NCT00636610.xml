  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of vismodegib (GDC-0449) added
      to biochemotherapy standard-of-care regimens for metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC), with
      treatment until disease progression. Patients received either FOLFOX (FOL=leucovorin calcium
      [folinic acid], F=fluorouracil, OX=oxaliplatin) or FOLFIRI (FOL=leucovorin calcium [folinic
      acid] F=fluorouracil, IRI=irinotecan hydrochloride) chemotherapy with bevacizumab. The
      decision of which regimen (FOLFOX or FOLFIRI) to use was made by the treating physician and
      patient. Patients were randomized to receive vismodegib or placebo and were stratified based
      on the chemotherapy regimen chosen and whether or not Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumors (RECIST) measurable disease was present at baseline.

    <time_frame>From first treatment through the data cut-off date of March 15, 2010, up to 90 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from randomization to the earlier of documented disease progression (PD) or death from any cause. PD: At least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since treatment started, unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions, or the appearance of one or more new lesions. For patients without measurable disease, PD was defined as an increase in the size of a lesion to one that is measurable or unequivocal progression of a non-target lesion.</description>

    <measure>Progression-free Survival (PFS) in Patients With Various Degrees of Hedgehog Antigen Tumor Expression</measure>
    <time_frame>From first treatment through the data cut-off date of March 15, 2010, up to 90 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Indian + Sonic Hedgehog antigen expression was measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) from archival tumor tissue taken from each patient prior to enrollment in the study. Results are reported in 3 categories; the 33% of patients with the lowest level of expression, the 35% of patients with a middle level of expression, and the 32% of patients with the highest level of expression. PFS was defined as the time between randomization and disease progression, as confirmed by radiography, or death for any reason.</description>

        <title>Progression-free Survival (PFS)</title>
        <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from randomization to the earlier of documented disease progression (PD) or death from any cause. PD: At least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since treatment started, unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions, or the appearance of one or more new lesions. For patients without measurable disease, PD was defined as an increase in the size of a lesion to one that is measurable or unequivocal progression of a non-target lesion.</description>

        <description>Indian + Sonic Hedgehog antigen expression was measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) from archival tumor tissue taken from each patient prior to enrollment in the study. Results are reported in 3 categories; the 33% of patients with the lowest level of expression, the 35% of patients with a middle level of expression, and the 32% of patients with the highest level of expression. PFS was defined as the time between randomization and disease progression, as confirmed by radiography, or death for any reason.</description>
