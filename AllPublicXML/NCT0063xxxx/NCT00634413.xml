      The purpose of this study is to assess the tolerability and efficacy of inhaled theophylline
      (ADC4022) on markers of pulmonary inflammation (white blood cells) in induced sputum and in
      bronchial biopsy samples in subjects with moderate to severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary
      Disease (COPD) when co-administered with budesonide and compared to placebo.
