  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Combination therapy with pegylated interferon-alpha plus ribavirin has greatly improved the
      treatment efficacy and is the mainstream of treatment for chronic hepatitis C infection. The
      efficacy and safety of pegylated interferon-alpha plus ribavirin combination therapy and its
      impact on the outcome in chronic hepatitis C patients concomitant with malignancy other than
      hepatocellular carcinoma deserve to be elucidated.

      The purposes of this study are:

        1. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of pegylated interferon-alpha 2a plus ribavirin
           combination therapy in chronic hepatitis C patients concomitant with malignancy other
           than hepatocellular carcinoma, compare to those without systemic malignancy.

        2. To investigate the role of baseline and on-treatment factors on the response to
           pegylated interferon-alpha 2a plus ribavirin combination therapy in chronic hepatitis C
           patients concomitant with malignancy other than hepatocellular carcinoma.

      A prospective, hospital-based study enrolling 40 chronic hepatitis C patients concomitant
      with malignancy other than hepatocellular carcinoma and other sex- and age-matched 80 chronic
      hepatitis C patients without malignancy will be conducted. The 40 chronic hepatitis C
      patients concomitant with malignancy other than hepatocellular carcinoma will receive
      pegylated interferon-alpha 2a plus ribavirin combination therapy at remission phase after
      oncological treatments and/or interventions. The other 80 chronic hepatitis C patients
      without malignancy receiving the same antiviral therapy will serve as controls. The primary
      outcome measurement is sustained virological response and safety, whilst the secondary
      measurement is rapid virological and early virological response.
