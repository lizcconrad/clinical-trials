    <time_frame>BL, 4 weeks (end of double-blind treatment period)</time_frame>
    <description>Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an incretin hormone that acts as a potent insulin secretegogue in response to nutrient ingestion and stimulates glucose disposition. The total AUC of Total GLP-1 levels was calculated from blood sample data measured after the morning meal.</description>

    <measure>Change From BL to Week 4 in the 2-Hour Active GLP-1 Total AUC</measure>
    <time_frame>BL, 4 weeks (end of double-blind treatment period)</time_frame>
    <description>GLP-1 is cleaved from proglucagon to form the active peptide GLP-1. The active form promotes suppression of glucagon secretion. The total AUC of Active GLP-1 levels was calculated from blood sample data measured after the morning meal.</description>

          <description>Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an incretin hormone that acts as a potent insulin secretegogue in response to nutrient ingestion and stimulates glucose disposition. The total AUC of Total GLP-1 levels was calculated from blood sample data measured after the morning meal.</description>
