  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients treated for methamphetamine dependence have high rates of relapse, and no
      pharmacotherapy has yet been demonstrated to be efficacious. Modafinil (d,
      l-2-[(diphenylmethyl)sulfinyl]acetamide) is a novel wake- and vigilance-promoting agent that
      is chemically and pharmacologically dissimilar to CNS stimulants. It is well tolerated and
      has low abuse liability compared to CNS stimulants. Modafinil is FDA approved for a variety
      of sleep disorders, may relieve methamphetamine withdrawal symptoms, improves cognitive
      function, has been shown to reduce cocaine use in dependent users, and is safe when
      coadministered with intravenous methamphetamine. We will conduct a randomized dose ranging
      clinical trial of modafinil to establish its safety and efficacy as a pharmacotherapy for
      methamphetamine dependence.
