  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Inspiratory Capacity (IC) at Peak Time and at Isotime on Day 14</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>Inspiratory capacity (IC) at peak time and at isotime were the primary pharmacodynamic (PD) variables of interest. IC was measured at two minute intervals during exercise. Isotime was defined as the time the subject was still exercising in the shortest of all sub-maximal exercise tests (3-minutes resting pedaling, 3-minutes unloaded pedaling and exercise with loaded pedaling). Peak time was defined as the last measurement taken in the exercise period. The primary analysis consisted of a linear mixed effects model with baseline IC measurement as covariate.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Static Inspiratory Capacity (IC) at Day 14</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>Inspiratory Capacity (IC) at resting (static IC) was measured by using whole body plethysmography. The day 14 measurement was analyzed using an analysis of variance including baseline (day -2) as a covariate,</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Trough Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) Measured by Spirometry on Day 14</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 was measured with spirometry conducted according to internationally accepted standards. Trough FEV1 was defined as the average of measurements made 23 hours 10 minutes and 23 hours 45 minutes post-dose. The linear mixed model included the baseline FEV1 measurement as covariate.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Chronic Activity Related Breathlessness Measured by Transition Dyspnoea Index (TDI) at Day 14</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>Dyspnoea was measured during the treatment period using the transition dyspnoea index (TDI), which captures changes from baseline. The TDI has three domains; functional impairment, magnitude of task and magnitude of effort. TDI domains are rated from -3 (major deterioration) to 3 (major improvement) and rates are summed for transition focal score ranging from -9 to 9; minus scores indicate deterioration. A TDI focal score of 1 was considered to be a clinically significant and meaningful improvement from baseline. Analysis of variance included period baseline dyspnoea index (BDI) as covariate.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dyspnoea Measured by Borg CR10 Scale at Day 1, Day 14</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>The modified Borg CR10 Scale consists of 12-point score that the patients point to so as to indicate their level of dyspnoea (where 0 indicates no breathlessness at all to 12 indicates maximum breathlessness), before and during exercise testing. A reduction in this score indicates an improvement. Isotime was defined as the time the subject was still exercising in the shortest of all sub-maximal exercise tests. Peak time was defined as the last measurement taken in the exercise period. Analysis of variance included period, treatment and sequence as fixed effects and subject as random effect.</description>

        <title>Inspiratory Capacity (IC) at Peak Time and at Isotime on Day 14</title>
        <description>Inspiratory capacity (IC) at peak time and at isotime were the primary pharmacodynamic (PD) variables of interest. IC was measured at two minute intervals during exercise. Isotime was defined as the time the subject was still exercising in the shortest of all sub-maximal exercise tests (3-minutes resting pedaling, 3-minutes unloaded pedaling and exercise with loaded pedaling). Peak time was defined as the last measurement taken in the exercise period. The primary analysis consisted of a linear mixed effects model with baseline IC measurement as covariate.</description>

        <title>Chronic Activity Related Breathlessness Measured by Transition Dyspnoea Index (TDI) at Day 14</title>
        <description>Dyspnoea was measured during the treatment period using the transition dyspnoea index (TDI), which captures changes from baseline. The TDI has three domains; functional impairment, magnitude of task and magnitude of effort. TDI domains are rated from -3 (major deterioration) to 3 (major improvement) and rates are summed for transition focal score ranging from -9 to 9; minus scores indicate deterioration. A TDI focal score of 1 was considered to be a clinically significant and meaningful improvement from baseline. Analysis of variance included period baseline dyspnoea index (BDI) as covariate.</description>

        <title>Dyspnoea Measured by Borg CR10 Scale at Day 1, Day 14</title>
        <description>The modified Borg CR10 Scale consists of 12-point score that the patients point to so as to indicate their level of dyspnoea (where 0 indicates no breathlessness at all to 12 indicates maximum breathlessness), before and during exercise testing. A reduction in this score indicates an improvement. Isotime was defined as the time the subject was still exercising in the shortest of all sub-maximal exercise tests. Peak time was defined as the last measurement taken in the exercise period. Analysis of variance included period, treatment and sequence as fixed effects and subject as random effect.</description>
