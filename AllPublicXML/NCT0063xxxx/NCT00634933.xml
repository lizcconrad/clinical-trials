    <description>EQ-5D: participant rated questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life in terms of a single utility score. Health State Profile component assesses level of current health for 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression; 1 indicates better health state (no problems); 3 indicates worst health state (eg, &quot;confined to bed&quot;). Scoring formula developed by EuroQol Group assigns utility value for each domain in the profile. Score is transformed and results in total score range -0.594 to 1.000; higher score indicates a better health state.</description>

    <measure>Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Fatigue (FACIT-F) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12, 24, 36, 52</time_frame>
    <description>FACIT-F is a 13-item questionnaire. Participants scored each item on a 5-point scale: 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Larger the participant's response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated), greater was the participant's fatigue. For all questions, except for the 2 negatively stated ones, the code was reversed and a new score was calculated as (4 minus the participant's response). The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-Fatigue score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score).</description>

    <description>WPAI-RA consisted of 6 items, a binary question on current employment, 3 questions on hours of work and work-loss, and 2 questions based on 0-10 point scale to judge how RA affects productivity at work and outside of work (0 = no effect on work and 10 = completely prevented from working). Four scores are derived: percent work time missed due to health, percent impairment while working due to health, percent overall work impairment due to health and percent activity impairment due to health. Total possible score range: 0 to 100, where 0 = no impairment and 100 = completely impaired.</description>

    <description>The DAS28-based EULAR response criteria were used to measure individual response as none, good, and moderate, depending on the extent of change from baseline and the level of disease activity reached. Good responders: change from baseline &gt;1.2 with DAS28 =&lt; 3.2; moderate responders: change from baseline &gt;1.2 with DAS28 &gt;3.2 to =&lt;5.1 or change from baseline &gt;0.6 to =&lt;1.2 with DAS28 =&lt;5.1; non-responders: change from baseline =&lt; 0.6 or change from baseline &gt;0.6 and =&lt;1.2 with DAS28 &gt;5.1.</description>

Health State Profile component assesses level of current health for 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression; 1 indicates better health state (no problems); 3 indicates worst health state (eg, &quot;confined to bed&quot;). Scoring formula developed by EuroQol Group assigns utility value for each domain in the profile.

        <description>FACIT-F is a 13-item questionnaire. Participants scored each item on a 5-point scale: 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Larger the participant’s response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated), greater was the participant’s fatigue. For all questions, except for the 2 negatively stated ones, the code was reversed and a new score was calculated as (4 minus the participant’s response). The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-Fatigue score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score).</description>
