  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PF-04603629 is being investigated for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
      Specifically, PF-04603629 is a protein that is a combination of exendin-4 (a glucagon-like
      peptide-1 (GLP-1) mimetic currently marketed as Byetta®) fused to human transferrin (a
      naturally occuring protein) in order to increase the concentration of exendin-4 in the blood.
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and
      pharmacodynamics of PF-04603629 following multiple escalating subcutaneous doses in adult
      subjects with T2DM.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      B0571002 was terminated August 19 2008 due to the decision to discontinue development of
      PF-04603629 after observing (in both B0571001 and B0571002) a trend for a reversible increase
      in heart rate within the normal range, which occurred at efficacious doses. Thus, the
      compound was primarily terminated due to safety concerns, although there was no immediate
      safety risk to any subject in the study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who are not taking any treatment or are taking
             metformin (with no change in the treatment, including dose, over the past 2 months).
             Subjects previously treated with a sulfonylurea in combination with metformin may be
             eligible if switched over to metformin only for a minimum of 4 weeks before dosing.

          -  Male and/or female subjects (females will be women of non-childbearing potential)
             between the ages of 18 and 70 years, inclusive.

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) of approximately 22 to 40 kg/m2

          -  Fasting C-peptide test result must be &gt;0.4 nmol/L.

          -  HbA1c ≥7% and ≤11%. If the subject requires to be washed off a sulfonylurea, the HbA1c
             limits will be ≥7% and ≤9.5%.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Screening fasting blood glucose, ≤60 or ≥270 mg/dL. One repeat screening fasting blood
             glucose will be allowed.

          -  Previous treatment with an approved or investigational GLP-1 mimetic.

          -  Have a known allergy to yeast, yeast-derived or yeast containing products.
