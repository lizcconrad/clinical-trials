  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study looking at advanced imaging such as PET/CT and MRI to see if they can provide
      a more accurate assessment of the patient with dense breasts or difficult to interpret
      mammograms. In addition, the ability to determine whether one or the other is more accurate
      or whether both together would be appropriate in this clinical situation, may be able to be
      measured.

      The MRI studies are very sensitive for detection of breast histopathology but less specific
      in differentiating between small low grade malignancies are more benign pathologies.
      Multifocal pathology can be challenging in determining site(s) for biopsy.

      PET scanning is specific in the measurement of metabolic glucose activity of various
      histopathologies and is accurate in differentiating aggressive from benign pathology in
      multifocal breast disease. A further drawback of PET is the lack of ability to observe
      lesions less than 3-4mm in diameter.

      In select cases the combination of MR and PET/CT is able to come to a more conclusive
      diagnosis - specifically with bilateral or multifocal breast disease.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Woman who have breast volumes allowing utilization of MRI breast coil

          -  Patients who are considered, by radiologist reading the mammograms, to have non

             have palpable breast lumps and may and may not have suspicious areas on their x-ray
             mammograms.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women of child bearing potential not practicing a medically accepted method of birth
             control
