      The specific aim of this proposed project is to implement a standard process for integrating
      MedlinePlus health information prescriptions into the clinic workflow.

      Hypothesis 1: Individuals in the intervention group who receive tailored email health
      information with provider selected MedlinePlus links and added commentary for patient
      specific conditions will be more likely to seek information / use MedlinePlus compared with
      individuals in the control group.

      Hypothesis 2: Individuals in the intervention group who receive tailored email health
      information with provider selected MedlinePlus links and added commentary for patient
      specific conditions will be more satisfied with the information received compared with
      individuals in the control group.

      Providing patient education in an outpatient practice can be challenging in part due to the
      variety of patient medical conditions and the quantity of materials needed. Increasingly,
      electronic resources such as those found on the internet have the potential to provide easily
      accessible needed information. However, clinicians do not have the time to assemble a list of
      websites for their patients and even if they did, the quality of information varies greatly
      and would require close screening. MedlinePlus is a free National Library of Medicine
      sponsored website that features health information on hundreds of conditions with all
      information carefully screened for quality standards by expert librarians. We will conduct a
      pilot study to seamlessly integrate provider-customized MedlinePlus health education
      prescriptions for specific conditions into the normal clinic workflow to motivate patients to
      access and expand their use of MedlinePlus to benefit their health. As HIV
      prevention/education is very important, we will include the HIV clinic as well as a general
      internal medicine clinic.

    <description>The patient education materials will consist of approximately 21 topics representing some of the most common conditions seen at the Fairview Internal Medicine Clinic. Twenty-one e-mails, one per topic, will be created by Fairview physicians to be distributed to selected clinic patients. There will be a standard e-mail for each condition with a specific link to MedlinePlus. To create the targeted health information topic email, the physician will review the information available at MedlinePlus. The physician will then select several links of appropriate information and, using the template, will write a short annotation on each link.</description>
