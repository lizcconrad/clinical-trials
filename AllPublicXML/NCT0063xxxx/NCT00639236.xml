  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of inhaled hypertonic saline has been extensively documented in asthma,
      bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis and COPD as method of bronchial challenge and sputum
      induction, but studies that evaluated others endpoints are required. The objective of this
      study was to analyse the effects of inhaling hypertonic saline compared with placebo with
      respect to functional exercise capacity, dyspnoea and quality of life. In a double-blind
      randomised parallel placebo-controlled trial, conducted at the Clínicas Integradas of the
      Evangelical Faculty of Paraná,sixty-eight patients (age 67 ± 6.5 years; FEV1 38.9 ± 16.2
      predicted) were randomised to inhale 3% hypertonic saline (n=34) or placebo (n=34), combined
      with a program of exercise, three times a week, for 8-weeks.

      Background: The use of inhaled hypertonic saline has been extensively documented in asthma,
      bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis and COPD as method of bronchial challenge and sputum
      induction, but studies that evaluated others endpoints are required. Objective: To analyse
      the effects of inhaling hypertonic saline compared with placebo with respect to functional
      exercise capacity, dyspnoea and quality of life. Design and Setting: This was a double-blind
      randomised parallel placebo-controlled trial, conducted at the Clínicas Integradas of the
      Evangelical Faculty of Paraná. Methods: sixty-eight patients (age 67 ± 6.5 years; FEV1 38.9 ±
      16.2 predicted) were randomised to inhale 3% hypertonic saline (n=34) or placebo (n=34),
      combined with a program of exercise, three times a week, for 8-weeks. Results: After the
      8-weeks the treatment period, both groups showed significant changes in functional exercise
      capacity (p&lt;0,001), dyspnoea (p&lt;0,001) and quality of life. When compared both groups, there
      was a significant improvement in placebo group in functional exercise capacity (p&lt;0,001).
      Conclusion: the present study concluded that inhaling HS reduces the functional capacity,
      compared to placebo and being associated with the appearance of coughs and bronchial spasms.
