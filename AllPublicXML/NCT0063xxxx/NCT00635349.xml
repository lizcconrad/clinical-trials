    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of tramadol hydrochloride 37.5
      milligram (mg) plus acetaminophen 325 mg maintenance with that of non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) maintenance in participants with knee osteoarthritis (a
      progressive and degenerative joint disease, in which the joints become painful and stiff)
      whose pain was relieved after the add-on treatment of tramadol hydrochloride to NSAIDs.

      This is a multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical
      research study), randomized (the study drug is assigned by chance), open-label (all people
      know the identity of the intervention), comparative study to compare the efficacy of tramadol
      hydrochloride plus acetaminophen maintenance with that of NSAIDs maintenance in participants
      whose pain was relieved after the add-on treatment of tramadol 37.5 milligram (mg) plus
      acetaminophen 325 mg to NSAIDs. All participants will receive tramadol hydrochloride 37.5 mg
      plus acetaminophen 325 mg, 1 to 3 tablets per day along with NSAIDs (meloxicam [7.5 mg or 15
      mg once daily] or aceclofenac [100 mg twice daily]) from Day 1 to Day 28, and participants
      will be randomly assigned into 2 treatment groups at Day 29 if the numerical rating scale
      score less than or equal 4. Tramadol plus acetaminophen group will receive 1 or 2 tablets
      containing tramadol 37.5 mg plus acetaminophen 325 mg 4 times daily (maximum daily dose will
      be 8 tablets) from Day 29 to Day 85 and NSAIDs group will receive either meloxicam 7.5 mg or
      15 mg per day or aceclofenac 100 mg twice a day from Day 29 to Day 85. The efficacy will be
      evaluated on Day 1, Day 29, Day 57 and Day 85. The primary efficacy end point will be
      assessed through change in Western Ontario McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC)
      total score from Day 29 to Day 85. Participant's safety will be monitored throughout the
      study.

    <time_frame>Day 29 and Day 85</time_frame>
    <description>The WOMAC is a self-administered and health status questionnaire designed to capture elements of pain, stiffness and physical impairment in participants with osteoarthritis. It consists of 24 questions (5 questions about pain, 2 about stiffness and 17 about physical function) scored on a visual analog scale (VAS) of 0 to 10 cm (0 cm=no pain to 10 cm=worse pain). Individual question responses are assigned a score between 0=extreme and 4=none. Maximum scores for each element differ and therefore, scores were normalized. Total normalized score ranges from 0=worst to 100=best.</description>

    <measure>Change From Day 29 in Pain Intensity Score at Day 85</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 29 and Day 85</time_frame>
    <description>Pain intensity was evaluated by 11- point numeric rating scale ranging from 0 to 10 where, 0=no pain and 10=pain as bad as you can imagine.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Pain Relief</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 29, Day 57 and Day 85</time_frame>
    <description>Pain relief was assessed by using a 6-point scale ranging from -1 to 4 where, -1=pain aggravated, 0=no change, 1=slightly relieved, 2=moderately relieved, 3=considerably relieved, and 4=pain completely disappeared. Participants with pain slightly relieved, moderately relieved and completely disappeared were considered as pain relieved.</description>

        <title>Change From Day 29 in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) Total Score at Day 85</title>
        <description>The WOMAC is a self-administered and health status questionnaire designed to capture elements of pain, stiffness and physical impairment in participants with osteoarthritis. It consists of 24 questions (5 questions about pain, 2 about stiffness and 17 about physical function) scored on a visual analog scale (VAS) of 0 to 10 cm (0 cm=no pain to 10 cm=worse pain). Individual question responses are assigned a score between 0=extreme and 4=none. Maximum scores for each element differ and therefore, scores were normalized. Total normalized score ranges from 0=worst to 100=best.</description>

        <population>Full analysis set (FAS) population included all randomly assigned participants excluding those who violated the major eligibility criteria or had no data at all after randomization. Last observation carried forward (LOCF) method was applied.</population>
