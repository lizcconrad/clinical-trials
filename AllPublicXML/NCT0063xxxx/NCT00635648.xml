    <description>A serious adverse event is one that results in death, disability/incapacity, or hospitalization or is life threatening, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, cancer, an overdose, or otherwise jeopardizes the patient and may require medical intervention.
A drug-related adverse event is a determination by the investigator physician that the study drug caused the event based on exposure, time course, likely cause, dechallenge (event resolved/improved when drug was discontinued), rechallenge (event resolved/improved when drug was re-introduced), and consistency with the drug profile.</description>

Efficacy response for invasive candidiasis was based on microbiological and clinical assessments; favorable responses required both favorable microbiological response (i.e., eradication or presumptive eradication based on symptoms, physical exam, and non-invasive tests) and complete or partial clinical response.</description>
