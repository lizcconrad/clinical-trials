    <textblock>
      Study TKT024EXT was a long-term, single-arm, open-label extension of Study TKT024, a one year
      Phase 2/Phase 3 registration study. The primary objective of this extension study was to
      collect long-term safety and clinical outcome data in Mucopolysaccharidosis II (MPS II), also
      known as Hunter Syndrome, from the Phase 2/Phase 3 Study TKT024. All patients enrolling into
      this study received weekly active treatment with idursulfase, the primary dosing regimen
      investigated in Study TKT024.

      Hunter Syndrome is an X-linked recessive lysosomal storage disease caused by a deficiency of
      iduronate-2-sulfatase, an enzyme required to catabolize glycosaminoglycans (GAGS) in cells.
      As a result, GAGs accumulate in the lysosomes leading to cellular engorgement, organomegaly,
      tissue destruction, and organ system dysfunction. Hunter Syndrome is a rare disease with an
      estimated incidence of 1 in 162,000 live births.

      Study TKT024EXT was conducted in 2 phases. The first phase (&quot;Phase I&quot;) was 2 years (104
      weeks) in duration and consisted of weekly infusions of IV idursulfase (0.5 mg/kg), and the
      collection of patients' safety and clinical outcomes. Week 105 defined the beginning of the
      second phase of the study. The second phase (&quot;Phase II&quot;) consisted of weekly infusions of IV
      idursulfase (0.5 mg/kg) and the monitoring of patients for safety (via collection of adverse
      events, concomitant medications, and vital signs). Study completion was defined as the time a
      patient either transitioned to commercially available idursulfase or discontinued this study.

      Idursulfase was administered to patients as a continuous IV infusion at a dose of 0.5 mg of
      protein per kg of body weight (0.5 mg/kg). Final evaluations from Study TKT024, the one-year
      predecessor Phase 2/Phase 3 registration study, served as the baseline assessments for the
      TKT024EXT study. Forced vital capacity (FVC) and the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) continued to
      be the primary clinical outcomes of TKT024EXT study. Efficacy outcomes were evaluated over
      the course of 2 years and were determined at 4-month intervals during the first year (ie,
      Weeks 18, 36, and 53) and at 6-month intervals in the second year (ie, Weeks 79 and 105).
      Safety outcomes were assessed throughout the duration of the study. The safety and clinical
      testing performed in the TKT024EXT study were identical to those performed in the
      double-blind phase of Study TKT024.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This study allows participants in double-blind phase of Study TKT024 (NCT00069641), a 1 year Phase 2/3 registration study, to continue long-term idursulfase therapy and to allow placebo participants in TKT024 to receive active idursulfase treatment. The first participant enrolled on 13 Sep 2004. The study was conducted at 52 sites in 17 countries.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants were screened for entry based on their known medical histories and previous participation in the TKT024 study. Participants had to have completed Week 53 final evaluations in the TKT024 study. Participants were not to have received any treatment with an investigational therapy other than idursulfase within 60 days of study entry.</pre_assignment_details>

    <certain_agreements>
      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>Shire’s agreements with investigators vary. All agreements provide Shire the right to embargo communications regarding trial results prior to public release for a period ≤ 180 days from the time submitted to Shire for review. Shire does not prohibit publication but can require the removal of confidential information (excluding trial results) and can request postponement of a single-center publication until after disclosure of the trial’s multi-center publication.</restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>This study design was open-label, and the lack of a concurrently followed placebo group limits the strength of the observations, because the progression of the disease is variable and has not been well described.</limitations_and_caveats>
