      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology that
      basically compromises the joints in a generalized, symmetrical, additive and usually
      progressive manner. This clinical condition includes pain and altered functionality.
      Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) has been studied since the 1970s with regard to its
      therapeutic effects. The literature suggests that it offers analgesic as well as
      anti-inflammatory benefits.

      A number of studies carried out in the laboratory and on animals have shown that LLLT
      contributes toward the treatment of inflammatory joint disease. However, studies on humans
      with RA have yielded controversial results. A large part of the authors researched state that
      further randomized double-blind controlled studies should be carried out to prove the
      effectiveness of LLLT on RA. Thus, the aim of the present study was to assess the
      effectiveness of LLLT on the reduction in pain and improvement in function in the hands of
      patients with RA.
