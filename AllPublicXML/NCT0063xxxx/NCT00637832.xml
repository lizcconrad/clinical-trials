      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in different
      ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and
      help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in
      different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping
      them from dividing. Radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies, such as yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab
      tiuxetan, can find cancer cells and carry cancer-killing substances to them without harming
      normal cells. Giving rituximab together with combination chemotherapy and yttrium Y 90
      ibritumomab tiuxetan may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving rituximab together with combination
      chemotherapy and yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan works in treating patients with relapsed
      follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To evaluate the response rates in patients with relapsed follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma
           treated with short-duration rituximab and combination chemotherapy (R-chemo) followed by
           rituximab and yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate the duration of response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To evaluate the quality of response in order to determine the conversion rate from
           partial response to complete response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To evaluate the toxicity of yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan when administered after 3
           courses of R-chemo.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Chemoimmunotherapy (R-CHOP or R-CVP): Patients receive R-CHOP comprising rituximab IV,
           cyclophosphamide IV, doxorubicin hydrochloride IV, and vincristine IV on day 1 and oral
           prednisolone on days 1-5. Alternatively, patients who have already been exposed to prior
           tolerance doses of anthracyclines receive R-CVP comprising rituximab IV,
           cyclophosphamide IV, and vincristine IV on day 1 and oral prednisolone on days 1-5.
           Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 3 courses.

      Patients with objective evidence of response on CT scan or those with &lt; 25% bone marrow
      involvement and no signs of bone marrow hypocellularity (&lt; 15%) on bone marrow biopsy proceed
      to radioimmunotherapy.

        -  Radioimmunotherapy: Four to 6 weeks after completion of R-CHOP or R-CVP, patients
           receive rituximab IV followed no more than 4 hours later by yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab
           tiuxetan IV over 10 minutes.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for up to 5 years.
