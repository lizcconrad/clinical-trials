  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to test legal guardians reading comprehension of their child's
      post-operative medication administration using three different versions of written medication
      information (standard fact sheets, easy-to-read fact sheets, and easy-to-read fact sheets
      accompanied by illustrations).

    <textblock>
      It is important for the child's welfare and comfort that the legal guardian can read and
      comprehend their child's pain medication information. Failure to understand the full
      implications of the medication may jeopardize the child's comfort level or welfare.
      Readability of printed education materials is a key to comprehension and supplements what
      healthcare providers verbally tell the parents/legal guardians. Several studies have
      demonstrated the benefits of using illustrations to convey intended messages. Simple line
      drawings appear to do well with those who have low-literacy skills.

      The following hypothesis will be tested:

        -  There is no difference in level of comprehension of medication administration by the
           legal guardians who receive standard fact sheets about medication, those who receive
           easy-to-read fact sheets, and those who receive easy-to-read fact sheets accompanied by
           illustrations.

        -  There is no difference in level of comprehension of pain assessment by the legal
           guardians who receive standard fact sheets about assessing pain, those who receive
           easy-to-read fact sheets, and those who receive easy-to-read facts sheets accompanied by
           illustrations.

        -  There is no relationship between legal guardians' satisfaction with medication education
           and whether they receive standard fact sheets, easy-to-read fact sheets, or those who
           receive easy-to read fact sheets accompanied by illustrations.
