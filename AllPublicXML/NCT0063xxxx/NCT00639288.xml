      Objective: To develop a detailed treatment manual that modifies the existing CPT-C treatment
      protocol to allow for concurrent treatment of PTSD and AD, and to obtain some pilot data
      regarding its efficacy.

      Hypothesis: We predict that CPT-C will significantly reduce the number of drinking days
      (measured by the Timeline Follow Back Method [TLFB]) and reduce the symptoms of PTSD
      (measured by the [CAPS and PCL] scores).

      Design: This is a non-randomized, prospective study in which all participants will receive
      the modified CPT-C for 12 weeks by trained CPT-C clinicians, with each session lasting
      approximately 1-1.5 hours). Modifications to CPT-C include psychoeducation about alcohol use
      as an avoidance of PTSD symptoms integrated throughout treatment, integration of coping
      skills training for AD, weekly breathalyzer tests to measure blood alcohol level, and use and
      collection of daily dairies of alcohol use.
