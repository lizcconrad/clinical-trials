  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will look for a relationship between asthma and factors released from the lungs in
      exhaled breath. If a relationship can be established, the identified factors may be used as
      biomarkers to predict episodes of increased asthma symptoms so that medications can be given
      to prevent the onset of an asthma attack.

      Healthy volunteers and people who have had asthma for at least 1 year may be eligible for
      this study. Candidates must be between 18 and 75 years of age.

      Participants undergo blood tests and breathing tests. For the latter, participants breathe
      into a machine before and after inhaling an asthma medication called albuterol. The machine
      measures the volume of air the subject can breathe out. Participants also provide a sample of
      exhaled breath by breathing normally for up to 30 minutes while wearing a mask devised for
      the procedure. Pulse rate, oxygen saturation and wheezing are monitored during the breath
      collection.

    <textblock>
      Asthma is a major public health problem that is associated with significant morbidity and
      mortality. Patients at increased risk for asthma decompensations include those with severe
      asthma that is refractory to therapy, as well as patients with poorly controlled disease due
      to inadequate treatment. The aim of this exploratory specimen procurement protocol is to
      develop a non-invasive method for the detection of asthma-specific biomarkers in exhaled
      breath condensates (EBC) utilizing a novel collection device that was engineered at the Johns
      Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. Biomarkers in EBC will be identified by mass
      spectroscopy. We propose that the identification of biomarkers in EBC that correlate with
      airway inflammation and disease activity may be used to guide therapy and prevent
      exacerbations in asthmatic patients.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA - ASTHMA:

        Patients will be between 18 and 75 years of age, male or female, with a diagnosis of asthma
        for at least one year.

        Oxygen saturation on room air greater than or equal to 92 percent.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA - ASTHMA:

        Diagnosis of a pulmonary disorder other than asthma (for example: chronic bronchitis,
        emphysema, cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, sarcoidosis, HIV-related lymphocytic airway
        inflammation).

        Cigarette smoking within the past 3 months or a prior history of greater than 10 cumulative
        pack-years.

        History of coronary artery disease.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS:

        Research volunteers will be between 18 and 75 years of age, male or female.

        Oxygen saturation on room air greater than or equal to 92 percent.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS:

        Same as the asthmatic exclusion criteria plus a history of asthma.

        Reversible Airflow Obstruction (increase in FEV (1) by 12 percent and 200 cc after inhaled
        beta 2-agonist)
