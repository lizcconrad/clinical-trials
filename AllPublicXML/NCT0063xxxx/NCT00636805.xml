      1. Primary Objective:

             -  To determine the efficacy and tolerability of palonosetron and dexamethasone in
                preventing acute CINV in brain tumor patients during the first 24 hours of
                receiving Irinotecan /Bevacizumab regimens.

        2. Secondary Objective

             -  To determine the safety and tolerability of palonosetron in brain tumor patients.

             -  To determine the effects of glucocorticoid and anticonvulsants on the efficacy of
                palonosetron.

             -  To determine the efficacy of palonosetron and dexamethasone in preventing delayed
                CINV in brain tumor patients during days 2-5.

             -  To determine if patients receiving palonosetron have less fatigue than baseline.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Before the patients receive the palonosetron, a physical exam and blood tests are performed
      to determine eligibility. If eligible and willing, subjects are given Palonosetron
      intravenously. Subjects are given the Palonosetron and Dexamethasone 30 minutes before the
      first dose of Irinotecan and Bevacizumab chemotherapy. The total expected duration of
      participation is 57 days. Subjects are also asked to complete 4 questionnaires about nausea
      and vomiting, as well as daily functioning and fatigue. Subjects are asked to complete these
      questionnaires before starting chemotherapy, the day of starting chemotherapy and for the
      next 4 days after receiving chemotherapy, for a total of 6 times. Subjects are asked to
      complete this set of questionnaires each of the 3 times that they receive chemotherapy during
      the 6-week treatment cycle.

      The other treatments subjects would normally receive for their brain tumor and their routine
      care are not affected by the study.

    <description>Overall mean change in the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue score from baseline to day 5 of the first week of chemotherapy. The FACIT-Fatigue is a 13-item validated questionnaire assessing the impact of fatigue on an individual's quality of life. The raw score range is 0-52 with higher scores indicating better quality of life. The mean change from baseline to day 5 was calculated by subtracting the baseline score from mean of the day 1-5 scores, thus a negative mean change represents worsening in quality of life due to fatigue.</description>

        <description>Overall mean change in the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue score from baseline to day 5 of the first week of chemotherapy. The FACIT-Fatigue is a 13-item validated questionnaire assessing the impact of fatigue on an individual's quality of life. The raw score range is 0-52 with higher scores indicating better quality of life. The mean change from baseline to day 5 was calculated by subtracting the baseline score from mean of the day 1-5 scores, thus a negative mean change represents worsening in quality of life due to fatigue.</description>
