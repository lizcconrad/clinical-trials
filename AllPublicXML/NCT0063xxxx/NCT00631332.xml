  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Women's Health Initiative Study of Cognitive Aging (WHISCA) is a two-armed, randomized,
      placebo controlled, clinical trial designed to assess the efficacy of postmenopausal hormone
      therapy (HT) on age related changes in specific cognitive functions.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      WHISCA is an ancillary study to the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) and the WHI Memory Study
      (WHIMS) and has enrolled 2303 women aged 66 to 84 years who did not meet the criteria for
      dementia. WHISCA is investigating the effects of hormone therapy on rates of change over time
      in memory, other aspects of cognition (language, attention, spatial ability), motor function,
      and mood.

      Objectives

        -  Does HT protect against age-associated memory and cognitive longitudinal decline in
           women age 65 and older?

        -  What is the rate of change in memory and other cognitive abilities in women receiving HT
           compared to women receiving placebo?

        -  Does the addition of progesterone to HT modify the effects of estrogen on memory and
           other cognitive abilities?

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Determine if HT protect against age-associated memory and cognitive longitudinal decline in women age 65 and older as measured over time by a series of cognitive tests administered annually.</measure>
    <time_frame>Annual assessment done annually.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measures are the changes in scores from a standardized neuropsychological assessment will be conducted annually. The battery is comprised primarily of tests of memory, and includes the following tests in specified order: the Prospective Memory Tests, Primary Mental Abilities Vocabulary Test, the California Verbal Learning Test, the Benton Visual Retention Test, Card Rotations Test, the Finger Tapping Test, the Letter and Semantic Fluency Test and the Digit Span Test. In addition, the Positive and Negative Affect Scale and Geriatric Depression Scale will be administered.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Determine the long-term effects of HT on changes in memory, other cognitive functions, and affect; and to investigate predictors of the transitions between normal aging and mild cognitive impairment and mild cognitive impairment and dementia.</measure>
    <time_frame>measured over life of the study</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary outcome measures will examine relative differences in measures between enrollment in WHIMS and the termination of the WHIMS E+P trial and E-Alone trial and also examine the relative differences in measures comparing periods of time for each woman when she reported taking HT versus times she reported not taking HT.</description>

    <ipd_description>WHISCA will follow guidelines, methods and processes as set forth in the WHI 2015-2020 Data Sharing Plan. Accompanying the limited data sets, substantial electronic documentation will be provided in a standard format that is readable on a variety of platforms. Documentation will include data collection forms, a description of study protocol and procedures, description of all variable re-coding and a list of major study publications. These data will be available to users only under a data-sharing agreement that provides for: a commitment to using the data only for research purposes and not to identify any individual participant; a commitment to securing the data using appropriate computer technology; and a commitment to destroying or returning the data after analyses are completed. Data will be made available for timely release no later than the acceptance for publication of the main findings from the final dataset.</ipd_description>
