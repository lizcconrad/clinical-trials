      Objective:

      Prospective study regulation in bone mass, size, architecture, cortical, trabecular bone,
      soft tissues and risk factors for cardiovascular disease at growth. Determine regulation by
      environmental factors. Evaluate how training affects the skeleton, soft tissues and
      cardiovascular risk factors during growth Material/Methods: (i) 500 children in one RCT´s
      with or without intervention with physical activity (daily scholl physical education) from
      school start to college. Annual evaluations

      Importance:

      The investigators provide increased understanding of the pathophysiology of osteoporosis by
      determine the mineralization, size- and architecture development during growth and adulthood.
      Evaluate if intervention program with exercise increase bone strength, muscle mass and reduce
      fatness and risk factor for cardiovascular disease.

      Background:

      Skeletal growth and the age related bone loss determine who will get osteoporosis (and
      fractures), but not only bone mass, also skeletal architecture and bone quality influence
      bone strength. Regulation of the traits differs where hormones, genetics and environmental
      factors continuously influence the development with different effect during different ages.
      It is thus imperative to determine the regulators of the traits and evaluate if these can be
      modified during growth.

      Aim:

      Study regulation of bone mass, size, architecture, cortical, trabecular, axial and
      appendicular bone and soft tissue during growth and aging; evaluate risk factors for
      cardiovascular disease; determine importance of environmental factors and hereditary factors.

      Study Design/Method

      Bunkeflo Cohort:

      Prospective, controlled exercise intervention study annually following skeletal development
      in 500children from age 7.

      Importance:

      By evaluating skeletal mass/architecture separate we will increase the understanding of the
      pathophysiology of osteoporosis. The intervention study provide Evidence Based Information as
      regard the importance of physical activity during growth. The presented Strength Index, where
      we combine bone mass and skeletal architecture, may predict fractures better than only bone
      mass.

      Determinants for Peak Bone Mass, Skeletal Architecture, Fractures, Adipositas and
      Cardiovascular Risk Factors During Growth and Adulthood

      Aim of the project:

      In the THE BUNKEFLO COHORT we determine if the growing skeleton, fat mass and risk factors
      for cardiovascular disease irreversible can be influenced by environmental influences as
      exercise and disease.

      Background:

      Bone mass, cortical thickness and bone geometry independently contribute to bone strength,
      all regulated differently. Thus, the regulation must therefore be trait specific studied as
      to understand the pathophysiology of osteoporosis as osteoporosis may partly be the result of
      deficits occurring during growth. We must also better discriminate the different traits
      building the skeleton. Areal bone mineral density (aBMD), measured by dual X-ray
      absorptiometry (DXA) the clinically used estimation of bone mass, is an estimate only
      adjusted for the measured area, not the third dimension (the depth), but aBMD is often
      uncritically used as a measurement for the &quot;true density&quot;. As to predict future fragility
      fracture, aBMD is acceptable, but for the understanding of reduced bone strength, we must
      separate the estimation into bone mass, the amount of bone within the skeletal envelope, bone
      size and skeletal structure (architecture) as these traits are independent associated with
      fractures.

      Preliminary results from our group:

      Bone loss by ageing is partly compensated by increased bone size, partly preserving bone
      strength. This is of relevance as a Strength Index, taking both bone size and bone mass into
      account, probably predict future fractures better than bone mass. Two years daily school
      gymnastics enhanced bone mass and bone size, reduce the fatness and cardiovascular risk
      factors for disease. Exercise increase bone mass also after puberty but the benefit is lost
      with cessation of exercise. In spite of this have elderly former active individuals less
      fractures than inactive people.

      Research Questions Following Our Hypothesis:

        1. Will separate evaluation of skeletal growth in bone mineral acquisition and skeletal
           architecture identify different pathogenetic risk cohorts for fracture?

        2. Could an exercise intervention program within a school affect the skeletal growth, fat
           content soft and muscle strength in growing children and reduce risk for cardiovascular
           disease? (BUNKEFLO STUDY)?

      Methods: Skeletal Evaluation: Dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA, Lunar DPX-L and Lunar Pixi):
      Quantitative bone mass (aBMD) total body, femoral neck, lumbar spine and regional. Special
      software determines cortical width, medullar width, cortical density and trabecular density
      in mid femur. vBMD and skeletal size can be evaluated from existing measurement in femoral
      neck and third lumbar vertebrae from DXA scan by the method described by Carter. Ultrasound
      (Lunar Achilles): Qualitative bone mass (aBMD) and bone width calcaneus. Peripheral computed
      tomography (pQCT): Bone mass, bone size and skeletal structure. Finite element analyses:
      skeletal strength. Digital radiographs of the hand: Bone size and cortical thickness. Soft
      tissue Evaluation: DXA (Lunar DPX-L): Quantitative lean body mass and fat mass. Peripheral
      computed tomography (pQCT): Quantitative lean body mass and fat mass. Muscle function: Cybex
      apparatus: Qualitative muscle strength in lower extremities. Balance plate and
      physiotherapists test: Qualitative muscle capacity. Anthropometric evaluation: Electronic
      scale: Body weight. Holstein Stadiometer: Sitting and standing height. Harpender stadiometer:
      Segmental extremity length and width. Pubertal status: Tanner. Environmental Evaluation:
      Questionnaire: life-style, exercise history, nutrition, and hereditary factors. Bone
      metabolism: Bone formation: Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), isoenzyme of bone specific ALP,
      osteocalcin (bone GLA protein), procollagen 1 C-terminal propeptic (P1CP). Bone resorption:
      Hydroxyproline, pyridinoline, deoxypyridinoline, carboxytelopeptid region (ICTP) and
      aminotelopeptid region (NTX) in blood and urine. Genetics: Polymorphism of Vitamin D receptor
      gene (VDR), oestrogen receptor gene (ER), androgen receptor gene (AR), human growth hormone
      gene (GH 1), collagen 1 A gene (COLL1A) and additional bone related genes that will occur the
      next years. Hormones: Growth hormone, IGF-1, testosterone, estradiol, luteinisating hormone,
      follicle stimulating hormone, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), androstenedione,
      dehydroepiandrostenedione (DHEAS). Fractures: The fractures are registered in the files at
      the Dept. of Radiology, MAS where referrals, reports and films are saved since last century.
      Questionnaire: Epidemiologic fracture screening. Physiologic Evaluation: Blood pressure
      (rest): Upper right arm. Bicycle test: Max working capacity by evaluating VO2 MAX. and CO2
      production in breath. Bio impedance: Fat percent in total body. Spirometry: Static and
      dynamic lung function measured by the IOS-method. Ultrasound: Volume and wall thickness of
      heart. Accelerometer: Number of steps during four days is measured within this minicomputer
      fastened at the wrist belt (evaluate the objective activity level). Blood Evaluation: Lipid
      profile and glucose - risk factors for cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome.

      Probands - Work plan:

      A. Determinants of Peak Bone Mass/Size/Architecture, Soft Tissue Development and Risk Factors
      for Cardiovascular disease During Growth Question: Regulation affecting growth and peak bone
      mass? Can increased exercise increase bone mass, reduce fatness and risk factors for
      cardiovascular disease? Could individuals with high risk for fractures be predicted already
      in early ages? Hypothesis: Changes in environmental factors can increase peak bone mass,
      reduce fatness and risk factors for future cardiovascular disease. Bone mass &quot;track&quot; so that
      we could already in young years identify individuals with high risk for fractures.

      Study cohorts: a. THE BUNKEFLO STUDY: N=500, aged 7, 8, 9, 12 and 15 years at baseline. In
      the RCT part of the study: n=310 aged 7-8 at baseline. Half with physical activity and health
      education as intervention, half controls, all annually followed during primary school.
      Several other scientific institutions from the University of Lund participate as Department
      of Physiotherapy, Clinical Physiology, Nutritional, Paediatrics, Child Psychiatry, Teacher
      Training College, and Dental School, all with separate projects within the RCT. Time plan:
      Baseline measurements in 1999-2000, with annual follow-up measurements throughout the Swedish
      nine-year primary school. After that, one follow-up during the last year of secondary school
      (12th grade), and one follow-up at age 23-25.

      Relevance:

      The studies will increase the understanding of the pathophysiology of osteoporosis. The
      Strength Index should possibly replace a bone mass measurement in the fracture risk
      assessment. The intervention studies will provide Evidence Based Information for the
      importance of exercise.
