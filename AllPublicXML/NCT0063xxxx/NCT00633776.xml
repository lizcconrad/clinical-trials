      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of nebulized formoterol fumarate
      (Perforomist) to dry-powder inhaler formoterol fumarate (Foradil). Perforomist is a solution
      that is made into very fine spray (using a nebulizer) that is then breathed in over 10-15
      minutes. Foradil is taken in a single quick, deep inhalation.

      Participation requires 3 visits over 1-5 weeks. The first visit (Screening) will help
      determine subjects' eligibility through medical history, physical exam, lung function
      testing, and exercise testing. Those who qualify will be invited back to 2 test visits, at
      which subjects will undergo lung function testing and high-resolution CT scans before and
      after treatment with one of the study drugs. All subjects will take both study drugs: those
      who are randomized to Perforomist at Test Visit 1 will take Foradil at Test Visit 2, and vice
      versa.

             significantly prolong the QT interval.
