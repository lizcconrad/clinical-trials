    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether a stress reduction intervention prior to
      surgery can improve wound healing and recovery.The investigators hypothesise that patients
      who receive a psychological stress reduction intervention prior to surgery will report lower
      stress and higher perceived control, have lower stress hormones, better wound healing and
      better self-reported recovery than patients who receive standard care alone.

      In previous prospective research, psychological stress has been shown to slow the healing of
      small superficial wounds and impair surgical healing. We will investigate whether a
      psychological intervention to reduce stress can improve surgical healing.

      Ninety patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy will be randomised to
      receive either standard care or a brief pre-surgical psychological intervention plus standard
      care. Patients will complete a pre-surgical questionnaire to assess stress, anxiety,
      depression, illness perceptions and current health, at least 3 days prior to surgery. Then
      the intervention will be delivered. A second questionnaire on the morning of surgery will
      reassess stress, anxiety and illness perceptions to see whether the intervention has reduced
      stress and increased control perceptions. Plasma catecholamines and salivary cortisol will be
      tested to assess the effectiveness of the intervention in reducing stress-related hormones
      and to investigate their role in wound healing. During surgery 2 small expanded
      polytetrafluroethylene tubes will be inserted in the wound, which will be removed after 7
      days. Wound healing will be assessed by hydroxyproline and total protein deposition in the
      tubes, as well as by the presence of wound infection. Patients' post-surgical recovery,
      including pain and fatigue, will also be assessed. If this brief psychological intervention
      can improve wound healing and aid recovery, it would provide a simple strategy to improve
      outcomes in surgery.

    <description>In addition to standard care, patients in the intervention group will receive a one-hour individually delivered programme administered once by a psychologist at least 3 days prior to surgery. This session aims to reduce stress and involves teaching relaxation and guided imagery exercises. Patients are provided a CD (or audiotape)of the relaxation instructions to take home and practice once a day.</description>
