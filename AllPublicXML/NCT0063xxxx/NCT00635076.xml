  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term (6-month) efficacy, safety, and
      tolerability of alprazolam XR in adolescents with panic disorder.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to recruitment difficulties in this adolescent population, the clinical program for
      alprazolam XR was cancelled and this study was terminated on 1 September 2004. There were no
      safety concerns that led to this decision.

          -  To enter Study A6131007, subjects must have completed Study A6131002, had an
             acceptable tolerability to study drug, and in the clinical judgment of the

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must continue to meet all of the exclusion criteria enumerated in the Acute
             Efficacy Study (Protocol A6131002) with the following exception: Subjects will be
             allowed to undergo cognitive-behavioral or other panic-specific therapy and any other
             psychotherapy (e.g., supportive and/or family therapy) during the expected study
             period in this study.
