  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine whether we can purify and grow a
      population of cells from the participants blood (iNKT cells) and then safely give them back
      to the participant in increased numbers, and whether these cells will then stimulate the
      bodies own immune response against the cancer. These iNKT cells have been used in laboratory
      studies and information from these and other research studies suggest that increasing the
      number of these cells in the blood can stimulate the immune response against tumors.

      -  The first step in the study will be to collect iNKT cells from the participants
           peripheral blood. For this procedure an intravenous catheter will be used to remove the
           blood. The white blood cells will be removed from the blood and the red blood cells and
           plasma will be returned to the participant (leukopheresis).

        -  We will then purify the iNKT cells from these collected white blood cells, and will grow
           them in culture plates in the lab under strictly controlled sterile conditions. This can
           take 4-6 weeks.

        -  If we are successful in growing the iNKT cells to large enough numbers, they will be
           divided into 3 equal doses. Participants will receive one dose of these cells by
           intravenous infusion every 2 weeks or days 1, 15 and 29. A blood sample will be taken
           immediately before each infusion, and at 1 and 4 hours after each infusion. Participants
           will be asked to return for blood samples on day 2, 3, 4 and 8 after infusion.

        -  The initial group of 3-6 participants will not receive any other therapy with the iNKT
           cell infusions. However, the subsequent group of 6 patients will in addition receive
           GM-CSF, which can further stimulate the immune system and may increase the effects of
           the iNKT cells. This medication is administered by subcutaneous injection and will be
           given daily for 10 days beginning the day of the second and third infusion.

        -  Participants will be on this research study for about 14 weeks, which includes the time
           for the cell purification and culture, treatment, and follow-up observation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Stage IV melanoma

          -  ECOG Performance Status 0-1

          -  Estimated life expectancy of 6 months or greater

          -  18 years of age or older

          -  Adequate pulmonary and cardiac function as outlined in protocol

             and iNKT cell reinfusion

             within 4 weeks prior to screening, and must not have a history of brain metastases
