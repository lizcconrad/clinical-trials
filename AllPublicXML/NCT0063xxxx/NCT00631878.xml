      &quot;Phase I/II, Randomized, Double Blind, Placebo Controlled, Dose Escalating, Safety and
      Pharmacokinetics Study in Very Low Birth Weight Neonates of Four Doses of BSYX-A110, a Human
      Chimeric Anti-Staphylococcal Monoclonal Antibody for the Prevention of S. epidermidis
      Infection&quot; will be the first study of BSYX-A110 in the target population of hospitalized,
      very low birth weight infants. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and
      pharmacokinetics of escalating doses of BSYX-A110 administered on Study Days 0 and 14.

      This will be a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, dose escalating study of
      BSYX-A110 in 48 very low birth weight neonates. The dose levels to be evaluated are 10, 30,
      60 and 90 mg/kg. Each dose level will enroll 12 infants who will receive two doses of
      BSYX-A110 or placebo intravenously at a ratio of 2:1 while hospitalized following birth.
      Infants will be followed for 8 weeks following the first dose of BSYX-A110 or placebo. The
      primary objective of this study is to evaluate safety and tolerability. The secondary
      objective is to analyze the pharmacokinetics of BSYX-A110. Positive cultures obtained during
      the study period will be recorded and analyzed.
