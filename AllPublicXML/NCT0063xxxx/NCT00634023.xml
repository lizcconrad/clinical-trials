  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a cross-sectional study of symptom burden and clinical management. A subset of
      patients who have attended the Primary Care (PC) office with reflux symptoms during a
      retrospective period of 4 months (Index Visit) are invited to complete health survey
      questionnaires and partake in a subject-physician/study nurse interview (Visit 1), in order
      to assess the type, intensity and frequency of GERD symptoms at both visits and describe the
      treatment provided. Additionally, the impact of GERD on subjects' life, productivity and
      willingness to pay for GERD symptom relief will be explored. This design will give a
      &quot;real-life&quot; clinical practice picture in a representative population of PC doctors and
      subjects.
