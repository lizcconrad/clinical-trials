    <textblock>
      Head injury is the most common cause of mortality and acquired disability in childhood. It is
      common to elevate the head of patients at risk for increased intracranial pressure, although
      it is not clear if it is always beneficial. Every severe pediatric traumatic brain injured
      patient will have an optimal head position that prevents rising pressure in the brain.

    <textblock>
      Head injury is the most common cause of mortality and acquired disability on childhood.
      Management of children at risk for intracranial hypertension is both complex and increasingly
      controversial. Also, effect of head position on intracranial pressure, cerebral perfusion
      pressure, adn cerebral venous outflow in the pediatric population has not been studied. We
      will examine the effect of head positioning on ICP, CPP, and cerebral venous outflow in
      pediatric patients at risk for intracranial hypertension. The hypothesis is that ICP will be
      reduced with improvement in cerebral venous outflow by each patient having their own optimal
      head position.
