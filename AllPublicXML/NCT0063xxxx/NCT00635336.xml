      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and clinical efficacy of novel
      vaccination for advanced bladder cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      DEP domain containing 1(DEPDC1) and M phase phosphoprotein 1(MPHOSPH1) have been identified
      using genome-wide expression profile analysis by the use of cDNA microarray in our previous
      studies. We have determined the HLA-A*2402 restricted epitope peptides derived from DEPDC1,
      DEPDC1-9-294, and MPHOSPH1, MPHOSPH1-9-278. These epitopes showed strong IFN-g production
      when stimulated with the appropriate targets expressed the appropriate protein and
      HLA-A*2402. Furthermore, when vaccinated these peptides, specific CTLs were determined after
      the vaccination. Therefore we focused on the safety and efficacy of novel vaccination for the
      advanced bladder cancer patients who already showed resistance to standard chemotherapies or
      radiotherapy.

    <description>DEPDC1-9-294, and/or MPHOSPH1-9-278 will be administered by subcutaneously injection once every week for 3 months thereafter once two weeks. These peptides are determined to administer in accordance with the protein expression using immunohistochemical staining. These peptides are conjugated with Montanide ISA 51 as an adjuvant.</description>
