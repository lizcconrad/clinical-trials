    <textblock>
      The relationship between hormone cycling/fluctuations and the occurrence of seizures in women
      has received considerable discussion in the medical literature. This study investigated the
      efficacy and tolerability of LEV treatment for subjects with catamenial exacerbation of
      partial onset seizures.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Non-pregnant and non-nursing females between the ages of 18 - 45 years of age;

          -  out-patients with epilepsy experiencing uncontrolled simple and/or complex partial
             seizures with or without secondary generalization for a minimum of 2 years;

          -  classifiable epilepsy according to the International Classification of Epileptic
             Seizures;

          -  minimum of 2 seizures per 4 weeks during the Baseline Period, without exceeding 100
             seizures per 4 weeks. The majority of seizures (&gt;50%) must be partial onset, with or
             without secondary generalization;

          -  exhibited, during the Baseline Period, a catamenial epilepsy type C1 pattern defined
             as at least a 70% increase of weekly seizure frequency during the menstrual phase
             compared to the luteal and follicular phases combined;

          -  concurrent C2 catamenial epilepsy, defined as a 70% increase in daily seizure average
             during the ovulatory phase in comparison to the follicular and luteal phases combined,
             was permitted;

          -  taking a minimum of one and a maximum of two antiepileptic drugs at a stable dose for
             a period of 4 weeks prior to the selection visit and during the duration of the trial;

          -  vagal nerve stimulator (VNS) was permitted.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  using felbatol and presented clinically significant abnormalities with WBCs, RBCs,
             platelets, and/or hepatic function during felbatol treatment, and taking felbatol less
             than one year from the date of the Selection Visit;

          -  partial onset seizures uncountable due to clustering during the last 3 months;

          -  hormonal contraceptives that block menses within 6 months of the selection visit with
             no washout period permitted;

          -  menstrual cycle length less than 21 days and greater than 35 days during the baseline
             evaluation;

          -  alternative medications documented or purported to impact reproductive hormone levels,
             within the prior 2 months with no washout period permitted;

          -  significantly irregular menstrual cycles or a history of frequent amenorrhea defined
             as two episodes within the preceding 6 months;

          -  not taking hormonal contraceptives with more than one anovulatory cycle during the
             Baseline Period;

          -  clinically significant medical condition requiring treatment, except for the study
             indication, which would prevent clear interpretation of the study results;

          -  using the following classes of medications influencing the central nervous system:
             antipsychotics (typical and atypical), psychostimulants (except those containing
             methylphenidate, dextroamphetamine, or amphetamine used in the treatment of Attention
             Deficit Disorder), and hypnotics;

          -  chronically dosing with benzodiazepines;

          -  hospitalized for depression within 3 months prior to the selection visit.

          -  history of attempting suicide within the last 3 years, or suicidal ideation within the
             last 3 months;

          -  recent history (within the past two years) or presence of significant alcohol abuse or
             drug abuse;

          -  clinical history of significantly impaired renal function with a estimate of
             creatinine clearance below 80 ml/min;

          -  history of clinically significant cardiac conditions;

          -  ALT/SGPT, AST/SGOT, alkaline phosphatase, or ?-GT value of more than 3 times the upper
             limit of the central laboratory reference value;

          -  presence of a terminal illness;

          -  presence of any clinically significant allergic condition to levetiracetam or
             pyrrolidone derivatives;

          -  neutrophil count of less than 1800 per ?L.
