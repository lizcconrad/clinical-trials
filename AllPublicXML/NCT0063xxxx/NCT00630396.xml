  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to find out which of 4 different doses of minocycline are
      safe and well tolerated so that we will know the optimal dose to test in future patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Minocycline is a widely used antibiotic and is approved by the Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA) for treatment of infections and acne. However, doctors do not know whether minocycline
      will work in stroke patients. Its use in stroke patients is experimental. There is a lot of
      information from experimental stroke studies in animals that minocycline lessens the damage
      from a stroke and the animals recover better. Since minocycline is generally a very safe drug
      in humans and does not have a lot of side effects, investigators at Georgia Health Sciences
      University (formerly the Medical College of Georgia) believe that it might be a safe and
      effective drug to improve the outcome in patients with stroke.

    <measure>Maximally Tolerated Dose of IV Minocycline</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators closely monitored each subject for evidence of minocycline intolerance. All adverse events were immediately reported for a decision whether to discontinue the study medication and/or reduce the dose. A computer program was used to determine the maximum tolerated dose. After entering information regarding doses and expected toxicities, results for each subject as they were collected were entered. The computer program informed as to (de)escalation, or maintenance of the same dose in the subsequent cohort of enrolled patients.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Half-life of IV Minocycline</measure>
    <time_frame>For each subject blood samples were drawn before dose #1 and one hour after starting dose #1. Additional blood was drawn 1, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after starting dose #6, which lasted approximately 6 days.</time_frame>
    <description>In eligible patients enrolled at Georgia Health Sciences University, blood samples were drawn for quantification of minocycline serum concentrations. This enabled the study team to determine the half life of the study drug.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>90 Day Modified Rankin Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) was performed in person at the 90 day clinic follow-up appointment. The modified Rankin Scale is a commonly used scale for measuring the degree of disability or dependence in the daily activities of people who have suffered a stroke. The scale runs from 0-6. 0 represents no symptoms. 1 represents no significant disability. 2 represents slight disability. 3 represents moderate disability. 4 represents moderately severe disability. 5 represents severe disability. 6 represents death.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Recruitment occurred from June 3, 2008 to October 10, 2009. The study was completed ahead of schedule. Study subjects were enrolled in each recruiting centers' Emergency Department or stroke intensive care unit. Many subjects came as transfers from rural or outside hospitals to one of the enrolling centers for further care and study participation.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Potential patients that met all of the inclusion criteria, did not meet any of the exclusion criteria, and were willing to participate were enrolled in the study. All study subjects were given one of the four doses of minocycline. The dose of minocycline given was assigned by a computer program.</pre_assignment_details>
