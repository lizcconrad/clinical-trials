  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Cancer which is refractory to standard therapies, or for which no standard therapies
             exist. Inclusion is irrespective of stage of disease or extent of prior therapy.

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed solid, malignant tumour.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Receipt of any of the following treatments within 4 weeks prior to study entry:
             chemotherapy (within 6 weeks for nitrosurea or mitomycin C), radiotherapy, hormone
             therapy (except for androgen-deprivation therapy for patients with prostate cancer),
             immunotherapy and any other anti-cancer therapies.

          -  Unresolved toxicity (other than stable toxicity) from previous anti-cancer therapy,
             except alopecia.

          -  History of documented cardiac failure, angina pectoris requiring antianginal
             medication, evidence of transmural infarction on ECG, poorly controlled hypertension
             (systolic &gt;180 mmHg or diastolic &gt;100 mmHg), significant valvular disease or history
             of high risk dysrrhythmia (such as ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia
             [includes ventricular triplets]).

          -  Resting ECG with measurable QTc interval of &gt; 460 msec at 2 or more time-points within
             a 24-hour time period, or history of prolonged QTc syndrome.

          -  The presence of any ocular disease or condition that is active or is likely to flare
             up during the course of the study or any systemic disease/condition that is affecting
             or has affected the eye in the past and may flare up, or the treatment of which may
             have an adverse effect on the eye. Eye conditions that are stable and of long
             standing, such as scars from trauma, pinguecula, atrophic pterygia etc, should not be
             considered as reasons to exclude the patient.
