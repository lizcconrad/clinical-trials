    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of giving vorinostat and sorafenib
      tosylate together in treating patients with kidney or non-small cell lung cancer. Vorinostat
      may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
      Sorafenib tosylate may stop the growth of solid tumors by blocking blood flow to the tumor.
      Giving vorinostat together with sorafenib tosylate may kill more tumor cells.

      The main purpose of this study is to:

        -  Evaluate the safety of vorinostat in combination with sorafenib.

        -  Determine the largest dose of vorinostat + sorafenib that can be given safely to humans.

        -  Determine if vorinostat + sorafenib are effective in stopping tumors from growing or in
           decreasing their size.

        -  Study the side effects of vorinostat + sorafenib.

             refractory to established forms of therapy or for which no effective therapy exists,
             or for which sorafenib alone would be considered by the investigator as an appropriate
             therapy; patients who have refused available standard therapies would also be deemed
             eligible

          -  In Part A, evaluable disease by radiology and/or a recognized serum tumor marker is
             required; in Parts B and C, measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in

          -  Predicted life expectancy ≥ 12 weeks

          -  Patients may have had prior therapy, providing the following conditions are met:

               -  Patients must have recovered from any treatment related toxicities (with the
                  exception of alopecia) to ≤ CTC grade 1 (fatigue, and neurotoxicity at grade 2
                  are permissible if stable for &gt; 3 months) prior to registration

               -  Chemotherapy: A minimum of 5 predicted half-lives of the agent must have elapsed
                  between the end of treatment and registration on to the study; when half-lives
                  are not available the principle of 2 weeks for once daily medications and 3 weeks
                  for agents given less frequently will be adopted, but discussion with the
                  principal investigator is recommended

               -  Hormonal therapy: Patients may have had prior anticancer hormonal therapy
                  provided it is discontinued &gt; 4 weeks prior to registration into the study;
                  however, patients with prostate cancer with evidence of progressive disease may
                  continue on therapy which produces medical castration (eg, goserelin or
                  leuprorelin) provided this was commenced at least three months earlier

                  toxic effects of radiotherapy prior to registration; a minimum of 7 days must
                  have elapsed between the end of radiotherapy to non-target lesions and
                  registration into the study (minimum of 28 days for target lesions)

               -  Surgery: Previous surgery is permitted provided that wound healing has occurred
                  prior to registration

          -  Supportive therapy including bisphosphonates is permissible; previous use of myeloid
             and erythroid growth factor support is permissible, but not within 2 weeks of
             commencement of study; primary prophylactic use of myeloid and erythroid growth
             factors is not permitted within the study, but intervention or secondary prophylaxis
             is permitted if instituted following the documentation of ≥ grade 3 neutropenia or ≥

             patients on warfarin, the INR should be measured prior to initiation of
             sorafenib/vorinostat and monitored at least weekly, or as defined by the local
             standard of care, until INR is stable; vorinostat and sorafenib have both been
             reported to elevate INR in those on coumadin derivatives
