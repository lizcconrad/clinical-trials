    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 study during which patients with advanced solid tumors will receive a new
      formulation of investigational study drug ARRY-334543. Patients will receive increasing doses
      of study drug in order to achieve the highest dose possible that will not cause unacceptable
      side effects. The patients will be followed to see what side effects and effectiveness the
      study drug has, if any, in treating the cancer. In addition, the effect of food on the new
      formulation will be evaluated. Approximately 24 patients from Canada will be enrolled in this
      study (Active, not recruiting).

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histological or cytological evidence of malignancy.

          -  Patients with advanced solid tumors who are no longer candidates for standard therapy,
             have no standard therapy available, or choose not to pursue standard therapy.

          -  Cardiac ejection fraction â‰¥ 50% by echocardiogram (ECHO) or multiple gated acquisition
             (MUGA).

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0, 1 or 2.

          -  Additional criteria exist.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Uncontrolled brain metastases (if a patient has brain metastases and is on steroids,
             the steroid dose must be stable for at least 30 days).

          -  Use of an investigational medication or device within 30 days prior to first dose of
             study drug.

          -  Major surgery within 30 days prior to first dose of study drug.

          -  Radiotherapy or chemotherapy within 28 days prior to first dose of study drug (not
             including palliative radiotherapy at focal sites).

          -  Active, uncontrolled infection requiring systemic antibiotic therapy or other serious
             underlying medical condition which would impair the ability of the patient to receive
             protocol treatment.

          -  Pregnancy or lactation.

          -  Known positive serology for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), 'active' hepatitis
             B and/or hepatitis C.

          -  Additional criteria exist.
