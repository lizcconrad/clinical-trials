      To evaluate the single-dose and steady-state pharmacokinetics of desloratadine and
      fexofenadine in desloratadine slow metabolizers. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      desloratadine compared to fexofenadine following single and multiple oral doses administered
      to desloratadine slow metabolizers.

          -  Historical, clinical, or laboratory evidence of liver disease including but not
             limited to transaminase activity concentrations &gt;2.5 times the upper limit of the
             reference range.

          -  Active peptic ulcer disease or a history of gastrointestinal surgery within the last 6
