  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial of orally administered Ruxolitinib (INCB018424) in patients whose
      disease has progressed following 1 prior chemotherapy regimen (not including anti-androgens
      or ketoconazole) for metastatic, androgen-independent prostate cancer.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    According to the protocol, the sponsor terminated the study after it was determined that less
    than 2 of the first 22 patients showed a PSA50 response.

    <measure>Number of Participants With a Prostate-specific Antigen Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed monthly from Baseline until the end of study (up to 8 months)</time_frame>
    <description>A prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response was defined as a PSA decline from Baseline of 50% or greater, repeated on 2 occasions at least 4 weeks apart.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline through to the end of study (up to 8 months)</time_frame>
    <description>A treatment-related AE was defined as an event with a definite, probable, or possible causality to study medication. A serious AE is an event resulting in death, hospitalization, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or is life threatening, a congenital anomaly/birth defect or requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes above. The intensity of an AE was graded according to the National Cancer Institute common terminology criteria for adverse events (NCI-CTCAE) version 3.0: Grade 1 (Mild); Grade 2 (Moderate); Grade 3 (Severe); Grade 4 (life-threatening).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Progression</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline until the end of study (up to 8 months).</time_frame>
    <description>The time from first dosing day to the date of disease progression:
Progressive measurable disease by RECIST criteria (regardless of bone scan or prostate-specific antigen (PSA) results).
Development of unequivocal new lesions on bone scan without clinical suspicion of a &quot;flare&quot; reaction.
In patients who responded or had a decreased PSA from Baseline, a rise of 50% from PSA nadir, if the increase is ≥ 5 ng/mL or back to Baseline and confirmed by a 2nd value.
In patients with no decrease in PSA from Baseline, a 25% rise over Baseline and ≥ 5 ng/mL confirmed by a 2nd value.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With a Complete Response or Partial Response</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline through the end of study (up to 8 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Complete Response (CR) and Partial Response (PR) defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST) criteria. CR: Disappearance of all target and nontarget lesions. PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameter, or persistence of 1 or more nontarget lesion(s) or/and maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosed with radiographically-documented metastatic prostate cancer that has
             progressed while receiving androgen-suppressive therapy in the form of a bilateral
             orchiectomy or Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH) agonist (eg, leuprolide,
             goserelin).

          -  Patients must demonstrate evidence of progressive disease based on 1 of the following
             criteria: 1) Progressive measurable disease, or 2) Progressive rise in
             prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level (2 consecutive rises from a prior reference
             level), or 3) Development of new lesions on bone scan.

          -  If receiving a GnRH agonist as primary hormonal therapy, the serum testosterone level
             must be ≤ 50 ng/mL.

          -  Must have received and progressed during or following 1 prior chemotherapy regimen for
             metastatic disease (not including an anti-androgen or ketoconazole); or, must have
             discontinued prior systemic therapy because of poor tolerance or other adverse
             effects; or, must have refused chemotherapy treatment. Patients having undergone more
             than 1 prior chemotherapy regimen may be admitted at the discretion of the sponsor.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2.

          -  Baseline serum PSA level of ≥ 10 ng/mL

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Received any anti-cancer medications in the 30 days before receiving their first dose
             of study medication except for GnRH agonists and bisphosphonates.

          -  Any unresolved toxicity greater than or equal to Grade 2 from previous anti-cancer
             therapy, except for stable chronic toxicities not expected to resolve, such as
             peripheral neurotoxicity.

Progressive measurable disease by RECIST criteria (regardless of bone scan or prostate-specific antigen (PSA) results).
Development of unequivocal new lesions on bone scan without clinical suspicion of a “flare” reaction.
In patients who responded or had a decreased PSA from Baseline, a rise of 50% from PSA nadir, if the increase is ≥ 5 ng/mL or back to Baseline and confirmed by a 2nd value.
In patients with no decrease in PSA from Baseline, a 25% rise over Baseline and ≥ 5 ng/mL confirmed by a 2nd value.</description>

        <population>According to the protocol, the sponsor decided to close the study after it was determined that less than 2 of the first 22 patients showed a PSA50 response. Given that all patients discontinued the study due to lack of efficacy, the secondary endpoint of median time to progression was not assessed.</population>
