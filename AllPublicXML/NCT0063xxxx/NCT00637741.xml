    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical investigation is to evaluate the long-term (up to 12 months)
      outcome of the 200 mm long self-expanding nitinol EverFlex (ev3) stent in long
      femoropopliteal lesions (TASC C &amp; D) Is is the first time that the use of 200 mm long stents
      will be evaluated in these lesions. It is expected that the outcome of the treatment with
      this type of long stents will be better as the treatment of identical lesions lengths with
      multiple shorter stents.

             suitable for stenting

          -  Patient presenting a score from 2 to 5 following Rutherford classification

          -  Patient is willing to comply with specified follow-up evaluations at the specified
             times

          -  Patient is &gt;18 years old

          -  Patient (or their legal representative) understands the nature of the procedure and
             provides written informed consent, prior to enrolment in the study

          -  Prior to enrollment, the guidewire has crossed target lesion

        ANGIOGRAPHIC

          -  The target lesion is located within the native femoropopliteal artery until maximally
             3 cm proximally of the knee joint.

          -  The target lesion has angiographic evidence of stenosis or restenosis &gt; 50% or
             occlusion which can be passed with standard guidewire manipulation
