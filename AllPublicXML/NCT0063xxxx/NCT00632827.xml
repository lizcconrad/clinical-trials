    <textblock>
      This study examines the use of denileukin diftitox (Ontak) for patients with peripheral
      T-cell lymphoma who are candidates for autologous stem cell transplants.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This protocol proposes first to increase the proportion of patients who achieve adequate
      initial disease control and are able to proceed to autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) in
      first complete or partial remission. It administers intensive and novel induction therapy.

      Two cycles of GND (gemcitabine, vinorelbine, Doxil) will be used followed by two cycles of
      augmented dose CHOP (Cyclophosphamide) plus high-dose MTX. Patients will be restaged after
      two cycles of GND to assess response to GND alone and again after the second cycle of
      augmented CHOP/high-dose MTX.

      Those achieving a remission status will receive intensive consolidation with HDAC/etoposide
      followed by stem cell mobilization. A five-day course of denileukin diftitox (Ontak) will be
      administered at and will serve as an in vivo purge. This will be followed by autologous stem
      cell transplant.

      Those not achieving partial remission or better following the four induction courses will
      receive 2 cycles of denileukin diftitox(Ontak) for 5 days. Those achieving partial remission
      or better to this regimen will go on to consolidation/mobilization and autologous stem cell
      transplant.

      Post-transplant, denileukin diftitox will also be used as an additional module of therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologic diagnosis of any of the following:

               -  Peripheral T-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified (PTCL-U),(IPI &gt;2)

               -  Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (IPI &gt;2)

               -  Non-primary cutaneous Alk-1-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma

               -  Extranodal NK/T lymphoma (Excluding stage I/II nasal disease)

               -  Blastic NK cell lymphoma

               -  Enteropathy type T-cell lymphoma

               -  Subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma

               -  Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma

          -  Measurable or assessable disease is not required.

          -  Age &gt;18 and &lt; 70 years

          -  Previously untreated or 1 prior cycle of chemotherapy

          -  Creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dL

          -  Total bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dL, AST &lt; 3x upper limit of normal

          -  Patients who test positive for HepBSAg or HepC Ab are eligible provided all of the
             following criteria are met:

               -  bilirubin ≤ 2 x upper limit of normal;

               -  AST ≤ 3 x upper limit of normal;

               -  liver biopsy demonstrates ≤ grade 2 fibrosis and no cirrhosis.

        Hepatitis B surface Ag(+) patients will be treated with amivudine (3TC) or investigator's
        preferred antiviral regimen throughout protocol therapy and for 6-12 months thereafter.

          -  Neutrophils &gt;1000/uL platelets &gt; 100,000/uL

             with the potential for hyperviscosity syndrome requiring plasmapheresis). Patients are
             not considered to have a &quot;currently active&quot; malignancy if they have completed
             anti-cancer therapy, and are considered by their physician to be at less than 30% risk
             of relapse.

        Exclusion Criteria:
