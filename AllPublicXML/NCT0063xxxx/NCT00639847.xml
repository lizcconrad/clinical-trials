    <textblock>
      This study compared an in-home asthma management program provided by nurses or respiratory
      therapists to see if those receiving program had fewer hospitalizations, clinic and emergency
      room visits and higher levels of satisfaction and health related quality of life.

      Background: Disease management may improve outcomes and reduce cost. We compared an in-home
      asthma management program (AMP) delivered by respiratory therapists (RTs) or nurses (RNs) to
      standard care (SC) in 159 adults with moderate to severe asthma to determine the effect on
      health care utilization (HCU), patient satisfaction (PS) and health related quality of life
      (HRQOL).

      Methods: This single center, prospective trial randomized subjects, age 18-64, to three
      groups: SC, AMP-RT or AMP-RN. Outcomes at six-months were HCU, cost, pulmonary function,
      symptoms, environmental assessment, asthma self-management, HRQOL (SF-36; St. Georges
      Respiratory Questionnaire [SGRQ]) and PS. Frequencies were compared using chi 2; all other
      variables were compared using ANOVA with a post-hoc test.

The AMP included asthma education (medications use, monitoring, triggers, steps to manage asthma attacks), demonstration and training (peak flow meter use, MDI and nebulizer use, asthma diary), home environment assessment and suggestions for environmental changes (mattress covers, control of dust, pets, fumes, cleaning materials, cock roach control, etc.)</description>
