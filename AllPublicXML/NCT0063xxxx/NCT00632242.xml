    <textblock>
      ARC1779 Injection will be investigated in 4 cohorts of TTP patients as an uncontrolled,
      open-label study. Patients with vWD-2b will be enrolled in an additional cohort in a
      randomized, blinded, double-dummy, and placebo-controlled study.

      Collectively, patients representing 3 different vWF-related platelet function disorders: TTP
      in remission, acute TTP, and vWD-2b will be treated in a total of 5 cohorts. Three cohorts
      will consist of patients who are status post an episode of TTP (&quot;TTP Remission Cohorts&quot;) and
      will be treated with ARC1779 Injection in a dose- and duration-escalation design. In
      parallel, a single cohort of patients with acute TTP (&quot;Acute TTP Cohort&quot;) will be treated
      according to an individual patient titration-to-response paradigm. This cohort will be opened
      for enrollment at the beginning of the study and closed after all of the other cohorts are
      completed. Also in parallel, a single cohort of patients with vWD-2b (&quot;vWD-2b Cohort&quot;) will
      begin enrollment at the commencement of the study and continue independently of the course of
      the TTP Remission Cohorts. Up to 4 patients will be included in each of the TTP cohorts. The
      vWD-2b Cohort is expected to consist of up to 12 vWD-2b patients.
