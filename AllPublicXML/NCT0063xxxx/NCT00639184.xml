  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We plan to test a home-based parent-provided early developmental intervention (EI) both in
      infants with mild to moderate birth asphyxia and in infants without perinatal complications
      who will constitute a healthy comparison group in a randomized controlled trial. The trial
      will evaluate the effect of a resource-intensive early intervention (EI) program on the
      outcomes in infants born in rural communities in Zambia, India, and Pakistan. It will consist
      of frequent interaction (every 2 weeks the first year and every 4 weeks the second and third
      years) between parents and the parent trainer. The control group will receive enhanced health
      counseling (HC).

      The overall goal will be to implement and evaluate an EI program for infants following birth
      asphyxia, which is sustainable in developing countries. The challenge will be to adapt
      programs demonstrated to be effective in developed countries to the circumstances of the
      developing world, while reducing the demands on resources. Because there are limited data on
      normative development and EI programs in developing countries, a group of infants without
      perinatal complications will also be randomized to the same conditions in order to provide a
      comparison of what may be achieved from the intervention in healthy infants in developing
      countries. A final aim will be to address individual variation in EI effects that could be
      due to child and/or family characteristics.

      A randomized controlled experimental design will be used, in which infants who survive
      following birth asphyxia are randomly assigned to either EI or enhanced health education
      counseling (HC). The trial will randomize infants to a home-based parent-provided early
      developmental intervention (EI) with frequent home interaction between parents and parent
      trainers vs. HC. A group of infants without birth asphyxia or other major perinatal
      complications also will be randomized. Children will be examined by masked examiners at three
      time points (12, 24, and 36 month's assessments).
