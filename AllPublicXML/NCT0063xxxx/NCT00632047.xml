      RATIONALE: Health education programs and screening methods, such as clinical breast
      examination and examination of the cervix, may help reduce the number of women who develop
      breast cancer and cervical cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying the early detection of breast cancer and
      cervical cancer in women in India.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To investigate the effectiveness of well planned health education programs (HEP) and
           low-cost screening methods (e.g., clinical breast examination [CBE] and visual
           inspection of the cervix painted with 4% acetic acid [VIA]) in down-staging and reducing
           the incidence of and mortality due to breast and cervical cancer.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

        -  Arm I (intervention): Participants undergo intervention comprising health education
           programs (HEP), clinical breast examination (CBE), and visual inspection of the cervix
           painted with 4% acetic acid (VIA) every 2 years for up to 8 years. Participants also
           undergo active surveillance over 8 years.

        -  Arm II (control): Participants receive one HEP. Participants also undergo active
           surveillance over 8 years.
