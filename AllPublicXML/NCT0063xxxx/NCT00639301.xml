  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out about the quality of life and health in a group of
      adults who had retinoblastoma when they were children. By quality of life, we mean how you
      are feeling about being satisfied with things in your life, including your physical health,
      your emotional health, and your ability to carry out daily activities. We hope that this
      information will help us provide better care to future children with retinoblastoma and
      better follow-up care for survivors of retinoblastoma.
