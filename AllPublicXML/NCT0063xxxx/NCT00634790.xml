      The purpose of this study is to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of alprazolam
      extended release (XR) in adolescents with panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, or in
      anxiety disorder with panic attacks. Efficacy, population pharmacokinetics of alprazolam XR
      and the relationship between alprazolam XR plasma concentrations and efficacy outcomes will
      also be evaluated.

    <textblock>
      Due to recruitment difficulties in this adolescent population, the clinical program for
      alprazolam XR was cancelled and this study was terminated on 1 September 2004. There were no
      safety concerns that led to this decision.
