      The objective of this study is to assess if the implementation of a treatment algorithm
      including initial treatment with a low dose diuretic/ACE-inhibitor or ARB combination and
      subsequently a low dose DHP-CCB/statin combination will improve the management of
      hypertension/hypercholesterolemia compared to guidelines-base management at family practices.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Utilization of fixed dose combination therapy has been advocated as an adherence-enhancing
      strategy and has been so recommended in the 2007 Canadian Hypertension Education Program
      (CHEP) recommendations. Further, in a previous study (STITCH) it was demonstrated that a
      simplified treatment algorithm utilizing initial therapy with a low dose fixed-dose
      combination therapy improved blood pressure control in hypertensive patients. However, the
      effectiveness of either a simplified treatment algorithm or the initial use of fixed dose
      combination therapies for 2 risk factors in hypertensive dyslipidemic patients has yet to be
      determined. Therefore, the current study is designed to determine whether utilization of a
      fixed dose combination hypertension/hypercholesterolemia therapy results in improved
      adherence, patient satisfaction as well as improved rates of reaching target LDL cholesterol
      and blood pressure.
