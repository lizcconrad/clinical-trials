  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the rate of pathological complete response (pCR) to the sequential
      therapy of Doxil, paclitaxel, and cyclophosphamide with concurrent Avastin for patients with
      locally advanced invasive (T2,T3, Nany, M0) breast carcinoma. Also, the study will evaluate
      the clinical and subclinical cardiotoxic effect(s) of this regimen, assess how feasible and
      safe the study is. Survival without any progression of disease will also be calculated.

      A regimen of chemotherapy will be given to replicate the high rate of pCR seen with
      conventional chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced breast cancer. Doxil will
      substitute the normally given doxorubicin. It is expected that the low effect or minimal
      effect of Doxil on cardiac function will minimize any additional risk of cardiotoxicity from
      Avastin. It is expected that clinical and subclinical rates of cardiotoxicity will be very
      low at the total doses to be given in this clinical trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this trial, an attempt will be made to replicate the high rate of pathological complete
      response seen after conventional chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced breast
      cancer, using a regimen in which Doxil is substituted for conventional doxorubicin. We expect
      that the low or minimal effect on cardiac function produced by Doxil will minimize any
      additional risk of cardiotoxicity from Avastin. We will also measure left ventricular
      ejection fractions before and after treatment to see if the substantial rate of subclinical
      cardiotoxicity reported by Swain et al 5 and Perez et al 7 can be avoided. The reported rates
      of cardiotoxicity after treatment with relatively high doses of Doxil are substantially lower
      than those of doxorubicin; few data are available to estimate the rate of cardiotoxicity of
      Doxil in patients treated with only about 100 mg/m2 total accumulated dose, the dose to be
      utilized here. The drug has been used in a few patients in the primary systemic therapy
      setting, with no reported clinical cardiotoxicity.

      The expectation is that clinical and subclinical rates of cardiotoxicity will be very low or
      negligible at the total doses to be used here.
