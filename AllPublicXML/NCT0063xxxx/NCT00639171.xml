  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) is a novel imaging technique for noninvasive probing of
      biochemical properties of tissue. While MRS does not generate images of tumor per se it
      allows biochemical spectroscopic data to be obtained in vivo from user defined
      region-of-interest. In this manner, biochemical information elucidated by MRS can be
      interpreted in relation to detailed anatomy and images of metabolite distribution can be
      created. The aim of MRS is to identify presence and concentration of metabolites
      characteristic for normal and abnormal (tumor) cellular activities hence allow differential
      normal tissue from pathological tissue, as well as allow differentiating malignant from
      benign tumors.

      Recent in vivo studies have reported successful use of 1H and 31P MRS in differentiating
      between benign and malignant tumors in breast tissue. These studies demonstrated an increase
      in the choline metabolite peak that reflects an increase in choline-containing metabolites in
      70-80% of breast carcinomas, as compared to 14-18% of benign breast tumors.The objectives
      would be to determine sensitivity/specificity of MRS in the context of breast CA, We will use
      normal volunteers to test software and to develop and optimize MR scan sequences prior to or
      during the testing of target subjects with suspicious breast lesion.
