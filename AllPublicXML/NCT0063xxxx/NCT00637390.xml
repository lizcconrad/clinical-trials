  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ovarian cancer cannot grow without recruiting new blood vessels. Studies in humans have
      identified a novel cell population, termed vascular leukocytes (VLCs). While VLCs are not
      cancer cells, they support the growth of ovarian cancer cells by stimulating the growth of
      new blood vessels which provide the cancer with nutrients. VLCs make a protein termed CD52.
      An antibody therapeutic, Alemtuzumab (also know as Campath), that kills cells that make the
      CD52 protein has been successfully used to treat certain lymphomas (a type of blood cell
      cancer) that make CD52 protein. The purpose of this study is to determine if Alemtuzumab
      given subcutaneously (under the skin)can be safely given to patients with ovarian, fallopian,
      or primary peritoneal cancers to kill VLCs and determine if Alemtuzumab, by eliminating VLCs,
      can restrict tumor growth or increase response rates to chemotherapy given after the
      discontinuation of chemotherapy.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have a diagnosis of histologically confirmed ovarian, fallopian or
             primary peritoneal cancer that has progressed or recurred in the abdomen or pelvis
             after salvage chemotherapy as documented by either:

               1. Radiologic studies or

               2. Rising CA125 levels on two independent measurements. If the patient's CA125 has
                  fallen into a normal range, CA125 relapse will be defined as double the nadir
                  CA125. However, if the patients CA125 nadir had fallen to less than 10, then the
                  measurements documenting recurrence or progression must be greater than 20.

          2. There is no limit on prior courses of chemotherapy.

          3. Patients must have unidimensional measurable disease or elevated CA125

          4. Age greater than 18 years.

          5. ECOG performance status less tha 2 (Karnofsky 60%).

          6. Life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks.

          7. Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function

          8. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.
             All patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and must
             sign an informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines.

          9. Timing guideline for pre-study labs and measurements:

        All pre-study labs required for determination of eligibility are to be completed within 28
        days of treatment Day 1.

        X-rays and/or scans used for tumor measurement to determine disease status are to be
        completed within 28 days of treatment Day 1.

        Women of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with known immunosuppressive diseases are excluded from this trial due to the
             known immunosuppressive nature of Alemtuzumab therapy.

          2. Patients may not be receiving any other agents (investigational or otherwise) with
             therapeutic intent.

          3. Patients with prior malignancy, except for adequately treated basal cell (or squamous
             cell) skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer or other cancer for which the patient has
             been disease free for 2 years.

          4. Patients with a history of allergic reactions to Alemtuzumab or other humanized
             immunotherapeutics.

          5. Patients with unresolved bacterial, fungal, or viral infections requiring active
             treatment. Patients may be registered two weeks after the conclusion of antibiotic or
             anti-viral therapy.

          6. Patients with history of active CMV disease as Alemtuzumab therapy has been associated
             with CMV reactivation.
