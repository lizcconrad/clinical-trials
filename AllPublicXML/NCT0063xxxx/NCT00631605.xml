      in patients with eating disorder and their relationships with psychopathology of eating
      disorders (eating patterns, depression, and personality) in these patients.

      The study subjects include female patients with DSM-IV diagnosis of AN (n = 30), BN (n = 60)
      and age-controled normal subjects (n = 30). They will receive a clinical interview and are
      asked to complete several self-administered questionnaires which included eating-related
      questionnaires, general psychological functioning scales and personality scales. After
      overnight fast, each subject undergoes a blood sample collection for neuroendocrine
      examination, body composition examination using BIA method, basal metabolic rate measurement
      by indirect calorimetry, and ECG in the morning between 0800 and 0900. Clinical patients
      would be asked to repeat filling the self-rating scales, weight and body fat measurement, as
      well as blood drawing again 2 months after treatment.
