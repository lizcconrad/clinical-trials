  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over 1 billion people worldwide smoke, resulting in an estimated 4 million deaths annually
      from smoking-related disease.1 Persistent and long-term smoking leads to an increased risk of
      cardiovascular damage, respiratory disease, and a higher incidence of a variety of cancers;
      but for smokers who can quit there is an immediate and significant beneficial impact on their
      health and life expectancy. Cigarette smoking remains the leading preventable cause of death
      in the United States (US), accounting for approximately 1 of every 5 deaths (438,000 people)
      each year.

      This Phase 2 study will investigate the efficacy and tolerability of 2 doses of TA-NIC
      compared to placebo as an aid to smoking cessation in smokers who are motivated to quit.

  <detailed_description>

      This is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebocontrolled, 3-arm, Phase 2 study
      evaluating the efficacy and safety of TA-NIC as an aid for smoking cessation in smokers
      motivated to quit within 12 weeks. At the start of the study, each subject will set a Target
      Quit Date, which must be within 12 weeks after first injection. Each subject will receive 7
      injections (vaccinations) from Weeks 0 to 16. Subjects will be encouraged to follow a phased
      reduction in cigarette consumption leading up to the Target Quit Date. All vaccinated
      subjects will be offered a counseling session at each clinic visit and will be contacted by
      telephone at Weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 14, 18, and 21 to provide up to 10 minutes of support and
      counseling for their smoking cessation. Smoking cessation will be measured during a 4-week
      assessment period from Week 22 to Week 26. Smoking cessation will be defined as complete
      abstinence during this 4-week period. Subject follow-up will continue to Week 52.
