      The purposes of this study are to:

        1. determine if a rehabilitation program that consists of exercise and manual therapy
           reduces pain and improves quality of life in patients with shoulder subacromial
           impingement syndrome;

        2. determine which patients are likely to respond to this rehabilitation program and which
           patients are not likely to respond to this rehabilitation program

      The hypotheses are:

        1. the rehabilitation treatment program will result in significant changes in pain and
           quality of life

        2. there will be items from the history and examination that will identify those patients
           who respond favorably and those who do not respond favorably to rehabilitation at 6
           weeks, 3, 6 and 12 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subacromial impingement syndrome (SAIS) is the most frequent cause of shoulder pain. A
      variety of non-surgical treatments have been advocated to correct the impairments associated
      with SAIS. Clinical trials support the use of therapeutic exercise and joint mobilizations to
      improve pain and functional disability associated with SAIS. However, not all patients in
      these trials had a favorable outcome. Moreover, the effect sizes in these trials were small
      to moderate. Thus the purposes of this study are to 1. determine the effect of a multi-modal
      rehabilitation program consisting of strengthening, stretching, manual therapy to the
      shoulder and spine, patient education, posture, and functional re-training; and 2. identify
      those patients who are and who are not likely to respond to rehabilitation at the start of
      care.
