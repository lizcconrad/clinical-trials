  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized double-blind clinical trial is to determine the effectiveness
      of manual therapy for patients with subacromial impingement syndrome of the shoulder. We
      hypothesize that a combination of therapeutic exercise and manual therapy to the shoulder and
      spine will be more effective in reducing pain and shoulder disability at short-term (6 wk)
      and long-term (3, 6, 12 months) as compared to therapeutic exercise only.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subacromial impingement syndrome (SAIS) is a frequent cause of shoulder pain. Clinical trials
      investigating the effectiveness of manual therapy have demonstrated improvements in outcomes
      when manual therapy has been added to a program of therapeutic exercise. However, the these
      clinical trials (3) have significant limitations and generalizability. Two of the three 3
      trials had a small number of subjects (14 &amp; 22 subjects) and all 3 trials had only short term
      follow up (&lt;12 weeks) and used non-validated self report outcome measures. These limitations
      reduce the confidence with which clinicians can apply these results to the patients they
      treat with SAIS. Clear evidence is needed to justify the cost and clinician time required to
      perform manual therapy in the delivery of patient care. Therefore, the purpose of this
      randomized clinical trial is to examine the short-term and long-term effectiveness of manual
      therapy in addition to therapeutic exercise as compared to therapeutic exercise only in
      patients diagnosed with SAIS.
