  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare:

        1. The degree of systemic postoperative inflammation (cytokine measurement) with the degree
           of post-operative pain

        2. The degree of pain and nausea and

        3. The pre and post operative pulmonary functions

      following Video Assisted Thorascopic Surgery (VATS) performed under general anesthesia with
      the addition of intra-operative single-injection paravertebral blockade vs general anesthesia
      with a sham intra-operative paravertebral nerve blockade

  <detailed_description>

      -  Enrolled subjects scheduled to undergo video-assisted thorascopic surgery (VATS) will be
           randomized to receive either paravertebral block or placebo(adhesive bandage applied at
           the site).

        -  All patients will undergo a standardized general anesthetic regimen.

        -  Human biological specimens will be collected preoperatively, postoperatively (in the
           PACU) at the first morning blood draw of POD 1, POD 2, POD 3, and POD 10-14 (follow-up
           visit at surgeons office)and analyzed for CRP, Cortisol &amp; inflammatory markers
           (IL-1beta,IL-2,IL-4,IL-5,IL-6, IL-8, IL-10,INF-gamma, TNF-alpha)

        -  Pulmonary functions (FEV1/FEV6) will be performed in the pre-op holding area prior to
           sedation and post-operatively on the morning of post-op day 1.

        -  Pain levels will be assessed with the Wong-Baker Faces and Visual Analog Scale
           pre-operatively in the PACU and hourly for a total of 6 hours and then every 8 hrs.and
           with patient self-report in diary after discharge.

        -  Pain levels will be assessed with the McGill-Melzack Pain Questionnaire pre-operatively,
           the evening of POD1-POD3 and by patient self-report in diary after discharge.

        -  Nausea assessments will occur at arrival on floor and every 8 hours thereafter until
           discharge.

        -  Narcotic requirements will be collected daily in the hospital and by patient self report
           in diary thereafter.
