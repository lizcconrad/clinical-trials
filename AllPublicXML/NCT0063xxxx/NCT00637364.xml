  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized, single-center, therapeutic trial in patients with AJCC
      Stage III or IV pancreatic cancer with tumor related abdominal and/or back pain to evaluate
      the safety of high intensity focused ultrasound therapy using the FEP-BY02 HIFU system for
      palliation of pancreatic cancer-related pain. Patients meeting all eligibility criteria
      without any exclusion criteria will be offered an opportunity to participate in the study.
      After obtaining informed consent a baseline history, physical examination, laboratory
      studies, and any additional imaging studies needed will be performed.

      The major theoretic risk to the patient with this procedure is the development of acute
      pancreatitis. If acute pancreatitis were to develop, it should become clinically evident by
      day 3 following HIFU ablation. Therefore, the initial phase of this pilot study is designed
      to allow a sufficient interval between HIFU treatments to identify whether this theoretic
      risk will manifest clinically. Previous clinical experience in China suggests that HIFU of
      pancreatic tumors is safe without risk of developing severe acute pancreatitis.

      Patients treated with HIFU will have approximately 15-20% of the tumor volume treated per
      session. The first 5 patients (feasibility study) will receive their first HIFU treatment
      followed by a 3-5 day interval for observation.

      Following the feasibility study the results will be reviewed with the FDA. If no serious
      adverse events are encountered, and the FDA agrees with continuing the study, then the next 5
      patients will be treated with an interval of 2-3 days between each treatment. If no serious
      adverse events are encountered in this group, then the next group of 5 patients will be
      treated at intervals of 1-2 days between each treatment.

    <description>The FEP-BY02 HIFU system uses extracorporeal generated high intensity ultrasound, focused on a tumor region of interest, to ablate tissue. A stand-alone B-mode ultrasound is used to locate and define the tumor region of interest. Once defined, the acoustic energy is delivered using a large aperture; fixed focus; sparse transducer array. The concentration of acoustic energy may result in thermal and/or mechanical bioeffects including tissue necrosis, apoptosis, and/or disruption (temporary or permanent) of normal cellular function within the targeted volume (such as nerve conduction).
The FEP-BY02 High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) system is intended to ablate ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas with ultrasound-guided targeted delivery of focused ultrasound energy to effect thermal and/or mechanical bioeffects leading to ablation (destruction) of the targeted tumor tissue.</description>
