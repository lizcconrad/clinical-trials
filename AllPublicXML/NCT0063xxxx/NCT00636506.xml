  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the American Medical System's IPP 2005 inflatable
      penile prosthesis implant in subjects receiving the implant for erectile dysfunction for ease
      of patient operability and use, as well as ease of surgery for the physician.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Erectile dysfunction, the inability to attain or sustain a penile erection sufficient to
      permit satisfactory sexual intercourse, affects an estimated ten to 30 million men in the
      United States. Erectile dysfunction can be caused by many organic abnormalities, including
      diabetes mellitus, hypertension, vascular disease, neurogenic disorders, and other chronic
      diseases. Erectile dysfunction can be effectively treated with a variety of methods,
      including the implantation of an inflatable penile prosthesis. A multi-center trial is to be
      conducted to assess the AMS IPP 2002 Inflatable Penile Prosthesis including handling during
      IPP implantation procedures and short-term follow-up experience of subjects. The study will
      collect pre-operative information comparing the pump operation using scrotal models of the
      current pump with the study pump, and baseline erectile function history. Surgical data will
      be collected to assess device design and procedure enhancements. Patient and physician
      assessment of study device function, ease of use, ease of training/learning, and adverse
      events will be gathered post-operatively.
