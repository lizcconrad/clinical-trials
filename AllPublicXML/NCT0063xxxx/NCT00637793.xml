      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of NGX267 in the improvement of
      decreased salivary flow associated with primary or secondary Sjögren's syndrome.

      For each patient, the study includes four periods of treatment separated by a washout period
      that may range from 4 - 8 days according to patient and site discretion. Each treatment
      period includes two overnight stays in the clinic. One dose of study drug is taken during
      each treatment period
