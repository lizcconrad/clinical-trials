      Purpose:

      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of AD 923 to the most widely
      used current treatment (MSIR) in the management of target BTP in subjects with malignancies
      who are taking a stable dose of background opioids. The efficacy evaluation criteria have
      been designed to determine whether AD 923 provides superior analgesia compared with MSIR as
      measured by the primary endpoint.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Termination is due to a combination of a device defect potentially impacting the quality of the
    AD 923 IMP and a major change in corporate strategy.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Main Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject is a male or female, at least 18 years of age.

          -  The subject has a malignancy, is receiving opioid therapy for his or her underlying
             persistent cancer pain, and is tolerant to the opioid therapy.

          -  The subject typically has 2 to 6 episodes of target BTP per day that require
             treatment.

          -  The subject has a life expectancy of &gt;3 months.

          -  The subject or his or her caregiver has easy, reliable access to a telephone.

        Main Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject is a female who is pregnant or lactating.

          -  The subject has any respiratory or cardiac condition that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, may be clinically worsened by opioids.

          -  The subject has any allergy to the AD 923 product or excipients, namely: fentanyl,
             dehydrated alcohol, menthol, saccharin, and citrate buffer; or to the MSIR product
             excipients, namely: morphine sulphate, lactose (anhydrous), pregelatinized maize
             starch, povidone, purified water, magnesium stearate, talc, and tablet coatings.

          -  The subject has any neurological or psychiatric disease that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, would compromise data collection.

          -  The subject has uncontrolled or rapidly escalating pain.

          -  The subject has any significant laboratory test results that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, will compromise subject safety or the conduct of the study.

          -  The subject has plans to undergo chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or surgery during the
             treatment period. The exception is that subjects may continue chemotherapy over the
             study period, provided it is not expected to alter the pain state or response to pain
             medication.
