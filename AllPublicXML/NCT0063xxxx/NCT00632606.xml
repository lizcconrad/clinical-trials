      The study will compare effectiveness of intravenous magnesium sulfate to that of intravenous
      metoclopramide (Reglan®) for acute headache in pregnant women. We will randomize pregnant
      women who present to our emergency department with chief complaint of headache to magnesium
      sulfate 2 grams intravenously or metoclopramide 10 mg intravenously; both groups will receive
      acetaminophen (Tylenol®) 1 gram orally and normal saline 1 liter intravenously. Headaches are
      common during pregnancy, related to hormonal changes, altered sleep patterns and psychosocial
      stressors. Common medications for headache such as non-steroidal antiinflammatories or
      triptans are typically avoided during pregnancy due to concern for fetal effects. Women, and
      their physicians, are often uncertain regarding available medication options with justifiable
      safety profiles during pregnancy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Metoclopramide and prochlorperazine (Compazine®), antiemetic dopamine receptor antagonists,
      are widely used for headache treatment in North American emergency departments.
      Metoclopramide, FDA pregnancy category B, is used in clinical practice for acute headache in
      pregnant women. Small studies have found magnesium sulfate to be effective in migraine,
      tension and cluster headaches, although there is no data regarding efficacy or tolerability
      in pregnant women.

      Our study would be similar to a Turkish study published in 2004 which compared magnesium
      sulfate to metoclopramide for acute headache treatment in nonpregnant individuals; they found
      the drugs equally effective 30 minutes after administration. Serum magnesium levels in
      pregnant women are often lower than in nonpregnant women; magnesium deficiency has been
      explored as contributing to headache frequency and severity. Magnesium sulfate use has been
      well established during pregnancy for decades, administered intravenously to delay labor or
      to women with preeclampsia for 24 to 48 hours, initially with 4 to 6 gram bolus then 2 grams
      per hour. For headache treatment, magnesium sulfate dose would be far lower, 2 grams. We
      would like to determine the efficacy and tolerability of magnesium sulfate for headache
      relief in pregnant women, as well as evaluate efficacy of metoclopramide in pregnant women.
      We do not find published randomized trials evaluating headache treatment in pregnant women.
