    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of this study is to learn if Zoledronic Acid can prevent or reduce pain in
      sickle cell disease. The goal of this study is to learn about the safety of Zoledronic Acid
      in persons with sickle cell disease who experience chronic pain requiring medical treatment
      or use of narcotics.
