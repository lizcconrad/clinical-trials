      Primary Objective:

      -To examine the association between self-rated spirituality/religiosity and coping strategies
      (Brief RCOPE, Brief COPE, SBI-15R) among palliative care patients.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To examine the associations between self-rated spirituality/religiosity and physical
           (ESAS) and psychological symptom reports (HADS), and quality of life (FACIT-sp) among
           palliative care patients.

        -  To examine the association between patient's self-reported spirituality/religiosity, and
           primary caregiver distress (HADS, PSQI, CQLS-C, caregiver self-assessment questionnaire,
           FACIT-sp).

        -  To determine the frequency (self-rated spiritual pain scale when score is more or equal
           than 1 in the scale 0 to 10) and intensity of self-rated spiritual pain in the
           palliative care setting and to explore the association between spiritual pain, and
           negative religious coping (Brief RCOPE), physical (ESAS) and psychological symptoms
           (HADS), and primary caregiver distress (CQLS-C, caregiver self-assessment
           questionnaire).

        -  To examine the association between primary caregivers' spirituality/religiosity
           (Appendix H, first question), religious coping strategies (Brief-RCOPE) and
           psychological and family/caregiver distress (HADS, PSQI, CQLS-C, caregiver
           self-assessment questionnaire), and caregivers' spiritual pain (Appendix F, second
           question).

      Questionnaires:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study and you agree to take part, you
      will complete 9 questionnaires.

      The first 2 questionnaires ask about your demographic information (such as your education
      level and age) and the symptoms of cancer you may be experiencing.

      The 6 other questionnaires ask questions about several subjects. You will be asked about your
      religious/spiritual beliefs, such as your way of coping with cancer and whether you have
      focused on religion/spirituality or other strategies in order to stop worrying. You will also
      be asked whether you feel religious/spiritual beliefs are important in your everyday life,
      how hopeful you may feel, and the level of spiritual pain you may feel. (Some people
      experience spiritual pain as a deep pain in the &quot;soul&quot; or &quot;being&quot; that is not physical pain.)

      The last questionnaire asks about any symptoms of anxiety or depression you may feel. In
      total, these questionnaires should take about 40 minutes to complete.

      Length of Study Participation:

      After completing the questionnaires, your participation in this study will be over.

      This is an investigational study. Up to 100 patients and 100 caregivers will take part in
      this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.
