  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol will examine whether the enzyme alpha-L-iduronidase (Laronidase), delivered
      into the spinal fluid of patients with Hurler syndrome at intervals before and after bone
      marrow transplant, is a safe and effective approach to slow the neurologic degeneration seen
      in Hurler patients undergoing transplantation.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will receive an infusion of Laronidase into his/her spinal fluid approximately 12
      weeks before, 2 weeks before, 100 days after and 6 months after transplant. This procedure is
      done by lumbar puncture (also called a &quot;spinal tap&quot;).

    <description>Laronidase belongs to a class of drugs called enzyme replacement therapies or ERT that provides people with sufficient quantities of an important enzyme that they cannot create on their own. The main ingredient in laronidase is a protein that is identical to a naturally occurring form of the human enzyme alpha-L-iduronidase. Laronidase replaces the missing enzyme alpha-L-iduronidase and restores sufficient enzyme activity to break down GAG buildup.
Subjects will receive an infusion of Laronidase into his/her spinal fluid approximately 12 weeks before, 2 weeks before, 100 days after and 6 months after transplant. This procedure is done by lumbar puncture</description>
