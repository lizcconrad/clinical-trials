      CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Myofascial syndrome is the most frequent condition of chronic pain.
      The objective of the present study was to compare the analgesic action of acupuncture and
      trigger point injection combined with cyclobenzaprine and dipyrone.

      DESIGN AND SETTING: A randomized study was performed at the Pain Clinic. METHODS: Thirty
      patients were divided into two groups: G1 received trigger point injection of 0.25%
      bupivacaine (1 ml/point) twice a week, 10 mg/day cyclobenzaprine and 500 mg dipyrone every 8
      h. G2 was submitted to classical and trigger point acupuncture twice a week. The patients
      were asked to continue physical exercise. The following parameters were evaluated: pain
      intensity rated on a numerical and verbal scale, quality of life before and four weeks after
      treatment, and quality of analgesia.

      Among the 39 patients selected, nine (3 in group 1 and 6 in group 2) were excluded from the
      study because they did not attend the visits scheduled for the procedures and assessment or
      because they did not respond to the questionnaires.
