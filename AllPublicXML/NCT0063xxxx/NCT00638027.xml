      Participants (n=20) will be identified at routine care visits performed at the Rochester
      Multiple Sclerosis Center. Eligible participants will have MS by McDonald Criteria,7 and will
      have a modified Ashworth spasticity rating8 of two or higher in at least one lower extremity
      muscle group. Participants will be seen at screening, one, and three months, and will be
      evaluated using the modified Ashworth scale,8 pendulum test,9 toe tapping test,10 manual
      muscle testing,11 timed 25 foot walk,12 and Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite.13 The
      type and severity of any adverse events will be recorded using standard definitions.
      Participants will be instructed to call between visits to inform the investigators regarding
      any adverse events they experience. Follow-up will continue until all adverse events resolve
      or stabilize.

      This is a randomized, placebo controlled, double-blind, parallel group trial of memantine in
      patients with MS and spasticity. Participants will be identified at routine care visits at
      the Rochester Multiple Sclerosis Center. After obtaining informed consent, patients will
      undergo screening, which will include a physical/neurologic exam and an assessment of the
      Expanded Disability Status Scale, spasticity, and functional abilities. Eligible patients
      will return for a baseline evaluation, will initiate their randomly assigned study
      medication, and will return after one and three months for re-evaluation. The type and
      severity of any adverse events will be recorded using standard definitions. Participants will
      be instructed to call between visits to inform the investigators regarding any adverse events
      they experience. Follow-up will continue until all adverse events resolve or stabilize.

    <measure>Difference in Ashworth Spasticity Scale Score Between Baseline and 12 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>spasticity scale score: the most common used tool to measure the degree of spasticity of the lower extremities.
Score: Degree of Muscle Tone 0: no increase in tone
slight increase in tone 1+: slight increase in tone, manifested by a catch, followed by minimal resistance throughout the remainder (less than half) of the range of motion.
more marked increase in muscle tone through most of the range of movement, but affected part(s) easily moved.
considerable increase in muscle tone, passive movement difficult.
affected part(s) rigid in flexion or extension.</description>

    <measure>Difference in the Multiple Sclerosis Spacticy Scale (MSSS-88) Between Baseline and 12 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Multiple Sclerosis Spacticy Scale (MSSS-88) is a patient reported questionnaire rating scale to quantify the perspectives of the impact of spasticity on people with multiple sclerosis.
Scoring: Individual items are scored on a 4 point Likert scale: 1 (Not bothered at all), 2 (a little bothered), 3 (moderately bothered), 4 (extremely bothered).This questionnaire asks how bothered you have been by your spasticity in the past two weeks. By spasticity we mean muscle stiffness and spasms.The MSSS-88 is a reliable and valid, patient-based, interval-level measure of the impact of spasticity in multiple sclerosis. Scores were summed, without weighting or standardization, to generate ordinal-level total scores just as any other Likert-type scale. Missing responses to items can be replaced with the mean score of the items completed (person-specific item mean score) provided that 50% or more of the items in a scale have been completed. The range is 8-32 and higher scores mean poorer outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) Score Between Baseline and Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>9-Hole Peg Test (9-HPT) is a quantitative measure of upper extremity function. Timed 25-Foot Walk (T 25 FW) is a quantitative measure of lower extremity function. The patient is instructed to walk 25 feet as quickly as possible, but safely.
Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test-3 seconds (PASAT-3) is a measure of cognitive function that assesses auditory information processing speed and flexibility, as well as calculation ability.
The MSFC is based on the concept that scores for these 3 dimensions—arm, leg, and cognitive function are combined to create a single score that can be used to detect change over time in a group of MS patients. This is done by creating Z-scores for each component of the MSFC. Implicit in this approach is the idea that patients who deteriorate or improve on all 3 component measures will have an overall larger change than patients who change on only 1 of the 3 measures. The MSFC score was transformed to z-scores, with higher scores indicating better outcome.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Multiple sclerosis by McDonald Criteria.

          2. Spasticity. A minimum score of two on the Ashworth spasticity scale in at least one
             lower extremity muscle group and a total score of at least four in the lower extremity
             muscles tested.

          3. Age 18-70.

          4. Normal renal function (estimated CrCl &gt; 50 ml/min).

             provide informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Evidence of clinically significant thyroid, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic,
             renal, hematologic, respiratory, neoplastic, endocrine (including diabetes mellitus),
             neurologic (other than MS), or other medical or psychiatric disorder at screening.

          2. Women must not be pregnant or lactating. Serum or urine pregnancy tests will be
             required prior to randomization for women of childbearing potential unless the last

        <title>Difference in the Multiple Sclerosis Spacticy Scale (MSSS-88) Between Baseline and 12 Weeks</title>
        <description>Multiple Sclerosis Spacticy Scale (MSSS-88) is a patient reported questionnaire rating scale to quantify the perspectives of the impact of spasticity on people with multiple sclerosis.
Scoring: Individual items are scored on a 4 point Likert scale: 1 (Not bothered at all), 2 (a little bothered), 3 (moderately bothered), 4 (extremely bothered).This questionnaire asks how bothered you have been by your spasticity in the past two weeks. By spasticity we mean muscle stiffness and spasms.The MSSS-88 is a reliable and valid, patient-based, interval-level measure of the impact of spasticity in multiple sclerosis. Scores were summed, without weighting or standardization, to generate ordinal-level total scores just as any other Likert-type scale. Missing responses to items can be replaced with the mean score of the items completed (person-specific item mean score) provided that 50% or more of the items in a scale have been completed. The range is 8-32 and higher scores mean poorer outcome.</description>

        <title>Change in Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) Score Between Baseline and Week 12</title>
        <description>9-Hole Peg Test (9-HPT) is a quantitative measure of upper extremity function. Timed 25-Foot Walk (T 25 FW) is a quantitative measure of lower extremity function. The patient is instructed to walk 25 feet as quickly as possible, but safely.
Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test-3 seconds (PASAT-3) is a measure of cognitive function that assesses auditory information processing speed and flexibility, as well as calculation ability.
The MSFC is based on the concept that scores for these 3 dimensions—arm, leg, and cognitive function are combined to create a single score that can be used to detect change over time in a group of MS patients. This is done by creating Z-scores for each component of the MSFC. Implicit in this approach is the idea that patients who deteriorate or improve on all 3 component measures will have an overall larger change than patients who change on only 1 of the 3 measures. The MSFC score was transformed to z-scores, with higher scores indicating better outcome.</description>
