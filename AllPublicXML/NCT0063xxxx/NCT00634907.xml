  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several human genes affect how medications are metabolized by the body. It is believed that
      knowledge of variations of these genes can help health care providers better manage an
      anticoagulation medicine called warfarin (Coumadin®)and as a result decrease patient problems
      with bleeding or the development of blood clots. This study was designed to evaluate if
      genetic testing can improve warfarin initiation better than usual care.

          <title>2 Genotype Arm</title>
          <description>The initial dose of warfarin will be corrected by the AC services team to account for variant genotypes, according to the following:
Sqrt (Dose) = 0.628 - 0.0135(Age) - 0.240(CYP2C9*2) - 0.370 (CYP2C9*3) - 0.241(VKORC1) + 0.0162(Height) Age: input age in years CYP2C9: input 0, 1, or 2 based on the number of variant alleles VKORC1: input 1 for GG, 2 for GA, and 3 for AA Height: input height in centimeters Patients in this study group will be managed by designated AC services physicians, different from those in managing patients in the Control Arm of this study. Dosing adjustments will be made based on post-surgical INR values obtained initially on POD#2 daily during hospital stay, and 2 times weekly, or as needed, thereafter.</description>

        <group group_id="P2">
          <title>1 Control Arm</title>
          <description>This is a two-armed parallel study with randomized assignment designed to test the hypothesis that selection of the initial warfarin dose based on CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotypes will improve warfarin pharmacotherapy outcomes. Initial dose of warfarin will be given as per standard protocol for the Control Arm. Briefly, 3 or 5 mg warfarin will be administered on the day of surgery (post-operative day zero, POD#0) and the subsequent day. Patients in this study group will be managed by designated AC services physicians. Dosing adjustments will be made based on post-surgical INR values obtained initially on POD#2, daily during hospital stay, and 2 times weekly, or as needed, thereafter.</description>
