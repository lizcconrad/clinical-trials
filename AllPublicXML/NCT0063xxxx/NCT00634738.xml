  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In carpal tunnel syndrome,trigger points are often found in the biceps muscle,in the
      aponeurosis of the biceps and in the pronator teres muscle.

      We hypothesise that by eliminating these trigger points,using ischemic compressions, may
      diminish the symptoms.

      Using one thumb on the other,the pressure is applied 10 seconds on each TrPs.The treatment is
