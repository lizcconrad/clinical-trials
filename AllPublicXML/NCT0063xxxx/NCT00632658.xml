  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease (cGVHD) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in
      patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. cGVHD usually occurs after 100
      days following transplantation and develops in 20-60% of transplant recipients. The incidence
      of cGVHD varies depending on the age of the marrow recipient, the use of sibling or unrealted
      donor bone marrow, teh use of unmanipulated T cell-depleted bone marrow, and perhaps other
      factors. Clinically, cGVHD is characterized by multi-system disease, which frequently mimics
      the clinical features of autoimmune diseases. The manifestations include skin changes
      (lichenoid and sclerodermatous changes, changes in pigmentation, loss of accessory structures
      such as hair, dystrophic nails, and rash), joint contractures, severe cramping, hepatic
      dysfunctions, sicca syndrome, obstructive lung disease, esophageal dysmotility, weight loss,
      polyserositis, immunodeficiency, and autoantibodies including anti-nuclear antibody,
      anti-erythrocyte antibodies, and anti-platelet antibodies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A large number of children with cGVHD have to deal with many years of a disfiguring and
      painful chronic illness with the side effects of long term steroid use. The number of stem
      cell transplants done in children is only growing given that we are now transplanting
      patients with a variety of nonmalignant disorders and given the use of alternative donor
      sources. The broad categories of limited and extensive cGVHD are recognized by clinicans, but
      are not particularly useful in clinical practice. Since cGVHD may involve almost every organ
      system adn since cGVHD constitutes a waxing and waning nature, cGVHD makes clinical
      management very difficult and complicated. Currently, there is a symptoms scale used in the
      adult population for measuring symptom burden for adults with cGVHD. This scale is called the
      &quot;Lee Symptoms Scale&quot;. The purpose of this project is to develop a scale that is similar in
      design to the Lee Scale, but it is specifically designed to measure the burden of cGVHD in
      the pediatric population

        Patients with cGVHD will be identified by their local physican and asked to participate in
        this research study. A total of 24 children will be asked to participate in this study. The
        parents of all of the 24 children will also be asked to participate and give us their
        feed-back on what it is like to cope with a child with cGVHD.
