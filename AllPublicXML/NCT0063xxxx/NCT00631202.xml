  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Friedreich's ataxia is a rare genetic disorder characterized by severe neurological
      disability and cardiomyopathy. Friedreich's ataxia is the consequence of frataxin deficiency.
      Although several drugs have been proposed, there is no available treatment. It was recently
      demonstrated that erythropoietin can increase the intracellular levels of frataxin in an
      in-vitro model.

      The present project is aimed at testing the possible therapeutic approach of erythropoietin,
      which is an already available and commercialized drug. The investigators will perform both
      in-vitro and in-vivo tests, in order to asses its efficacy and safety in patients. The
      results will be useful to plan further clinical trials.

      Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is an inherited recessive disorder characterized by progressive
      neurological disability. FRDA is the consequence of frataxin deficiency. Although several
      drugs have been proposed for FRDA, there is no available treatment. Recently it was shown
      that recombinant human erythropoietin (rhu-EPO) administration increases frataxin expression
      in cultured human lymphocytes of FRDA patients. It is therefore of primary importance to test
      extensively rhu-EPO's ability in increasing frataxin levels in-vitro and in-vivo. In addition
      rhu-EPO is an already available and commercialized drug approved for the treatment of anaemia
      associated with chronic renal disease, heart failure and cancer. Towards this overall
      purpose, we will perform an acute clinical trial in FRDA patients with rhu-EPO and will
      assess its effect in-vivo on frataxin expression. In addition, rhu-EPO's safety in FRDA
      patients based on laboratory parameters and neurological indexes will be tested. The results
      will be useful to gain new insight in the role of rhu-EPO in FRDA, and in the future, it may
      be useful to plan further clinical trials.

    <description>Patients that will satisfy all inclusion/exclusion criteria will be sequentially treated with three single Epoetin alfa administrations. The first time the dose will be 600U/KG BW s.c. in a single administration. The outcome measures will be assessed. A washout period of 1 month will be necessary to eliminate any carry-over effect. A second administration of 1200U/KG BW s.c. will be performed. Outcome measures will be again assessed.</description>
