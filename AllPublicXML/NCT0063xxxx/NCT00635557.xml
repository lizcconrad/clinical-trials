    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, dose finding, multiple-dose study in subjects with recurring/relapsing
      glioblastoma multiforme. Three dose levels of MPC-6827 will be administered with carboplatin
      to three separate cohorts. Study endpoints will include determination of the maximum
      tolerated dose, dose limiting toxicities, and evaluation of evidence of anti-tumor activity
      of MPC-6827 when given with carboplatin.
