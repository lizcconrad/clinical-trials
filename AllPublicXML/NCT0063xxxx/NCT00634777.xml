  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) may benefit from
      organ-preservation treatment based on combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy without
      compromising disease-free and overall survival. In patients with initially advanced regional
      disease, there is controversy about the place of routine planned lymph node neck dissection
      after chemoradiotherapy, especially in responding patients without clinically invaded
      residual lymph nodes. There is uncertainty about the lymph nodes status after chemoradiation
      because the structural imaging modalities (CT, MRI) lack sensitivity and specificity : small
      positive lymph nodes are not detected, and residual large lymph nodes can be sterilized ( &quot;
      ghosts nodes &quot; with no sign of viable tumor cells at histopathology). Despite the absence of
      evidence based on prospective study, in numerous institutions currently, head and neck
      surgeons are quite reluctant to operate on for neck dissection patients with a complete
      clinical and radiological response following chemoradiation.

      Metabolic imaging of tumors using PET and the glucose analog FDG has proven effective in head
      and neck SCC, especially after treatment to differentiate disease progression from
      radiation-induced inflammation.1 Several studies have shown that the metabolic response could
      predict the presence or absence of residual tumor cells in the primary tumor as well as the
      probability of relapse .2-4 Conflicting results have been reported on the use of PET to
      predict the pathological nodal status after chemoradiation, with negative predictive values
      ranging from 14 % to 100 %.5,6 Discrepancies observed might be due to the fact that PET was
      performed at variable time points after the end of radiotherapy. Ideally, PET should be
      performed as late as possible so that tumor regrowth can begin and become detectable,
      increasing the sensitivity of the procedure.

      - The primary objective is to assess the negative predictive value (NPV) of PET as a single
      examination in correctly predicting the absence of remaining invaded lymph nodes after
      chemoradiotherapy for advanced HNSCC.

      Secondary objectives include :

        -  The evaluation of the suitability of a wait and see approach without neck dissection in
           patients considered as complete responders ( based on clinical evaluation and imaging
           assessment including PET : all these diagnosis tools should be negative to consider a
           patient as a complete responder); this suitability will be estimated using the negative
           predictive value of the overall assessment of a complete response including PET-FDG but
           also the clinical evaluation and imaging.

        -  The evaluation of the ability of PET-FDG to correctly predict remaining pathologically
           invaded lymph nodes (PPV) after chemoradiotherapy for advanced HNSCC in patients with a
           postchemoradiation positive PET a (and who will therefore be considered with less than a
           complete regional or locoregional response and who will undergo at least neck
           dissection.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Biopsy-proven HNSCC

          -  Clinical stage: unpreviously treated T1-T4 oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx,
             larynx

          -  Only patients suitable for at least a neck dissection after chemoradiotherapy will be
             included. Consequently, inclusion criteria are thus : T1-T4 , N1 N2a, N2b N2c N3 M0.

          -  Patient scheduled for an organ preservation treatment protocol based on concomitant
             chemoradiation (induction chemotherapy is allowed if this approach is followed by
             concomitant chemoradiation)
