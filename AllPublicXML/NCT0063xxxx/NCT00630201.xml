  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Buprenorphine (BPN) is an approved treatment for opioid dependence; however, in taking oral
      tablets, patients experience withdrawal and cravings when the variable BPN levels in the
      blood are low. Probuphine (buprenorphine implant) is an implant placed just beneath the skin
      that contains BPN. It is designed to provide 6 months of stable BPN blood levels. This study
      will test the safety and efficacy of Probuphine in the treatment of patient with opioid
      dependence. Patients who have completed 24 weeks of treatment in the Randomized,
      Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Multi-Center Study of Probuphine in Patients with Opioid
      Dependence, will be re-treated with Probuphine over an additional 24 weeks.
