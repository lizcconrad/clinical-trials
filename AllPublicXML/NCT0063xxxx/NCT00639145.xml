  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if antiretroviral drugs are safe and well tolerated
      by HIV-positive pregnant women and their infants in South Africa and Zambia.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although the use of HAART in pregnancy has significantly reduced rates of vertical
      transmission of HIV-1, some questions remain regarding the safety of these therapies and
      their potential impact on the uninfected infant.

      The overall goal of the project is to establish a voluntary exposure-registry and perform
      observational surveillance on HIV - positive pregnant women who are exposed to antiretroviral
      products during the prenatal period, in order to evaluate the outcome of the pregnancy and
      safety of the products in HIV-positive pregnant women, and their infants.
