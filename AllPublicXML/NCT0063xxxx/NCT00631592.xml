  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible physician, based on a medical evaluation
             including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and cardiac
             monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters outside the
             reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the
             Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to
             introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.

          -  Male or female between 18 and 50 years of age.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of non-childbearing potential
             (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant) including any female who:

               -  Is pre-menopausal with a documented bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral
                  oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries) or hysterectomy, or

               -  Is post-menopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea. A follicle
                  stimulating hormone (FSH) level will be performed to confirm a post-menopausal
                  status. For this study, FSH levels &gt; 40 mlU/ml is confirmatory. Females on
                  hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt, HRT
                  should be discontinued for 2 weeks and then the subject rescreened, as HRT can
                  suppress FSH.

          -  Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in protocol.
             This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study medication
             until 14 days after the last dose of study medication.

          -  Body weight &gt;/ 50 kg for men and &gt;/ 45 kg for women and BMI within the range 18.5-31.0
             kg/m2 (inclusive).

          -  Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has a positive pre-study drug/alcohol screen. A minimum list of drugs that
             will be screened for include amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, opiates,
             cannabinoids and benzodiazepines.

          -  A positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody
             result within 3 months of screening.

          -  A positive test for HIV antibody.

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as:

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary
             supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a
             potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first
             dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical
             Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise
             subject safety.

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period.

          -  Pregnant females as determined by positive serum or urine hCG test at screening or
             prior to dosing.

          -  Lactating females.

          -  Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures outlined in the protocol.

          -  If heparin is used during PK sampling, subjects with a history of sensitivity to
             heparin or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia should not be enrolled.

          -  Has a history or regular use of tobacco- or nicotine-containing products within 3
             months prior to screening.

          -  Consumption of red wine, seville oranges, grapefruit or grapefruit juice from 7 days
             prior to the first dose of study medication.

          -  Subjects with a pre-existing condition interfering with normal gastrointestinal
             anatomy or motility, hepatic and/or renal function, that could interfere with the
             absorption, metabolism, and/or excretion of the study drugs. Subjects with a history
             of cholecystectomy should be excluded.

          -  screening ECG within protocol parameters (a single repeat is allowed for eligibility
             determination):• Evidence of previous myocardial infarction (Does not include ST
             segment changes associated with repolarization).

          -  Any conduction abnormality (including but not specific to left or right complete
             bundle branch block, AV block [2nd degree or higher], WPW syndrome).

          -  Sinus Pauses &gt; 3 seconds.

          -  Any significant arrhythmia which, in the opinion of the principal investigator and GSK
             medical monitor, will interfere with the safety for the individual subject.

          -  Non-sustained or sustained ventricular tachycardia (3 consecutive ventricular ectopic
             beats).

          -  The subject's systolic blood pressure is outside the range of 90-140mmHg, or diastolic
             blood pressure is outside the range of 45-90mmHg or heart rate is outside the range of
             50-100bpm for female subjects or 45-100 bpm for male subjects.

          -  History/evidence of symptomatic arrhythmia, angina/ischemia, coronary artery bypass
             grafting surgery or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or any clinically
             significant cardiac disease.

          -  History/evidence of clinically significant pulmonary disease.

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), direct bilirubin or
             creatinine values greater than the upper limit of normal. A single repeat is allowed
             for eligibility determination.
