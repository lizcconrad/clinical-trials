      Boston Scientific CRM's Longitudinal Surveillance Registry (LSR) will serve as an active
      ongoing source of updated information on the long-term reliability and performance of BSC
      commercially available leads and LATITUDE-enabled (wireless or wanded) pulse generators
      (PGs).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The LSR is an active, prospective, non-randomized, multi-center registry of patients
      implanted with BSC commercially available LATITUDE-enabled products. The primary purpose of
      the LSR is to evaluate and report on the long-term reliability and clinical performance of
      BSC's commercially available PGs and leads using the LATITUDE Patient Management system to
      augment information collected from in-clinic visits. The LSR is designed to enroll patients
      implanted with BSC LATITUDE-enabled (wireless or wanded) commercially available PGs (lead
      systems may include other manufacturers' leads).

      The primary objective of the LSR is to prospectively evaluate market-released PGs and leads
      to verify long-term system performance. The secondary objectives of the LSR include:

      I. To compare PG- and lead-related reliability data collected via LATITUDE with PG- and
      lead-related reliability data collected at in-clinic visits II. To compare this active
      surveillance of BSC PG and lead reliability data to the current passive surveillance system
      III. To enhance understanding of feature performance, patient management and clinical
      outcomes

             with a currently available BSC PG (lead systems may include other manufacturers'
             leads) that can be followed on the LATITUDE Patient Management system

          -  Patient who plans to remain in the long-term care of his/her enrolling physician (must
             be followed in-clinic at least once every 24 months by his/her enrolling physician)
