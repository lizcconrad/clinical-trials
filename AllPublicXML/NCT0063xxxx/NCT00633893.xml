  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to evaluate the effects of an investigational blood thinner, apixaban, in
      preventing venous thromboembolic (VTE) recurrence or death in patients who have completed
      their intended treatment for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE)

    <measure>Adjudicated Composite of Symptomatic, Recurrent Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) or All-Cause Death During the Intended Treatment Period - Randomized Population With Imputation</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 up to 12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>VTE included: nonfatal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or nonfatal pulmonary embolism (PE). All index events, DVT and/or PE were adjudicated/confirmed by a central independent adjudication committee blinded to treatment. DVT assessed by compression ultrasound and/or venography; PE assessed by spiral computed tomography scanning, pulmonary angiography, and/or ventilation/perfusion lung scan. Event rate (proportion of participants with event) calculated as n/N (n=number of events; N=number of participants). Intended treatment period: longer of the dosing period plus 2 days (completed treatment) or 355 days (discontinued early). Composite endpoint included events at any time from randomization until end of the intended treatment period, regardless whether drug treatment was received. For missing endpoint data, participants were imputed as having had a primary efficacy outcome event.</description>

        <title>Adjudicated Composite of Symptomatic, Recurrent Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) or All-Cause Death During the Intended Treatment Period - Randomized Population With Imputation</title>
        <description>VTE included: nonfatal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or nonfatal pulmonary embolism (PE). All index events, DVT and/or PE were adjudicated/confirmed by a central independent adjudication committee blinded to treatment. DVT assessed by compression ultrasound and/or venography; PE assessed by spiral computed tomography scanning, pulmonary angiography, and/or ventilation/perfusion lung scan. Event rate (proportion of participants with event) calculated as n/N (n=number of events; N=number of participants). Intended treatment period: longer of the dosing period plus 2 days (completed treatment) or 355 days (discontinued early). Composite endpoint included events at any time from randomization until end of the intended treatment period, regardless whether drug treatment was received. For missing endpoint data, participants were imputed as having had a primary efficacy outcome event.</description>

Intended treatment period: longer of the dosing period plus 2 days (completed treatment) or 355 days (discontinued early). Composite endpoint included events at any time from randomization until end of the intended treatment period, regardless whether drug treatment was received. No imputation was done for these endpoints; participants who had an event during the intended treatment period were counted.

          <title>Adjudicated Nonfatal Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) During the Intended Treatment Period - Randomized Population With Imputation</title>
          <description>DVT was adjudicated/confirmed by a central independent adjudication committee blinded to treatment and assessed by compression ultrasound and/or venography. Event rate is proportion of participants with event; calculated as n/N (n=number of events; N=number of participants). Intended treatment period: longer of the dosing period plus 2 days (completed treatment) or 355 days (discontinued early). Endpoint included events at any time from randomization until end of the intended treatment period, regardless whether drug treatment was received. Participants with missing endpoint information were classified as having had the efficacy event (imputation). Confidence interval (CI) for single event rate was calculated based on the Wald asymptotic confidence limits.</description>
          <population>Intent to treat: all randomized participants with valid consent. Analyzed per randomized treatment assigned. (n) number of events = 19, 28, 72 in apixaban 2.5 mg, 5 mg, placebo arms, respectively.</population>

          <description>CV-related death was defined as myocardial infarction, stroke, or other specified cardiovascular event and were adjudicated/confirmed by a central independent adjudication committee blinded to treatment. Event rate is proportion of participants with event; calculated as n/N (n=number of events; N=number of participants). Intended treatment period was defined as the longer of the dosing period plus 2 days or 355 days. Endpoint included events at any time from randomization until end of the intended treatment period, regardless whether drug treatment was received. Participants with missing endpoint information were classified as having had the efficacy event (imputation). CI for single event rate was calculated based on the Wald asymptotic confidence limits.</description>

        <title>Adjudicated Major Bleeding During the Treatment Period - Treated Population</title>
        <description>Major bleeding was adjudicated/confirmed by a central independent adjudication committee blinded to treatment and was defined as acute clinically overt bleeding: associated with a fall in hemoglobin of 2 grams per deciliter (g/dL) or more, or leading to a transfusion of 2 or more units of packed red blood cells or 1000 milliliters (mL) or more of whole blood, or in a critical site: intracranial, intraspinal, intraocular, pericardial, intra-articular, intramuscular with compartment syndrome, retroperitoneal, or another critical organ; or is fatal. Event rate is proportion of participants with event; calculated as n/N (n=number of events; N=number of participants). Confidence interval (CI) for event rate was calculated based on the Wald asymptotic confidence limits. Treated population includes randomized participants who received at least one dose of study drug.</description>

          <description>CV-related death was defined as myocardial infarction, stroke, or other specified cardiovascular event. Index events of DVT and/or PE, along with myocardial infarction and stroke were adjudicated/confirmed by a central independent adjudication committee blinded to treatment: DVT assessed by compression ultrasound and/or venography; PE assessed by spiral computed tomography scanning, pulmonary angiography, and/or ventilation/perfusion lung scan. Event rate is proportion of participants with event; calculated as n/N (n=number of events; N=number of participants). Intended treatment period was defined as the longer of the dosing period plus 2 days or 355 days. Composite endpoint included events at any time from randomization until end of the intended treatment period, regardless whether drug treatment was received. No imputation was done for these endpoints; participants who had an event during the intended treatment period were counted.</description>

        <title>Adjudicated All-Cause Death During the Intended Treatment Period - Randomized Population Without Imputation</title>
        <description>DVT and/or PE were adjudicated/confirmed by a central independent adjudication committee blinded to treatment: DVT assessed by compression ultrasound and/or venography; PE assessed by spiral computed tomography scanning, pulmonary angiography, and/or ventilation/perfusion lung scan. New/recurrent VTE, death, venous/arterial thromboembolic events, bleeding, thrombocytopenia, acute myocardial infarction and stroke were also adjudicated. Event rate is proportion of participants with event; calculated as n/N (n=number of events; N=number of participants). Intended treatment period was defined as the longer of the dosing period plus 2 days or 355 days. Endpoint included events at any time from randomization until end of the intended treatment period, regardless whether drug treatment was received. No imputation was done for this endpoint; participants who had an event during the intended treatment period were counted.</description>

(n) number of events = 7, 4, 14 in apixaban 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and placebo arms, respectively. CI for single event rate was calculated based on the Wald asymptotic confidence limits.</population>
