      Specific Aim 1: To assess the feasibility and acceptability of a home-based, computerized
      cognitive training program with survivors of central nervous system-impacting pediatric
      cancer (e.g. acute lymphoblastic leukemia, brain tumors).

      Specific Aim 2: To estimate the effect size of this cognitive training program on measures of
      attention and working memory in survivors of childhood cancer in order to determine whether a
      larger-scale clinical trial is warranted.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After obtaining written informed consent (parent) and assent (child), screening procedures
      will include administration of an abbreviated intellectual test battery, a working memory
      battery, and a computerized attention measure to the survivor (see specific Measures below).
      Our goal is to enroll 24 (12 ALL, 12 brain tumor) participants in the intervention phase of
      this prospective pilot study. To reach this goal, we anticipate needing to screen
      approximately 50 survivors, though enrollment will end when, or continue until, 24 eligible
      participants are identified and randomized to the intervention phase. Parents will complete
      questionnaire measures regarding their child's adaptive, behavioral, emotional, and
      attentional functioning. Follow-up interviewing will be conducted to clarify any potential
      problems identified on the questionnaires. The entire screening procedure is estimated to
      take approximately 90 minutes for the survivor and 30-45 minutes for parents. To maximize
      efficiency, two study personnel will work with families - one will complete testing with the
      child, while the other will complete questionnaires and follow-up interviewing with the
      parent. The design will be a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which half of the
      participants will be randomized to the intervention condition and half will receive a
      comparison computer program. Specifically, participants assigned to the comparison (placebo)
      condition will complete a modified version of the CT at home. The treatment and comparison CT
      programs begin identically, at the lowest difficulty level. Those in the treatment condition
      will complete activities of increasing difficulty over the intervention period. Those in the
      placebo condition, in contrast, will complete the same basic tasks during each session of the
      intervention, regardless of performance. In this way, a true estimate can be obtained of the
      efficacy of the treatment program.

    <description>Participants meeting inclusion criteria will be provided with a laptop computer outfitted with a wireless card for the duration of the intervention and will be trained in the use of RoboMemo in the clinic by study personnel. Although many participants may have ready access to home computers, we decided that all participants will be required to use laptops provided by the study for two reasons: 1) to ensure that coaches and participants are blind to treatment condition (as described above), and 2) to ensure that participants will always have access to the intervention program (i.e., they will not compete with other family members for computer time). Once trained, children will complete the intervention at home. The intervention will consist of four 30- to 45-minute sessions per week for 8 weeks (total = 32 sessions). This intervention schedule is similar to the schedule employed by Klingberg and colleagues in their home-based CT trials with ADHD children.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. A T-score greater than the 75th percentile on either the Cognitive
             Problems/Inattention or the DSM-IV Inattention subscales of the Conners' Parent Rating
             Scale

          2. One or more standard deviations below the mean on the Attention or Working Memory
             Indices of the WRAML 2 [56] or Attention or Working Memory Indices that are one or
             more standard deviations below the participant's estimated IQ. These criteria are
             similar to those used in a trial of methylphenidate with survivors of childhood
             cancer.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Estimated IQ â‰¤ 70

          2. A motor, visual, or auditory handicap that prevents computer use

          3. A diagnosis of Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Oppositional Defiant
             Disorder, depression, autism, or Pervasive Developmental Disorder

          4. Insufficient fluency in English. Participants who are currently taking stimulant
             medications (stable dose for at least 30 days) for attentional difficulties, but who
             meet inclusion criteria listed below will be allowed to participate.
