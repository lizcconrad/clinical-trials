  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The administration of néfopam after initial treatment by kétoproféne, could obtain, in
      patients remaining pain and classically need morphine, analgesia at least the same as
      morphine alone. The use of néfopam second line after ketoprofen could reducing (or even
      eliminating) the need for morphine (and its side effects), allowing a reduction in the length
      of stay of patients in the emergency unit.

      The main objective is to show that the addition of a néfopam initial treatment with the
      kétoproféne, reduces, in patients with ureteral calculi, the percentage of patients requiring
      the use of a treatment by morphine.

      The secondary objective is to reduce the side effects caused by the morphine, shorten the
      time to install the appropriate level of analgesia while reducing the risk of failure of the
      titration morphine, reduce the time spent on titration of morphine and reduce the length of
      stay patient intake in emergency unit.

      The study is prospective, parallel, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled analysis
      with intent to treat. There are 2 groups:

        -  A group N: néfopam

        -  A group P: placebo And all the patient receive, before randomization, 100 mg of
           ketoprofen (Profenid ®) on 20 minutes.

      The number of subjects is 52.
