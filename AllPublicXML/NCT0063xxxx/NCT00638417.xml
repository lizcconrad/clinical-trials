  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to improve hospital treatment and rehabilitation of patients with hip
      arthroplasty to help the patients to regain functional ability in the shortest possible time,
      and reduce hospital and rehabilitation time to save costs for the patient and society.

      Optimal reconstruction of the hip joint and the effect of an intensive physical training
      programme are compared to conventional rehabilitation programmes.

    <description>maximal dynamic strength training from 1 week after the operation, 5 training bouts a week for 4 weeks. The regimen consisted of 2 exercises, leg press and hip abduction, that included 4 series of 5RM involving the operated leg only. 5RM corresponds to approximately 85% of 1RM. When the patients managed to perform 6RM, the load was increased by 5kg. The series were separated by resting periods of 2 minutes.</description>

    <description>conventional rehabilitation program: inpatient treatment in a rehabilitation center. Individual sling exercise therapy in hip abduction/adduction, hip flexion/extension, exercises with low resistance (&gt;12-15 repetitions37), or no resistance and exercises performed in water when sutures had been removed. Each session lasted 1 hour and was performed 5 days a week for 4 weeks.</description>
