    <description>Parecoxib sodium 40 mg intravenous (IV) on the day after surgery (Day 1) following recovery from anesthesia, contingent on an acceptable postoperative status, verification of baseline eligibility, and lack of perioperative complications. A second dose of parecoxib sodium 20 mg IV was administered on Day 1. On the day following surgery, patients received parecoxib 20 mg IV at 8 am and each subsequent dose was administered at 12-hour intervals. After receiving at least 6 doses of IV parecoxib sodium, patients were transitioned to oral valdecoxib 20 mg taken at 12-hour intervals until the total treatment duration of 10 days had been completed.</description>
