    <textblock>
      This study will compare the benefits of exenatide once weekly treatment to those achieved by
      the approved antidiabetic therapies sitagliptin and pioglitazone in subjects whose type 2
      diabetes is managed with metformin therapy alone. The safety and tolerability of the three
      treatment regimens will also be compared.
