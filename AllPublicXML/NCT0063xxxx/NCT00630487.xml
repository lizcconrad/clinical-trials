  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will investigate the effect on growth hormone replacement in patients with isolated
      growth hormone deficiency on body composition, especially visceral fat mass.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was terminated on 15-Dec-2008 due to poor recruitment. Although 9 Patients were
      enrolled, no patient was randomized nor treated with somatropin. No safety reasons
      contributed to the termination.

    <description>Participant self-administered questionnaire EQ-5D, a 2 part generic health status instrument. The first part consists of 5 descriptors of current health state: mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Scores are assigned on a three-level scale (1= no problem, 2= some problem, 3= extreme problem). The second part was an overall rating of the participant's current health state using a 20 cm Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-VAS) with endpoints labelled 'best imaginable health state' and 'worst imaginable health state'.</description>

    <description>Patients of Placebo Group will be treated with placebo sub-cutaneous in the same way as Somatropin during the double blind treatment phase. To maintain blind subject will be measured in the same way as the treatment group for IGF-I- Levels. Central lab will randomize placebo patients to dose change or maintenance of dose. This will ensure continued blinding of the study to patients and personnel.</description>

After that dose will be increased to the targeted maintenance dose according to IGF-I Levels +/- 2 SD of age adjusted reference range. In case of side effects dosage will remain on half-dose (during the first 4 weeks) or reduced to half dose (after the first 4 weeks). At week 52 patients have the opportunity to switch to open label study restarting with half the given fixed dose which will be adjusted to full dose after 4 weeks.</description>

The first part consists of 5 descriptors of current health state: mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Scores are assigned on a three-level scale (1= no problem, 2= some problem, 3= extreme problem). The second part was an overall rating of the participant's current health state using a 20 cm Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-VAS) with endpoints labelled ‘best imaginable health state’ and ‘worst imaginable health state’.</description>

          <description>Participant self-administered questionnaire EQ-5D, a 2 part generic health status instrument. The first part consists of 5 descriptors of current health state: mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Scores are assigned on a three-level scale (1= no problem, 2= some problem, 3= extreme problem). The second part was an overall rating of the participant's current health state using a 20 cm Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-VAS) with endpoints labelled ‘best imaginable health state’ and ‘worst imaginable health state’.</description>
