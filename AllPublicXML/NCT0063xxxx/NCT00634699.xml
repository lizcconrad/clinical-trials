      The purpose of this study is to find the efficacy of treating the muscles in the inside
      (biceps,pronator teres) of the arm in order to eliminate the carpal tunnel syndrome .The
      authors hypothesise that eliminating the trigger points located in these muscles would
      diminish the symptoms associated with the carpal tunnel syndrome.

      The carpal tunnel syndrome is a common condition which should treated by surgery only when
      conservative approaches has been tried.In the present trial the authors intend to find the
      effectiveness of treating the triggers points located in the biceps muscle, the pronator
      teres muscle and the biceps aponeurosis on the symptoms normally associated with the carpal
      tunnel syndrome.

      The technique used in this trial will be ischemic compression(thumb tip pressure)on the
      trigger points located on the previous sites.
