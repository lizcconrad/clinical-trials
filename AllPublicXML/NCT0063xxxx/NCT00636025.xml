      A cross-sectional study was performed at a single center, in accordance with good clinical
      practice. Thirty women aged 18 to 50 were included in this study. An experienced
      dermatologist evaluated all of the subjects in a standing position, with relaxed gluteus
      muscles, using the CSS classification. An area with cellulite and another without cellulite
      on the contralateral buttock were selected. The area with cellulite had an evident depressed
      lesion, whereas the area without cellulite had no depressed or raised lesions, The selected
      cellulite depression was marked with a positive symbol using a skin marking pen.
