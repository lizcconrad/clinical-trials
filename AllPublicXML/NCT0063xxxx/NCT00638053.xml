    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the prevalence of GHD in patients who sustain a head
      injury or suffer a major traumatic event and to evaluate the efficacy of growth hormone (GH)
      therapy in the treatment of GHD caused by trauma or head injury

      The study was terminated on October 9, 2003. The reason cited for the termination was due to
      poor patient recruitment and therefore not enough data could be collected to provide
      comprehensive analysis for reporting of results. No safety or efficacy issues were reported
      to cause the termination of the study.

    <description>Somatropin will be administered as a daily subcutaneous injection; Fixed doses starting with 0.1 mg/day in patients older than 55 years or patients weighing less than 50 kg; all other patients: 0.1 mg/day or 0.2 mg/day (these doses should all be lower than 0.04 mg/kg/week); all patients starting at 0.1 mg/day will have their dose progressively increased in 0.1 mg/day increments to a maximum clinically- and pharmacologically- tolerated plateau dose; all patients starting at 0.2 mg/day will increase in 0.2 mg/day increments; all incremented dose changes will occur at monthly intervals based on IGF-I levels; treatment will continue for 12 months</description>
