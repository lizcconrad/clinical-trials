  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs) play an important role in asthma. CysLTs exert most of their
      bronchoconstrictive and pro-inflammatory effects through activation of the CysLT1-r. As
      allergic rhinitis appears to be a predisposing factor in the development of asthma and as
      CysLT-receptors seem to be implicated in the first steps of asthma manifestations, we think
      it would be of interest to determine if the CysLT1-r is a key mediator in the progression
      from allergic rhinitis to asthma. We believe it would be interesting to study the expression
      of the CysLT1-r

      Our goal is to assess baseline, as well as variations following allergen bronchoprovocations,
      in the expression of the CysLT1-r in mild asthmatic subjects compared with non asthmatic
      subjects with allergic rhinitis.

      Our hypothesis is that there will be a higher baseline expression of the CysLT1-r in
      asthmatic subjects compared with allergic rhinitis subjects and that allergen
      bronchoprovocations will induce an increase in the expression of the CysLT1-r in both groups.

      We will recruit mild allergic asthmatic subjects and non asthmatic subjects with allergic
      rhinitis. On a baseline visit, allergy skin prick tests, spirometry, methacholine
      bronchoprovocation and induced sputum (IS) with differential leukocyte count will be
      obtained.

      In a second step, mild asthmatic subjects will undergo conventional bronchial allergen
      challenge. IS will be obtained at 6h (corresponding to the late asthmatic response) and 24h
      following the challenge. The rhinitic subjects and asthmatic subjects will undergo a 4-day
      low dose allergen bronchial challenge as well as a nasal allergen challenge. Sputum samples
      will be obtained following days 2 and 4 of the low dose challenge and one week later, and 24h
      following nasal challenge.

      Induced sputum will be analyzed for differential cell count. Total mRNA will be extracted
      from IS cells and used for RT-PCR.
