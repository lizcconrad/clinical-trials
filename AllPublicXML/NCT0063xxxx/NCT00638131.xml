  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is little doubt of the necessity for further improvement in the prevention and therapy
      of end-stage renal disease. Despite the success of ARB in treating diabetic nephropathy, not
      all patients obtain satisfactory control of blood pressure, albuminuria and decline in renal
      function. Experimental data have provided us with a rationale for the potential added
      benefits of ET receptor blockade to the AII inhibition in diabetic renal protection.
      Considering the nephroprotective effect of bosentan in diabetic rats, clinical studies are
      warranted to assess whether ET receptor antagonism has additive renoprotective effects on top
      of AII inhibition.
