  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MT110 is a bispecific (anti-EpCAM x anti-CD3) T-cell engager (BiTE) designed to link EpCAM
      (epithelial cell adhesion molecule) expressing cells and T-cells resulting in T-cell
      activation and a cytotoxic T-cell response against EpCAM+ cells. In vitro and ex-vivo data
      indicate that EpCAM+ tumor cell lines are sensitive to MT110 mediated cytotoxicity.
      Furthermore, data from in-vivo experiments with both MT110 and a mouse surrogate molecule
      (muS110) have confirmed the activity of these molecules in inhibiting the formation of
      metastases but also against established tumors. In vitro and ex-vivo data suggest that a
      prolonged presence of the drug in target tissues may result in significant T-cell
      recruitment, activation and expansion to/in target tissues, potentially resulting in
      substantial anti-tumor activity in man.

             chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy or surgery.

               -  This generally means at least 4 weeks since major surgery, radical radiotherapy
                  or myelosuppressive chemotherapy (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C).

               -  At least 4-5 half-lives (t1/2) must have elapsed since treatment with an
                  investigational agent.
