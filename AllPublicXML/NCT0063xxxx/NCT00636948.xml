      The hypothesis of the present trial was that the use of a defunctioning loop stoma reduces
      the rate of symptomatic anastomotic leakage from 15% to 7.5% after low anterior resection of
      the rectum for cancer.

      The assumption that a defunctioning loop stoma reduces symptomatic anastomotic leakage from
      15% to 7.5%, with a level of statistical significance of 5% and a statistical power of 80%,
      requires randomization of 220 patients.
