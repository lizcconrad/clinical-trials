  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare effects of inspiratory muscle training added by aerobic training
      to aerobic training alone in heart failure patients with inspiratory muscle weakness. To do
      so, strength and endurance of inspiratory muscles, functional capacity, quality of life,
      heart rate variability and sleep apnea evaluations will be conducted in patients with heart
      failure.

    <textblock>
      A sample comprising at least 30 individuals is necessary. These subjects will be randomized
      in two groups, one consisting of inspiratory muscle training plus aerobic training, whereas
      the other will consist of the aerobic training alone.

      This prospective, randomized, controlled trial will include patients with the diagnosis of
      chronic heart failure attributable to left ventricular systolic dysfunction who will be
      recruited from the Heart Failure Clinic.

      Entry criteria for the study are a previous history of symptomatic heart failure caused by
      left ventricular systolic dysfunction, inspiratory muscle weakness (PImax &lt; 70% of the
      predicted), and clinical stability, including no change in medications for the past three
      months.

      Exclusion criteria will be unstable angina, myocardial infarction, or cardiac surgery within
      the previous three months, chronic metabolic, orthopedic, or infectious diseases, treatments
      with steroids, hormones, or cancer chemotherapy, history of exercise-induced asthma, chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease and smokers will be not recruited.

      The protocol was approved by the Committee for Ethics in Research of Hospital de Clinics de
      Porto Alegre and Ijuí University and all subjects are required to sign an informed consent
      form.

      Variables will be measured by strength and endurance (progressive and constant load), 6-min
      walk test, cardiopulmonary exercise testing, quality of life questionnaire, evaluation of the
      heart rate variability and sleep apnea.

      The inspiratory muscle training plus aerobic training will consist of cycle exercise (3
      sessions/week) and inspiratory exercise by using Threshold equipment for 30 min, 7 times per
      week, whereas aerobic training group will perform only cycle exercise. Both treatments will
      last 12 weeks.
