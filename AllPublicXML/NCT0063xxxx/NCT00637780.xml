    <textblock>
      This study will characterize the steady state pharmacokinetics of sulfasalazine delayed
      release tablets in pediatric Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis patients. Data from this study
      will fulfill the post approval commitment to the FDA.

      <recruitment_details>The last participant enrolled in 2014 but the study was kept open for another 2 years and enrollment was not stopped. However, by 2016, no additional participants were enrolled and thus the study was closed. As such, the basic results for this study are only prepared in 2016 though last participant's last visit was in 2014.</recruitment_details>
