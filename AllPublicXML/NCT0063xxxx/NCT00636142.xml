      The aim of the study is to test whether neutralizing TNF-alpha with infliximab affects
      insulin resistance and phenotypical manifestations of the metabolic syndrome as fasting
      plasma insulin, total body fat, plasma lipid profile or vascular endothelial function in
      obese male subjects.

    <textblock>
      Overweight and obesity are rapidly becoming one of the most pressing health problems. Obese
      subjects face an increased risk for cardiovascular events that is closely related to a
      cluster of metabolic disturbances (i.e. insulin resistance, hypertension, dyslipidemia and
      impaired fibrinolysis), collectively referred to as syndrome X. The actual mechanism
      underlying development of syndrome X has not been elucidated. Increased TNF-alpha activity
      has been proposed as a key factor.

      The objectives of the study are to test whether neutralizing TNF-alpha with infliximab in
      obese subjects affects insulin resistance and phenotypical manifestations of the metabolic
      syndrome such as:

        -  fasting plasma insulin

        -  ivGTT derived parameters of insulin resistance and beta-cell function

        -  total body fat

        -  plasma lipid profile

        -  vascular endothelial dysfunction
