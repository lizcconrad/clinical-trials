  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the introduction of an EBP text
      for Nursing Research Council (NRC) members to use with RN staff to increase staff belief in,
      knowledge of and implementation of EBP in providing patient care. The theory that will drive
      this study is Disciplined Clinical Inquiry (DCI).

      The current study will use a quasi-experimental design plus DCI to engage unit RN staff in
      deciding how they might learn about EBP in a feasible, useful way. After collection of
      baseline data, the NRC member will introduce the text + solicit staff input into a plan for
      using the text to increase understanding of EBP and use of evidence to make practice changes
      on her/his own unit. Another unit in that service line or under the same Service Line
      Administrator will serve as a comparison unit. Data collection will be conducted again after
      4 and 12 weeks. At the 12 week point, the NRC member will introduce the text + solicit staff
      input for a plan on the comparison unit. Data collection will be conducted on the comparison
      unit at 16 weeks, and again on both units at 24 weeks. At the 24 week point, additional units
      will be added and the process repeated until all units represented on the NRC have been
      included.

      Outcome measures will include: EBP belief and EBP implementation scales (Melnyk &amp;
      Fineout-Overholt, 2003); EBP knowledge cognitive test; # of lit searches conducted by unit RN
      staff ; # of requests for library support for lit searches or to obtain search-related
      articles: # of unit clinical policies with documented levels of evidence &amp; research
      references. EBP belief, EBP implementation and EBP knowledge variables will be analyzed at
      both individual and unit levels of analysis. All other variables will be measured at the unit
      level of analysis. Additional unit level variables will include the following data collected
      annually as part of the National Database for Nursing Quality Indicator (NDNQI) RN
      satisfaction survey: satisfaction with RN-RN interaction, satisfaction with autonomy,
      satisfaction with practice decision-making, perceived quality of care delivered on the unit.

      The primary statistical procedures for analysis will be ANCOVA, ANOVAwith repeated measures,
      and logistic regression.

        All RN staff &amp; RN patient service leaders (PSLs) who are over 18 years of age, employed by
        Upstate and working full or parttime on direct care units within service lines represented
        on the Nursing Research Council (NRC) will be invited to participate. This target
        population includes approximately 551 staff RNs &amp; PSLs. We expect to enroll a minimum of 5
        and as many as 15 RNs on the 29 nursing units over the course of the study for a sample
        size between 145 and 435
