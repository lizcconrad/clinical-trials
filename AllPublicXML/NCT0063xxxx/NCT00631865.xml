      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of autologous
      transplantation of melanocytes in patients with vitiligo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vitiligo is a pigmentation disorder in which white patches of skin appear on different parts
      of the body. Histologically it is characterized by absence of melanocytes along the epidermal
      basal layer.

      Using cell suspension with non-cultured melanocytes which injected into blister of
      depigmented lesion, a success rate of 85% was reported for repigmentation. However there are
      some limitations in this technique: the induction of blister is limited to several sites of
      the body, hypo-pigmentation around the recipient area due to cryodamage of peripheral
      melanocytes and leakage of suspension out of the blister. To reduce these problems, in this
      study we will inject melanocytes directly to epidermis.

      A shaved biopsy specimen (about 1 cm2) is taken from the patient`s normally pigmented area
      under local anesthesia (lidocaine hydrochloride 20 mg/ml). The specimens are incubated in
      0.25% trypsin solution for 15 minutes at 37°C 0.02% EDTA solution for 10 minutes. Then
      epidermal sheets are gently manipulated with forceps to dissociate the epidermal cells and to
      yield a cell suspension, followed by treatment with 0.5% trypsin/versene solution at 37C for
      3-5 minutes. Well-dispersed cell suspension is aspirated into 1 ml syringes and injected
      directly in epidermis.
