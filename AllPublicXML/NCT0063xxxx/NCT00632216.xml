      The study in the labeled and real conditions of prescription of Actonel will investigate the
      satisfaction of patients with its new formulation: 35 mg Once A Week. The study will also
      measure response rates in CTX (the C-telopeptide of type I collagen) at baseline and after 12
      weeks of treatment with risedronate 35 mg Once A Week.
