      This study is being done to determine if the use of double strength cranberry juice in daily
      diet will improve endothelial function.

    <textblock>
      Study participants will be randomized assigned to drink either placebo (a drink that looks
      and tastes like cranberry juice, but does not contain cranberry juice) or a double strength
      Ocean Spray light cranberry juice cocktail for four months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects over the age of 18 years old with known or suspected cardiovascular disease
             including documented CAD by cardiac catheterization, and multiple cardiovascular risk
             factors will be included, regardless of severity of endothelial dysfunction or
             previous history of cardiovascular events.

          -  Subjects with no known history of cardiac disease will also be eligible to
             participate.

          -  Subjects must demonstrate endothelial dysfunction via the RH-PAT test (an RH-PAT score
             of less than 2.0) to continue participating in this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be excluded if they have confounding factors including, but not limited
             to, history of renal or liver failure, or relevant food allergies (cranberries, etc.).
