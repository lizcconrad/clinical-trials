  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Imatinib has revolutionised the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). The first
      clinical trials were conducted in 1998 in patients with advanced disease, and by 2002
      imatinib was established as the standard therapy for all patients including those recently
      diagnosed. In spite of overwhelming evidence about its efficacy we still need to gain more
      knowledge about issues related to long term treatment with imatinib such as why some patients
      respond better than others, the development of side effects and the quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We plan to follow prospectively a cohort of CML patients in order to study their compliance
      to therapy,pharmacological levels of imatinib and the prevalence of side effects. We expect
      to be able to correlate the actual dose received, the pharmacological levels of drug in
      blood, with the change in the level of residual disease (measured by Q−PCR) at various time
      points. We also want to gain insight into the relationship between compliance to therapy and
      specific side effects and between compliance and duration of treatment. We will also assess
      the adherence to imatinib therapy after increases in the drug dose that are part of standard
      treatment.
