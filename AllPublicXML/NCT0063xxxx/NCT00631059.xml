      The objective of this protocol is to collect leukemia cell specimens from adults (18 years of
      age) diagnosed with acute leukemia at time of initial diagnosis and, if applicable, at time
      of first relapse. These specimens, in conjunction with a de-identified data set, will be
      utilized prospectively to determine potential chemotherapy resistance in this patient
      population.

      The specific aims of this study are as follows:

      To collect peripheral blood specimens from patients diagnosed with acute leukemia at time of
      initial diagnosis and, if applicable, at time of first relapse To evaluate the leukemia cells
      in the blood specimens for chemotherapy resistance utilizing the Hem(A)+ technology

      To develop a body of evidence from acute leukemia patients that demonstrates the
      applicability of the Hem(A)+ assay to determine the following:

      Predict responders and non-responders to common chemotherapeutic agents Track treatment
      results and comparison to prediction results from the assay Identify optimal chemotherapy
      doses for each patient Identify the most efficacious pharmaceutical agent combinations
