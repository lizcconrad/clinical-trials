      The purpose of this study is to determine if 11.25 and 30 mg formulations of leuprolide are
      effective in treating children with Central Precocious Puberty (CPP).

      Study Design:

      A total of 80 children with confirmed CPP were planned to be enrolled and randomized in a 1:1
      ratio to receive 2 injections of either leuprolide acetate 11.25 mg or 30 mg depot
      formulation, each injection administered 3 mo apart (6 mo of treatment):

      This study includes a 4-week Screening Period, two 3-mo treatment cycles, and a posttreatment
      follow-up period (12 weeks following the Mo 6 visit). Study visits will occur at Screening,
      Day 1, Week 2 (only for subjects participating in the pharmacokinetic subset), Mo 1, 2, 3, Mo
      6/Early Termination, and 12 weeks later, for the Posttreatment Follow-up Visit.

      This study was conducted at 18 sites in the United States and 4 sites in Puerto Rico.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Suppression of Peak Stimulated Luteinizing Hormone (&lt;4 mIU/mL) From Month 2 Through Month 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 2 through 6</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants with suppression of peak stimulated luteinizing hormone that was measured after a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) stimulation test at Month (Mo) 2, 3, and 6. The analysis was performed according to a life table method. Subjects who withdrew without peak-stimulated luteinizing hormone &gt;= 4 mIU/mL were censored at their last measurement of peak-stimulated luteinizing hormone.</description>

    <time_frame>Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants with suppression of breast development, out of the number of girls with pubertal staging of breast development (n/N%). Only girls are analyzed in this outcome measure. Breast development was rated from Stage 1 (early development) through Stage 5 (full development) according to a Tanner Staging pictogram. Girls entering the study with fully developed breasts (Stage 5) were excluded from this analysis. Observed data were used with no imputation for missing data.</description>

    <description>Percentage of participants with suppression of genital development and testicular volume, out of the number of boys with pubertal staging of genital development or testicular volume (n/N%). Only boys are analyzed in this outcome measure. External genital development (testes and penis) was rated from Stage 1 (early development) through Stage 5 (full development) according to a Tanner Staging pictogram. Boys entering the study with fully developed genitals (Stage 5) were excluded from this analysis. Observed data were used with no imputation for missing data.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Incremental Growth Rate (cm/Year) at Month 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The growth rate at baseline was the growth rate during the last year before the start of treatment and was calculated with the measurement closest to Day -336 (before Day -30) and the measurement up to Day 1. Growth rate at Month 6 was defined as the ratio of the change in height from Day 1 to the change in chronological age, with an approximate 6-month interval between the 2 height measurements. Observed data were used with no imputation for missing data.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ratio of Change From Baseline in Bone Age/Change From Baseline in Chronological Age at Month 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The ratio at Month 6 was calculated as (bone age at Month 6 - bone age at baseline)/(chronological age at Month 6 - chronological age at baseline). Observed data were used with no imputation for missing data. Baseline bone-age radiograph was performed at or within 3 months of the Screening Visit.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Eighteen sites in the US and 4 sites in Puerto Rico enrolled subjects into the study. The first subject was randomized 17 June 2008 and the last subject was randomized 12 Aug 2009.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of the 2 treatment arms. To ensure balanced randomization, the study drug assignment was stratified on the basis of whether subjects were treatment-naive or had been treated with GnRHa previously.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Percentage of participants with suppression of breast development, out of the number of girls with pubertal staging of breast development (n/N%). Only girls are analyzed in this outcome measure. Breast development was rated from Stage 1 (early development) through Stage 5 (full development) according to a Tanner Staging pictogram. Girls entering the study with fully developed breasts (Stage 5) were excluded from this analysis. Observed data were used with no imputation for missing data.</description>
