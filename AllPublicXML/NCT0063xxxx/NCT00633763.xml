  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pancreas is an organ that plays major roles in the digestion of food. A part of the
      pancreas called islet beta-cells produces insulin, which regulates the amount of glucose (a
      sugar) present in the blood at all times. Type-1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM), an autoimmune
      disorder characterized by destruction of pancreatic islet beta-cells (the cells that produce
      insulin), affects at least a million individuals in the US alone. In T1DM, a type of white
      blood cells called T lymphocytes attacks and destroys the pancreatic islet beta-cells,
      leading to a loss of insulin, an increase in blood glucose, and a dependence on insulin
      injections for survival. Despite rigorous control of blood sugar, the majority of diabetic
      patients develop serious complications including retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy,
      microangiopathy and strokes.

      Non-invasive methods to monitor pancreatic beta-cell loss associated with type-1 diabetes
      mellitus (T1DM) could improve early diagnosis, provide tools to measure responsiveness to new
      therapies, and evaluate the efficiency of pancreatic transplantation and graft survival.

      Our goal is to develop a non-invasive PET-CT imaging method based on binding of a molecule
      (18F-fallypride) for tracking beta-cell loss during the progression of T1DM. In preliminary
      studies we demonstrated specific binding of 18F-fallypride to D2 receptors in rat pancreatic
      sections and we demonstrated that the loss of pancreatic beta cells in streptozotocin-treated
      rats was associated with a corresponding decrease in 18F-fallypride binding to pancreatic
      sections. A preliminary 18F-fallypride PET-CT study done by a collaborator in Ohio on a
      healthy volunteer, revealed 18F-fallypride-uptake by the pancreas that was distinguishable
      from surrounding tissues. Aim-1 of our project will measure the variability of 18F-fallypride
      PET-scanning of the pancreas in six healthy volunteers scanned twice with an interval of 4-6
      weeks. In Aim-2 of our project, we will compare fallypride PET-CT scans of 12 patients with
      long-standing T1DM (nearly all beta cells destroyed) with 12 age- and sex-matched healthy
      volunteers. If we are able to distinguish between the two groups, we will in future (a)
      optimize the method so as to be able to detect a 20-30% loss of beta cells, and (b) perform
      PET-CT studies in new-onset T1DM patients and in at-risk first degree relatives of T1DM
      patients.

    <description>Healthy individuals with normal C-peptide levels following i.v. glucagon challenge. These individuals will be administered 18F-fallypride and then subjected to PET-CT scanning of the pancreas and brain. The subject will be positioned in the PET/CT scanner and a low-dose CT (15-20 secs) of the abdomen carried out (with subjects breathing normally). A 30-min PET acquisition will then be started (three 10 min static frames or one 30 min static frame). The subject will then be repositioned for a low-dose CT scan of the head (15-20 secs) following which a 20-min PET acquisition will then be started (two 10 min static frames or one 20 min static frame).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  T1DM patients that are over 18 years of age, have had T1DM for greater than 5 years
             and show a greater than 80% reduction in C-peptide blood levels following intravenous
             glucagon injection are eligible to participate in this study.

          -  Healthy controls that are over 18 years of age, show normal C-peptide blood levels
             following intravenous glucagon injection, and are age- and sex-matched with one of the
             T1DM patients included in the study, are eligible to participate in this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  T1DM patients or healthy controls that are not over 18 years of age are not eligible
             to participate in this study.

          -  Pregnant females are not eligible to participate in this study because there is a
             chance PET/CT scans might be risky for the developing baby. Females physically capable
             of getting pregnant will be required to get a urine pregnancy test at no cost before
             each of the PET/CT scans. If the pregnancy test is positive, the T1DM patient or
             healthy control will be excluded from the study. The consent form describes the risks
             in detail and the need for women of childbearing age to undergo a pregnancy test.

          -  Subjects with a history of psychiatric illness, substance abuse history, clinically
             significant head trauma, active neurological disease, cardiovascular disease, liver
             disease or renal impairment, claustrophobia ((very upset and afraid of being in a
             small space) are not eligible for the study. Dr. Ping Wang will use the subjects
             history, blood chemistry, to identify individuals with cardiovascular disease, liver
             disease, or renal impairment.

          -  T1DM patients with C-peptide levels following intravenous glucagon injection that are
             not reduced greater than 80% are not eligible for the study.

          -  Healthy volunteers with C-peptide levels following intravenous glucagon injection that
             are reduced greater than 20% compared to established control values are not eligible
             for the study.

          -  To determine if it is safe to do the procedure, T1DM patients and healthy volunteers
             will be expected to tell the researchers about any radiation exposure the individual
             may have had (including diagnostic or treatment x-rays), and any history of head
             injury, kidney or bladder disease, or any other serious medical conditions.

          -  T1DM patients and healthy volunteers will be expected to tell the researchers if they
             have surgical clips or metallic prostheses (i.e., replacement body parts, such as a
             hip joint) or a pacemaker or other pieces of metal in the body (shrapnel, metal
             filings, etc.).

          -  Patients with history of alcoholism or significant alcohol consumption will be
             excluded from the study.

          -  The consent form will be English, and non-English speakers will therefore be excluded
             from the study.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded because 18F-fallypride is a radioactive substance , which
             will be injected into the patient and could be hazardous to the fetus.
