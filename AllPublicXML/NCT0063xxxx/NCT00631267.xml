      Rationale:

      Many different closed techniques are used to reduce a dorsally dislocated distal radius
      fracture (Colles' fracture). One trial to compare two main techniques (finger-trap traction
      and manual manipulation) did not find significant difference in radiological and clinical
      outcome (Earnshaw 2002). This trial aims to investigate patient and medical satisfaction
      between both techniques

      Objective:

      To demonstrate patient satisfaction (pain, duration, general) and medical satisfaction
      (difficulty of reposition). It is suggested that finger-trap traction causes less pain for
      patients and is more easy than manual manipulation but have the same radiological and
      clinical outcome.

      Study design:

      Randomised controlled intervention study

      Study population:

      300 Patients with newly diagnosed closed distal radius fractures with dorsal angulation
      (Colles' fracture) older than 16years coming to the Emergency Medical Department.

      Intervention:

      One group is put in finger-trap traction (digitus 1-3) for 10minutes with 4-5kg of ballast on
      their upper arm followed by reduction by dorsal pressure. The other group is manually reduced
      according to Charnley with traction and &quot;hooking over&quot; of the fracture elements.

      Main study parameters/endpoints:

      Visual analogue scale of patient and medical satisfaction, percentage of successful primary
      reductions. Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit
      and group relatedness: Apart for the regular follow-up of patients with distal radius
      fractures,one extra out-patient visit is necessary to assess functional outcome after three
      months.Finger-trap traction has a (theoretical) risk of causing traumatic damage to ligaments
      of the fingers, but this risk is in our opinion not higher than in the manual manipulation.
      It is expected that the finger-trap traction group is more satisfied because this technique
      seems less traumatic than but as successful as the manual manipulation group.
