  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators reported in a pilot study presented at last year's Cybertherapy Conference
      (Girard &amp; Turcotte, 2007) that using an action-cue exposure strategy in virtual reality
      (ACE-VR; crushing virtual cigarettes) might be useful in the treatment of tobacco addiction.

      The investigators are pursuing research in this area with a randomized control trial based on
      90 smokers who will receive a brief psychosocial smoking cessation program (25 people are
      enrolled so far and we expect to finish the study before the conference). During the first
      four weeks of an eight-session psychoeducational and motivational program, all participants
      will be immersed in VR. During the immersions in VR, 45 of the participants will use a
      virtual arm to catch and crush virtual cigarettes. The other half of the sample will use the
      virtual arm to catch virtual fruits (control condition).

      The smoking frequency, and abstinence, will be assessed with a daily diary and exhaled carbon
      monoxide tests (the CO2 tests will provide an objective confirmation of the abstinence
      reported in the diaries). The success the program will be compared based on the number of
      subjects who quitted or reduced their smoking frequency. The severity of addiction will be
      assessed with two questionnaires, the Fagerstrom and the Horn tests. Craving and withdrawal
      effects will be measured with the Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale (MNWS) and the Brief
      Questionnaire of Smoking Urges (QSU-Brief) at the baseline and at the visits from weeks 1
      through 4, 6, 12 and at the end of the program. Before the VR immersion, the Immersive
      Tendencies Questionnaire will be administered and after each VR session participants will
      fill two questionnaires addressing presence and cybersickness. The comparative impact of both
      treatments will be tested with repeated measures ANOVAs (and planned contrasts) with
      sufficient power to detect medium effect sizes.

      The main goal of our study is show that crushing virtual cigarettes can boost the impact of a
      behavioural program dedicated to cigarette addiction.

    <time_frame>Weeks 1, 4, 6, 12, 24 and 12-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Participants completed a daily diary to record the number cigarettes smoked during the day. No cigarette smoked during 7 days = abstinence. To be counted as real abstinence, the participant had to smoke zero cigarettes during four weeks and confirmed by zero nicoting in the unrine sample.
Six measurement times were used to assess if zero cigarettes has been smoked in the last 4 weeks prior to the study (Week 1), during the first four weeks (Week 4 measurement point) and so on for a blok of four weeks ending at each measurement point (e.g., four weeks before the 12-month follow-up).</description>

        <title>Self-report Measure of Abstinence in the Last 7 Days, Averaged Over Four Weeks, and Confirmed by Urine Samples.</title>
        <description>Participants completed a daily diary to record the number cigarettes smoked during the day. No cigarette smoked during 7 days = abstinence. To be counted as real abstinence, the participant had to smoke zero cigarettes during four weeks and confirmed by zero nicoting in the unrine sample.
Six measurement times were used to assess if zero cigarettes has been smoked in the last 4 weeks prior to the study (Week 1), during the first four weeks (Week 4 measurement point) and so on for a blok of four weeks ending at each measurement point (e.g., four weeks before the 12-month follow-up).</description>
