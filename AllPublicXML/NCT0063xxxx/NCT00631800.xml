      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety (including tolerability),
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and clinical activity of BSYX-A110 administered in a
      3-dose regimen on Study Days 0, 7, and 14.

      This Phase II study will be a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study of BSYX-A110
      in very low birth weight neonates. A total of 80 infants will be dosed in this study.
      Participants will receive either BSYX-A110 or placebo, at 60 mg/kg or 90 mg/kg. The Study
      Drug will be administered at 48-120 hours of life, 7 days after the initial dose, and 14 days
      after the initial dose for all dose groups.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients must meet all of the following criteria at the time of first infusion (Day 0):

          1. 48-120 hours of age, inclusive

          2. Birth weight of 700-1300 grams

          3. Inpatient in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit

          4. Written informed consent obtained from the parent(s) or legal guardian

        Multiple gestations:

          1. Siblings from multiple gestations may be enrolled if they each meet the entry criteria

          2. No more than 4 subjects in any birth weight cohort may be siblings

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients may have none of the following at the first dose:

          1. Survival not expected for at least 1 week after infusion

          2. Clinically overt systemic infection, as determined by history, physical examination,
             and positive culture from a normally sterile site. (Infuse only when infant clinically
             stable and cultures negative for 48 hours. If being evaluated for sepsis, decision to
             infuse may be deferred as allowed by protocol infusion window. Infusions outside of
             protocol window must be approved by Sponsor.)

          3. Severe congenital anomalies or genetic disorders that are likely to be fatal or that
             may interfere with drug distribution or metabolism, as determined by history and/or
             physical examination, and including but not limited to:

             i. Trisomy 13 ii. Trisomy 18 iii. Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome iv. Omphalocele v.
             Gastroschesis vi. Holoprosencephaly

          6. Immunodeficiency other than due to prematurity

          7. A history of standard immune globulin administration prior to first study drug
             infusion (excluding Hepatitis B Immune Globulin, HBIG)

          8. Any history, in the infant subject or its mother, of a hypersensitivity or severe
             vasomotor reaction to immunoglobulin G, or blood products

          9. Currently receiving, recently received, or planned to receive other investigational
             agents that could interfere with conduct or results of this study; including
             enrollment in another investigational study for a product under an IRB-approved
             protocol

         10. Expectation that the patient will not be able to be followed for the duration of the
             study

         11. Mother with serology positive for hepatitis B surface antigen
