  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is current evidence that maintaining ICU patient's blood sugar between 4.4-6.1 saves
      lives. However, this is difficult to do in the ICU and carries risks of lowering the blood
      sugar too much. In addition, the best way to achieve this control is not known. Many strict
      nomograms that provide a standardized approach for nurses have been developed and validated,
      including one here at SMH. However, these nomograms cannot apply to all patients at all
      times, especially ICU patients whose needs are rapidly changing. ICU nurses are at the
      bedside constantly, are very familiar with their patient's needs, and have decades of
      experience in titrating medication doses without a nomogram to achieve a pre-determined
      response (i.e. medications to achieve pre-selected blood pressure). Indeed, once the bedside
      nurse has bought into the importance of the concept of tight glucose control and have been
      introduced to the nomogram here at SMH, their experience and intuition may be more adaptable
      to the changing needs of the patient than an inflexible paper nomogram. This study will
      compare glucose control using our current standard nomogram versus no nomogram (i.e. nurse
      directed) in order to determine whether the nomogram should continue to be used.
