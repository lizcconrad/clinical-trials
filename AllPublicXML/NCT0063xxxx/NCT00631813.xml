    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine which dose of prucalopride is safe and effective in
      patients with chronic constipation.

      Hypothesis:

      Prucalopride 1 and 2 mg bid are safe and effective for the treatment of chronic constipation
      whereas 0,5 mg is a suboptimal dose.

      This is a phase II trial with a parallel-group design, consisting of a drug-free run-in phase
      (phase 1), followed by a placebo controlled double-blind phase (phase 2). Patients will
      receive either R093877 0.5 mg b.i.d., 1 mg b.i.d. or 2 mg b.i.d. or placebo for a period of
      12 weeks.

      Phase 1 is a run-in period of 4 weeks duration, during which the bowel habit is documented
      and the existence of constipation confirmed. At the start of this period all existing
      laxative medication is withdrawn and patients will be instructed not to change their dietary
      habits, in particular their fiber intake during the trial. Patients will enter the
      double-blind phase if constipation has been shown to be present during the run-in period.

      If the definition of constipation was not met during the 4 weeks of the run-in period, the
      patient will be considered ineligible for the double-blind period.

      Phase 2 is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase, in which patients will be
      treated for 12 weeks with either 0.5 mg, 1 mg or 2 mg of R093877 or placebo given twice daily
      (one capsule is taken before breakfast and one is to be taken before the evening meal).

      Patients admitted to the double blind treatment period will be randomly allocated to one of
      the 4 treatment arms.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age between 18-70 years;

          2. History of constipation, i.e., the subject reported the occurrence of two or more of
             the following criteria for at least 6 months before the selection visit:

               -  two or fewer spontaneous* bowel movements a week,

               -  lumpy (scyballae) and/or hard stools at least ¼ of the stools,

               -  sensation of incomplete evacuation after at least ¼ of the stools,

               -  straining at defaecation at least ¼ of the time. *The above criteria were only
                  applicable for spontaneous bowel movements i.e., not preceded within a 24-hour
                  period by the intake of a laxative agent. Subjects who never had a spontaneous
                  bowel movement were considered constipated and eligible to enter the double-blind
                  phase of the trial.

          3. Constipation being severe and causing disability; the subject's occupational, social

          4. Normal inhibition pattern of the external anal sphincter during straining i.e.,
             relaxation of the m.puborectalis and a distal displacement of the rectal canal
             (digital examination and/or electromyographic and/or manometric evidence was
             acceptable);

          8. Availability for follow-up during the trial period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             causes of constipation other than idiopathic constipation, for instance: endocrine
             disorders, metabolic disorders, or neurologic disorders;

          3. Congenital megacolon/megarectum;

          4. History of previous abdominal surgery (other than hysterectomy, surgery for Meckel's
             diverticle, appendectomy, cholecystectomy, inguinal hernia repair, splenectomy,
             nephrectomy or fundoplication) thought to be the primary cause of constipation;

          5. Known or suspected organic disorders of the large bowel, i.e., obstruction, carcinoma
             or inflammatory bowel disease;

          6. Active proctological conditions thought to be responsible for the constipation;

          7. Presence of the following ECG abnormalities:

               -  2nd or 3rd degree of AV-block,

               -  prolonged QT-times (&gt; 460 ms),
