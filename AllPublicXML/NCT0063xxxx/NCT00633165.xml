  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, multicenter, open-label clinical trial designed to determine the efficacy
      and safety of Brostallicin when administered once every 3 weeks in patients with myxoid
      liposarcoma with (12;16) translocation. The primary objective of this study is to determine
      the response rate following Brostallicin administration.

               -  AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT) and alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 times ULN (if liver
                  metastases are present, then ≤ 5 × ULN is allowed).

          9. Acceptable renal function: For all patients serum creatinine within normal limits, OR
             calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) for patients with creatinine
             levels above institutional normal.

         10. Acceptable hematologic status:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1500 cells/mm(3) (1.5 ×10(9)/L)

               -  Platelet count ≥ 100,000 platelet/mm(3) (100 ×10(9)/L)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient received any of the following within the specified time period prior to
             initiation of treatment in this study:

               -  Chemotherapy, major surgery, significant traumatic injury, or irradiation,

                  previous 6 months

               -  Myocardial infarction within the past 6 months

               -  High-risk uncontrolled arrhythmias

               -  Angina pectoris that requires antianginal medication

               -  Has clinically significant valvular heart disease
