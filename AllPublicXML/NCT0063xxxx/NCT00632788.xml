    <description>For every patient fulfilling the criteria of enrollment, an acute myocardial infarction checklist was incorporated into the patient's medical records at emergency department immediately after a diagnosis of acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction was made. All the time sequences concerning different managements at different locations were recorded by nurses and/or physicians as instructions on the checklist.</description>

             intensive care unit for any reason

          -  patients who had an ambiguous diagnosis that the decision of emergency cardiac
             catheterization was made after admission to ward or intensive care unit
