    <textblock>
      Current therapy recommendations suggest a low protein diet to preserve residual renal
      function (RRF) before the start of dialysis, but a higher protein intake during dialysis to
      prevent protein-energy wasting (PEW). We conducted a randomized trial to test whether low
      protein intake also during treatment with peritoneal dialysis (PD) would be safe and
      associated with a preserved RRF.

    <textblock>
      Dietary protein is the major source of nitrogen excreted as urea by the kidney, and a
      decreased protein intake has been associated with a retardation of kidney function loss in
      non-dialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. While a low protein diet is recommended
      to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients before the start of dialysis to preserve residual
      renal function(RRF), current therapy recommendations in dialysis are for a normal protein
      intake of no less than 1.2 g of protein/kg ideal body weight (IBW)/day to prevent
      protein-energy wasting (PEW).

      We hypothesized that a lower protein intake would be safe and able to slow the loss of RRF
      also in dialysis patients and conducted two prospective, randomized trials involving a total
      of 94 peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients to test our hypothesis.
