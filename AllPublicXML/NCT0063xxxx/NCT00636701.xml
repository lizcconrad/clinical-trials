    <textblock>
      We hope to understand the properties of the motor cortex in the brain of people with stroke
      using non-invasive magnetic stimulation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This case series assesses the effects of five consecutive days of low‐frequency (1 Hz)
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) with and without a 6‐Hz primer. Although
      this paper studies able‐bodied individuals, similar rTMS protocols are used to facilitate
      motor recovery in patients with hemiplegia following stroke. However, the cortical mechanisms
      associated with repeated daily doses of rTMS are not completely understood.

    <measure>Percentage BOLD (Blood-oxygen-level Dependent Contrast Imaging) Signal From Baseline at 2 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (day 0) and 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Blood-oxygen-level dependent contrast imaging, or BOLD-contrast imaging, is a method used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to observe different areas of the brain or other organs, which are found to be active at any given time. In 1990, three papers published by Seiji Ogawa and colleagues showed that haemoglobin has different magnetic properties in its oxygenated and deoxygenated forms, both of which could be detected using MRI. This leads to magnetic signal variation which can be detected using an MRI scanner. Given many repetitions of a thought, action or experience, statistical methods can be used to determine the areas of the brain which reliably have more of this difference as a result, and therefore which areas of the brain are active during that thought, action or experience. The percentage BOLD was measures at day 0 and day two weeks. We measured the change in the dependent measure from day 0 to day 2 weeks .</description>
