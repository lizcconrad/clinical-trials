      The purpose of this study is to test a drug called d-cycloserine to see if it can help people
      with a condition called social phobia. Social phobia is also called &quot;social anxiety
      disorder.&quot; Social phobia is a constant fear of social or performance situations. Social
      situations include group gatherings of any kind. Performance situations might include times
      when a person would have to do something in public, such as speak up in class or at a
      meeting. A person with this condition worries about being embarrassed, or about other
      people's opinions. People with social phobia usually feel extremely anxious (nervous and
      worried) about being the focus of attention. They often avoid social and performance
      situations. This behavior can have a negative effect on the quality of their lives and
      relationships.

      In this study, we want to find out if d-cycloserine can help control social phobia when the
      drug is added to the standard treatment for this condition. The standard treatment is
      cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT). CBT is a form of talk therapy involving discussion with a
      therapist, along with practicing the feelings or events that the person finds frightening.

      Inclusion criteria:

        1. Age 18 or older

        2. Primary diagnosis of SAD

        3. Physical examination, electrocardiogram, and laboratory findings without clinically
           significant abnormalities.

        4. Willingness and ability to comply with the requirements of the study protocol.

      Diagnostic Exclusion Criteria:

        1. A lifetime history of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, psychosis, delusional disorders
           or obsessive-compulsive disorder; an eating disorder in the past 6 months; organic brain
           syndrome, mental retardation or other cognitive dysfunction that could interfere with
           capacity to engage in therapy; a history of substance or alcohol abuse or dependence
           (other than nicotine) in the last 6 months or otherwise unable to commit to refraining
           from alcohol use during the acute period of study participation.

        2. Patients with posttraumatic stress disorder within the past 6 months are excluded. Entry
           of patients with other mood or anxiety disorders will be permitted if the social anxiety
           disorder is judged to be the predominant disorder, in order to increase accrual of a
           clinically relevant sample. Patients with significant suicidal ideation (MADRS item 10
           score &gt; 3) or who have enacted suicidal behaviors within 6 months prior to intake will
           be excluded from study participation and referred for appropriate clinical intervention.

        3. Patients must be off concurrent psychotropic medication (e.g., antidepressants,
           anxiolytics, beta blockers) for at least 2 weeks prior to initiation of randomized
           treatment.

        4. Significant personality dysfunction likely to interfere with study participation.

        5. Serious medical illness or instability for which hospitalization may be likely within
           the next year.

        6. Patients with a current or past history of seizures

        7. Pregnant women, lactating women, and women of childbearing potential who are not using
           medically accepted forms of contraception (e.g., IUD, oral contraceptives, barrier
           devices, condoms and foam, or implanted progesterone rods stabilized for at least 3
           months).

        8. Any concurrent psychotherapy initiated within 3 months of baseline, or ongoing
           psychotherapy of any duration directed specifically toward treatment of the GSAD is
           excluded. Prohibited psychotherapy includes CBT or psychodynamic therapy focusing on
           exploring specific, dynamic causes of the phobic symptomatology and provides management
           skills. General supportive therapy initiated &gt; 3 months prior is acceptable.

        9. Prior non-response to adequately-delivered exposure (i.e., as defined by the patient's
           report of receiving specific and regular exposure assignments as part of a previous
           treatment) will exclude participants from the study.

       10. Patients with a history of head trauma causing loss of consciousness, seizure or ongoing
           cognitive impairment.

       11. Patients receiving isoniazid.

       12. Patients unable to understand study procedures and participate in the informed consent
           process.

    <measure>Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 13</time_frame>
    <description>The Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) is a 24-item measure designed to assess both fear and avoidance of social and performance situations occurring in the last week. Each item is rated from 0-3 for both fear and avoidance with a possible score of 144; 55-65 Moderate social phobia, 65-80 Marked social phobia, 80-95 Severe social phobia, and Greater than 95 - Very severe social phobia. Remission was defined as a score of &lt; 30 on the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale</description>

    <description>The Clinician Global Impression-Improvement Scale (CGI-I) is a clinician-rated instrument used to assess global severity of symptoms. The CGI-I ranges from 1 (&quot;very much improved&quot;) to 7 (&quot;very much worse&quot;). Response and remission was defined as an improvement score of 1 (&quot;very much improved&quot;) or 2 (&quot;much improved&quot;) on the CGI-I.</description>

    <description>The patient will then receive 12 weekly sessions of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy lasting approximately two and a half hours each. During these sessions, patients will receive information on the nature of social phobia and a model of treatment and will receive weekly training in how to become more comfortable with social situations, with the goal of achieving confidence in social interactions. As part of this training, the therapist will practice social interactions with the patient, who will also be asked to practice what they have learned outside of the therapists' office.</description>

A physician will be available in the unlikely event that a patient begins to experience side effects. Before the treatment starts, before the eighth session, and one week after the final session patients will have a separate visit in which their levels of symptoms assessed with measures of mood, anxiety, and avoidance.</description>
