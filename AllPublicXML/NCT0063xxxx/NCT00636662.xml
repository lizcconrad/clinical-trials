      The purpose of this clinical study is to obtain clearance for the nasal swab sample type by
      demonstrating the performance characteristics of the FLU A+B Test versus standard laboratory
      culture for Influenza A and B viruses using nasal swab samples.

        Nasal swab samples will be collected from subjects suspected of having influenza infections
        and onset has occurred within 3 days of examination. Across the sites these samples will be
        drawn from an approximately 60% pediatric patients (&lt;21 years), and 40% adult patients (&gt;21
        years) and it is expected that the population will be divided approximately equally between
        males and females.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and Female of all age groups

          -  Patients exhibiting influenza symptoms (i.e., fever, body aches, headaches, cough,
             sore throat, and other respiratory symptoms) at the time of examination

          -  Patients must either present with a fever (&gt;100ºF; &gt;37.8ºC) at time of examination or
             have had a fever (&gt;100ºF; &gt;37.8ºC) or declare at time of the examination that they had
             a fever within the previous 3 days prior to the examination

          -  Must be able to collect sample using the nasal swab sample type

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with no fever at time of examination or within the 3 days prior to
             examination and/or are currently undergoing treatment (including anti-virals) will be
             excluded from the study.
