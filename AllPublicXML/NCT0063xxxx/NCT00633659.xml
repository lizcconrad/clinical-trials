    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of Hemospan infusion on vascular
      reactivity, regional perfusion and oxygenation of ischemic tissue in patients with chronic
      critical lower limb ischemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hemospan® is a novel hemoglobin-based oxygen carrier developed to perfuse and oxygenate
      tissue at risk for ischemia and hypoxia. Because of its molecular size and oxygen binding
      characteristics, Hemospan selectively off-loads oxygen in tissues predisposed to low oxygen
      tension. Preclinical evidence suggests that Hemospan provides volume expansion and enhances
      tissue perfusion. Hemospan is therefore being developed as an oxygen-carrying plasma expander
      for patients where tissues are at risk of inadequate perfusion and oxygenation.

      In patients with chronic critical lower limb ischemia (CCLI), the primary cause of ischemic
      symptoms in the leg is insufficient perfusion. As many of the patients suffering from CCLI
      are elderly and have concomitant disease, surgical procedures may not always be possible. The
      goal of all treatments is to improve the blood flow in the nutritional vessels of the
      ischemic areas; one such possibility may be to use an oxygen-carrying plasma expander.

      Hemospan has been shown to improve the oxygenation of tissues by preserving functional
      capillary density. In addition, Hemospan has a high affinity for oxygen - a feature that is
      specifically designed to target the unloading of oxygen in the microcirculation where local
      PO2 levels are much lower (e.g., in ischemic regions). Since Hemospan is a cell-free oxygen
      carrier, it should be able to perfuse capillaries that are so constricted that red blood
      cells are unable to flow through them.
