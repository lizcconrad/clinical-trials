  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Develop a tool to objectively quantify technical skills necessary to perform diagnostic
      cystoscopy (using Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills- OSATS).

      Develop criteria by which surgeons skills in diagnostic cystoscopy can be evaluated or
      judged.

      Develop an intervention (1.5 hour workshop) which can be replicated by other residency
      programs in order to enhance learning of diagnostic cystoscopy. The workshop should be
      adequate for practicing Gynecologists as well as they already have experience with diagnostic
      hysteroscopy which uses many of the same concepts.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The OSATS and a written examination will be used to assess residents skills and knowledge
      pertinent to diagnostic urethrocystoscopy. All residents will be tested on anatomic replica
      of human bladder for baseline competency using the above tools. Then approximately half will
      be randomly selected to undergo an educational intervention (a workshop teaching diagnostic
      urethrocystoscopy). As we are interested in short-term acquisition, about a week later all
      residents will be retested using the same methods. Grades on the exam will be kept
      confidential.
