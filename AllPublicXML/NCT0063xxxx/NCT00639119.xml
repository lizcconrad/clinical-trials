  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The progressive myoclonus epilepsy of the Unverricht-Lundborg disease (ULD) type is an
      autosomal recessive disease characterized by progressive stimulus-sensitive and
      action-related myoclonic jerks.

      The mainstay of the current treatment in myoclonic epilepsies including ULD are valproic acid
      and clonazepam among several other antiepileptic drugs. Unfortunately the disease may often
      be resistant to antiepileptic drugs leading to major reductions in daily activities and
      disability to walk without assistance. Therefore new treatment modalities are needed.
      Experimental treatments of ULD patients with dopamine agonists have relieved myoclonic
      symptoms. Further, in accordance with this, a recent study indicates decreased dopaminergic
      neurotransmission in the basal ganglia of ULD patients, determined by PET.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of dopaminergic medication (ropinirole
      hydrochloride, Requip Â®) on relieving the symptoms of ULD patients. Patients will undergo
      sixteen weeks intervention period. The main efficacy determinants are changes in unified
      myoclonus rating scale (UMRS), nerve conduction, multi-modality evoked potentials including
      visual evoked potential (VEP), somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) and brainstem auditory
      evoked potential (BAEP), blink reflex habituation and electroencephalography (EEG).
      Tolerability and the safety of the medication are determined. The study setting is placebo
      controlled, crossover, two-group and double blind study.
