  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the presence, degree, time course and profile of
      opioid withdrawal symptoms associated with induction onto new formulations of buprenorphine
      or buprenorphine/naloxone in persons with active opioid dependence. The primary outcome
      measure is the severity of withdrawal symptoms measured using the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal
      Scale (COWS). The primary study hypothesis is that neither drug formulation will precipitate
      an opioid withdrawal syndrome.

    <textblock>
      Buprenorphine sublingual and buccal soluble films are being developed to be used for the same
      indication and over the same buprenorphine dose range as Subutex and Suboxone sublingual
      tablets in the treatment of opioid dependence. However, only films administered by the
      sublingual route were evaluated in this study.

      The soluble film dosage is expected to provide the following enhancements and potential
      advantages over the current Subutex and Suboxone product:

        -  Mitigation against unintentional pediatric exposure by providing child-resistant
           packaging in unit dose format.

        -  Improvement in subject convenience and compliance by ensuring rapid disintegration.

        -  Protection against diversion by providing a dosage form that is very difficult for the
           subject to remove from the sublingual or buccal mucosa after administration. This
           provides assurance to the caregiver that the dose has actually been taken appropriately
           in a supervised setting.

        -  Provision of a unit dose product format for hospital and institutional use.

        -  Decreased product damage during shipping as compared to Subutex and Suboxone tablets.

    <measure>Severity of Withdrawal Symptoms Measured Using the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) at Baseline and the Peak COWS up to 23.5 Hours After the First Administration</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline: 30 minutes prior to first administration on Day 1. Peak: up to 23.5 hours post administration on Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The COWS is an 11-item instrument used to assess symptoms of opioid withdrawal (Wesson et al., 1999). The score is the sum of the response to each of the 11 items and cover a range of 0-48. The COWS is commonly used by clinicians treating patients with buprenorphine to monitor the severity of withdrawal. COWS scores below 5 are considered not indicative of withdrawal. Scores from 5 to 12 are considered mild withdrawal; from 13 to 24 moderate withdrawal; 25 to 36 moderate/severe withdrawal, and 37-48 severe withdrawal.
The baseline COWS was the score obtained 30 minutes prior to administration of soluble films on Day 1. Peak COWS was the highest COWS score obtained between 1-23.5 hours post administration on Day 1.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>During screening run-in, subjects received 30 mg morphine subcutaneously up to 4 times/day for up to 13 days. Subjects underwent two test sessions, consisting of a challenge of naloxone (0.4 mg) or placebo intramuscularly and evaluation for the severity of withdrawal. Subjects able to detect withdrawal were randomized to treatment.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Severity of Withdrawal Symptoms Measured Using the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) at Baseline and the Peak COWS up to 23.5 Hours After the First Administration</title>
        <description>The COWS is an 11-item instrument used to assess symptoms of opioid withdrawal (Wesson et al., 1999). The score is the sum of the response to each of the 11 items and cover a range of 0-48. The COWS is commonly used by clinicians treating patients with buprenorphine to monitor the severity of withdrawal. COWS scores below 5 are considered not indicative of withdrawal. Scores from 5 to 12 are considered mild withdrawal; from 13 to 24 moderate withdrawal; 25 to 36 moderate/severe withdrawal, and 37-48 severe withdrawal.
The baseline COWS was the score obtained 30 minutes prior to administration of soluble films on Day 1. Peak COWS was the highest COWS score obtained between 1-23.5 hours post administration on Day 1.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline: 30 minutes prior to first administration on Day 1. Peak: up to 23.5 hours post administration on Day 1</time_frame>
        <population>Per protocol, the evaluable population includes all subjects randomized to the study who completed the study through the first two days of soluble films administration and assessments for 23.5 hours after the first day of soluble films administration.</population>

        <title>Severity of Withdrawal Symptoms Measured Using the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) at the End of Induction and the Peak COWS Post Induction</title>
        <description>The COWS is an 11-item instrument used to assess symptoms of opioid withdrawal (Wesson et al., 1999). The score is the sum of the response to each of the 11 items and cover a range of 0-48. The COWS is commonly used by clinicians treating patients with buprenorphine to monitor the severity of withdrawal. COWS scores below 5 are considered not indicative of withdrawal. Scores from 5 to 12 are considered mild withdrawal; from 13 to 24 moderate withdrawal; 25 to 36 moderate/severe withdrawal, and 37-48 severe withdrawal.
The end of induction COWS was the score obtained 47.5 hours after first administration of soluble films on Day 1. Peak post induction COWS was the highest COWS score obtained on Days 2-5.</description>

        <title>Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Score at Baseline and the Peak (Maximum Increase) VAS up to 23.5 Hours After First Administration for the Question: &quot;How High Are You?&quot;</title>
        <description>A visual analog scale (VAS) was used by participants to answer the subjective question, &quot;How high are you?&quot;. The question was one of six used to measure the extent of opioid blockade following study intervention. VAS questions were selected based on previous demonstration of their sensitivity to opioid agonist and antagonist effects (Preston et al., 1988). Participants indicated how high they feel by marking a score on a horizontal line with 0=not high and 100=extremely high.
The baseline VAS was the score obtained 30 minutes prior to administration of soluble films on Day 1. Peak VAS was the highest VAS score obtained between 1-23.5 hours post administration on Day 1.</description>

The question was one of six used to measure the extent of opioid blockade following study intervention. VAS questions were selected based on previous demonstration of their sensitivity to opioid agonist and antagonist effects (Preston et al., 1988). Participants indicated how high they feel by marking a score on a horizontal line with 0=no bad effects and 100=maximum bad effects.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline: 30 minutes prior to first administration on Day 1. Peak: up to 23.5 hours post administration on Day 1</time_frame>
        <population>Per protocol, the evaluable population includes all subjects randomized to the study who completed the study through the first two days of soluble films administration and assessments for 23.5 hours after the first day of soluble films administration.</population>

        <title>Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Scores at End of Induction Period and the Post-induction Period (Maximum Increase) for the Question: “Do You Feel Any Drug Effect?”</title>
        <description>A visual analog scale (VAS) was used by participants to answer the subjective question, “Do you feel any drug effect?”. The question was one of six used to measure the extent of opioid blockade following study intervention. VAS questions were selected based on previous demonstration of their sensitivity to opioid agonist and antagonist effects (Preston et al., 1988). Participants indicated how high they feel by marking a score on a horizontal line with 0=no effect and 100=maximum effect.</description>

        <title>Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Scores at End of Induction Period and the Post-induction Period (Maximum Increase) for the Question: “Does the Drug Make You Sick?”</title>
        <description>A visual analog scale (VAS) was used by participants to answer the subjective question, “Does the drug make you sick?”. The question was one of six used to measure the extent of opioid blockade following study intervention. VAS questions were selected based on previous demonstration of their sensitivity to opioid agonist and antagonist effects (Preston et al., 1988). Participants indicated how high they feel by marking a score on a horizontal line with 0=no effect and 100=maximum effect.</description>

        <population>Per protocol, the evaluable population includes all subjects randomized to the study who completed the study through the first two days of soluble films administration and assessments for 23.5 hours after the first day of soluble films administration.</population>
