    <textblock>
      A cluster randomized controlled trial. Twenty health care service sites were randomly
      assigned to the intervention or control groups. Health care workers of the intervention
      health care service sites received training based on the programme &quot;Ten steps for healthy
      feeding for children from birth to two years old&quot;.

      Pregnant women, in their third term, were enrolled in the study. At 6 and 12 months of age,
      the mothers were interviewed at home using a semi-structured questionnaire with pre-coded
      close- and open-ended questions and the children were evaluated.

      When the children are 3 years old, the mothers will be interviewed at home again and the
      mothers and the children will be evaluated.
