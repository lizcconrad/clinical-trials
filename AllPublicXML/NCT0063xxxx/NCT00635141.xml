      This study is examining the effect of hypertonic saline compared to placebo on the Lung
      Clearance Index in Cystic Fibrosis patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The life expectancy of patients with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) has greatly increased over time due
      to improved clinical care. While this is certainly beneficial to CF patients, the overall
      stability in lung function has made it more difficult to assess the effect of therapeutic
      interventions. Currently, FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 second) remains the primary
      outcome measure for most clinical trials, but many CF patients have normal pulmonary function
      and the annual rate of decline is now less than 2% in large specialized centres. Therefore,
      additional parameters are needed that are more sensitive parameters to define abnormalities
      in CF patients and be used in therapeutic trials.

      One such promising parameter is the Lung Clearance Index (LCI). The LCI is a test to quantify
      ventilation inhomogeneity by assessing the washout of an inhaled inert gas. Abnormalities in
      gas clearance from the lung are largely due to retention of inhaled gases due to mucous
      obstruction in the lower airways.

      Interventions that improve mucus accumulation are expected to improve the LCI. Hypertonic
      saline has been shown to increase airway surface liquid (ASL), mucociliary clearance and
      pulmonary function. Therefore, this study will examine the effect of hypertonic saline
      compared to placebo on the Lung Clearance Index in Cystic Fibrosis patients.
