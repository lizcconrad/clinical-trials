    <textblock>
      This study provides compassionate use of bicalutamide (Casodex) at a 150-mg dose for subjects
      with prostate cancer prior to it becoming commercially available. The patient will receive
      bicalutamide 150-mg as long as the physician feels that the subject is benefiting from this
      therapy and safety information is provided regularly to AstraZeneca. Treatment will be
      discontinued after bicalutamide 150-mg becomes commercially available.
