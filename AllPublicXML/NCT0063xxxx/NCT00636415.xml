      CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Osteoarthritis causes pain and disability in a high percentage of
      elderly people. The aim of the present study was to compare the analgesic effect of
      intra-articular bupivacaine and morphine in patients with knee osteoarthritis.

      DESIGN AND SETTING: A randomized and double-blind study was performed at a Pain Clinic of São
      Paulo Federal University.

      METHODS: Thirty-nine patients with pain for more than 3 months and an intensity higher than 3
      on a numerical scale (zero to 10) were included. G1 patients received 1 mg (1 ml) morphine
      diluted in 9 ml saline by the intra-articular route, and G2 patients received 25 mg (10 ml)
      0.25% bupivacaine without epinephrine. Pain was assessed on a numerical scale and knee
      flexion and extension angles were measured after administration of the drugs at rest and
      during movement. The total amount of analgesic complementation with 500 mg paracetamol was
      also determined.

      Among the 39 patients selected, two patients from group 1 and five from group 2 were excluded
      from some of the analyses because they did not return on the day of assessment or because
      they used a complementary analgesic different from that standardized in the study
