  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Polyflux HD-C4 (Gambro Renal Products) is a new dialyzer based on the existing Polyflux H
      membrane and dialyzer technology, but which achieves a performance comparable to Polyflux
      210H in a significantly smaller device.

      The objectives of this study are:

        1. To compare and contrast small and large molecule removal by the Polyflux HD-C4 and
           Polyflux 210H dialyzers under conditions of routine hemodialysis; and,

        2. To compare and contrast the ease of use of the Polyflux HD-C4 dialyzer with that of the
           Polyflux 210H under conditions of routine clinical use for hemodialysis.

    <measure>Comparison of Urea Removal Under Conditions of Routine Hemodialysis.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks = duration required for each subject to complete 6 consecutive dialysis treatments</time_frame>
    <description>Urea removal is correlated with successful clinical outcomes. Kt/V is a way of measuring the delivered dose of dialysis where K=clearance of urea, t=treatment time and V=volume of body water. Single-pool (sp) Kt/V assumes that urea is removed from a single compartment in the human body during dialysis. However, because there are multiple compartments in the human body, rebound occurs following hemodialysis which lowers the Kt/V. Equilibrated (e) Kt/V is an equation that has been devised to predict the amount of rebound based on the ratio of K/V. Outcomes are posted for both spKt/V and eKt/V.</description>

    <measure>A Comparison of Pre- to Post-dialysis Reduction of Small and Large Molecules Under Conditions of Routine Hemodialysis.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks = duration required for each subject to complete 6 consecutive dialysis treatments</time_frame>
    <description>Overall removal of urea, phosphorus and β2-microglobulin was determined from the pre- to post-dialysis change in plasma concentration and from the amount of solute recovered in the dialysate. This outcome measure is reported as the percentage of pre- to post-dialysis reduction of urea, phosphorus and β2-microglobulin.</description>
