    <textblock>
      The Stroke Rehabilitation Assessment of Movement (STREAM) is a relatively new measurement
      tool, which measures specific movement deficits (impairments) caused by a stroke. The STREAM
      is used to evaluate recovery of voluntary movement and basic mobility following the onset of
      a stroke. Several important clinical measurement properties of the STREAM remain to be
      explored, including its ability to measure impairments and clinical change in acute
      rehabilitation patients in the USA. We hypothesize that the STREAM will be able to detect and
      quantify a statistically significant change in the motor abilities of stroke patients from
      admission to discharge. An additional aim of the study is to compare the STREAM with two
      accepted and widely used clinical measures of function and disability, the Stroke Impact
      Scale (SIS)and the Functional Independence Measure (FIM). By linking movement deficits that
      are commonly assessed by physical therapists with measures of function and disability, the
      impact of the movement deficits can be understood.

    <description>The STREAM measures quality of movements in the arm and leg, and the quality of mobility during important functional tasks, such as walking 10 feet. There are 10 items for each of the 3 assessments (arm, leg and mobility), resulting in a total of 30 items. Each item is rated on a scale of 0 = unable to perform, to 2 or 3 = normal movement. Ratings on the 30 items are added together for a total score which is divided by the total number of items resulting in a percentage score: minimum=0, maximum=100, range=100 The score reported is mean +/- standard deviation of discharge STREAM scores.</description>
