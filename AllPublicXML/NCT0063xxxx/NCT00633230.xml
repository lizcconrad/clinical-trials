  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to (1) determine the effects of the herbal formula Sho-saiko-to
      (SST) compared to placebo in treating hepatitis C virus (HCV) in persons who have not
      responded to the current conventional therapy (peginterferon alfa and ribavirin) or who have
      relapsed or in those for whom conventional therapy is contraindicated; (2) determine the
      influence that SST will have on participant reports of depression/sadness, fear and
      uncertainty related to the HCV disease progression, and renewal of hope in these individuals;
      and (3) collect preliminary data needed to examine feasibility, patient acceptance, and any
      potential limitations of the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Persons infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) suffer from multiple symptoms caused by both
      the disease and the current conventional treatment (peginterferon alfa and ribavirin) if they
      can tolerate the treatment or have no contraindications to taking it. Most HCV-infected
      individuals eventually develop chronic liver disease that may progress to complications such
      as hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatic decompensation, and cirrhosis. What is not known is
      whether or not modulation of the HCV disease using the standardized herbal formulation
      Sho-saiko-to (SST), 3 capsules containing 700 mg of the SST herbal extract/capsule and 28 mg
      of the excipients, magnesium stearate and silicon dioxide/capsule 2 times a day, over 12
      weeks might reduce or prevent the prevalence and severity of liver deterioration and
      symptoms. Thus, the objectives of this project are to: (a) demonstrate quantitatively in a
      sample of persons infected with HCV expected SST treatment-driven changes in serum levels of
      liver enzymes, viral load, and CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell counts by longitudinal statistical
      modeling, and to correlate these to the severity of individual symptoms, liver enzyme levels,
      and CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells as measured at screening, 4, 8, and 12 weeks; (b) examine in vitro
      the response of a line of HCV-infected cells to the standardized herbal formulation; and (c)
      assess the mechanism by which the herbal formulation may affect the HCV-infected cells in
      vitro. Taken together, the clinical and laboratory components of the study should provide a
      strong test of our primary hypothesis that compared to placebo a standardized combined herbal
      formulation, SST, will reduce viral load, liver enzymes, and improve CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell
      counts in persons infected with HCV who did not respond or have relapsed after peginterferon
      alfa and ribavirin or in those for whom this conventional therapy is contraindicated. Our
      long-term objectives are to identify the basic mechanisms underlying chronic HCV
      infection-related cytokines and immune mediators and to provide a rationale for
      mechanism-driven SST disease treatment. Confirming the effect of SST in chronic HCV infection
      will create a foundation for a potentially supportive approach to managing HCV
      disease-related and treatment-related symptoms. Ability to reduce liver damage or even
      prevent the side effects of conventional therapy through the use of a standardized herbal
      formula, SST, would be of potential benefit to thousands of persons infected with HCV by
      providing an herbal treatment when the current conventional therapy is not effective or is
      contraindicated.
