  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinically, iodinated contrast-medium (CM) is widely used in angiography and computerized
      tomography. CM-induced nephropathy (CMIN) is one major complication after application of CM.
      Therefore, how to prevent CMIN is always one of the hot topics concerned by nephrologists,
      cardiologists, and radiologists.

      The present study is aimed to determine the norepinephrine concentration, oxidative markers,
      and tubular damage markers in the urine samples of patients undergoing intravenous
      pyelography (IVP).

      The working hypothesis is high-osmolarity contrast media (HOCM) causes more oxidative stress
      and greater tubular damage than iso-osmolarity contrast media (IOCM).
