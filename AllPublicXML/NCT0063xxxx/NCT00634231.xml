  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the administration of AdV-tk followed by valacyclovir in children
      with malignant glioma, including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and anaplastic astrocytoma
      (AA), as well as recurrent ependymomas in combination with radiation therapy. The primary
      objective is to determine if this approach is safe and can be effectively delivered without
      disturbing standard therapy.

      This is an Open label, Phase I, dose escalation study. Patients will receive an injection of
      AdV-tk into the tumor or tumor bed during the surgical procedure followed by 14 days of
      anti-herpetic prodrug, valacyclovir, starting 1-3 days after vector injection. Standard
      radiotherapy will begin 3-7 days after AdV-tK injection. Standard chemotherapy may begin
      after completion of valacyclovir at the discretion of the treating physician and family. Two
      dose levels of AdV-tk will be evaluated with a fixed dose of valacyclovir.
