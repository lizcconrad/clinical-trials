  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to gather data on feasibility and on immune and clinical efficacy
      of intratumoral dendritic cell (DC) vaccination in combination with local radiotherapy in
      patients with recurrent lymphoma
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lymphoma is extremely sensitive to radiation and is a commonly used therapy. The major issue
      in application of local radiotherapy is the relative short duration of response and as a
      consequence is used mainly for palliation. Therefore novel therapies are needed to improve
      the outcome of patients with lymphomas. The potential specificity of the immune system to
      recognize and eliminate tumor cells is especially relevant in lymphoma. Immune responses are
      induced, coordinated and regulated by dendritic cells (DCs), the most potent
      antigen-presenting cells. Based on the central role of DCs in initiating immune responses,
      four vaccinations will be administered at intervals beginning two days after low dose
      radiation is given to the tumor site.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Biopsy confirmed recurrent lymphoma of any initial stage, either Hodgkin's lymphoma or
             the B cell or T cell NHL of an indolent nature. For B cell lymphoma, follicular
             lymphoma, small lymphocytic lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma, and those indolent
             patients with mantle cell lymphoma or diffuse large B cell lymphoma will be included.
             For T cell lymphoma, the patients with indolent cutaneous T cell lymphomas (mycosis
             fungoides or primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma) who have failed or have
             been intolerant of one systemic or two topical treatments will be included.

          -  Patients must have failed at least one line of prior treatment but not more than four
             (including autologous but not allogeneic stem cell transplant).

          -  Patients must have at least one site of disease that is accessible for intratumoral
             injection of DCs percutaneously after palliative local radiotherapy

          -  Tumor specimens must be available for immunological studies either from a previous
             biopsy or a new biopsy obtained before the initiation of the treatment.

          -  Patients must have measurable disease other than the injection site or biopsy site.

          -  18 years of age or older.
