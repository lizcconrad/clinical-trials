  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following mastectomy (removal of your breast), reconstruction of your breast(s) can be
      performed using tissue expanders and implants. At the same operation as your mastectomy, a
      tissue expander is put under the skin and muscles of your chest.

      Following your surgery, the tissue expander is gradually filled with salt water over a period
      of months. Once the expander is filled to the size of your new breast, a second operation is
      performed. At this time, the tissue expander is removed and a permanent breast implant is
      placed. This is a standard procedure. We are interested in learning about the use of AlloDerm
      in breast reconstruction. AlloDerm can be used instead of some of your own chest muscles, in
      order to cover and protect a tissue expander. We want to know if the use of AlloDerm can
      decrease your pain or discomfort after surgery and after the filling of your tissue expander.

      AlloDerm is made from human tissue. When AlloDerm is made all the cells that could cause your
      body to reject it are removed. When it is placed in your chest, your own cells will then grow
      into the AlloDerm, causing it to act like the muscle it is replacing. In this study, you will
      either have reconstruction with AlloDerm or without AlloDerm.
