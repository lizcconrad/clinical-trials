    <textblock>
      In this two-year study, we will target two high risk groups, including MSM of HIV-infected
      and those of non-HIV-infected. We will avail the serodiagnosis to detect the potential amebic
      carriers in both groups; and use microscopy to detect protozoas other than amebiasis.
      Meanwhile we will also survey the patients' status of sexual transmitted diseases (STD). For
      the amebic carriers, we will apply specific antigen and molecular biologic method to follow
      up the duration of the persistence of fecal amebas. We try to clarify the dynamic change of
      amebic carriage.

      HIV-infected persons who are men having sex with men (MSM) are prone to acquire invasive
      amebiasis. It would cast great threat for public health if the pathogens are spread by way of
      human to human transmission and food contamination.

      From 2000 to 2004, we assessed the seroprevalence of Entamoeba histolytica infection using
      indirect hemagglutination antibody (IHA) assay among 667 HIV-infected persons (group 1), 1311
      asymptomatic HIV-uninfected persons seeking anonymous HIV testing (group 2), 616
      HIV-uninfected controls with gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea and/or liver abscess)
      seeking medical care (group 3), and 2500 healthy controls undergoing health check-up (group
      4). An IHA titer greater than 128 was detected in 7.1% of group 1, 2.5% of group 2, 1.8% of
      group 3, and 0.1% of group 4 (p&lt;0.0001). The highest seroprevalence (11.2%) was noted among
      HIV-infected persons who were MSM aged 30 to 39 years. Compared with persons with
      gastrointestinal symptoms, the adjusted odds ratio for having high IHA titers among
      HIV-infected persons was 3.206 (95% confidence interval, 1.433, 7.176) (p=0.005). These
      findings demonstrate that HIV-infected persons, especially MSM aged 30 to 39 years, are at
      significantly higher risk of E. histolytica infection.

      In this two-year study, we will target two high risk groups, including MSM of HIV-infected
      and those of non-HIV-infected. We will avail the serodiagnosis to detect the potential amebic
      carriers in both groups; and use microscopy to detect protozoas other than amebiasis.
      Meanwhile we will also survey the patients' status of sexual transmitted diseases (STD). For
      the amebic carriers, we will apply specific antigen and molecular biologic method to follow
      up the duration of the persistence of fecal amebas. We try to clarify the dynamic change of
      amebic carriage.

      We anticipate this study could outline the epidemiology and risk factors of protozoal
      infections and STD in MSM cohorts. We also hope to reduce the the infection rate (protozoa
      and HIV) and disease rate (STD) through the repetitively effective health education and
      consultation during the conduct of this study.
