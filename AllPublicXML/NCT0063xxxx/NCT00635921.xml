      Objective: The aim of this double-blind, placebo-controlled study was to evaluate the
      efficacy and tolerability of ziprasidone in the treatment of adult patients with Borderline
      Personality Disorder (BPD).

      Method: Sixty BPD patients were included in a 12-week, single-center, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study. The subjects were randomly assigned to ziprasidone or placebo in a
      1:1 ratio following a two-week baseline period. The Clinical Global Impression scale for use
      in BPD patients (CGI-BPD) was the primary outcome measure, and other scales and self-reports
      related to affect, behavior, psychosis, general psychopathology domains and clinical safety
      were included.

      The American Psychiatric Association (APA) Guidelines for the Treatment of Borderline
      personality disorder recommend that pharmacological treatment for BPD has an important
      adjunctive role, especially for diminution of symptoms such as affective instability,
      impulsivity, psychotic-like symptoms, and self-destructive behavior. Studies conducted with
      low doses of conventional antipsychotics have showed significant improvements in specific
      symptoms such as hostility, impulsiveness, mood, and psychotic symptoms.

      The introduction of atypical antipsychotics, with a more favorable tolerance profile,
      increases clinicians' options for treating BPD. Olanzapine has proven its efficacy in four
      double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients with BPD. Ziprasidone is an
      atypical antipsychotic with a pharmacological action on serotonergic, dopaminergic and
      adrenergic receptors. It has proven to be effective for schizophrenia, schizoaffective and
      acute mania disorders and the incidence of side effects is low.

      Although clinical findings and the pharmacological activity of ziprasidone suggest the drug
      may have therapeutic benefits in BPD patients, no controlled studies have yet been conducted
      in these patients. We carried out a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to
      evaluate efficacy and tolerability of ziprasidone in the management of BPD patients with
      moderate-high clinical severity.
