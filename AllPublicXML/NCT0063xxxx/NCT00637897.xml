      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle
      formulation, docetaxel,, paclitaxel, and ixabepilone work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
      Paricalcitol may help chemotherapy drugs to kill more tumor cells by making tumor cells more
      sensitive to the drugs.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the best dose and best way to give paricalcitol and
      to see how well it works when given together with chemotherapy in treating patients with
      metastatic breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the ability to administer 8 continuous weeks of therapy within the first 3
           months of enrollment with paricalcitol when given together with taxane or ixabepilone
           therapy in women with metastatic breast cancer.

        -  To estimate the proportion of patients who successfully complete 8 continuous weeks of
           therapy as well as the proportion of patients who achieve a 'steady-state' dose.

      Secondary

        -  To determine a dose of paricalcitol that can be taken continuously that maintains a
           normal calcium level when combined with a taxane or ixabepilone.

        -  To determine if baseline levels of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol and parathyroid hormone
           (PTH) are associated with time to treatment failure in these patients.

        -  To determine if PTH levels decline from baseline in patients treated with paricalcitol
           in combination with taxane or ixabepilone therapy.

      OUTLINE: Beginning on day 1, patients receive oral paricalcitol. The dose of paricalcitol is
      increased every 2 weeks until the serum calcium level is between 9 mg/dL and 11.4 mg/dL. Once
      this level is reached, the patient continues at that dose for the duration of the study.
      Patients also receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation, docetaxel, or
      paclitaxel once a week or once every 3 weeks or ixabepilone once every 3 weeks. Treatment
      continues for at least 12 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.
