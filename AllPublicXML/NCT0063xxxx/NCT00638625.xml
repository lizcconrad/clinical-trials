  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the features that the pathologist sees, when
      examining a lung tumor under the microscope, to the way that the tumor appears on the
      computed tomography (CT) scan. Features of the tumor may include abnormal blood vessels and
      areas in which tumor cells are dying. The samples that are taken during the needle biopsy
      contain information from one small part of the tumor. The investigators believe that they can
      show where in the tumor the samples came from, based on the CT scans during the biopsy
      procedure. If the investigators can accurately determine where in the tumor their samples
      came from, they can compare the features of that part of the tumor, as seen on the CT images,
      to the features of that part of the tumor as seen under the microscope. This research study
      also will give the investigators an idea of how much the biopsy samples are distorted in the
      process of preparing them for examination under the microscope.

      Newer cross-sectional imaging methods allow improved visualization of anatomic detail—for
      example, high-resolution CT has a spatial resolution of less than 1 mm in all 3 dimensions.
      These imaging methods also provide a limited amount of physiologic information—for example,
      tumor perfusion as demonstrated by enhancement with intravenous contrast agents.
      Radiologic-pathologic correlation in the current era gives us the opportunity to work on a
      finer spatial scale and to take advantage of the additional physiologic information.
      Pathologic assessment of tissue has evolved at the same time. Tissue can be stained in the
      traditional way for microscopic evaluation but newer tools such as immunohistochemistry and,
      most recently, methods of molecular biology can be applied as well.

      We are interested in radiologic-pathologic correlation in lung tumors. Tumors are known to be
      heterogeneous; we want to develop an approach that will allow us to explore their spatial
      organization. We cannot rely on surgical resection to provide tissue for pathologic
      evaluation, because the majority of lung lesions never come to resection. For example, only
      ~15% of lung cancer patients are surgical candidates. The remainder would be lost to the
      classical approach that depends on surgery. Percutaneous needle biopsy provides an
      alternative means of tissue sampling. This is a safe, effective and commonly used way to
      obtain samples of tissue (&quot;core samples&quot;) from any given lung mass. The pathologist can
      process these core samples in the same way as a surgical specimen.

        Study subjects will be recruited among patients who are referred for percutaneous needle
        biopsy of a suspected malignant lesion in the lung. Consecutive patients who meet the
        eligibility criteria will be offered enrollment until the study accrual target has been
        met.
