  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare the clinical, radiographic (x-ray) and
      cost effectiveness outcomes (cost relative to risks and benefits) of two different minimally
      invasive knee joint replacement surgical techniques. The primary study hypothesis is that in
      comparing total knee replacement performed with the two different surgical techniques that
      respect four minimally invasive surgery principles (low-profile instrumentation, &quot;minimally
      invasive&quot; incision, overall minimal knee surgical intervention), a faster return to function
      will result when the technique does not incise the tendon.
