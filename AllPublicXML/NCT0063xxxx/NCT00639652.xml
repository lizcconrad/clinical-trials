  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, we conduct a prospective, randomized trial comparing the outcome of surgical
      excision with the outcome of curettage in nodular and superficial BCCs. Larger BCCs and
      micronodular or sclerosing BCCs are not included in the randomized study. They are mainly
      operated using three-dimensional histology (3D-histology, micrographic surgery). In this
      observational study we measure the cosmetic result and the recurrence rate of all BCCs not
      included in the randomized trial.

      1. Disinfection

        2. Local anesthesia

        3. Surgery

        4. Dressing

        5. Preparation with paraffin for histopathologic evaluation

        6. Staining with hematoxylin-eosin

        7. Adjuvant radiotherapy is not applied in any of our patients.

        8. If histopathology discovers another tumor than BCC, the tumor is excluded.

        9. If recurrence is suspected, a punch biopsy is taken. If recurrence is confirmed, the
           endpoint is achieved.

       10. Patients who provide no feedback receive phone calls.

       11. The patient receives a letter containing a list of the BCCs treated within the study.
           She or he is asked to visit the private practitioner with the list after 12 and 48
           months (+/- 30 days) referring to the last operation in the recruitment period. The
           practitioner or the patient return the questionnaire to our department.

       12. The letter contains a questionnaire about suspicion of recurrence of BCC.

       13. The patient is asked to assess the esthetic outcome on a scale of excellent, good,
           satisfactory, mediocre, and poor.

       14. The physician is asked to assess the esthetic outcome on a scale of excellent, good,
           satisfactory, mediocre, and poor.

       15. When follow-up is closed for an individual patient, the reason is recorded:

             1. Planned end of follow-up after 48 months

             2. Patient has moved.

             3. Death (date of death)

             4. Consent withdrawn

             5. Meanwhile, the patient has become so ill or high-maintenance that no more follow-up
                visits can be planned.

             6. Recurrence of all of the patient's BCCs with histopathologic confirmation.

    <description>The tumor is marked at the 12 o'clock-position. Excision with a safety margin between 2 and 10 mm, depending on tumor size and location. Plastic reconstruction. Removal of the specimen's margins and base as thin layers, using a scalpel. These primarily three-dimensional layers of the specimen's borders are flattened to one level and microscopically screened for tumor cells. 3D-histology is combined with representative vertical sections for histologic diagnosis. Consecutive excisions are performed topographically at the tumor-positive areas and 3D-histology is repeated until tumor-free margins are obtained.</description>
