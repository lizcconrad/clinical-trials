  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK Biologicals is working on the development of a vaccine to protect elderly people from
      bacterial pneumonia. Diagnostic of bacterial pneumonia is difficult, and for the future
      studies in that project, it would be useful to have some easy non invasive tests. New
      clinical read-outs are needed to detect and identify the causative pathogen. These assays
      will be based on specific antigen detection in the urine or specific pathogen DNA detection
      in the blood. Technical and clinical validation of these assays will be realised at later
      stage with samples coming from epidemiological and/or phase III studies.

      To allow the development of such tests in GSK Biologicals laboratories, urine and blood
      samples are needed from subjects aged 65 or above who have diagnosed pneumonia.

      The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep
      2007.
