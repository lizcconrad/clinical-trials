      The purpose of this study is to characterize the cardiac adaptive changes of professional
      Israeli bicyclists by using echocardiography.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adaptive cardiac changes, such as enlargement of left ventricle mass and enlargement of left
      ventricular wall was observed in athletes. The physiological limit of remodeling changes in
      accordance to sex, type of activity, intensity of activity, genetics and race.

      Although many studies were conducted on this subject, it is still impossible to predict if an
      athlete from a certain sport will develop cardiac changes and their what will those changes
      characteristics will be.

      Sudden cardiac death is the leading cause of death among young athletes, this is because of
      high physical activity in the presence of a hidden heart disease, therefore there is much
      debate about the needed screening tests for athletes.

      In Israel, there is only one study in this subject that showed no significant cardiac changes
      in Olympic athletes of various types of sports. the study didn't focused on high endurance
      sport athletes such as professional bicyclists although cardiac endurance is a main factor in
      cardiac changes.
