      Summary

      Introduction: Insomnia is a symptom of sleep disorders most prevalent. Primary insomnia, the
      investigators analyzed, often related to stress states acquired, generalized anxiety and
      stress, which are important factors that disrupt normal sleep. The investigators point out a
      fact that still intrigue the students of medicine and sleep that is distorted perception of
      sleep by the sleepless nights, polysomnography shows greater effectiveness than that
      perceived by them. On the other hand, there is evidence that mindfulness techniques may
      reduce symptoms of stress and anxiety as well as improve the general attention, which may
      contribute to a better perception of the effectiveness of sleep. In addition, there are
      studies showing that meditation is associated with metabolic and neurophysiological
      characteristics similar to normal sleep. Objectives: To compare sleepless menopausal women
      trained for 8 weeks in the technique of mindfulness insomniac postmenopausal untrained and
      also assess the quality of sleep experienced meditators menopausal comparing them to the
      group of healthy postmenopausal women untrained in the art.

      Groups will be assessed by actigraphy, polysomnography and questionnaires for assessing
      stress, depression, anxiety, quality of life, self-pity, subjective states such as sedation
      and other physical or mental attitudes, vitality, emotional state and attentiveness.
      Moreover, prospective memory participants will be evaluated by means of a task as close as
      possible to real life conditions of the volunteers (green) and also the working memory is
      assessed by a test called specific counting span. Menopausal women will be evaluated for the
      presence or absence of bruxism compared to ordinary meditators, all postmenopausal.
