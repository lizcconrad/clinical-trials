  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Numerous factors can influence the processing of pain message: the affective or emotional,
      the sensorial and the cognitive components. Interindividual variations at the emotional and
      cognitive levels may interfere with the pain message and the consecutive behavior. Some
      modifications in these components are observed in psychiatric troubles, but their influences
      on the behavior to pain have not been studied, although they have been studied in some
      populations characterized as non communicating, with obvious cognitive degradations (subject
      with dementia, older, newborns,â€¦).In an other study in course, the past pain experience is
      explored in relation to results to experimental pain tests, emotional and anxious
      characteristics. This present pilot study aims at studying the infra-verbal behavioural signs
      during experimentally induced pain in subjects with schizophrenia, major depression, and
      controls.

      The objective is to search for behavioral non verbal indicators of pain during experimentally
      induced pain (pressure application, ischemia induction).

      Included subjects are subjected to experimental pain tests : pressure application (160 kPa)
      with an algometer to determine the pain with Visual Analogic Scale (VAS), and ischemia
      induction to determine the time needed to feel pain with an intensity equivalent to 3 with
      the VAS.

      Subjects are filmed during experimentation to identify the corporal mobility signs, facial
      expression signs and sonorous signs associated to pain stimulation.

      Neurophysiological measures complete these observations : surface electromyogram, heart rate
      measure, blood pressure.
