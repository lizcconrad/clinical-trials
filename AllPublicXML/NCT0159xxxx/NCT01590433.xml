  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting a study that will investigate the possible mechanisms of
      weight loss associated with exenatide treatment and the metabolic characteristics of high
      responders (i.e. subjects who achieve greater than 5% weight loss) to exenatide treatment.
      The investigators will also examine the magnitude and duration of weight loss among a cohort
      of high responders over 52 weeks of treatment, and at 3 and 6 months following treatment.

      Hypothesis:

      The mechanisms of weight loss with exenatide are not fully understood, and weight loss
      responses to exenatide are highly variable, possibly reflecting distinct metabolic
      parameters. By identifying and following a group of obese women who lose greater than 5% body
      weight after short-term exenatide treatment, the investigators can gain insights into the
      possible mechanisms of weight loss and assess long-term weight loss with this
      pharmacotherapeutic intervention.

      Primary Outcomes

      The primary objectives of this study is:

      - To investigate possible mechanisms and patterns of weight loss with exenatide treatment,
      especially among individuals who have robust early weight loss (greater than 5% weight loss
      in 12 weeks) with exenatide.

      Secondary Outcomes

      Our secondary objective is to identify metabolic characteristics that predict robust response
      to exenatide treatment.

      Outcome measurements:

        -  Weight

        -  Body composition

        -  Resting energy expenditure (REE)

        -  Mixed meal test

        -  Thermic effect of food

        -  Serum metabolic parameters

        -  Hunger/Nausea/Satiety visual analog scales (VAS)

        -  Physical activity monitoring

      Study Population

      The study population will be generally healthy, non-diabetic women age 18-70 years with BMI
      28-48 kg/m^2.
