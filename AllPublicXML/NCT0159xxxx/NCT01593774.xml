  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether melatonin can prevent metabolic side
      effects of olanzapine such as weight gain, elevated glucose concentrations and lipid
      abnormalities.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atypical antipsychotics including olanzapine are associated with significant metabolic side
      effects. Animal studies have suggested that melatonin might prevent some of the
      olanzapine-associated side effects. Melatonin is safe and is widely used as a sleep-promoting
      complement, and is not associated with side effects seen with other used drugs such as
      metformin.
