  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infants with heterotaxy syndrome (HS) are born with an abnormal arrangement of organs along
      the right-left body axis. Abnormalities of intestinal rotation and fixation are commonly
      associated with HS. Malrotation is the most worrisome intestinal rotation abnormality (IRA).
      Advances in cardiac surgery have improved HS mortality such that there is increasing
      attention to IRA and their management. The objective of this research project is to
      prospectively observe a cohort of infants with HS and IRA and evaluate their long term
      outcomes. Specifically, the investigators would like to determine what is the natural history
      of asymptomatic IRA in patients with HS and what is the morbidity and mortality secondary to
      an elective Ladd procedure for asymptomatic IRA in a population with HS? The investigators
      plan a prospective, multi-center, observational study to follow this complicated group of
      patients. This will be a web-based database collected from major cardiac tertiary care
      centers in both Canada and the United States. Patients with HS will be recruited by their
      primary site and clinical data will be collected by their primary site prospectively
      throughout childhood until they are at least five years of age. This patient population will
      be followed by their own clinical care givers; this is not an interventional study. No
      additional clinic visits will be required and the patients will not have to be contacted.
      Patient medical records will be accessed by a member of the study team at the primary site at
      least once per year or more frequently if interventions are required or complications
      develop.
