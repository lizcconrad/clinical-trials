  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study was to assess whether the tolerance to the effect of YF476 on
      gastric pH observed with repeated doses in a previous study in healthy volunteers can be
      avoided by using smaller doses of YF476.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      YF476 is a novel, potent and selective gastrin antagonist that inhibits basal and
      meal-stimulated gastric acid secretion, enhances gastric emptying of a liquid meal and
      increases lower oesophageal sphincter pressure in animals. In a placebo- and
      ranitidine-controlled, crossover study in healthy volunteers, single doses of 5, 25 and 100mg
      of YF476 increased gastric pH; the effect was dose-dependent in magnitude and duration and
      compared favourably with that of ranitidine 150mg. In a placebo- and omeprazole-controlled,
      parallel-group study in healthy volunteers, 25 and 100mg of YF476 twice daily for 7 days, did
      not significantly affect gastric pH unlike omeprazole 20mg daily for 7 days. YF476 and
      omeprazole both increased plasma gastrin concentrations. Single and repeated doses of YF476
      were well tolerated.

    <description>On Study Days 1, 7 and 14, ambulatory gastric pH recorded continuously from 0.5h before dosing until 24h after dosing. Subjects dosed between 0900-0930h. Standard meals and a drink (decaffeinated) taken at 4, 9, 13 and 22 h after dosing. Water (150mL) given at 2, 6, 8 and 11 h after dosing.
On Study Days 1, 7 and 14, blood samples (4mL) taken via a cannula for assay of plasma gastrin at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22 and 24 h after dosing.</description>

    <description>There were 4 treatments: 3 dose levels of YF476 (5mg, 10mg, 25 mg) and placebo.
Each treatment taken by mouth once daily for 14 days (Study Days 1-14). Each subject took 1 of the 4 treatments.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males aged 18-45 years.

          -  No clinically relevant abnormal findings in the clinical history or physical
             examination at the screening assessment which could interfere with the objectives of
             the study or make the subject's participation hazardous.

          -  No clinically relevant abnormal laboratory values at the screening evaluation
             (Attachment 2).

          -  A normal ECG at the screening examination.

          -  A body mass index (Quetelet index) in the range 19.0-30.9:

             any hazards of their participation in it. They must be able to communicate
             satisfactorily with the Investigator and to participate in, and comply with the
             requirements of, the entire study.
