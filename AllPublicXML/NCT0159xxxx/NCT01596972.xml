  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to determine if a self-administered semi-quantitative urine
      pregnancy test and telephone pregnancy symptom questionnaire can reduce the percentage of
      women with a complete uterine evacuation who require a clinic or lab visit to confirm
      completion.

      The investigators hypothesize that women with complete uterine evacuation will be less likely
      to require a follow-up clinic or lab visit by using a standardized pregnancy questionnaire
      and home SQ-UPT, than by using serum hCG as the objective measure of completion.

    <description>The dBest® semi-quantitative urine pregnancy test (Figure 2) is a graduated urine pregnancy test with five different levels of sensitivity: 25 IU/L, 100 IU/L, 500 IU/L, 2000 IU/L, 10000 IU/L. The test detects the level of serum hCG that corresponds to the range between that level and the level above it, i.e. the test would be positive at 500 if the hCG was either 501 or 1999. The tool was validated in a US sample of 196 women, where there was a correlation of 69% between urine hCG and serum hCG. Furthermore, the test had a 10% false negative rate (i.e. recording a level two gradations below the serum level) and a 6% false positive rate (i.e. recording a level two gradations above the serum level)</description>

dBest semi-quantitative urine pregnancy test: The dBest® semi-quantitative urine pregnancy test (Figure 2) is a graduated urine pregnancy test with five different levels of sensitivity: 25 IU/L, 100 IU/L, 500 IU/L, 2000 IU/L, 10000 IU/L. The test detects the level of serum hCG that corresponds to the range between that level and the level above it, i.e. the test would be positive at 500 if the hCG was either 501 or 1999. The tool was validated in a US sample of 196 women, where there was a correlation of 69% between urine hCG and serum hCG. Furthermore, the test had a 10% false negative rate (i.e. recording a level two gradations below the serum level) and a 6% false positive rate (i.e. recording a level two gradations above the serum level)</description>
