    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of two different endoscopic treatment
      in gastroesophageal varices in patients with liver cirrhosis: ligation versus ligation plus
      sclerotherapy in addition to cyanoacrylates

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastroesophageal variceal bleeding, which often results from portal hypertention, is known as
      one of the most frequent death causes of patients with liver cirrhosis. When a patient has
      bleeding episode, it's very likely that he/she will develop another one in the future.
      Endoscopic treatments such as ligation, sclerotherapy or cyanocrylates are proved to decrease
      the risk of re-bleeding. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of two
      different endoscopic treatments in patients who have both gastric and esophageal varices with
      liver cirrhosis: In addition to cyanoacrylates, ligation versus ligation plus sclerotherapy.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with portal hypertension caused by liver cirrhosis who presented with an
             acute or recent episode of gastroesophageal variceal bleeding and have previously
             received endoscopic treatments of ligation and cyanoacrylate. Diagnosis of liver
             cirrhosis or mixed cirrhosis was based on results of liver biopsy or biochemical tests
             and liver imaging by ultrasonography.

          -  The extent of the varices range from Moderate to Severe.

          -  The age of the patients range from 18 to 72 years old.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who had other causes for portal hypertention(CTPV,Budd-Chiari syndrome,etc.)

          -  Patients with severe systemic disease (renal failure, heart failure,carcinoma other
             than liver cancer,etc.)

          -  Patients who had contraindications for ligation,sclerotherapy or cyanoacrylate.

          -  Patients who have previously received shunt or devascularization operation,TIPS.

          -  Patients who had portosystemic shunt according to the results of CT scan.
