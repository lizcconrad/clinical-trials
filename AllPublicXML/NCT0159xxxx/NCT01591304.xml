    <textblock>
      Study subjects will be assigned to one of two treatment groups. Both treatment groups will
      receive treatment in the center of the forehead/temples, medial cheeks, and chin regions
      using the 1.5mm and 1.0mm transducers.

        -  For Group A, both the 1.5mm and 1.0mm transducers will be used at 0.25J energy setting
           and 0.20J energy setting, respectively.

        -  For Group B, both the 1.5mm and 1.0mm transducers will be used at 0.18J energy setting
           and 0.15J energy setting, respectively.

      Subjects will receive 3 Ultherapy treatments administered 2 weeks apart. Subjects will be
      required to return for follow-up assessments at 14, 30, 60, 90 and 180 days following the
      third Ultherapy treatment. Pre- and post-treatment photos will be taken. In addition, pre-
      and post-treatment lesion counts and sebum measurements will be obtained.
