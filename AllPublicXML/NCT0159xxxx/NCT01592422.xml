  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The role of maintenance therapy in the management of Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) has not
      been confirmed. Many treatment modalities like chemotherapy, interferons and other biological
      agents have been tested as maintenance therapy in SCLC, but the results are disappointing. A
      marginal survival advantage is seen in maintenance with chemotherapy and interferon-alpha,
      however, the functioning status and immune system may get worse, which subsequently has a
      negative impact on patient's quality-of-life. Immunotherapy with autologous cytokine-induced
      killer (CIK) cells can activate the antitumor defense mechanism through stimulating immune
      response and altering the interaction between tumor and its host. This effect may result in
      improved tumor control and survival, as well as a better quality of life. To test the
      hypothesis, a randomized controlled study was conducted to compare CIK cells with best
      supportive care as maintenance therapy for SCLC.
