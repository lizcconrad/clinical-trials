  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Each year, 5 million packs of iron tablets are dispensed in England and Wales to treat
      anaemia due to iron deficiency. Iron tablets are not always easy to take. The investigators
      think that there could be ways to reduce the number of iron tablets needed, by increasing the
      dietary intake of iron. In this study the investigators will assess the efficacy and safety
      of a dietary iron supplement compared to iron tablets using controls and new biomarkers.

    <textblock>
      18 healthy individuals will be randomised to one of three arms, and for two consecutive
      mornings, will receive either an iron tablet (ferrous sulphate 200mg), a dietary iron
      supplement, or no agent.

      Blood and urine samples will be collected pre-dose, and at stated intervals 2.5, 4, 7, 24 and
      48 hours post first dose.

      The standard deviations of data obtained in this pilot study will be used to perform power
      calculations for our future studies in this field.
