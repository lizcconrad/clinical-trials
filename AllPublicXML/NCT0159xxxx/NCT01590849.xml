  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of combined oral contraceptives has been associated with increased risk of adverse
      cardiovascular events. The exact mechanism by which these drugs exert this influence is
      uncertain. It is possible that changes in autonomic nervous system are involved. The
      objective of these study was to evaluate the effect of the use of a contraceptive containing
      20 mcg of ethinyl estradiol and 3mg of drospirenone in the autonomic nervous system in
      healthy women. Few studies have been conducted in the field of hormonal contraception and
      evaluation of the autonomic nervous system work and no prospective, controlled study was
      published so far. These study will be the first.

    <description>The participants in this study will be 80 healthy women. After a counseling session concerning the advantages, disadvantages and side effects of contraceptive methods (COC or nonhormonal methods), the volunteers were divided into two study groups according to the method they chose to use as follows:
Case group: healthy women, users of COC containing 20 mcg EE and 3 mg DRSP (Yaz®)(n=40).
Control group: healthy women, users of nonhormonal methods of contraception (condoms or copper IUD) (n=40).
The acquisition of autonomic parameters will be performed through the device Finometer.</description>
