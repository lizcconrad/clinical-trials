  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if getting a blood stem cell transplant with donor
      stem cells given over several days is better than getting a blood stem cell transplant with
      donor stem cells given over 1 day. We want to find out which procedure over will result in
      improved recovery of blood and immune function after transplant. When donor stem cells are
      given over various days in mice, the blood and immune system recovery is quicker.

      This is a complex study that involves various interventions, Intervention #1: Donor Initial
      Stem Cell Collection; Intervention #2: Stem Cell Product Initial Processing Orders;
      Intervention #3 Patient Admission and Transplantation; Intervention #4: Stem cell infusion;
      Intervention #5: Post infusion follow up; Intervention #6: Off Study Patient and Donor
      Evaluation.

      Patients whose donor fails to collect the appropriate number of cells will receive all their
      cells as a bulk infusion. These patients will continue to receive a transplant on protocol
      but will be replaced until both arms have reached the target accrual.
