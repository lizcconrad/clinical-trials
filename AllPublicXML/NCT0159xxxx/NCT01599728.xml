  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite modern advances in treatment, heart failure continues to carry a poor prognosis with
      high morbidity and mortality rates. Hence, there remains a major interest in the development
      of novel therapeutic agents for this debilitating condition. Urocortins have recently shot
      into limelight with their potential role in the pathophysiology and treatment of heart
      failure.

      Recent studies by the investigators group (REC no: 09/S1103/41) have confirmed that Urocortin
      2 and 3 are potent arterial vasodilators, the effects of which are reproducible and well
      tolerated in healthy male volunteers. Previous studies using heart failure models in
      animals1-7, as well studies in heart failure patients (Urocortin 2), suggest that there is
      great scope for Urocortins as novel biomarkers and as potential therapeutic agents in heart
      failure. With this in mind, the investigators wish to study the local vasomotor effects of
      these peptides in greater detail in patients with heart failure.

    <description>After a 20-min infusion of intra-arterial saline, ascending doses of Urocortin 2 (3.6, 12 and 36 pmol/min [15, 50 and 150 ng/min] to achieve estimated end-organ concentrations of 0.6, 2 and 6 Âµg/L, respectively), Urocortin 3 1200, 3600 and 12000 pmol/min (5, 15 and 50 micrograms/min) [to achieve estimated end-organ concentrations of 199, 600 and 2000 micrograms/L respectively] and substance P (a control endothelium-dependent vasodilator that evokes endogenous t-PA release [2, 4 and 8 pmol/min]) will be administered intra-arterially.
Baseline blood samples will be taken at the start of the study for full blood count, cholesterol, glucose, renal function Bilateral venous blood samples will be taken at baseline, immediately before the start of Ucn2/Ucn3 infusion and at the end of each dose of Ucn2/Ucn3 for subsequent measurement of plasma Ucn 2 and 3 concentrations and other hormones.</description>
