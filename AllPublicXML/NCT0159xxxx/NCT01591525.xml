  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the type II diabetes (T2D) screening study is to improve diabetes care in
      minority communities by identifying undiagnosed and uncontrolled T2D patients, as well as
      help patients without a regular primary care physician (PCP) find one within their community.
      These goals will be achieved first through a glucose measurement. Individuals with a high
      glucose measurement will be confirmed with a rapid hemoglobin A1c (HgA1c) test. The HgA1c
      test will tell us about the patients average blood sugar over the past 3 months, which will
      allow us to immediately diagnose new and uncontrolled type II diabetics. All participants
      will fill out a survey on healthcare seeking behaviors before glucose testing. All patients
      who enter the study will receive education on T2D and the value of regularly visiting their
      PCP, and will be provided a list of PCP currently accepting new patients within a 3 mile
      radius. Follow-up visits at 4 and 8 months will help us determine the success this community
      based screening.

      The investigators hypothesis is that community based screening designed with adequate
      education and follow-up, and performed by qualified medical professionals will improve
      diabetes care in minority communities as assessed through hemoglobin A1c levels over 8
      months, and in the change in the number patients who visit/obtain their PCP within the study
      period.
