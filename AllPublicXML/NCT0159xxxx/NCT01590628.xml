      Pilot Study Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of a Co-Transplantation of NiCord®, a
      UCB-derived ex Vivo Expanded Population of Stem and Progenitor Cells and a Second,
      Unmanipulated CBU in Patients with Hemoglobinopathies.

    <textblock>
      Umbilical cord blood (UCB) is an alternative stem cell source for hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantations (HSCT) and can be used for the treatment of various life-threatening
      diseases, such as hematological malignancies or genetic blood disorders, in such cases where
      a matched related stem cell donor is not available. However, the major drawback of using this
      valuable stem cells source is the limited cell dose in a single cord blood unit (CBU), which
      was shown to be associated with inadequate hematopoietic reconstitution and high risk of
      transplant-related mortality. To improve outcomes and extend applicability of UCB
      transplantation, one potential solution is ex vivo expansion of UCB-derived stem and
      progenitor cells. NiCord® is a stem/progenitor cell based product composed of ex vivo
      expanded allogeneic UCB cells. NiCord® is based on a novel technology for the ex vivo cell
      expansion of cord blood derived hematopoietic progenitor cells. By increasing the number of
      the short and long-term reconstitution progenitor cells transplanted, NiCord® has the
      potential to enable the broader application of UCB transplantation, and improve the clinical
      outcomes of UCB transplantation.

      The study is designed as a pilot, single center, single arm study, evaluating the safety and
      efficacy of the co-transplantation of NiCord® with an unmanipulated CBU to patients with SCD
      following myeloablative therapy.

      The total study duration is approximately 220 days, starting with the signing of an informed
      consent to the last visit on day 180 post-transplant. A long-term post-study follow-up is
      planned at 6 months post-study completion (1 year post-transplantation), and a long-term
      follow-up using the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR)
      registry.

      The study hypothesis is that the co-transplantation of NiCord® and an unmanipulated unrelated
      cord blood graft in patients with SCD following myeloablative preparative therapy consisting
      of hydroxyurea, busulfan, cyclophosphamide and ATG will be safe and will enable cord blood
      engraftment.

      The main study objectives are assessment of the acute toxicity associated with the infusion
      of NiCord® within 24 hours post infusion, and assessment of cumulative incidence of
      donor-derived neutrophil engraftment by day 42 following co-transplantation of NiCord® and
      unmanipulated cord blood grafts. In addition, the proportion of transplant-related mortality
      at 100 days, event-free survival at 100 days and overall survival at 180 days will be
      assessed.

      Ten evaluable patients recruited for the study should be 2-45 years of age, at least 10 kg in
      weight, have symptomatic SCD and should be considered as candidates for allogeneic
      myeloablative HSCT for the treatment of SCD.
