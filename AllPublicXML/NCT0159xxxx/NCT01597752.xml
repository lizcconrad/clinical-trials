    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the biologic activity of a Blomia tropicalis
      allergen extract in histamine equivalent prick (HEP) units, in order to be used as in-house
      reference preparation (IHRP).

      This is an open, unblinded and non-randomized biological assay. The study design is a slight
      modification of the recommendations proposed by the Nordic Guidelines.

      Four concentrations of Blomia tropicalis allergen extract, together with a positive and
      negative control, using 10 mg/ml histamine dihydrochloride solution and a glycerinated phenol
      saline solution, respectively, will be tested in every patient in duplicate on the volar
      surface of the forearm.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. A documented positive case history with inhalation allergy (rhinitis and/or
             rhinoconjunctivitis and/or asthma) related to Blomia tropicalis.

          2. Subject has provided written informed consent, appropriately signed and dated by the
             subject (or legal representative, if applicable).

          3. Subject can be male or female of any race and ethnic group.

          4. Age &gt; 18 years and &lt; 50 years at the study inclusion day.

          5. Positive skin prick test with a standardized commercially available preparation of
             Blomia tropicalis allergen extract. The skin prick test will be considered positive if
             the test results in a wheal major diameter of at least 3 mm and at least the size of
             the positive control. Positive skin prick test results are valid if performed within
             one year prior to the inclusion of the subject in the study

          6. A positive test for specific IgE to Blomia tropicalis(CAP-RAST ≥ 2). IgE results are
             valid if performed within one year prior to the inclusion of the subject in the study.

          7. Allergic symptoms during the season of Blomia tropicalis.

          8. Mean of the forearm major diameters of the wheals provoked by histamine
             dihydrochloride (10 mg/ml) ≥ 3 mm.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Immunotherapy in the past 5 years with an allergen preparation known to interfere with
             the allergen to be tested (e.g., mites group extracts).

          2. Use of drugs that may interfere with the skin reactions (e.g., antihistamines). See
             Appendix 1

          3. Treatment with any of the following medications: tricyclic or tetracyclic
             antidepressants, β-blockers or corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg/day of prednisone or
             equivalent).

          4. Pregnancy.

          5. Dermographism affecting the skin area at the test site at either study visit.

          6. Atopic dermatitis affecting the skin area at the test site at either study visit.

          7. Urticaria affecting the skin area at the test site at either study visit.

          8. Participation in another clinical trial within the last month.

          9. Subjects suffering from pathologies or conditions in which adrenalin is
             contraindicated (heart disease, severe hypertension,...)
