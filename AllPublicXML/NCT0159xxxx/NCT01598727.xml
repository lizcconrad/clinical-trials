      Hypothesis: Intraoperative use of near infrared fluorescent imaging technology and detection
      of Methylene Blue fluorescence will improve outcomes following thyroid and parathyroid
      surgery.

      Aims: The aims of this phase of the study are to determine the feasibility of using near
      infrared fluorescent technology in the detection of parathyroid tissue and its
      differentiation from adjacent soft tissue during surgery on parathyroid glands.

      Objectives of the phase I study:

        1. To familiarise surgical teams with the intraoperative use of the 'Fluobeam(TM)' device
           (Fluoptics).

        2. To understand the patterns (onset, intensity and duration) of fluorescent staining of
           normal parathyroid glands, thyroid glands and other soft tissue structures encountered
           during parathyroidectomy.

      Further research:

      This will be followed by a phase II study during which fluorescent imaging will be used in
      conjunction with intraoperative incremental dose of IV methylene blue in both thyroid and
      parathyroid surgery. Phase II will enable us to develop a protocol for the use of a minimum
      possible dose of MB for the identification of parathyroid glands. This will then be tested in
      the pilot phase of a randomized clinical trial.

    <description>This is a proof of principle study aimed to demonstrate that the patterns of Methylene Blue emitted fluorescence from the parathyroid glands, thyroid glands and other soft tissue structures in the neck such as lymph glands are distinct and can be used to differentiate between them at surgery. The fluorescence from the various structures will be recorded as 'no', 'mild' and 'yes'.</description>
