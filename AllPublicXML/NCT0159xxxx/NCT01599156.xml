    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine if the use of reflexology can alleviate chronic
      constipation. The trial will last 26 week per patient, 2 week of screening period, 12 weeks
      of treatment and 12 weeks of follow up. Included in the study will be 40 men and women, 18
      years of age or older, which are able to comply with the study guidelines; Fewer than three
      spontaneous bowel movement per week; and one or more of the following symptoms/signs during
      more than 25% of bowel movements for at least 12 weeks within the preceding 12 months: (1)
      straining, lumpy or (2) hard stools, and (3) a sensation of incomplete evacuation. Exclusion
      criteria are: Loose or watery stool in the absence of laxative use for more than 25% of bowel
      movements during the 12 weeks preceding the trials; Mushy stool defined as a score of 6 on
      the Bristol Stool Form Scale for any SBM during the baseline period; Rome III criteria for
      the irritable bowel syndrome; History of pelvic-floor dysfunction; Neurological pathologies;
      Psychiatric conditions; Chronic use of medication with a gastro intestinal-activity.

    <description>Reflexology is a therapy whereby diagnosis and treatment are done on the patient's feet. According to reflexology, our feet are a micro-cosmos of our bodies and contain all the body's systems and internal organs. The treatment is palpation and massage of specific reflex points that respond to the body organs. This massage or palpitation of reflex points improves the physical function of the corresponding organ or system</description>
