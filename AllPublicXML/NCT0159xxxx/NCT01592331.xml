  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study will evaluate the
      pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of RO5508887 in healthy volunteers.

      Subjects will be randomized in cohorts to receive single oral doses of either RO5508887 or
      placebo. In-unit period is 6 days.

             for at least 30 days after the last dose of study drug

          -  Donation of blood over 500 mL within 6 weeks before drug administration

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Concomitant disease or condition or treatment that could interfere with the conduct of
             the study or would, in the opinion of the investigator, pose an unacceptable risk to

          -  Positive for hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV 1 or 2 infection

          -  Participation in an investigational drug or device study (last administration of study
             drug or installation of device) within 6 weeks before RO5508887 administration and
             within 5 mean half-lives of receiving previous investigational drug before RO5508887
             administration. In addition, subject cannot participate unless completely recovered
             from previous invasive or study procedure

          -  Donation of blood over 500 mL within 6 weeks before drug administration
