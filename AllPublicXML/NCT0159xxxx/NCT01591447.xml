    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Evidence of a urogenital gonococcal infection (prior culture, NAAT test, Gram stain,
             sexual contact)

          2. Willing to abstain from anal, oral, or vaginal sexual intercourse or use condoms until
             study completion.

          3. Females of childbearing potential (including females less than 2 years
             post-menopausal) must have a negative pregnancy test at enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Confirmed, or suspected, complicated or systemic gonococcal infections such as pelvic
             inflammatory disease, arthritis, or endocarditis.

          2. Known HIV, chronic hepatitis B, or hepatitis C infection.

          3. Known concomitant infection which would require additional systemic antibiotics.

          4. Use of systemic or intravaginal antibiotics within 30 days prior to study drug
             administration.

          5. Current use of corticosteroid drugs or other immunosuppressive therapy.

          6. Cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiation therapy within the previous 3 months.

          7. Known significant renal, hepatic, or hematologic impairment.

          8. History of intolerance or hypersensitivity to macrolide antibiotics.

          9. Any concomitant condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would preclude an
             evaluation of a response or make it unlikely that the contemplated course of therapy
             and follow-up could be completed (e.g., life expectancy &lt;30 days).
