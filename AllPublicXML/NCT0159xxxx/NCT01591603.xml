  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will investigate the difference in success rate between popliteal peripheral nerve
      catheters placed at 1 centimeter compared to 5 centimeters past the tip of a Tuohy needle.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traditionally for the lower extremity, peripheral nerve catheters have been threaded greater
      than or equal to 5 centimeters past the tip of the Tuohy needle. The major rational for this
      practice is to reduce dislodgement. However, the greater the distance that a catheter is
      advanced, the greater the risk of contacting undesired structures, kinking, looping and
      knotting. For the continuous popliteal nerve block, the catheter is threaded perpendicular to
      the course of the nerve. This could result in the tip of the catheter being a significant
      distance from the targeted nerve which may lead to a decrease in the success rate or efficacy
      of the block.

      Greater efficacy may be seen if the needle is closer to its target. This may be quantified by
      documenting a faster onset of motor and sensory changes and/or a lower catheter infusion rate
      required to maintain pain control. The study will investigate the difference in success rate
      between popliteal peripheral nerve catheters placed at 1 centimeter compared to 5 centimeters
      past the tip of a Tuohy needle.

    <measure>Change in Peripheral block score (PBS).</measure>
    <time_frame>10, 20, and 30 minutes after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The extent of popliteal nerve blockade will be captured with four sensory groups (sural, superficial peroneal, tibial, and deep peroneal) and three motor groups (superficial peroneal, tibial, and deep peroneal). For each group, a score of 0, 1, or 2 will be assigned based on complete, partial, or no blockade, respectively. The peripheral block score (PBS) outcome variable will be based on the sum of these values and will range from 0 to 14.</description>

    <measure>Pain score</measure>
    <time_frame>Arrival to PACU (Immediately after surgery, approximately 3-5 hours after intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will examine the difference in the pain scores (0-10 numeric rating scale) between the two groups.</description>

    <measure>Analgesia failure rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Arrival to PACU (Immediately after surgery, approximately 3-5 hours after intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will examine the difference in analgesia failure rates in the PACU. Analgesia failure is defined as the failure of a rescue bolus (to treat patient pain).</description>

    <measure>Difference in total opioid usage</measure>
    <time_frame>Length of Stay In PACU (Approximately 5-7 hours after intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will examine the difference in the total opioid usage. We will compare medications separately and in total equivalent units (using an opioid conversion table).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Degree of Doppler color agitation</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will examine the relationship between the degree of Doppler color agitation (evaluated at the time the catheter is placed) and block success (i.e., the outcome in the primary analysis). Degree of agitation color will be defined as the percentage of nerve covered during the color agitation.</description>
