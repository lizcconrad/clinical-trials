  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression and anxiety accompany with advanced cancer. The effect of anti-anxiety depression
      has not evaluated in special cancers. Mirtazapine is a drug anti-anxiety depression and has a
      high risk increase weight. So the investigators assume Mirtazapine would not only improve the
      anxiety and depression of metastasis pancreas cancer but also would improve the appetite of
      such patients which would improve dyscrasia of pancreas cancer patients. The drug may improve
      the quality of life in advanced pancreatic cancer which is of short survival.

      The investigators design a phase II/III trial to compared Mirtazapine plus gemcitabine with
      gemcitabine in metastasis pancreatic cancer. The investigators planed to enroll 33 patients
      for each arm after randomization.

      The inclusion criteria included:

        1. Patients shall have normal organic function such as liver function, Cardiac function and
           renal function.

        2. Before enrolled, anxious and depression states will be evaluated by the Hamilton degree
           of depression and anxiety scale. Only patients with definite depression and/or anxiety
           will be considering participating this trial.

        3. Pancreatic cancer patients with ECOG 1～2 scores will be enrolled.

        4. Patients should be expected to live no shorter than 1.5 months

      The investigators will evaluated the quality of life by SF-36 scale as primary outcome. The
      second outcomes include anxious and depression scores, objective response rate, progress free
      survival, overall Survival and chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting.
