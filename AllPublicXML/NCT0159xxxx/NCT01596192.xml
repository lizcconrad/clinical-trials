    <textblock>
      Graft versus host disease (GVHD) is one of the major causes of death in patients undergoing
      allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. 18F-FDG PET/CT (2-[fluorine-18]
      fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose, Positron emission tomography- CT) is a noninvasive technique that
      allows quantifying and precisely localizing 18F-FDG uptake in the entire body. 18F-FDG uptake
      is caused by increased local metabolic activity. In this study, we aim to evaluate and
      characterize the correlation between CT-PET findings in patients suspected to have acute
      GVHD, and the disease course.

    <textblock>
      Graft versus host disease (GVHD) is one of the major causes of death in patients undergoing
      allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Despite prophylactic measures, the
      incidence of acute GVHD is estimated at 40-60% among patients receiving allograft from
      HLA-identical sibling donors, and may even reach 75% in patients receiving HLA-matched
      unrelated grafts. Approximately 20% of the patients will develop the severe variant of the
      disease and there is a tight association between the severity of GVHD and
      transplantation-related-mortality. The treatment of GVHD is largely based on high dose
      steroids regimen which is associated with long term morbidity and mortality. In the subgroup
      of patients with steroid-refractory or slowly resolving GVHD, there are currently no
      recommendations on the best timing of tapering down the steroids dose in the case of
      resolution of the disease, or adding a second line medication, in case of non-resolving or
      progression of the symptoms.

      18F-FDG PET/CT (2-[fluorine-18] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose, Positron emission tomography- CT)
      is a noninvasive technique that allows quantifying and precisely localizing 18F-FDG uptake in
      the entire body. 18F-FDG uptake is caused by increased local metabolic activity. Such
      increased uptake has been described not only in neoplastic lesions but also in inflammatory
      lesions (2). In this condition, uptake has been correlated with local stimulation of tumor
      necrosis factor, and with monocyte priming and activation. A physiologic variable uptake may
      be observed in the bowel, especially the cecum, and has limited the use of PET in
      inflammatory bowel diseases. The advantage of combined PET and CT devices leads to
      significant improvements in the interpretation of the bowel areas, and greatly reduces the
      number of false-positive findings in the gastrointestinal tract.

      CT-PET has been recently evaluated in our center as a diagnostic tool for Crohn disease. In
      this study, CT-PET had a good correlation between FDG uptake and the severity of Crohn
      disease. In the acute GVHD setting, a study reported on a small cohort suggested a
      correlation between CT-PET findings, FDG uptake, and the diagnosis of lower gut acute GVHD.

      In this study, we aim to evaluate and characterize the correlation between CT-PET findings in
      patients suspected to have acute GVHD, and the disease course.

    <description>CT-PET will be performed at the onset of GVHD(up-to 6 months from transplantation) and repeated after 4 weeks. The findings will be compared with the initial CT-PET results. The time frame of 4 weeks is the period of time in which most patients become either asymptomatic or in need for additional immunosuppressive therapy. In addition, all patients will go through the standard GVHD evaluation practice which includes (but not limited to) GI endoscopy (sigmoidoscopy and/or gastroscopy) and skin biopsies. Data obtained from the CT PET results will be compared with the GI findings.</description>

    <description>CT-PET will be performed within 3 days from acute GVHD diagnosis. Each patient will receive 400-610 MBq (11-16.5 mCi) of 18F-FDG intravenously. After tracer injection, the patients will rest on a comfortable chair during the 18F-FDG-uptake period, and drink with 150-300mg Levolac (Fresenius Kabi, Austria) diluted in 1000-1500cc water. CT-PET will be initiated 45-50 min after injection of the 18F-FDG.ll scans will be performed on a Discovery STE PET/CT scanner (General Electric Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI).
CT will be performed 45-50 minutes after drinking the diluted lactulose solution had been ingested. The CT images will be acquired from the diaphragm to the symphysis pubis. After IV administration of 100 ml of nonionic contrast medium at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/sec.</description>
