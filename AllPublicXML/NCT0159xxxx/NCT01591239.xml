  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is aimed at parents with a teenager who is already starting to use drugs. The
      study will test a new, innovative version of a brief intervention. This program will be home
      based rather than implemented by a counselor in a clinical setting. The stage I activities
      will involve manual development, parent training development, and a small feasibility study;
      Stage II involves an efficacy study. Two samples, 110 families each, will participate in the
      trial. Families will be assigned to either an intervention or control condition. The
      investigators hypothesize that the home-based intervention will be superior to the control
      condition. In addition, the investigators expect response to the intervention by the
      adolescent to be mediated by motivation, cognitions, problem solving, peer drug use,
      parenting skills and parent self-efficacy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Little attention has been paid to the large group of adolescents who use substances but are
      not, or not yet, dependent and who could successfully reduce substance use through early
      intervention. Brief interventions (BI) that are based in cognitive-behavioral and
      motivational interviewing (CB-MI) strategies provide an option for such mid-level drug
      abusers (e.g., DSM-IV substance abuse disorder), and extant research on them suggests this
      approach can be effective with youth.

      Winters and colleagues have studied with controlled designs the efficacy of brief
      interventions for application to mild-to-moderate substance abusing adolescents. These
      studies have used the more traditional approach of counselor-led interventions. This program
      will be parent-led rather than directed by a counselor in a clinical setting.

      The stage I activities will involve manual development, parent training development, and a
      small feasibility study; Stage II involves an efficacy trial. Two samples, 110 families each,
      will participate in the trial. Families will be assigned to either an intervention or control
      condition. Data to quantify intervention effects will be obtained by interviewing adolescents
      and the target parent at multiple time points (baseline and, 3-, 6- and 12-months post
      baseline). The investigators hypothesize that the home-based intervention will be superior to
      the control condition. In addition, the investigators expect response to the intervention by
      the adolescent to be mediated by motivation, cognitions, problem solving, peer drug use,
      parenting skills and parent self-efficacy. Secondary analyses will focus on additional
      predictors of intervention effects, and analyses of parent adherence, parent acceptance, and
      of training adherence.

      The final product of the work will be a tested comparative intervention protocol that is
      shaped in an engaging and useful presentation format for use by parents.

    <description>Parents will receive a 1-session training on how to deliver a 3-session intervention across a 3-week period. The intervention program begins with a 3 and a half hour training session delivered by the staff Trainer to the participating parent. At the conclusion of training, the parent will be given the intervention manual and supplemental materials. The trainer will phone the parent shortly before session 1, in between each intervention session, and after the third intervention (four phone calls total) to review the objectives and tasks associated with that week's intervention session and to help prepare for the coming session. At the final phone call between the parent and trainer (after the third week), the trainer will deliver to the parent the follow-up resources.</description>
