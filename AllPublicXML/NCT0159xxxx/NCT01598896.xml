  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cannabis use disorders are an important public health problem in the United States, but no
      effective pharmacotherapies are available to treat these disorders. People with schizophrenia
      are more likely than healthy people to abuse cannabis. Cannabis use may worsen clinical
      outcomes in this group, making the identification of pharmacotherapy to treat cannabis
      dependence in those with schizophrenia important. The investigators intend to test the
      combination of dronabinol, a cannabinoid agonist, and the α2-adrenergic agonist clonidine,
      for cannabis dependence in subjects with schizophrenia. The combination of dronabinol and
      clonidine may alleviate cannabis withdrawal symptoms while allowing treatment-seeking
      outpatients to benefit from medical management (MM) sessions when they are trying to stop
      using cannabis. The investigators propose to assess the relationship of dronabinol and
      clonidine, when added to MM, on cannabis use patterns in cannabis-dependent patients with
      schizophrenia.

      Hypothesis: The investigators predict that combination pharmacotherapy of dronabinol and
      clonidine will significantly reduce cannabis use compared to those receiving placebo.

      Subjects will receive either the combination of dronabinol and clonidine or placebo in
      addition to medical management (MM) over a 10-week treatment period. Following treatment
      completion, subjects will have follow-up visits until 14 weeks after treatment initiation.
      This pilot study will evaluate the feasibility of the combination of dronabinol and clonidine
      for cannabis dependence and will establish effect sizes for a larger trial.

      Cannabis use disorders are highly prevalent in the United States and rising among high school
      seniors, making the identification of efficacious treatments for cannabis dependence of
      critical clinical and public health significance. Schizophrenia is overrepresented among
      those with cannabis dependence. At the completion of this study, the investigators hope to
      have improved our understanding of the relationship of the pharmacotherapy combination of
      dronabinol and clondine on cannabis use.
