      The purpose of this research study is to learn how effective and safe FP01 lozenges are when
      given to subjects with a cough due to an upper respiratory tract infection. The study will
      include subjects who have an upper respiratory tract infection, with a cough of less than six
      weeks duration.

                  hour within 12 hours preceding study screening AND

               -  At least one other respiratory symptom (cough, pharyngeal symptoms [sore throat],
                  nasal congestion of moderate or severe intensity, headache, etc.)

          2. Subject must exceed a cough severity threshold (VAS) during screening visit (Cough
             Severity VAS score ≥ 40 mm).

          3. Subjects who recall that their average number of days with cough during their usual
             cold history is 3 or greater (URTI cough history &gt; 3).

          4. Subjects who do not smoke or use nicotine or nicotine containing products.
             Ex-smokers/ex-tobacco users must have stopped using tobacco products for at least 6

             consecutive months), surgically sterile, or women of child-bearing potential (WOCP)
             with a negative serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) pregnancy test prior to
             entering the study and who are using or agree to use an acceptable method of
             contraception as determined by the Investigator. Acceptable contraceptives include
             abstinence OR intrauterine devices (IUDs), hormonal contraceptives (oral, depot, patch
             or injectable) for ≥ three months prior to screening OR use of double barrier methods

             visit. (Subject may be enrolled by exception, as determined by the Principal
             Investigator and consented by Cerecor's Medical Monitor.)

         17. Any clinically significant finding on the ECG done at the screening visit, as
             determined by the investigator. (Subject may be enrolled by exception, as determined
             by the Principal Investigator and consented by Cerecor's Medical Monitor).
