  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the possible changes in upper airway geometry induced by variations in the
      characteristics of the mouthpieces of inhalers will be evaluated with functional respiratory
      imaging (FRI) and Pharyngometry. The study population consists of 12 healthy male subjects.

      Different mouthpiece designs will be evaluated for each subject by using magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) scans. The results will help to identify the influence of the height, width,
      protrusion and resistance of the mouthpiece on upper airway geometry.

      Pharyngometry profiles of all subjects, whilst inhaling through different mouthpiece
      variants, in supine and upright position, will be completed.

      A computed tomography (CT) scan and a cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scan of the upper
      airway will be taken to respectively compare the time dependence on 3D imaging with MRI and
      to provide a 3D image in an upright position.

      Dental impressions will be optically scanned to obtain a more accurate representation of the
      oral cavity, mainly in MRI.

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate time dependence on image upper airway by using CT scan</measure>
    <time_frame>At day 1</time_frame>
    <description>With a high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan it's possible to obtain high resolution images in a very short period of time at a low radiation dose. Therefore the 3D CT image of the upper airway will be compared with the one from MRI for 1 mouthpiece to check the time dependence. MRI takes about 50 seconds and CT only 3-4 seconds.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>3D image of upper airway in upright position by using CBCT scan</measure>
    <time_frame>At day 1</time_frame>
    <description>To make a comparison between the upright and supine upper airway geometry the CBCT will be used to provide a 3D image of the upper airway in an upright position. This image will be compared with the 3D MRI image for 1 mouthpiece.</description>
