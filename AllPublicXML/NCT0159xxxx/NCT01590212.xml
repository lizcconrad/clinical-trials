  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of a relationships based antenatal
      intervention (Mellow Bumps) against a comparison intervention (Chillout In Pregnancy) and
      also against the normal antenatal care which is received during pregnancy (Care As Usual).
      The Mellow Bumps intervention will seek to improve maternal anxiety and maternal sensitivity
      whilst the Chillout In Pregnancy intervention will aim to improve only maternal anxiety. This
      will allow the researchers to determine what type of intervention, if any, is most successful
      at improving the outcomes of the mother and child. This will be measured by looking at the
      mother's stress response, anxiety, depression and irritability, the baby's stress response
      and the interactions between the mother and the baby. Participants in the study will be
      pregnant women who would be between 20 and 30 weeks pregnant at the start of the antenatal
      intervention. Participants will be chosen to take part in one of the three conditions (Mellow
      Bumps, Chillout In Pregnancy or Care As Usual) at random. All participants will be asked to
      complete questionnaires and give saliva samples prior to the intervention. The questionnaires
      will also be repeated at the end of the intervention and at a follow up occurring eight to
      twelve weeks after birth. Consent will also be sought to take saliva samples from the baby
      before and after a routine blood test when the baby is five days old. This information will
      then be evaluated to establish the effectiveness of the proposed interventions.

      Lower than anticipated recruitment numbers have resulted in changes to the planned
      methodology of this trial. Firstly, participants were allocated to the three arms in
      groups/blocks of 6. Secondly, randomisation of the final group recruited was abandoned.

MB is intended to decrease maternal antenatal stress levels, increase expectant mothers' understanding of neonates' capacity for social interaction and emphasise the importance of early interaction in enhancing brain development and attachment. It is delivered non-didactically to maximise participant engagement and rapport. Each week there is one activity focused on the woman and another on a baby-related topic. The programme is designed to be offered between twenty to thirty weeks' gestation.</description>

        <title>Anxiety, Depression and Irritability Measured on Adult Wellbeing Scale</title>
        <description>Anxiety, depression and irritability measured on the Adult Wellbeing Scale post-birth (approximately 8-12 weeks postnatal)
The Adult Wellbeing scale (AWS): a validated questionnaire which generates scores in four domains - depression, anxiety, outward-directed irritability and inward-directed irritability. The sub-scales have different cut-off scores that indicate a possible problem in that area: Anxiety (normal=0-5, borderline=6-8, problem 9-15), Depression (normal=0-3, borderline=4-6, problem 7-15), Outward directed irritability (normal=0-4, borderline=5-7, problem 8-12), Inward directed irritability (normal=0-3, borderline=4-6, problem 7-12),</description>

            <description>MB is a six week group-based antenatal programme designed to support families with additional health and social care needs. MB is intended to decrease maternal antenatal stress levels, increase expectant mothers' understanding of neonates' capacity for social interaction and emphasise the importance of early interaction in enhancing brain development and attachment. It is delivered non-didactically to maximise participant engagement and rapport. Each week there is one activity focused on the woman and another on a baby-related topic. The programme is designed to be offered between twenty to thirty weeks' gestation.</description>
