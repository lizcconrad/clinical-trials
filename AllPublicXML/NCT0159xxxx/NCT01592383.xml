      The purpose of this study is to test the drug erlotinib (erlotinib hydrochloride) in people
      with malignant peritoneal mesothelioma who have a specific genetic mutation in their cancer.
      Erlotinib has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for other
      cancers, but erlotinib has not been approved for malignant peritoneal mesothelioma. This
      research is being done because there is no current standard treatment for malignant
      peritoneal mesothelioma and the study doctors want to see how erlotinib affects malignant
      peritoneal mesothelioma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the objective response rate (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR])
      of erlotinib in malignant peritoneal mesothelioma (MPeM) patients who have epidermal growth
      factor receptor (EGFR) mutations.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the percentage of patients with MPeM who have EGFR mutations. II. To
      characterize asbestos exposure history and other clinical parameters of patients with MPeM
      who do or do not have EGFR mutations.

      III. To determine the disease control rate (CR + PR + stable disease [SD]) of MPeM patients
      who have EGFR mutations and are treated with erlotinib.

      IV. To determine the progression-free survival (PFS) of MPeM patients who have EGFR mutations
      and are treated with erlotinib.

      V. To determine the median overall survival (OS) of MPeM patients who have EGFR mutations and
      are treated with erlotinib.

      VI. To evaluate toxicity in MPeM patients who have EGFR mutations and are treated with
      erlotinib.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the specific EGFR mutations observed in MPeM patients. II. To correlate
      tumor markers (cancer antigen [CA] 125 and soluble mesothelin-related peptide [SMRP]) with
      response rate, PFS, and OS in MPeM patients treated with erlotinib.

      III. To correlate immunohistochemical staining of EGFR, phosphorylated (p)-EGFR, MET
      (Metastasis), E-cadherin, vimentin, and CBL (Casitas B-lineage Lymphoma)with EGFR mutational
      status and, if present, particular EGFR mutation noted.

      IV. To correlate immunohistochemical staining of EGFR, p-EGFR, MET, E-cadherin, vimentin, and
      CBL with response rate, PFS, and OS in MPeM patients treated with erlotinib.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD). Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.

          -  The effects of erlotinib on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic
             dose are unknown; for this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree
             to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;
             abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation; should a
             woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study,
             she should inform her treating physician immediately.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed screening and
             treatment consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or surgery within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or
             mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse
             events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop. progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to erlotinib.

          -  EGFR-mutation negative tumor tissue as determined by sequencing; if an individual
             tissue test result is inconclusive (unable to be determined), it will be considered
             negative for study eligibility purposes.

          -  History of previous malignancy excluding non-melanoma skin lesions and in-situ
             cervical cancer; patients with other malignancies are eligible if they have been
             disease free for &gt;= 3 years.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because it is unknown if erlotinib poses a
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with erlotinib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated
             with erlotinib.

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral
             therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with
             erlotinib; in addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections;
             appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination
             antiretroviral therapy when indicated.

          -  Inability to tolerate or absorb an oral medication due to any cause, including but not
             limited to malabsorption syndromes.
