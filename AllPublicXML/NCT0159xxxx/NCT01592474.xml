      The purpose of this study is

        -  To examine if Avaonex can delay the development of clinically definite multiple
           sclerosis.

        -  To investigate if Avonex can delay disability progression by slowing brain atrophy.

      -  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disorder characterized by focal areas
           of demyelination in the central nervous system (CNS). MRI findings suggest that we
           should look at gray matter atrophy as a marker of the disease process in MS.

        -  Avonex is a proven effective disease-modifying treatment, which reduces total brain and
           GM atrophy and should be considered first-line therapy in patients with RRMS and CIS.

        -  The original SET study is an open-label observational study of high risk subjects after
           CIS for development of CDMS that will enroll 220 patients who have started Avonex
           immediately after their first clinical attack in Czech Republic, and are followed with
           clinical and MRI examinations for 4 years at 0, 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 months. The
           clinical and MRI acquisition examinations of this study are conducted in Czech Republic.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  MRI findings must reveal at least 2 hyperintense lesions on T2-WI or FLAIR images at
             first clinical onset

          -  CSF examination should confirm oligoclonal bands (examination must be done in an
             internationally approved lab and the CSF taken before the treatment of attack starts)

          -  Age 18 - 55 years

          -  Effective contraception in female patients of childbearing potential

          -  Kurtzke EDSS ≤ 3.5 at baseline

          -  Willingness to accept the plan of the study and compliance with the study

          -  Time from the beginning of first symptoms of CIS to baseline visit should not exceed 4
             months (baseline MRI and baseline visit will be organized first 28 days after last
             steroid administration)

          -  CIS attack is treated by at least 3g of methylprednisolone without taper

          -  In case of severe attack 1 g of cyclophosphamide does not disqualify the patient from
             the study if first MRI and CSF examination was done before treatment administered

          -  No active major organ disease especially of hepatic or thyroid origin

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The clinical diagnosis of MS is definite (the second attack occurs before the baseline
             visit)

          -  Age less than 18 or more than 55

          -  Non-effective contraception method or pregnancy planning

          -  Active major organ disease, especially hepatic or endocrinologic

          -  Cooperation of the subject cannot be ensured

          -  Kurtzke EDSS higher than 3.5 at baseline
