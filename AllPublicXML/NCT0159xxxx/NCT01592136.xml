      This protocol will allow expanded access of ponatinib to patients ≥18 years with CML or
      Ph+ALL who have failed all available treatment options. Patients with chronic (CP) or
      accelerated phase (AP) CML must be previously treated with and resistant or intolerant to
      imatinib, dasatinib and nilotinib or develop the T315I mutation after any tyrosine kinase
      inhibitor (TKI) therapy. Patients with blast phase (BP) CML and Ph+ ALL must be previously
      treated with and resistant or intolerant to imatinib and dasatinib or develop the T315I
      mutation after any TKI therapy. No formal analysis will be performed on any data obtained.
      Safety information will be collected and adverse events will be tabulated for reporting
      purposes only.
