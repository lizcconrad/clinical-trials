  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adenosine is used clinically to assess permanency of electrical isolation of pulmonary veins
      during atrial fibrillation ablation, however, the methodology has not been validated either
      in terms of the reproducibility of the adenosine response or the effect on clinical outcomes,
      namely whether using pulmonary vein reconnection to guide additional ablation lowers rate
      recurrent atrial fibrillation post ablation. Study will test the hypothesis that the response
      to adenosine used in this manner is reproducible over time.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing pulmonary vein isolation as part of atrial fibrillation ablation will be
      randomized to treatment and control groups. Treatment group subjects will received 12 mg IV
      adenosine to evaluate pulmonary vein reconnection after initial electrical isolation is
      documented. If electrical reconnection is not observed at 5 minutes, a second dose of
      adenosine will be administered, monitoring again for electrical reconnection. Control
      patients will be observed for 10 minutes post initial electrical isolation of the pulmonary
      vein for spontaneous electrical reconnection. If reconnection is observed, veins will be
      re-isolated per standard clinical practice. This procedure will be repeated for each of a
      patient's pulmonary veins. Patients will be followed up at clinical visits to examine for
      adverse effects of procedure and/or adenosine administration as well as atrial fibrillation
      recurrence.

    <description>In treatment group, 30 minutes after all veins confirmed to be isolated with lasso catheter, 12 mg IV adenosine will be given to treatment group subjects, will monitor with lasso catheter for pulmonary vein reconnection for 5 minutes, if no reconnection, a second dose adenosine will be given and will monitor for additional 5 minutes for pulmonary vein reconnection. Criteria for pulmonary vein reconnection will be recurrence of local pulmonary vein electrical recordings noted on lasso catheter located within the vein. Pulmonary vein isolation is defined as disappearance of all local intracardiac electrograms within a pulmonary vein recorded on a 10 electrode circular catheter or lasso catheter positioned within the vein.</description>

        <title>Pulmonary Vein Reconnection</title>
        <description>In treatment group, 30 minutes after all veins confirmed to be isolated with lasso catheter, 12 mg IV adenosine will be given to treatment group subjects, will monitor with lasso catheter for pulmonary vein reconnection for 5 minutes, if no reconnection, a second dose adenosine will be given and will monitor for additional 5 minutes for pulmonary vein reconnection. Criteria for pulmonary vein reconnection will be recurrence of local pulmonary vein electrical recordings noted on lasso catheter located within the vein. Pulmonary vein isolation is defined as disappearance of all local intracardiac electrograms within a pulmonary vein recorded on a 10 electrode circular catheter or lasso catheter positioned within the vein.</description>
        <time_frame>Pulmonary vein reconnection will be monitored for 5 minutes post second dose of adenosine, or on average for 15 minutes after initial electrical isolation of the pulmonary vein.</time_frame>

Of these 10 patients, 3 patients were noted to have pulmonary vein reconnection post initial dose of adenosine in at least one pulmonary vein. No patient demonstrated pulmonary vein reconnection with second dose of adenosine.</description>
