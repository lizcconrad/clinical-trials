  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Porphyromonas gingivalis is one of the major bacteria involved in the formation and
      progression of chronic periodontitis. Pathogens invading the gingiva face the host's innate
      immune system at first and later on the acquired immune system which includes secreted
      antibodies and specialized cells. Although both the arms of the immune system are coordinated
      to overcome the infection, there are several known mechanisms which help pathogens as
      Porphyromonas gingivalis evade immunity. As a result, inflammatory mediators secreted by
      immune cells cause tissue damage and lead the inflammation process towards chronicity instead
      of clearing the pathogen. Up till recently most of the studies focused on the role of
      macrophages, dendritic cells and lymphocytes at the response to periodontal pathogenic
      bacteria while the role of fibroblasts (the most abundant cell in the connective tissue) was
      less examined. Fibroblasts are spindle shaped cells which have the ability to produce extra
      cellular matrix and respond to growth factors and cytokines. They are able to affect cells in
      the infected tissue and contribute to immune response efficiency. As known in the case of
      lymphocytes, fibroblasts also vary in subtypes, each differs in phenotype, immune
      interactions, extra cellular matrix production and destruction, migration abilities and so
      on. Two main fibroblasts subtypes in the oral cavity originate in the gingival tissue and the
      periodontal ligament anchoring teeth to the surrounding alveolar bone. Amongst the
      differences between the two are collagen production ability and receptors profile over the
      cell surface. Considering all that, the investigators aim to obtain and use periodontal
      ligament and gingival tissues removed anyways during common dental procedures in order to
      extract the different fibroblasts subtypes residing there and compare their response to
      Porphyromonas gingivalis.
