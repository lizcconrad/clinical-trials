  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good and/or bad, the addition of
      clofarabine, a new chemotherapy agent, to a standard busulfan and fludarabine conditioning
      treatment has. The study will also look at what causes some people to have high drug levels
      of these medications in their body compared to other people that may have low drug levels
      even if they all receive the same dose of medication.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must be ≥ 3 months and ≤30 years of age.

          -  Stratum A: Non-Malignant Diseases, including:

               -  Bone Marrow Failure Syndromes

               -  Hemoglobinopathies or transfusion-dependent RBC defects

               -  Congenital Immunodeficiencies

               -  Metabolic Diseases known to be treatable with HCT (e.g. Hurler's)

               -  Other Bone Marrow Stem Cell Defects (e.g. Osteopetrosis)

               -  Severe Immune Dysregulation / Autoimmune Syndromes with at least transient prior
                  response to immunosuppressive therapy

          -  Stratum B: Myeloid Malignancies, including:

               -  AML, in greater than first clinical remission, or in CR1 but with detectable
                  disease (≥0.1% Blasts by MRD or Flow, or Positive Cytogenetics), or in CR1 but
                  with a matched sibling UCB donor.

               -  MDS

             diseases will generally be eligible only if they have a mismatched donor, or an
             accepted clinical reason to be considered high-risk for rejection.

          -  Liver transaminases (AST/ALT) and Direct Bilirubin less than twice the upper limit of
             normal within 2 weeks of admission.

             cc/min/1.73 m2, within 4 weeks of admission.

          -  Pulmonary diffusion capacity ≥50% of predicted corrected for anemia/lung volume within
             4 weeks of admission. If unable to do PFT's, then no active lung disease by CXR and/or
             O2 Sat ≥90% on room air.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Fanconi Anemia

          -  Dyskeratosis Congenita

          -  A known syndrome with increased sensitivity to radiation or alkylating agents

          -  A mismatched donor for whom ex vivo T-cell depletion of the donor stem cells is
             planned
