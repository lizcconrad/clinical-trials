  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There have been reports of monitoring LSR during MVD surgery helps predicting the clinical
      outcome of MVD.However, there have been no evidence of which degree of partial neuromuscular
      blockade should be performed or no neuromuscular blockade could be performed during LSR
      monitoring. Therefore, we performed a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of
      different degree of partial neuromuscular blockade, including no neuromuscular blockade on
      the LSR monitoring for MVD surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hemifacial spasm develops by vascular compression of facial nerve at the root exit zone from
      brain stem. Microvascular decompression (MVD) is known for its curative treatment. Lateral
      spread response (LSR) is a kind of pathologic electromyographic (EMG) wave form which
      develops when facial nerve is compressed by vessel. There have been reports of monitoring LSR
      during MVD surgery helps predicting the clinical outcome of MVD.

      As neuromuscular blockade during LSR monitoring decreases the amplitude of EMG, partial
      neuromuscular blockade is usually maintained during general anesthesia for MVD. However,
      there have been no evidence of which degree of partial neuromuscular blockade should be
      performed or no neuromuscular blockade could be performed during LSR monitoring. Therefore,
      we performed a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of different degree of
      partial neuromuscular blockade, including no neuromuscular blockade on the LSR monitoring for
      MVD surgery.
