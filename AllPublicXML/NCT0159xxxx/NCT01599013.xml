  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is assessing the combination of well known cytotoxics with a novel anti-cancer
      agent that could be administered as monotherapy without renal toxicity in patients with renal
      impairment presenting with advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma previously treated
      with a platinum-based regimen. The intent of this study is to clarify the benefit/risk ratio
      of the two most promising associations of cytotoxics including the novel therapeutic agent,
      vinflunine: vinflunine-gemcitabine and vinflunine-carboplatin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gemcitabine and carboplatin have been the most studied and used anticancer agents in
      cisplatin-unfit patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma. Both agents previously
      demonstrated clinical activity as single agent and/or as part of combination regimen in
      patients with advanced or metastatic disease even if clinical benefits and survival remains
      limited in this setting for this population.

      The purpose of this study is to test in a randomized trial enrolling patients with renal
      impairment or moderate congestive heart failure two combinations of a novel cytotoxic agent,
      vinflunine, one with gemcitabine and another with carboplatin in order to determine the most
      promising combination in the first line treatment of advanced/metastatic urothelial
      carcinoma.

    <description>Population: all treated patients unless the patient is lost to follow-up immediately after the start of the treatment. The patients will be analysed in the treatment arm they actually received.
The NCI-CTC classification version 2.0 will be used to classify toxicities. Maximum grade or severity will be reported by cycle and by patient for each MedDRA Preferred Term. Analyses will be performed both regardless the relationship to treatment and related to treatment.
Biochemical toxicities: the worst CTCAE version 2.0 grade will be analysed according to the grade present at baseline.</description>
