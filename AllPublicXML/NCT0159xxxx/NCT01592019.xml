  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that a technique called microdialysis can be used to measure
      the amount of the drug diclofenac which penetrates (enters) the fatty tissue under the skin.
      Microdialysis uses a small device called a 'probe' to determine the amount of drug which
      enters a body tissue. The small device is placed directly in the fatty tissue and samples are
      taken at specific times. The investigators will determine whether site of application affects
      the availability of the drug.

    <description>Blood and tissue concentrations (nanograms/milliliter) of the drug diclofenac will be measured and compared between different batches of the product Flector. In addition, the two batches will be compared at different application sites, namely the abdomen and thigh. Tissue concentrations will be measured using microdialysis.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males or females, between 18 and 55 years of age.

          -  Body mass index of 18.5 and 32 kg/m2, inclusive.

          -  Non-smoker (not smoked for 12 months prior to screening).

          -  Healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical history, and vital signs.

          -  Healthy on the basis of clinical laboratory tests performed at screening. If the
             results of the serum chemistry panel (including liver enzymes, other specific tests)
             and hematology are outside the normal reference ranges, the subject may be included
             only if the study physician judges the abnormalities or deviations from normal to be
             not clinically significant.

          -  Female subjects must be postmenopausal (for at least 6 months), surgically sterile, or
             abstinent; or, if of childbearing potential and sexually active, be practicing an
             effective method of birth control (e.g., prescription oral contraceptives,
             contraceptive injections, intrauterine device, double-barrier method, contraceptive
             patch) before entry and throughout the study. Also, subjects must have a negative
             serum human chorionic gonadotropin pregnancy test at the initial screening.

             the study.

          -  Subjects should be willing to shower using the same soap/cleansers between the
             screening visit and the end of the study, namely the Oil of Olay Moisturizing Bar
             Soaps with Shea Butter.

          -  Subjects should be willing avoid the use of body oils, creams, lotions, or powders to
             the test areas for a period of 48 hours before the application of patches.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically significant abnormal values for hematology or chemistry at screening.

          -  History of current significant medical illness including (but not limited to)
             cardiovascular thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, stroke or other cardiac
             disease, hypertension, peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding, skin
             disorders, hematological disease, bronchospastic respiratory disease, asthma, diabetes
             mellitus, renal or hepatic insufficiency, or any other illness that the investigator
             considers should exclude the subject.

          -  History of atopic eczema, dry skin or ichthyosis.

          -  Excessive hair at the site of application that could possibly affect drug absorption;
             scar tissue, open tissue(s), tattoo or coloration that would interfere with the test
             sites, their assessments, and their reaction to drug, or that may compromised the
             safety of the subjects.

          -  Known allergies or hypersensitivity to Flector® Patch or diclofenac-containing
             products.

             blood pressure &gt;140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure &gt;90 mmHg, heart rate &gt;100 bpm and
             &lt;45 bpm).

          -  Received an investigational drug (including vaccines) within 60 days prior to study

             equivalent amount of blood within 60 days prior to study drug administration.

             well-being of the subject or the study or prevent the subject from meeting or
             performing study requirements.

          -  Employees of the investigator or study center, with direct involvement in the proposed
             study or other studies under the direction of that investigator or study center, as
             well as family members of the employees or the investigator.
