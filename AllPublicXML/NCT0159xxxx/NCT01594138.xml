  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether patients who have a high risk for serious
      suicide behavior will demonstrate a speech pattern that has a relationship to language
      patterns found in suicide notes.

      In an average week the CCHMC Emergency Department (ED) evaluates 40 patients with suicidal
      behavior. Currently, there is no systematic method for assessment of suicide risk in these
      patients and often, emergency department staff are required to make judgments about the
      disposition of these patients without a full understanding of the patient's risk for another
      serious suicide attempt. This pilot project involves experts in child psychiatry, biomedical
      informatics, and emergency medicine to collect pilot data for developing a method to estimate
      the risk of serious suicidal behavior based on computational linguistics.
