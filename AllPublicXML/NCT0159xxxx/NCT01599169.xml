      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and the tolerance of the food

      Extramel®, on the burnout syndrome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The burnout syndrome currently concern all the professional categories. In 2010 the WHO
      estimated that the three countries with the most important work-related depression are Unites
      States, Ukraine and France. The direct and indirect costs of work-related stress for the
      insurance program were not insignificant.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of the food supplement B-Back®
      proposed in order to improved the symptoms of the burnout syndrome : stress, fatigue,
      emotional imbalance, anxiety, sleep, etc.

      The main objective is to determine the efficacy of B-Back® on the symptoms suggestive of the
      burnout syndrome by using the Burnout Measure Short version (BMS-10). The others objectives
      were to evaluate the tolerance of the product, to evaluate the efficacy of B-Back® on the
      symptoms suggestive of the burnout syndrome by using the Maslach Burnout Inventory,
      depression, and the global quality of professional and family life, sleep,and fatigue
      (energy).
