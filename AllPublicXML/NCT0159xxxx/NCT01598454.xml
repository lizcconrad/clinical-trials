  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be carried out in children with diagnosis of cancer with tumors known to
      express N-glycolylated gangliosides. The disease must be resistant to conventional therapy.
      The acute toxicity and immune response will be evaluated.

      The expression of N-glycolylated gangliosides in tumors has previously been investigated in
      the tumor sample bank at this Hospital. The expression of N-glycolyl GM3 was shown in
      neuroblastoma, Ewing's sarcoma, Wilm's tumor and retinoblastoma.

      Gliomas and the aforementioned tumor types have a very bad prognosis when conventional
      treatment is ineffective.

      New therapeutic strategies have thus been examined, and several immunotherapeutic approaches,
      including dendritic cell vaccines, peptide vaccines and anti-idiotype vaccines are currently
      being assessed.

      Racotumomab is an anti-idiotype antibody capable of inducing anti-N-glycolyl GM3 antibodies
      in patients with melanoma, breast cancer and lung cancer.

      Dose escalation studies have shown the safety of racotumomab in the 0.5 to 2 mg dose range.
      The 1 mg dose level was selected for the ensuing clinical studies.

      This clinical trial in children involves three dose levels: 0.15 mg, 0.25 mg and 0.4 mg,
      owing to the difference in body surface between an adult (1.73 sq. m in average) and the
      candidate population for this study (0.55 to 0.7 sq. m).
