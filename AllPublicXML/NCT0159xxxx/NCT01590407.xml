  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-part study will assess the safety,
      tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of orally administered ALS-002200 in healthy volunteers
      (HV) and subjects with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) genotype 1 infection.

      Part 1 will assess single ascending dosing pharmacokinetics and safety in HV. Part 2 will
      assess food effects on pharmacokinetics in HV. Part 3 will assess multiple ascending dosing
      pharmacokinetics and safety in subjects with CHC genotype 1 infection.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has provided written consent.

          -  In the investigator's opinion, the subject is able to understand and comply with
             protocol requirements, instructions, and protocol stated restrictions and is likely to
             complete the study as planned.

          -  Subject is in good health as deemed by the investigator.

          -  Creatinine clearance of greater than 50 mL/min (Cockcroft-Gault)

          -  Male or female, 18-55 years of age for HV and 18-65 years of age for subjects with
             CHC.

          -  Body mass index (BMI) 18-32 kg/m2 inclusive for HV and 18-36 kg/m2 for subjects with
             CHC, minimum weight 50 kg in both populations.

          -  A female is eligible to participate in this study if she is of non childbearing
             potential.

          -  If male, subject is surgically sterile or practicing specific forms of birth control.

        Additional inclusion criteria for subjects with CHC genotype 1 infection:

          -  Positive HCV antibody and a positive HCV RNA at screening.

          -  Positive test for HAV IgM, HBsAg, HCV Ab (HV only), or HIV Ab.

          -  Abnormal screening laboratory results that are considered clinically significant by
             the investigator.

          -  Drug allergy such as, but not limited to, sulfonamides and penicillins, including
             those experienced in previous trials with experimental drugs.

          -  Participation in an investigational drug trial or having received an investigational
             vaccine within 30 days or 5 half lives (whichever is longer) prior to study
             medication.

          -  Clinically significant blood loss or elective blood donation of significant volume.

          -  For healthy subjects, history of regular use of tobacco.

          -  The subject has a positive pre-study drug screen.

          -  Laboratory abnormalities including:

               -  Hematocrit &lt; 34 %
