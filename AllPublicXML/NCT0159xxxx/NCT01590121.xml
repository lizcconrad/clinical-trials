  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hereditary Haemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) is a condition in which sufferers have abnormal
      blood vessels which makes them more likely to bleed than other people, particularly in the
      lungs, which results in low blood oxygen levels. Flying may make this worse and cause
      problems. The investigators want to know if there are an increased number of problems on
      flights compared to on land.

      The investigators currently do not have any evidence based guidelines on air travel to best
      advice people who suffer with HHT. The investigators would therefore like to ask individuals
      who have HHT about their experience on a flight, using a postal questionnaire.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with Hereditary Haemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) previously reviewed at HHTIC
      London will be sent an invitation to participate in a short questionnaire study.

      Quantitative variables from the questionnaires for statistical analysis will be the number of
      individuals responding (and number of questionnaires sent out); number of flights taken and
      number of complications, subgrouped by type, and flight duration in hours. Complication rates
      will be expressed as proportion of person flight hours.

      The quantitative data from the questionnaire will then be compared with quantitative data
      from patients' medical records using non parametric methods such as Mann Whitney for
      univariate analyses.
