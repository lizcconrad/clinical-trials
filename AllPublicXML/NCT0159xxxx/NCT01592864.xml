    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Evaporative Air Sensitivity Pain Response on a Schiff Sensitivity Scale at Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 8 weeks post administration of study treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Response to a constant jet of air applied to hypersensitive teeth is evaluated using a Schiff Sensitivity pain response scale. According to this analog scale, pain response for each individual stimulated tooth ranged from 0 to 3; 0 - participant does not respond to air stimulation, 1 - participant responds to air stimulus but does not request discontinuation of stimulus, 2 - participant responds to air stimulus and request discontinuation of stimulus, 3 - participant responds to air stimulus, considers stimulus to be painful and request discontinuation of stimulus.</description>

    <measure>Adjusted Mean Change From Baseline in Tactile Sensitivity Pain Response at Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 8 weeks post administration of study treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Response to increasing force on hypersensitive teeth was evaluated using a Yeaple Probe pain response scale. The constant pressure probe allowed the examiner to vary the force applied to the dentin surface from 10 grams (g) to an upper threshold of 80 g, in increments of 10g since the values below represents adjusted mean change in baseline, the value can fall below scale range. The greater the pressure the subject was able to tolerate, the less. Change from baseline in tactile response to Week 8 was calculated.

According to this analog scale, pain response for each individual stimulated tooth ranged from 0 to 3; 0 - participant does not respond to air stimulation, 1 - participant responds to air stimulus but does not request discontinuation of stimulus, 2 - participant responds to air stimulus and request discontinuation of stimulus, 3 - participant responds to air stimulus, considers stimulus to be painful and request discontinuation of stimulus.</description>

        <description>Response to increasing force on hypersensitive teeth was evaluated using a Yeaple Probe pain response scale. The constant pressure probe allowed the examiner to vary the force applied to the dentin surface from 10 grams (g) to an upper threshold of 80 g, in increments of 10g since the values below represents adjusted mean change in baseline, the value can fall below scale range. The greater the pressure the subject was able to tolerate, the less. Change from baseline in tactile response to Week 8 was calculated.
