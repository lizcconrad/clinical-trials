  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize everolimus toxicities are linked to pharmacokinetic
      variabilities of everolimus. Thus, early detection of clinical or biological risk factors
      will lead to personalized dosage treatment and permit a better tolerance without altering
      efficacy.

    <description>The recommended dose of Afinitor is 10 mg everolimus once daily, at fixed hour.Treatment should continue as long as clinical benefit is observed or until unacceptable toxicity occurs.
In case of frail patients, treatment could be initiated at a lower daily-dose (5mg/d for example) and then increase if tolerance is acceptable.</description>
