  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study were:

      To compare repeated doses of YF476 at 2 dose levels, placebo and omeprazole with respect to
      their effect on basal- and food- stimulated gastric pH in healthy volunteers.

      To compare repeated doses of YF476 at 2 dose levels, placebo and omeprazole with respect to
      their effect on basal and meal stimulated pH.

      To assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of repeated doses of YF476 in healthy
      volunteers.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      YF476 is clearly a potent and selective gastrin/CCK-B antagonist and should inhibit basal and
      meal-stimulated gastric acid secretion, enhance gastric emptying of a liquid meal and
      increase lower oesphageal sphincter pressure in man. Therefore YF476 might benefit patients
      with reflux oesophagitis.

      YF476 has been well tolerated in healthy volunteers at single doses up to 100mg and
      remarkably well tolerated at repeat doses in animals up to 350 times the maximum dose planned
      for the proposed study. A range of doses of YF476 (25 and 100mg twice daily) will be
      administered to steady state. 24-hour ambulatory gastric pH will be monitored via an
      intragastric pH electrode to assess the effect of YF476 on basal and meal stimulated gastric
      pH. Although there is variability between subjects with respect to the effects of food and
      drug treatment on gastric pH, the methodology for measurement of ambulatory gastric pH is
      robust.

             examination at the screening assessment which could interfere with the objectives of
             the study or make the subject's participation hazardous.

          -  No clinically relevant abnormal laboratory values at the screening evaluation
             (Attachment 2).

          -  A normal ECG at the screening examination.
