  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a single blind prospective randomised control trial in patients undergoing
      ablation for the treatment of typical atrial flutter, with the aim of investigating the
      benefit of a new impedance-based computer software application which measures tissue contact
      between the ablation catheter and the inside of the heart.

      The investigators hope to demonstrate that the use of this tissue contact information reduces
      ablation time, Xray time, and procedure time required to complete the procedure successfully.
      Study participants will be randomly assigned to undergo their procedure with or without this
      contact data displayed for the doctor performing the ablation to see. The acute procedural
      endpoint of ablation is successful conduction block across the cavotricuspid isthmus of the
      right atrium. If the outcome of this study is positive, it will have a significant beneficial
      impact on this procedure, reducing procedure length, patient discomfort, and potentially
      reducing risk for the patient, recurrent arrythmia symptoms, and the need for repeat
      procedures later on.

      Patients in this study will be de novo cases of atrial flutter ablation, and they will be
      randomised to ablation using tissue contact data provided by the St. Jude medical ECI
      technology (active arm), or standard ablation as per physician practice, without the use of
      contact data to guide ablation (control arm). The endpoint measures will include RF ablation
      time, procedure time, time to achieving cavotricuspid isthmus block, the need for &quot;touch up&quot;
      ablation to achieve conduction block, the recurrence rate of isthmus conduction on isuprel
      infusion at 20 minutes post-isolation, and clinical recurrence of atrial flutter
      post-operatively.
