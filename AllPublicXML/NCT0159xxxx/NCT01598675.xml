  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many of the 780,000 people affected by stroke each year are left with slow, asymmetric
      walking patterns. The proposed project will evaluate the effectiveness of two competing motor
      learning approaches to restore symmetric gait for faster, more efficient, and safer walking.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Walking after stroke is characterized by reduced gait speed and the presence of interlimb
      spatiotemporal asymmetry. These step length and stance time asymmetries can be energy
      inefficient, challenge balance control, increase the risk of falls and injury, and limit
      functional mobility. Current rehabilitation to improve gait is based on one of two competing
      motor learning strategies: minimizing or augmenting symmetry errors during training.
      Conventional rehabilitation often involves walking on a treadmill while therapists attempt to
      minimize symmetry errors during training. Although this approach can successfully improve
      gait speed, it does not produce long-term changes in symmetry. Conversely, augmenting or
      amplifying symmetry errors has been produced by walking on a split belt treadmill with the
      belts set at different fixed speeds. While this approach produced an 'after-effect' resulting
      in step length symmetry for short periods of time, with some evidence of long term learning
      in people with stroke, it had no influence on stance time asymmetry. The investigators
      propose that patients need real-time proprioceptive feedback of symmetry errors so that they
      are actively engaged in the learning process. For this project, the investigators developed
      and validated a novel, responsive, 'closed loop' control system, using a split-belt
      instrumented treadmill that continuously adjusts the difference in belt speeds to be
      proportional to the patient's current asymmetry. Using this system, the investigators can
      either augment or minimize asymmetry on a step-by-step basis to determine which motor
      learning strategy produces the largest improvement in overground spatiotemporal symmetry.
