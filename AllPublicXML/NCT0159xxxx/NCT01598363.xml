  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential effect of bardoxolone methyl on the
      pharmacokinetics of digoxin and rosuvastatin and to assess the safety of the concomitant
      administration of bardoxolone methyl with digoxin or rosuvastatin.

    <textblock>
      Subjects in Cohort 1 will receive a single dose of digoxin (0.5 mg) on Study Day 1, an
      initial dose of bardoxolone methyl (60 mg) and a single dose of digoxin (0.5 mg) on Study Day
      10, and once daily doses of bardoxolone methyl (20 mg) on Study Days 11 through 14. Subjects
      in Cohort 2 will receive a single dose of rosuvastatin (20 mg) on Study Day 1, an initial
      dose of bardoxolone methyl (60 mg) and a single dose of rosuvastatin (20 mg) on Study Day 10,
      and once daily doses of bardoxolone methyl (20 mg) on Study Days 11 through 14. All doses
      will be given in the morning under fasting conditions. Bardoxolone methyl and the probe
      substrates (digoxin, rosuvastatin) will be dosed at the same time. Confinement will begin on
      Study Day -1 (Study Day before the first dosing day) and end after the collection of the 216
      hour blood samples and scheduled study procedures on Study Day 19.
