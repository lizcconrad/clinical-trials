  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of neuropathic pain ist still a challenge. A new promising therapy is the use
      of capsaicin on skin.

      The investigators first experiences with capsaicin in patients with peripheral nerve injury
      showed changes in the sensibility, which achieved its maximal extent after four weeks and was
      regressive, but not completely abolished 1,5 months after application.

      In this study the investigators hope to specify, how long and in which way exactly this
      changes in sensibility appear.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The topical application of a high dosage of capsaicin (8%) is a new promising approach. There
      is only little knowledge about the extent and the duration of drug-induced changes of
      detection and pain thresholds based on a currently recommended standardized quantitative
      sensory testing (QST). The assessment of QST changes would be an important step forward to
      understand the way of action as well as the time course of the presumed recovering of the
      C-fiber function after topical application of a high concentration capsaicin patch.

      10 patients suffering from peripheral neuropathic pain due to peripheral nerve injury and 10
      patients suffering from postherpetic neuralgia will be investigated by QST following the
      protocol of DFNS (German Research Network on Neuropathic Pain), using both thermal and
      mechanical nociceptive as well as non-nociceptive stimuli.

      QST will be performed at the following times:

        -  at baseline

        -  2, 4, 6, 8 weeks later, and every two weeks at least until re-occurrence of pain and/or
           recovering of the capsaicin-induced worsening of the C-fiber function.
