  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The population is aging and chronic conditions, which are major causes of pain and mobility
      limitations, are on the rise, however, current access to physiotherapy is difficult.
      Knowledge on managing disability is substantial, but methods to translate into action are
      lacking. This project is designed to test a novel method of promoting function in vulnerable
      seniors and simultaneously develop awareness in the new generation of physiotherapists that
      they can have a proactive role in health promotion. The investigators are proposing a pilot
      project targeting both students and patients.

      The research question are (1) What are the needs of vulnerable patients at the MUHC? Two
      groups will be targeted; newly discharged seniors (who will be eligible for an intervention)
      and cancer outpatients who will be surveyed only);(2) For a senior population at risk for
      physical deterioration, to what extent is a personalized mentoring approach to optimizing
      function and preventing disability through developing self-management skills more effective
      in improving outcomes than the provision of written material covering the same general
      content? (3) Does a mentoring experience with vulnerable seniors through development and
      teaching of a self-management program (comprised of education and support) produce meaningful
      positive changes in future clinicians' knowledge, skills and attitude towards modes of
      delivering physiotherapy services and promoting self-management in Canadian seniors?

      There are two phases to this study: a survey and randomized controlled trial (RCT). The
      survey phase will identify mobility needs of two groups, newly discharged seniors and cancer
      outpatients. The needs assessment for newly discharged seniors will identify people eligible
      for the (RCT) component; the needs assessment for cancer outpatients will inform the
      development of interventions for this specific group. The RCT component will be piloted for
      recently discharged community dwelling seniors 70 years and older only.

      A sample of 400 seniors recently discharged from the adult, general, hospital sites of the
      MUHC will be contacted for a needs assessment. From this pool, the investigators anticipate
      100 will be eligible and 60 will be randomized, 30 to the mentor intervention and 30 to the
      control group. Participants will be followed-up for 6 months and assessments will be
      performed at 2 time points (baseline and 6 months). The main outcome is a standardized
      response ratio (SRR) estimated across all persons and measures. SRRs will be calculated for
      three groups of response variables: impairment/mobility measures, quality of life indicators,
      and health services outcomes.

      In parallel, to determine cancer survivor needs, the investigators will contact 600 cancer
      survivors; as the investigators anticipate 400 will answer the survey. The analysis of this
      survey will consist of frequency of specific needs by diagnosis and treatment.

    <description>will be offered an evaluation and treatment plan supervised by a qualified physiotherapist, accompanied by written and visual material to enhance mobility self-management skills, supported by telephone mentoring by physiotherapy students in the Professional Master's program. The components of the mobility self-management program will target skill enhancement of each senior to identify their functional limitations, set realistic goals for mobility improvement, develop a mobility action plan, carry out the plan, and then re-assess their function and mobility. Mobility self-assessment, personalized goals, and the action plan will be incorporated into a personalized workbook that the senior can use to monitor their function profile and serve as a communication aid during health care encounters.</description>
