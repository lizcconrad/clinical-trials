  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine what contribution of 'markers' of fruit and vegetable (FV) intake in
      blood and urine is most closely related to FV intake. 30 healthy volunteers will be fed
      either 2, 5 or 8 portions of FV per day for 4 weeks (ten participants per group, randomly
      assigned). Volunteers will have all their food provided during the study, and will consume
      two meals each weekday at the University. Volunteers will complete diet and lifestyle
      questionnaires at the start and end of the study and will have blood and urine samples
      collected at 0, 2 and 4 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Single biomarkers of FV consumption, such as Vitamin C and certain carotenoids and
      flavonoids, have been proposed, but associations between these compounds and FV intake are
      relatively weak. The investigators propose that, given the complexity of FV, production of an
      algorithm based on a wide variety of bioactive compounds found in FV might better predict FV
      consumption. A controlled feeding study (30 volunteers randomised to 2, 5 or 8 portions of FV
      day for 4 weeks) will allow development of such an algorithm. Volunteers will be recruited by
      advertisement from QUB and the general public, and will have all their food provided for the
      4 week period (two meals per day during the week to be consumed under supervision at the
      University).
