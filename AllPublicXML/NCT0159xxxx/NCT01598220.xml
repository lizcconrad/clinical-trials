      The purpose of this study is to determine whether computer-assisted cognitive remediation
      therapy is effective in the treatment of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.

      Schizophrenia can be considered a chronic illness that affects all aspects of daily life.
      Cognitive deficits seems to play a key role that interferes directly in the functional
      adaptation.

      Cognitive remediation therapy (CRT) emerges as a psychological intervention that target
      cognitive impairment. But, the use of computerized or papel an pencil procedures for
      remediation cognitive deficits remains controversial. Nonetheless, computer tasks offer a
      number of advantages compared to those of paper and pencil. The most noteworthy advantages
      are to enhance patient's motivation just because the sensory variety that the exercises
      presented or the possibility to provide immediate feedback. Furthermore, the possibility to
      present custom-tailored and adapted tasks taking into accounts the patients deficits and
      their evolution in the process of the psychological therapy is another important feature of
      computer-assisted cognitive remediation therapy.

    <description>Comparison of two groups:
The experimental group performs 48 sessions of computer exercices designed to remedy cognitive domains(attention, speed of processing, working memory,reasoning and problem solving) frequently affected in schizophrenia.
The intervention has a period 6 months , two sessions a week. All exercises provided a visual or verbal feedback to immediately terminate the execution.In addition to, the therapist after the sessions interactively explain the results and the strategies employed by the patient.</description>
