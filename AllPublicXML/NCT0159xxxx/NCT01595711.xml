  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The skin conductance algesimeter (Pain Monitorâ„¢, Med-Storm Innovation AS, NO-0264 Oslo,
      Norway)) reflects the sympathetic nervous system by the measurement of the skin conductance
      of the palm of the hand. SCA detects nociceptive pain fast and continuously, specific to the
      individual, with higher sensitivity and specificity than other available objective methods.

      The skin conductance response to a calibrated noxious stimulus varies among patients. It
      defines two types of people depending on its magnitude.

      The investigators assume that the importance of skin conductance response to a noxious
      stimulus predicts the occurrence of chronic pain in patients operated by thoracotomy.
