      The purpose of this study is to validate an integrated pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model
      to administer propofol in obese patients.

      Our hypothesis is that pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes occur with increasing
      weight and that mathematical models to administer drugs in obese patients can be developed to
      accurately predict dose schemes in this population.

    <textblock>
      Propofol is the most frequently used IV anesthetic today. Propofol TCI is commonly used for
      induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia in obese and non obese patients. However,
      current propofol PK models, used in TCI devices, were derived from studies that did not
      include obese patients. A controversial issue for propofol dose adjustment in this population
      has been the selection of an adequate size descriptor to scale PK parameters, as drug
      administration based on total body weight can result in overdose, and conversely,
      administration based on ideal body weight can result in a sub-therapeutic dose. In a previous
      study from our group, we developed a PK model capable of characterizing the influence of
      obesity on propofol disposition. The purpose of this study is to validate this model to
      administer propofol in obese patients.

    <description>General anesthesia will be induced administering propofol by effect site TCI system using our previously derived model, the target plasma concentration initially will be set at 4 mcg/ml. After loss of consciousness, rocuronium 0.6mg/kg, and remifentanil 0.2mcg/kg/min will be given to facilitate tracheal intubation. After intubation propofol target will be decreased to 3 for 10 minutes and then adapted to the needs of each patient to maintain stable BIS values between 40 and 50. At the end of surgery propofol infusion will be stopped, and patients will be transferred to the recovery unit extubated. Samples of 2.5 ml of arterial blood will be taken at 2, 5 and 10 min after every new target is set. Thereafter samples will be taken at 2, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 120 min after stopping drug infusion. Blood samples will be immediately centrifuged and then stored until analysis.</description>
