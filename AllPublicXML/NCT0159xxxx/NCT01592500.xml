             hormone deficiency.

          2. Confirmed diagnosis of GHD by two different GH provocation tests defined as a peak
             plasma GH level of ≤7 ng/ml, determined by central laboratory using a validated assay
             .

          3. Bone age (BA) is not older than chronological age and should be no greater than 9
             years for girls and 10 years for boys.

          4. Without prior exposure to any r-hGH therapy.

          5. Normal birth size, birth weight and length for gestational age

          6. Impaired height and height velocity defined as:

               1. Height (HT) of at least 2.0 standard deviations (SD) below the mean height for
                  chronological age (CA) and gender according to the standards from Prader et. al,
                  1989 , (HT SDS ≤ -2.0).

               2. Annualized height velocity (HV) below the 25th percentile for CA (HV &lt;-0.7 SDS)
                  and gender according to the standards of Prader et al (1989). The interval
                  between two height measurements should be at least 6 months before inclusion.

          7. BMI must be within ±2 SD of mean BMI for the chronological age and sex according to
             the 2000 CDC standards.

          8. Baseline IGF-I level of at least 1 SD below the mean IGF-I level standardized for age
             and sex (IGF-I SDS ≤ -1.0) according to the central laboratory reference values;

          9. 12. Written informed consent of the parent or legal guardian of the patient and assent
             of the patient (if the patient can read).

        Exclusion Criteria:

               1. Serum albumin below the lower limit of normal (LLN) according to the reference
                  ranges of central laboratory;

               2. Serum iron below the lower limit of normal (LLN) according to the reference
                  ranges of central laboratory;

          4. Children with psychosocial dwarfism.

          5. Children born small for gestational age (SGA - birth weight and/or birth length &lt; -2
             SD for gestational age).

             Noonan syndrome, Prader-Willi Syndrome, Russell-Silver Syndrome, SHOX

             dysplasia.

         11. Closed epiphyses.

         12. Concomitant administration of other treatments that may have an effect on growth such
             as anabolic steroids and methylphenidate for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
             (ADHD), with the exception of hormone replacement therapies (thyroxine,
             hydrocortisone, desmopressin (DDAVP))
