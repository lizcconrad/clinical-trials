  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn whether women who use progestin-only methods of birth
      control such as the contraceptive implant (Implanon), the levonorgestral-releasing IUS
      (Mirena), or depot medroxyprogesterone acetate(DMPA) will experience weight change compared
      to women using the non-hormonal copper IUC (ParaGard).

      The investigators primary hypothesis is that users of DMPA will gain excess weight and
      increase their BMI above the copper-IUC users; secondarily, the investigators will compare
      users' data in the LNG-IUC and ENG implant groups to the copper-IUC group.

        Participants already enrolled in the Contraceptive CHOICE Project will be offered
        participation during their 12-month follow up window if they had originally selected one of
        the four methods being studied during CHOICE enrollment.
