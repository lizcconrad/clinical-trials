  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of combined glucagon-like-peptide-1
      (GLP-1) analogue and metformin therapy on glucose metabolic and cardiovascular endpoints
      compared to metformin monotherapy in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and newly
      diagnosed type 2 diabetes (T2D).

      It is hypothesized that GLP-1 analogue added to backbone therapy of metformin in CAD patients
      with T2D will improve beta-cell function, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), heart
      rate variability and lower 24h blood pressure among other selected endpoints.

      The present study on CAD patients with newly diagnosed T2D will address these selected
      endpoints during an investigator initiated, randomized, double blind, crossover,
      placebo-controlled 12 + 12 weeks intervention study with a 2 week wash-out period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The total study period for each patient will be 26 weeks (12 plus 12 weeks of intervention
      with a 2 week wash-out period).

      The endpoints will be evaluated at baseline (week 0), at week 12, at week 14 (following 2
      weeks of wash-out) and finally at week 26.
