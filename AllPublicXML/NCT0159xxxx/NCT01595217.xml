      Researching the diagnostic significance of Biliary Tract Neoplasm under combining DWI
      sequence with MRCP versus MRCP only separately.

      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the usefulness of diffusion weighted imaging(DWI)
      combined with MRCP of 3.0T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the evaluation of suspected
      malignant bile duct diseases. People with suspected Biliary Tract Neoplasm based on clinical
      symptoms (such as jaundice and thinness with unknown reasons) and CA-199 value raises are
      included.Diagnosis divided into two steps: the first one，only provide conventional MR
      sequences and MRCP images to make a diagnosis; the second step,provide the DWI images
      additionally, combining the image data before to make a diagnosis. Hypothesis is that DWI
      sequence should be regularly added into MRCP examination for improving diagnosis rate of
      Biliary Tract Neoplasm.

    <masking_description>Two experienced professors of radiology observed and analyzed the images separately. They were not involved in image acquisition and were blinded to the patients' clinical, surgical and histological information. Conventional MR sequences were qualitatively analyzed in the first reading session, including T2WI, FIESTA, 2D MRCP and 3D MRCP sequences, and after one week, DWI under three different b values with ADC map combined with the preceding conventional sequences were analyzed respectively as the second reading session.</masking_description>

    <time_frame>at the end of the study</time_frame>
    <description>The ADC value of EHCC in DWI under various b values was measured, and the SNR, the CNR and the SIR in DWI were calculated. The formula for calculating the ADC value was: ADC = [ln (S1 /S2)]/ (b2 -b1) , (S and b represent signal intensity and b value, 1 and 2 represent low and high, respectively).</description>
