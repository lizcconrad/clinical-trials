  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will perform a randomised controlled trial of the provision of food
      designed for rehabilitation of malnourished children that is supplemented with n-3 fatty
      acids compared to usual composition. The investigators want to see whether the provision of
      such a food normalises the deficiencies in essential fatty acids observed in severely
      malnourished children faster than standard composition.

      Randomized controlled trial of n-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid-Enriched Therapeutic Food for
      Severe Malnutrition.

      Description of Study Design: Randomized Controlled Trial

      Study Duration: 6 months (Trial); 12 months (All trial-related activities)

      Description of Intervention: Provision of ready to use food (RUTF) enriched with flax seed
      oil, with or without fish oil, compared to conventional-composition RUTF. Interventional
      product will be given until nutritional recovery to a maximum of 12 weeks.

      Design: Flax-enriched or standard RUTF allocation is randomised and double blind. Fish oil
      allocation is randomised within those receiving flax-enriched RUTF and is open label.

      Location: Kilifi District, coastal Kenya.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Children aged 6 months to 5 years old

          -  Provision of informed consent

          -  Severe malnutrition (one or more of mid-upper arm circumference &lt;11.5cm, weight for
             height z score &lt;-3, or nutritional oedema)

          -  Stabilised and eligible to receive RUTF according to national guidelines

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known HIV disease, tuberculosis or other chronic infection*

          -  Known allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the product ingredients

               -  Chronic infections such as HIV and tuberculosis and their treatments are likely
                  to cause alterations in lipid metabolism that may confound interpretation of this
                  pilot trial. national guidelines recommend offering provider-initiated testing
                  for HIV for all severely malnourished children, and referral for comprehensive
                  care in the case of a positive test.
