  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current treatment options for hemangiomas, such as propranolol, steroids and interferon, all
      have the potential for significantly harmful side effects. The purpose of this study is to
      identify potential biomarkers that can be used to design clinical trials and accelerate the
      delivery of new treatment alternatives to children with hemangiomas.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Urine will be collected from children with hemangiomas and age-matched healthy controls at
      2,4,6,9,12,18 and 24 months of age. Children with hemangiomas will also have ultrasound
      examination performed at each visit.
