  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a pay for performance model in contrast to the
      traditional &quot;fee for service&quot; model may improve the number of patients discharged being
      treated in accordance with Joint Commission on Health Care JCAHO (a non-for profit
      organization that accredits health care organizations) standards and standard of care for
      management of hyperlipidemia

      In this study the investigators will evaluate these two models by training resident
      physicians (doctors in training) on JCAHO core measures and specific criteria related to
      accepted standard of care for acute myocardial infarction and heart failure. The physicians
      will be randomized to a pay for performance or a fee for service model. Then a medical record
      review will be performed on patient records that received a discharge diagnosis of myocardial
      infarction or heart failure and were cared for by the physician subjects
