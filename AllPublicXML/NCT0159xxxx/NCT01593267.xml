  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With evolving endovascular technologies there is a growing debate centered on the relative
      safety and efficacy of the currently accepted alternatives for the treatment of ruptured
      cerebral aneurysms in the face of acute subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The purpose of this
      study is to compare the safety and efficacy of microsurgical clipping and endovascular
      coiling of acutely ruptured cerebral aneurysms in a prospective, randomized fashion.

      The planned trial enrolled 250 subjects per arm. Subjects are followed postoperatively and
      outcome endpoints will be assessed at Discharge, 6 Months, 1 Year, 3 Years, and 6 Years. One
      hundred (100) subjects will participate in neuropsychological testing at 1 Year; after the
      100th subject an interim data analysis will be performed and the viability of future
      neuropsychological testing will be determined. Subjects will receive preoperative,
      intraoperative or postoperative, 3 Year follow up, and 6 Year follow up angiograms. In this
      fashion immediate clinical outcome, including peri-procedural morbidity and mortality, will
      be assessed as will long term outcome, both clinical and angiographic.

    <description>Primary Outcome Measure is Modified Rankin Scale &lt; or = to 2. Data will be analyzed on intent to treat basis with crossover to the alternative treatment analyzed as a data subset. The null hypothesis is that no difference in outcome will be detected between the endovascular and surgical treatment arms. A statistically significant difference will then be considered evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis, that one treatment is superior to the other.</description>
