    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess HBV immunity and institute policy regarding the
      Hepatitis B vaccination practices in the IDF among a cohort that was vaccinated during
      infancy.

      The study population will consist of both males and females who were born after January 1st
      1992, who are in medical training at the Medical Corps Training Base. Demographic information
      will be obtained through a questionnaire given to the soldiers in the study , as well as the
      IDF computerized personnel information database.

      This study is designed to determine HBV vaccination policy among new HCWs in the IDF, who
      were vaccinated during infancy. This population was recruited to the IDF since the second
      half of 2010. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct this study on new HCWs that will be
      receiving the routine HBV vaccination and that will be at risk for HBV infection in the
      future due to their occupation in the army (HCWs, etc).
