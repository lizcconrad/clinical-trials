      The purpose of this study is to investigate Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation as
      treatment method for pain in fibromyalgia.

    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia (FIM) is a chronic pain condition with high prevalence. Studies involving
      neuroimaging techniques have identified functional differences in cerebral pain processing in
      patients with FIM, as compared to healthy controls. This may support that FIM do have a
      functional CNS component.

      Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive and safe method for inducing
      changes in cortical excitability. Previous studies showed that anodal stimulation of M1 may
      change pain perception, possibly by modulating functional anomalies in the FIM brain. The
      present study has two main goals:

        1. To investigate if tDCS may provide FIM patients with symptom relief due to reduction of
           pain.

        2. To investigate tDCS induced functional changes in the brain by using fMRI.

    <description>Pain (intensity and unpleasentness) measured with Visual Analog Scale. Repported at 3 points daily (0900hrs, 1500hrs, 2100hrs) using Short Message System (SMS) 14 days pre-treatment (baseline), during treatment 5 days, and 30 days post-treatment. Measure effect of active\sham tDCS on pain. 2 levels of group (active tDCS\ sham tDCS, 7 repeated measures: pre-treatment day 1, 2 ,3, 4, 5 - post) SMS messages contain 4 questions, mesauring pain intensity / pain unpleasentness (primary outcome), and stress / activation (secondary outcome).</description>

    <description>Pain (intensity and unpleasentness) measured with Visual Analog Scale. 3 times daily (0900hrs, 1500hrs, 2100hrs). A randomly selected sample of participants have VAS measured with SMS for 30 days pre treatment. Intention is to gather natural history sample to compare with a similarly lengthed post-treatment period.</description>

Repported at 3 points daily (0900hrs, 1500hrs, 2100hrs) using Short Message System (SMS) 14 days pre-treatment (baseline), during treatment 5 days, and 30 days post-treatment. Measure effect of active\sham tDCS on stress and activation. 2 levels of group (active tDCS\ sham tDCS, 7 repeated measures: pre-treatment day 1, 2 ,3, 4, 5 - post) Measured using the same instrumet as the primary outcome.</description>
