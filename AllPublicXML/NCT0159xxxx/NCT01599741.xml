    <textblock>
      ClarityIQ is a novel X-ray imaging technology, that combines advanced real-time image noise
      reduction algorithms, with state-of-the-art hardware to reduce patient entrance dose
      significantly. This is realized by anatomy-specific optimization of the full acquisition
      chain (grid switch, beam filtering, pulse width, spot size, detector and image processing
      engine) for every clinical task individually. Furthermore, smaller focal spot sizes, shorter
      pulses and the introduction of automatic real-time motion compensation in subtraction imaging
      are used, which are known to positively influence image quality . The final effect on the
      clinical image quality in peripheral angiography is investigated in this study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      X-ray dose and image quality are related by laws of physics. Low dose and high image quality
      cannot be achieved at the same time. However, image processing algorithms can help an x-ray
      system to acquire images with lower dose without influencing image quality or achieving
      higher image quality with equal dose. The primary aim of this study is to verify if the
      diagnostic image quality is equal or better when using a significant reduction in X-ray dose
      for endovascular digital subtraction angiography in combination with a novel imaging
      technology compared to using normal dose with conventional image technology.

    <description>Overall proportion where diagnostic image quality of ClarityIQ is scored equal or better compared to AlluraXper by the blinded reviewers. Reading is performed by simultaneous visual comparison of image quality of AlluraXper and ClarityIQ by multiple blinded readers. All blinded readers have rated all side-by-side presented images. The images are presented in a random order and blinded to the reader. The hypothesis is that the overall proportion where diagnostic image quality of ClarityIQ is scored equal or better is â‰¥ than 0.80. Combined for all raters, the lower bound of the one-sided 95% CI (lower bound of the two-sided 90% CI) is used.</description>
