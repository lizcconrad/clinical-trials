      A 5-year study to observe and describe long-term patient management and treatment patterns
      with associated outcomes of patients who previously enrolled in Protocol AI452009 (i.e., the
      CCgenos cross sectional phase, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01293279) and had their
      genotype characterized at diagnosis of HCV infection in a real world clinical practice in
      China.

      A sample of 600 Han ethnic Chinese male or female who are ≥ 18 years old enrolled and
      completed in the study of AI452-009 (i.e., CCgenos cross sectional phase, ClinicalTrials.gov
      Identifier: NCT01293279). In the AI452-009 study, all patients had a recent confirmation of
      anti-HCV-antibody positive and HCV RNA positive but antiviral treatment naive from 28
      university affiliated hospital in China. The primary objective of this study (AI452-018,
      CCgenos follow up phase, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01293279) is to observe and
      describe long-term patient management and treatment patterns with associated outcomes of
      patients who previously enrolled in Protocol AI452009 (i.e., the CCgenos cross sectional
      phase, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01293279) and had their genotype characterized at
      diagnosis of HCV infection in a real world clinical practice in China.
