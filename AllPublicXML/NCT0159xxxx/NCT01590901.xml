      The Objectives of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety of multiple oral
      doses of probucol in healthy male subjects.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single dose, single period, multiple administration, open-labeled trial in one
      investigation center.

      The screening examination will be completed from Day -14 to Day -2 before investigational
      medicinal product (IMP) administration. The subjects will be hospitalized on Day -1. From Day
      1 (the next day), the subjects will receive probucol twice daily (BID). for 14 consecutive
      days. On Day 18, the subjects can be discharged after the safety evaluation. The follow-up
      visit will occur on Day 6, 9, 12, 15, 19, 27 (totally 41 days) after the final dosing day.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Chinese.

          2. Gender: Male.

          3. Age 20 to 40 years, (at time of informed consent).

          4. Body mass index [BMI, body weight (kg) / height (m)2] between 19 and 26 kg/m2,
             inclusive.

          5. Nonsmokers (or former smokers): Urinary cotinine level satisfying the criteria for a
             nonsmoker established by the trial site (at time of screening examination).

          6. Subjects judged by the investigator to be healthy based on the medical history,
             physical examination, vital signs, 12 lead ECG, the results of serological test
             (HIV/HCV Ab, HBsAg and Syphilis Ab) and clinical laboratory tests, etc.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with hypersensitivity or a history of hypersensitivity to any drug (any
             prescription or over-the-counter [OTC] drug)

          2. Subjects who meet any of the following lipid criteria in the fasting state (at time of
             screening examination)

               -  LDL-C: ≥ 140 mg/dL

               -  TC: ≥ 220 mg/dL

               -  HDL-C: &lt; 40 mg/dL

               -  TG: ≥ 150 mg/dL

                    -  LDL-C value will be directly measured or calculated by the Friedewald
                       formula. Friedewald Formula: LDL-C = TC - HDL-C - TG/5 (When TG value is
                       less than 400 mg/dL) LDL-C value will be directly measured when TG value is
                       400 mg/dL or greater.

             administration in the present trial

          8. Plasmapheresis or plateletpheresis within 2 weeks or whole blood collection (blood
             donation, etc) cumulatively exceeding 200 mL within 4 weeks, 400 mL within 12 weeks,
             or 1200 mL within 1 year prior to scheduled IMP administration

          9. Subjects whose body weight is less than 50 kg (at time of screening examination)

         10. Subjects who are scheduled for examination or treatment at any other hospital or
             clinic during the trial period

         11. Subjects otherwise judged by the investigator or sub investigator to be inappropriate
