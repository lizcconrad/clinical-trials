  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The UK population is ageing and the likelihood of having a long term health condition
      increases with age. Three out of every five people over 60 in the UK have a long term
      condition. Ageing and having a long term condition increases the chance of having difficulty
      being independent and carrying out day to day activities. In recent years the NHS has made a
      greater effort to prevent these difficulties in patients with long term conditions.

      One approach to help patients with long term conditions is case management, where by
      (usually) a community matron visits patients at home, looking for early warning signs of any
      worsening of their condition and arranging care and treatment. But the current way this is
      done varies across the country and hospital admissions are still rising. In order to give the
      right care at the right time, effective monitoring is needed to help the community matron
      detect and act on changes in the patient's condition.

      Loss of muscle strength in old age is linked to a poor health, but it is not known whether
      simple measures of muscle strength could be used to detect and predict declines in health in
      the short to medium term to help maintain independence and prevent an accident or hospital
      admission.

      The aim of this study is to look at whether monitoring muscle strength in case managed
      patients is practical, acceptable and useful in detecting when a patient's condition worsens.
      Each patient will be visited by the researcher in their home twice in the first week, then
      once every two weeks, for another 5 weeks, to carry out three simple measures of grip and
      respiratory strength, and complete questionnaires about their health and ability to carry out
      day to day activities. Each visit will last about 20 to 30 minutes. A small group of
      clinicians will be asked about their views of the strength measures. Database analysis will
      allow descriptive data on the patient group to be gathered and analysed.
