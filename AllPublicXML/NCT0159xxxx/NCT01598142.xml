  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The single-operator wire-guided cannulation technique doesn't require an experienced
      assistant and precise coordination between the assistant and endoscopist.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A new single-operator wire-guided cannulation technique was performed on all patients. All
      procedures were performed by the same experienced endoscopist, but with different assistants
      in two groups (with an experienced one in Group A, and a new trained one in Group B). The
      number of attempts at cannulation, cannulation time, success rate, and procedure-related
      complications were compared between the two groups.
