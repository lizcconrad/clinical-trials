      Background:

      - Vaccines and antiviral therapies are critical for preventing and treating viral diseases.
      Testing these vaccines and drugs often requires healthy volunteers. To ensure that volunteers
      are healthy and eligible to participate in these studies, they will be screened before the
      start of the study. This screening may involve a medical history, physical exam, and blood
      test. Other samples may also be collected. This study will help identify volunteers who are
      eligible to participate in vaccine or antiviral therapy trials.

      Objectives:

      - To screen volunteers for clinical trials of vaccines or drugs to treat or prevent virus
      infections.

      Eligibility:

      - Healthy volunteers at least 18 years of age.

      Design:

        -  Screening may begin several months before the start of the clinical trial. Participants
           may come to the National Institutes of Health clinic one or more times.

        -  Participants may be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood samples
           will be collected. Other samples may also be collected, including urine, nasal wash,
           nasal swab, or stool samples. All samples will be stored for reference by the study
           researchers.

      Vaccines and antiviral therapies are critical for prevention and treatment of viral diseases.
      Testing of vaccines, antiviral medications, or live virus challenge studies in volunteers may
      requires knowing whether the subject has been previously infected by the virus. We will
      recruit healthy persons for this study and screen them for their eligibility to participate
      in clinical trials of investigational vaccines or antiviral products, investigational studies
      of licensed products, or live virus challenge studies. In most cases this will involve a
      medical history, physical examination, and obtaining blood to test for antibodies to the
      virus being studied in a vaccine or antiviral therapy trial or live virus challenge study. In
      some cases blood may be tested for viral DNA or RNA and urine, stool, saliva or nasal wash or
      secretions may be tested for viruses or antibodies to the virus. Additional testing, such as
      an electrocardiogram (EKG), chest radiograph (CXR), pulmonary function tests (PFTs), and
      collection of cervicovaginal secretions may be done. Blood samples will also be stored for
      future research. This study should help us to identify a group of volunteers that will be
      eligible, based on testing for their prior exposure to viruses, to participate in vaccine or
      antiviral therapy trials, or live virus challenge studies, .conducted by the Laboratory of
      Infectious Diseases, NIAID at the NIH Clinical Center.

               3. Able and willing to complete the informed consent process

               4. Agree to have blood and/or urine, stool, nasal wash samples, or cervicovaginal
                  secretion samples collected and stored for future studies of investigational or
