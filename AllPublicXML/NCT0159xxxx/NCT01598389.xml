      The purpose of this study was to compare weight-discordant siblings in eating in the absence
      of hunger, caloric compensation, and the quality of their habitual diet. The investigator
      hypothesized that, within families and controlling for age differences, overweight and obese
      siblings would show greater eating in the absence of hunger, poorer caloric compensation, and
      poorer diet quality (e.g., increased percent of energy from fat and caloric beverages)
      compared to normal-weight siblings.

      The study used a discordant sibling design to compare putative obesity-promoting eating
      traits among siblings, 5-12 years, who were raised in the same household, but were discordant
      for weight status (normal-weight: BMI-for-age between 5 and less than the 85th percentile;
      overweight/obese: BMI-for-age greater or equal to the 85th percentile). Forty-seven pairs of
      same-sex siblings (boys and girls) were recruited from the greater Philadelphia area to
      participate in a 4-week study during which their eating behaviors and body composition were
      assessed. The study tested the hypotheses that overweight/obese, compared to normal-weight,
      siblings exhibit 1) a weaker ability to compensate for calories, 2) a greater susceptibility
      towards eating in the absence of hunger, and 3) habitual dietary intakes that favor increased
      dietary energy density (kcal/g) and increased %energy derived from fat and caloric beverages.
      The use of a behavioral genetics design to study eating phenotypes among siblings is a unique
      approach to elucidate shared and non-shared environmental influences that can contribute to
      variations in weight status during childhood.

    <description>In a crossover design, siblings were served dinner once a week for 3 weeks. Across conditions, siblings were served the same dinner, but, 25 minutes before dinner, they either consumed in full or did not consume one of two preloads that varied in energy density. On the day when no preload was consumed, eating in the absence of hunger was assessed after dinner and defined as the number of calories consumed from snacks. Habitual dietary intake was assessed using 24-hour dietary recalls.</description>
