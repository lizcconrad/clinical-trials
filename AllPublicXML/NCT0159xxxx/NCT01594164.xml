      In this study the changes in upper airway geometry and resistance between images, obtained in
      upright and supine position, will be evaluated. Therefore a Cone Beam Computed Tomography
      (CBCT) scan and a low dose Computed Tomography (CT) scan will be taken in a population of 20
      subjects. The upright morphology will be obtained using CBCT scan while the supine upper
      airway geometry will be determined using a standard High Resolution Computed Tomography
      (HRCT) scanner.

          -  Subject who is pregnant or is breast-feeding.

          -  Subject with a history of surgery of the upper airway.

          -  Subject with a history of any illness that, in opinion of the investigator, might
             confound the results of the study or poses an additional risk to the subject by
             participation in the study.

          -  Subject is unlikely to comply with the protocol or unable to understand the nature,
             scope and possible consequences of the study.

          -  Subject who received any investigational new drug within the last 4 weeks prior to
             visit 1.

          -  Subject who has claustrophobia.
