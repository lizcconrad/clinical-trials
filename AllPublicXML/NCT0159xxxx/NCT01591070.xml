      The purpose of this study is to determine whether proactive use of 0.1% tacrolimus ointment
      once or twice weekly can keep adult facial SD in remission and reduce the incidence of
      exacerbation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Seborrhoeic dermatitis (SD) is a common chronic papulosquamous dermatosis, affecting 2% to
      10% of the adult population, mainly those between the ages of 20 and 50 years with a male
      bias. The affected skin appears erythematous and oedematous, covered with yellow-brown
      scales, and is often accompanied by pruritus. It typically affects areas containing sebaceous
      glands, particularly the scalp, ears, face, chest, and intertriginous areas. SD has a chronic
      course, and relapse is common. Therefore, therapy is directed toward reducing the symptoms or
      aggravating factors of SD, such as loosening and removal of scales and crusts, inhibition of
      yeast colonization, control of secondary infection, and reduction of erythema and pruritus.
      Standard topical treatments for SD include corticosteroids and anti-mycotic medications.
      However, the chronic use of topical corticosteroids particularly on the face could result in
      undesirable outcomes, such as telangiectasia, atrophy, striae, peri-oral dermatitis, or
      tachyphylaxis, and early relapse after discontinuation of treatment. SD relapse prevention
      strategies have not yet been established, so the investigators suspected that intermittent
      use of tacrolimus ointment can be effective in preventing SD relapse.

    <description>The clinical assessments of erythema, scaling, and pruritus will be evaluated by investigator using 4-point scale: 0 (absent), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), or 3 (severe).
Maintenance of stabilised facial Seborroheic dermatitis will be considered those patients who showed significant improvement of clinical assessment in erythema, scaling, and pruritus compared with the baseline values.</description>
