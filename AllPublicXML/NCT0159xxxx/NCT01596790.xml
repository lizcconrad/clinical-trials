  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer needs chemotherapy in most of the cases. During
      these last years, many new chemotherapies and targeted therapies have been developed
      improving significantly the overall survival of patients. However, the choice of the
      therapeutic sequences becomes difficult due to the lack of validated predictive biomarkers of
      their efficiency. Indeed, only the mutation of the k-ras oncogene is a predictive factor of
      non-efficacy of the anti-EGFR antibodies. It is thus crucial to identify new biomarkers to
      propose the best personalized 1rst line therapeutic sequence. One idea would be to enumerate
      and characterize the circulating tumor cells (CTC) which, as it has been described in a
      recent study realized by Cohen et al. in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, would
      give us an early evaluation of the therapeutic efficiency. In this context, the investigators
      have developed an innovative technology, the EPISPOT assay (patent of the University Medical
      Center of Montpellier), that allows the detection &amp; characterization of viable CTC in the
      peripheral blood. The EPISPOT technology has been already evaluated in the breast and
      prostate cancer. Thus, the investigators would like to perform a prospective study on a
      cohort of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer to confirm, with this technology, the
      predictive value of CTC count for the efficacy of the treatment.

      In the aim to study a homogeneous cohort of patients, the investigators will only recruit
      patients in first line of treatment and treated by 5-FU (IV), IRINOTECAN et BEVACIZUMAB
      combination.

    <description>The primary outcome aims to evaluate the predictive value of the early progression of the CTC performed with the EPISPOT assay on the PFS in a cohort of patients treated with 5-FU, IRNOTECAN et AVASTIN (FOLFIRI or XELIRI-AVASTIN) in 1rst line of metastatic colorectal cancer. The progression disease is assessed based on imagery techniques.</description>

    <description>For each patient, we will perform a counting of CTC before chemotherapy and then at different time points after chemotherapy, using both technologies: EPISPOT and CellSearch®.For the EPISPOT, we will need 15 mL of peripheral blood on EDTA tubes. For each patient, five blood samples will be done: D0, D14, D28, D42 and D56. These different time points will help us to determine when the best moment is for the evaluation of the CTC with this technology.For the CellSearch®, we will need 10 mL of peripheral blood on a specific CellSave tube. Only two samples will be perform: D0 and D28 because Cohen et al. (2008) reported that the best appropriated moment to appreciate the CTC progression is between 3 and 5 weeks after the initiation of the treatment.</description>
