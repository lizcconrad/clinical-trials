  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since it's introduction in 1979 at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center by Dr. Jon
      Kabat-Zinn, Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) has become a respected adjunct to
      conventional treatment for patients suffering from many diverse chronic ailments. Three
      decades of research have documented it's benefits, but few papers have focused on identifying
      which particular aspect of MBSR directly correlates with it's degree of therapeutic efficacy.
      This study will use 7 well validated questionnaires to compare participants responses prior
      to, and following completion of an eight-week MBSR program at the North York General
      Hospital, as well as follow-up results at 1 month and 1 year post completion of the MBSR
      group.
