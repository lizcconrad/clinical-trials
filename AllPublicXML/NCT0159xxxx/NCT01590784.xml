    <textblock>
      Depression in patients with schizophrenia is common. Several factors was found to be
      associated with depression including medical illness, quality of life, positive symptoms, and
      typical antipsychotics. The Calgary depression scale of schizophrenia (CDSS) is commonly used
      for screening depression in schizophrenia,however; the Thai version of CDSS has not been
      validated.

      This study aims to a.) test the reliability and validity of the Thai version of Calgary
      depression scale of schizophrenia (CDSS) and b.) identify the prevalence and factors
      associated with depression in patients with schizophrenia including quality of life, type of
      antipsychotic drugs, and severity of schizophrenia in 60 patients with schizophrenia at the
      Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Thailand.
