  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some Akt inhibitors have produced functional cardiovascular effects such as marked
      hypotension that may limit their clinical benefit. There are no current data on whether this
      autonomic failure presents in humans at clinically used doses. We will test the hypothesis
      that Akt inhibition causes an acute decrease in sympathetic tone and lowers blood pressure.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosed with melanoma with a BRAF mutation and relapse following therapy with a BRAF
             inhibitor

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Factors which in the investigator's opinion would prevent the participant from
