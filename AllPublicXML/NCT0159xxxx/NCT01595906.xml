  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of infantry helmets under heavy heat stress conditions, during physical exertion, may
      hinder the body's ability to effectively dissipate heat from the head area, thereby damaging
      the soldier's function. Therefore head cooling may potentially enable a longer duration of
      activity until reaching fatigue. An improvement in function may also be possible.The purpose
      of this research is to determine the extent of the cognitive and physiological strain caused
      by wearing a helmet under exertional conditions while exposed to heavy heat stress and to
      evaluate the effect of a unique ventilation system connected to the helmet on strain
      reduction.

      12 young, healthy civilian volunteers, aged 21-28 will participate in the study. Following a
      day of examinations and 6 days of acclimatization in a climatic chamber in accordance with a
      well accepted protocol, the subjects will undergo 3 days of experiment that will include
      exposure to hot environmental conditions with different helmet-wearing scenarios, while
      wearing uniform and a combat vest: (a) without a helmet (b) with a helmet (c) with a helmet
      connected to a ventilation system. All 3 scenarios will include a two hour effort (walking on
      a treadmill) in heavy heat stress in the climatic chamber at our institute (the Heller
      institute of medical research).

    <description>The subjects will undergo:
6 acclimatization days carried out by a standard protocol including a daily 2 hour effort performed in a climatic chamber, during which the subjects walk on a treadmill at 5km/h on a 2% incline under heat conditions (40 deg. centigrade &amp; 40% RH). Core (rectal) and skin temperatures and heart rate will be monitored continuously.
Three consecutive days including 3 scenarios:
Without a helmet b.With a helmet c.With a ventilated helmet During the experiment days the subjects will be exposed to the following protocol : A 5 minute sitting, performing cognitive tests on a computer for 15 min, 120 min walking on a treadmill at 5km/h on a 2% incline, at the end of the effort the same cognitive tests will be repeated for extra 15 min, 155 min in total.</description>
