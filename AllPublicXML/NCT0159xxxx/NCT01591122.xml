  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of abiraterone
      acetate when co-administered with prednisone in patients with chemo-naive metastatic
      castration resistant prostate Cancer (mCRPC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multinational, multicenter, randomized (the study drug is assigned by chance),
      double-blind (neither physician nor patient knows the treatment that the patient receives),
      placebo-controlled (an inactive substance that is compared with a drug to test whether the
      drug has a real effect in a clinical trial) study. All patients will be randomly assigned in
      a 1:1 ratio between the abiraterone acetate group (abiraterone acetate and prednisone) and
      the placebo group (placebo and prednisone). The study will consist of a screening phase
      (within 28 days prior randomization on Cycle 1, Day 1), a treatment phase (28-day cycles
      until disease progression), and a follow-up phase (all patients will be contacted for every 3
      months up to Month 60, focusing primarily on survival status). Patients will receive either
      abiraterone acetate 1,000 mg daily and prednisone 5 mg twice daily or placebo and prednisone
      5 mg twice daily.
