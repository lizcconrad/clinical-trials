    <textblock>
      Interethnic variability in chemotherapy response is becoming increasingly evident, making
      approaches for customizing chemotherapy treatment to different ethnic populations desirable.
      At the same time, significant genetic variation has also been observed between ethnic groups,
      including many germline and somatic pharmacogenetic variants involved in chemotherapy
      pharmacology. Recently, based on meta-analyses of studies on germline pharmacogenetic variant
      frequencies and clinical trials, the investigators found that chemotherapy outcomes between
      Asians and Caucasians colorectal cancer (CRC) patients could potentially be inferred from the
      frequencies of variants between the ethnic groups and their respective biological functions.
      In this study, the investigators seek to further clarify the validity of using
      pharmacogenetic variants to customize chemotherapy between ethnicities through the following
      specific aims: (1) To verify the differences observed in the frequency of germline
      pharmacogenetic variants related to chemotherapy between Asian and Caucasian CRC patients,
      (2) To test whether variations in the frequency of somatic pharmacogenetic gene mutations
      between Asian and Caucasian CRC patients could be used to infer differences in clinical
      outcomes between the two ethnicities. (3) (4) For Aim 1, DNA samples from approximately 1000
      Asian and Caucasian CRC patients each will be analyzed for the frequency of a panel of
      germline pharmacogenetic variants identified in our meta-analyses using high-throughput
      methodology. For Aim 2, meta-analyses will be performed on pharmacogenetic studies and
      clinical trials to establish the relative frequencies of somatic variants and clinical
      outcomes in Asian and Caucasian CRC patients. These frequencies will be verified on the same
      series of DNA samples used in Aim 1. The clinical outcomes inferred from the frequency
      differences and biological functions will then be compared to those summarized from clinical
      trials. This data could provide a basis for developing a rational approach to customizing
      chemotherapy in non-Caucasian populations and improve assessment of drug feasibility in
      different ethnic populations.If validated, this working hypothesis would be of high clinical
      interest, giving the opportunity to use this as a DNA prognosis biomarker in CRC.

      Pharmacogenetic frequencies could be a potentially useful approach for predicting likely
      chemotherapy outcomes in non-Caucasian populations
