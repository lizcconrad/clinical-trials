  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized control study that involves a combination of a drug treatment,
      behavioral health, and placebo controls.

      Some participants will receive a medication approved by the Food and Drug Administration for
      treatment of moderate to moderately severe pain called Tramadol HC1 IR. Others will receive
      an inactive pill, called a placebo. There will also be 2 different types of behavioral health
      treatments, Cognitive-Behavior Therapy (CBT) and Health Education (HE) both of which have
      been recommended for the treatment of patients with FM by the American Pain Society.

      There are 4 possible study treatment combinations:

        1. Tramadol + CBT,

        2. Tramadol + HE,

        3. Placebo + CBT,

        4. Placebo + HE.

      Although Tramadol, CBT, and HE have been shown to have some benefits for FM patients, there
      have been no studies that have evaluated the combination of medication and a behavioral
      health treatment. The primary purpose of this study is to compare the benefits of the 4
      combinations listed.
