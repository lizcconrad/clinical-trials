    <textblock>
      Investigation of the differences between the levels of extracellular and intracellular
      nano-particles in workers exposed to environmental particles during their employment to
      enhance understanding the process of penetration of the particles to respiratory epithelial
      cells.

      This study investigates the following questions:

      Does occupational exposure to nanoparticles influence permeation of such particles to
      respiratory airways? Is there a correlation between the levels of nanoparticles in sample
      biological fluids of the patients and their pulmonary functions.

      Is there a correlation between the levels of nanoparticles in sample biological fluids of the
      patients and respiratory tract infections.

      The study protocol includes the following steps:

      Initial interview of the patient Measurement of nanoparticles in samples of exhaled breath
      condensate using NanoSight LM 20 Measurement of nanoparticles in induced sputum. And finally
      examination of the relationship between the measured parameters and the indices of pulmonary
      infection, and pulmonary function as measured by the pulmonary department of the TASMC.
