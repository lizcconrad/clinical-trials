  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of an algorithm, where ICU patients pain
      are assessed systematically with valid pain assessment tools and where pain is treated after
      pain intensity score.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As a pre-test, before the intervention is introduced, data from ICU patients from four
      intensive care units (ICU) will be collected from medical records to evaluate current pain
      management practices. An algorithm, which is developed by a group of resource persons, is
      educated to the staff in three of the ICUs. The staff will also receive training and guiding
      in the use of the algorithm and the different pain assessment tools. Then the algorithm will
      be implemented and used in all the consecutive ICU patients. Post-test data is then collected
      in the three ICUs. In the fourth ICU, which will be used as a comparison unit, the same
      post-test data will be collected at the same time as data in intervention ICUs were
      collected. The algorithm will not be introduced here.

    <description>A time period before the clinicians will be educated, trained and guided in the pain management algorithm, pre-test data will be collected in four ICU units.
The clinicians in three of the ICU units will be educated, trained and guided in the pain management algorithm. The algorithm will then be used to assess and treat pain in all consecutive ICU patients. Post-test data will be collected a time period after the intervention is implemented.</description>

    <description>The clinicians in the fourth ICU (control unit) will not be educated, trained and guided in the pain management algorithm. They will continue to assess and treat pain in all consecutive ICU patients as before. The unit, which will be used as a comparison unit, will collect the same post-test data at the same time as data in intervention ICUs were collected.</description>

    <description>The algorithm guide the clinicians to score ICU patients pain systematically with different pain assessment tools. The tools are the Numeric Rating Scale, Behavioral Pain Scale and Behavioral Pain Scale Non Intubated. The algorithm guide the clinicians to choose between the different pain assessment tools depending on the ICU patient's condition and ability to rate his own pain. Thereafter the algorithm guide the clinicians to treat pain depending on the pain intensity score.</description>
