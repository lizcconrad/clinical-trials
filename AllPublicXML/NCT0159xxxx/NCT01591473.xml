  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Influenza epidemics continue to represent a significant medical problem in the developed as
      well as the developing world. Even with existing vaccines, annual influenza epidemics
      typically results in 20-50 million cases, resulting in 30,000-40,000 deaths in the U.S.
      alone. A possible pandemic could have even more devastating consequences. Current vaccines
      have a number of disadvantages including slow and expensive manufacturing, and a relative
      lack of efficacy in elderly, children and immune-compromised populations. These disadvantages
      would be multiplied during a pandemic. Use of Ampligen® as an adjuvant combined with FluMist®
      has a number of potential advantages as compared to traditional inactivated vaccines: it is
      simpler to administer (intranasally), generation of a broader immunity at the natural site of
      entry of the influenza virus as well as systemic immunity (and hence should be more
      efficacious than traditional vaccines) and may stimulate cross-protection against
      pre-pandemic H5N1 and/or H7N9 avian influenza strains. As FluMist®, due to its intranasal
      administration, imitates the natural entry of the influenza virus, it will generate local
      'first-line' immunity as well as the traditional systemic immunity; therefore, at least
      theoretically provide greater protection than injectable vaccines.

               -  Agree to consistently use effective contraception from at least 21 days prior to
                  enrollment through the Day 84 clinic visit for sexual activity that could lead to
                  pregnancy;

               -  Effective contraception is defined as using any of the following methods:

                    -  condoms (male or female) with or without spermicide,

                    -  diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide,

                    -  intrauterine device (IUD),

                    -  hormonal contraception, or

                    -  successful vasectomy in the male partner (considered successful if a
                       volunteer reports that a male partner has [1] documentation of azoospermia
                       by microscopy or [2] a vasectomy more than 2 years ago with no resultant

               -  Volunteers who were born female must also agree not to seek pregnancy through
                  alternative methods, such as artificial insemination or in vitro fertilization,
                  until after the Day 84 clinical visit.

          8. Screening Laboratory Inclusion Criteria. Screening values must be within Institutional
             Normal Range, unless they are not clinically significant (i.e. values do not reach the
             threshold for mild (Grade 1) or higher toxicity as defined in Appendix D). Repeat
             laboratory testing may be performed at the discretion of the clinical investigators

          9. Subjects must weigh at least 120 pounds at screening

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant or lactating women.

          2. Any flu/cold, or respiratory tract symptoms and/or fever greater than 101 ºF in the 3
             days prior to study enrollment and/or initial vaccination.

             rhabdomyolysis and myositis, nephritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and sarcoidosis,
             hemolytic anemia) and any history of malignancy.

          5. History of chronic rhinitis or presence of pre-existing nasal septal defect, nasal
             polyps or other gross abnormalities that might impact vaccine administration, or any
             previous nasal cautery or significant surgery for nasal septal defects.

          6. Any regular past or current use of intranasal illicit drugs, or a history of
             intravenous illicit drug use.

          7. Asthma, or other chronic respiratory disorders, of any severity, even if mild.

             ideation, or a suicide attempt within two (2) years of screening. A score of 5 or
             greater on the PHQ-9 at Baseline indicates symptoms of depression and will exclude
             subject. A score of greater than zero on question nine (9) of the PHQ-9 at Baseline
             indicates suicidal ideation and will exclude subject.

         11. Immunosuppressed, altered or compromised immune status as a consequence of disease
             (i.e. asplenia, recurrent severe infections) or chronic treatment (more than 14 days)
             with systemic corticosteroids (including inhaled or intranasally-administered drugs),
             alkylating drugs, anti-metabolites, radiation, or other immunosuppressive therapies
             within the preceding 6 months.

         12. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within 3 months prior to
             enrollment.

         13. Receipt of an influenza vaccine within the past 6 months.

         14. Receipt of any vaccine in the past 30 days.

         19. Any medical, psychiatric, or social condition, or occupational or other responsibility
             that, in the judgment of the investigator, would interfere with, or serve as a
             contraindication to, protocol adherence, assessment of safety or reactogenicity, or a
             participant's ability to give informed consent.

         20. History of taking antiviral drugs active against influenza A and/or B in last 72 hours
             before FluMist® administration.

         21. Hypersensitivity to eggs, egg proteins, gentamicin, gelatin, or arginine, or life
             threatening reactions to previous influenza vaccinations.
