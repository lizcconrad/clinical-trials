  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy reduces mortality in patients with
      chronic heart failure and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;36%.
      Nevertheless, patient selection for ICD therapy based on LVEF and NYHA functional class alone
      seems to have a low specificity and sensitivity: In 100 patients treated, the SCD-HeFT study
      prevented 7 deaths in 5 years. Therefore 93 patients have a risk of adverse effects, such as
      operation risk, infection, pneumothorax, lead dislocation, and inadequate icd therapy. On the
      other hand, patients with advanced or end stage heart failure might rather die off
      progressive heart failure death and thus not benefit from ICD therapy.

      It therefore seems appropriate and necessary to improve the individualized risk
      stratification in these patients. The aim of this study is to evaluate multiple cardiac
      biomarkers in a model predicting ventricular arrhythmias in patients on ICD therapy.

      Patients having or getting an ICD in the Dept. of Cardiovascular Medicine of the Hannover
      Medical School will be recruited in the next 2 years. Blood samples of all patients will be
      obtained at inclusion and at 6 months follow-up. Patients will be followed-up for 1-2 years
      after inclusion.
