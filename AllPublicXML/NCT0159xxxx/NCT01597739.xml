      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of
      JNJ-40346527 200 mg/day (100 mg twice daily) for 12 weeks, compared with placebo, in patients
      with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) despite disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD)
      therapy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (treatment assigned by chance, like flipping a coin), multicenter,
      double-blind (neither physician nor patient will know the treatment the patient receives),
      parallel-group (each group of patients will be treated at the same time) study. JNJ-40346527
      will be compared to a placebo, which is an inactive substance used to test whether a drug has
      a real effect. Patients will receive study medication for 12 weeks and will continue their
      permitted, stable DMARD therapy (methotrexate [MTX], sulfasalazine [SSZ], and/or
      hydroxychloroquine [HCQ]) through Week 12. A follow-up visit will occur 4 weeks after dosing
      is complete. The maximum length of patient participation will be 22 weeks, including a 6-week
      screening period. Other study visits will occur during the study, and patient safety will be
      monitored.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) for at least 6 months prior to screening

          -  Have been positive for, or are positive at screening for, either anti-cyclic
             citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibody or rheumatoid factor (RF) in serum

          -  Have active RA with at least 6 swollen and 6 tender joints, using a 66/68 joint count
             at the time of screening and at baseline, and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) &gt;= 0.80
             mg/dL at screening

          -  Have been treated with and tolerated at least one of the following medications for a
             minimum of 6 months prior to screening and must be on a stable dose for a minimum of 8
             weeks prior to screening: methotrexate (MTX) treatment at dosages of 7.5 to 25
             mg/week, inclusive; sulfasalazine not exceeding 3 g/d; hydroxychloroquine not
             exceeding 400 mg/d

          -  If using nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or other analgesics regularly
             for RA, patients must have been on a stable dose for at least 2 weeks prior to the
             first administration of study agent. If not using NSAIDs or other analgesics for RA,
             the patient must have not received NSAIDs or other analgesics for at least 2 weeks
             prior to the first administration of study agent

             elimination procedure at least 4 weeks prior to the first administration of study
             agent; any investigational nonbiologic DMARD within 4 weeks prior to the first
