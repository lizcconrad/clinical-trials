        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. 13 to 17 years of age inclusive at screening.

          2. Written patient or parental (or appropriate legal representative) IRB approved
             informed consent as appropriate.

          3. Written patient assent (as appropriate).

          4. Confirmed malignancy.

          5. Scheduled to receive 2 or more cycles* of emetogenic chemotherapy requiring 5-HT3
             antagonist treatment.

          6. Scheduled to receive one or more consecutive days of 5-HT3 antagonist treatment, per
             cycle, as CINV prophylaxis.

               -  The cycles of chemotherapy must be consecutive (i.e. one followed by the other)
                  but do not have to be the first and second cycle of a line of treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Hypersensitivities, allergies or contraindications to study medications; intolerance
             of medical tape or sticking plaster.

          2. Clinical or laboratory signs and symptoms of significant cerebral, cardiovascular,
             respiratory, renal, hepatobiliary, pancreatic or infectious disease, which in the
             Investigator's judgment may interfere with the study assessment or completion of the
             study.

          3. Patients with a known history or predisposition to cardiac conduction interval
             abnormalities, including QT Syndrome, or known family history of long QT Syndrome or
             taking medications that are known to prolong the QT interval.

          4. Patients scheduled to have routine surgery during the study duration.

          5. Patients with a life expectancy of &lt; 6 months.

          6. Scarring or significant skin disease on both upper arms.

          7. Female patients who are pregnant or breast-feeding. All post menarche female patients
             must have a pregnancy test at screening.

          8. Patients who are known or thought to be sexually active must use effective birth
             control.**

          9. Administration of other investigational drugs within 30 days preceding the screening
             visit, except for anticancer treatments.

         10. Any conditions associated with non-compliance.

               -  Effective birth control includes absolute abstinence, or double barrier birth
                  control methods, i.e. condom and one of the following: combined oral
                  contraceptive, diaphragm, depot contraceptive injection.
