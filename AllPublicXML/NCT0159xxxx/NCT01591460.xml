  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, multicenter, treatment response guided study will evaluate the sustained
      virological response and safety of the triple combination therapy boceprevir, Pegasys
      (peginterferon alfa-2a) and Copegus (Ribavirin) in previously untreated patients with
      genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C. In the lead-in phase, patients will receive a dual
      combination therapy of Pegasys and Copegus for 4 weeks. In the following triple combination
      therapy phase, 800 mg boceprevir, 180 mcg Pegasys and 1000-1200 mg Copegus will be
      administered for 24, 32 or 44 weeks; the duration depending on the patient's treatment
      response. The anticipated time on study treatment is up to 48 weeks.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Sustained Virological Response (SVR) at 12 Weeks After End of Treatment (EOT)</measure>
    <time_frame>At 12 weeks after EOT (up to 60 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>SVR at 12 weeks after EOT was defined as an undetectable HCV RNA viral load obtained 12 weeks following completion of treatment. HCV RNA viral load was measured using the Roche COBAS TaqMan 2.0 HCV Test, with a lower limit of detection (LOD) of 10 to 15 international units per milliliter (IU/mL). The percentage of participants with SVR was calculated as [number of participants with undetectable HCV RNA at 12 weeks after EOT divided by the number of participants analyzed] multiplied by 100.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Treatment Discontinued Based Upon Elevated (Week 12) or Detectable (Week 24) HCV RNA</measure>
    <time_frame>At 12 and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment was to be discontinued for participants who met prespecified criteria, termed the futility rule, after 12 or 24 weeks of treatment. Participants were discontinued from treatment for one of the following reasons: HCV RNA viral load ≥100 IU/mL (Week 12) or a detectable HCV RNA viral load (Week 24). HCV RNA viral load was measured using the Roche COBAS TaqMan 2.0 HCV Test, with a lower LOD of 10 to 15 IU/mL. The percentage of participants with treatment discontinued for each reason was calculated as [number of participants meeting one of the above criteria divided by the number of participants analyzed] multiplied by 100.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Receiving Target Administrations of PEG-IFN, RBV, and Boceprevir</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 48 weeks (from Baseline until EOT)</time_frame>
    <description>The frequency of missed treatments was examined using the number of administrations received as a percentage of target administrations for each study drug. The maximum number of possible administrations was considered in terms of once-weekly injections with PEG-IFN and in terms of treatment days with RBV and boceprevir. The percentage of target administrations each participant received was separated into ranges of &lt;60%, 60 to &lt;80%, 80 to &lt;95%, and ≥95% for each study drug. The percentage of participants who received each range of target administrations was calculated as [number of participants in each range divided by the number of participants analyzed] multiplied by 100.</description>

          <description>Treatment-naive participants with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) received treatment with peginterferon alfa-2a (PEG-IFN) 180 micrograms (mcg) subcutaneous (SC) once weekly, weight-based ribavirin (RBV) 1000 to 1200 milligrams (mg) orally (PO) daily in 2 divided doses, and boceprevir 800 mg PO every 7 to 9 hours. Participants received dual therapy with PEG-IFN and RBV from Week 0 to 4, and triple therapy was initiated at Week 4. Those with undetectable hepatitis C virus (HCV) ribonucleic acid (RNA) at Weeks 8 and 24 stopped treatment at Week 28. Those with detectable HCV RNA at Week 8 but undetectable HCV RNA at Week 24 continued triple therapy until Week 36 and received dual therapy from Week 36 to 48. Those with a less than (&lt;) 1-log decrease in HCV RNA at Week 4 continued triple therapy until Week 48, with optional dual therapy from Week 32 to 48 if triple therapy was not tolerated. Participants with compensated cirrhosis, regardless of response, received triple therapy until Week 48.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Sustained Virological Response (SVR) at 12 Weeks After End of Treatment (EOT)</title>
        <description>SVR at 12 weeks after EOT was defined as an undetectable HCV RNA viral load obtained 12 weeks following completion of treatment. HCV RNA viral load was measured using the Roche COBAS TaqMan 2.0 HCV Test, with a lower limit of detection (LOD) of 10 to 15 international units per milliliter (IU/mL). The percentage of participants with SVR was calculated as [number of participants with undetectable HCV RNA at 12 weeks after EOT divided by the number of participants analyzed] multiplied by 100.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With SVR at 24 Weeks After EOT</title>
        <description>SVR at 24 weeks after EOT was defined as an undetectable HCV RNA viral load obtained 24 weeks following completion of treatment. HCV RNA viral load was measured using the Roche COBAS TaqMan 2.0 HCV Test, with a lower LOD of 10 to 15 IU/mL. The percentage of participants with SVR was calculated as [number of participants with undetectable HCV RNA at 24 weeks after EOT divided by the number of participants analyzed] multiplied by 100.</description>

Participants received dual therapy with PEG-IFN and RBV from Week 0 to 4, and triple therapy was initiated at Week 4. Those with undetectable HCV RNA at Weeks 8 and 24 stopped treatment at Week 28. Those with detectable HCV RNA at Week 8 but undetectable HCV RNA at Week 24 continued triple therapy until Week 36 and received dual therapy from Week 36 to 48. Those with a &lt;1-log decrease in HCV RNA at Week 4 continued triple therapy until Week 48, with optional dual therapy from Week 32 to 48 if triple therapy was not tolerated. Participants with compensated cirrhosis, regardless of response, received triple therapy until Week 48.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With at Least a 1-Log, 2-Log, or 3-Log Reduction in HCV RNA</title>
        <description>HCV RNA levels were obtained routinely during and after treatment. Reductions in HCV RNA viral load by 1-log, 2-log, or 3-log increments were determined relative to Baseline HCV RNA. Each increment represents a reduction greater than or equal to (≥) the specified log value, including results for which HCV RNA was below the limit of quantification (25 IU/mL). The percentage of participants with each log reduction in HCV RNA was calculated as [number of participants with log reduction divided by the number of participants analyzed] multiplied by 100.</description>

Participants received dual therapy with PEG-IFN and RBV from Week 0 to 4, and triple therapy was initiated at Week 4. Those with undetectable HCV RNA at Weeks 8 and 24 stopped treatment at Week 28. Those with detectable HCV RNA at Week 8 but undetectable HCV RNA at Week 24 continued triple therapy until Week 36 and received dual therapy from Week 36 to 48. Those with a &lt;1-log decrease in HCV RNA at Week 4 continued triple therapy until Week 48, with optional dual therapy from Week 32 to 48 if triple therapy was not tolerated. Participants with compensated cirrhosis, regardless of response, received triple therapy until Week 48.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Virological Relapse Following EOT Response</title>
        <description>Virological relapse was defined as a detectable post-treatment HCV RNA viral load following a previously undetectable EOT level (ie, virological response). The percentage of participants with virological relapse was calculated as [number of participants meeting the above criteria divided by the number of participants analyzed] multiplied by 100.</description>

          <description>Virological rebound was defined as an HCV RNA viral load &gt;1000 IU/mL and a ≥1-log increase from nadir following a decline in HCV RNA from Baseline at any time during treatment (ie, on-treatment decline). Participants who ultimately achieved an EOT response were not considered for virological rebound. The percentage of participants with virological rebound was calculated as [number of participants meeting the above criteria divided by the number of participants analyzed] multiplied by 100.</description>
          <population>All-Treated Population; only participants with a previous on-treatment decline in HCV RNA were included in the analysis. Arms were not mutually exclusive.</population>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Treatment Discontinued Based Upon Elevated (Week 12) or Detectable (Week 24) HCV RNA</title>
        <description>Treatment was to be discontinued for participants who met prespecified criteria, termed the futility rule, after 12 or 24 weeks of treatment. Participants were discontinued from treatment for one of the following reasons: HCV RNA viral load ≥100 IU/mL (Week 12) or a detectable HCV RNA viral load (Week 24). HCV RNA viral load was measured using the Roche COBAS TaqMan 2.0 HCV Test, with a lower LOD of 10 to 15 IU/mL. The percentage of participants with treatment discontinued for each reason was calculated as [number of participants meeting one of the above criteria divided by the number of participants analyzed] multiplied by 100.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With a Dose Modification of PEG-IFN, RBV, or Boceprevir By Reason</title>
        <description>Dose modifications for each study drug included any dose reduction, treatment interruption, or premature withdrawal. Adverse event (AE)-related reasons were documented, as well as reasons related to insufficient efficacy ('Poor efficacy') or other safety-related reasons ('Safety/other'). The percentage of participants with a dose modification documented for each reason was calculated as [number of participants with dose modification divided by the number of participants analyzed] multiplied by 100.</description>

Participants received dual therapy with PEG-IFN and RBV from Week 0 to 4, and triple therapy was initiated at Week 4. Those with undetectable HCV RNA at Weeks 8 and 24 stopped treatment at Week 28. Those with detectable HCV RNA at Week 8 but undetectable HCV RNA at Week 24 continued triple therapy until Week 36 and received dual therapy from Week 36 to 48. Those with a &lt;1-log decrease in HCV RNA at Week 4 continued triple therapy until Week 48, with optional dual therapy from Week 32 to 48 if triple therapy was not tolerated. Participants with compensated cirrhosis, regardless of response, received triple therapy until Week 48.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Receiving Target Administrations of PEG-IFN, RBV, and Boceprevir</title>
        <description>The frequency of missed treatments was examined using the number of administrations received as a percentage of target administrations for each study drug. The maximum number of possible administrations was considered in terms of once-weekly injections with PEG-IFN and in terms of treatment days with RBV and boceprevir. The percentage of target administrations each participant received was separated into ranges of &lt;60%, 60 to &lt;80%, 80 to &lt;95%, and ≥95% for each study drug. The percentage of participants who received each range of target administrations was calculated as [number of participants in each range divided by the number of participants analyzed] multiplied by 100.</description>
