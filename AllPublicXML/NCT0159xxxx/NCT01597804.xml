      This pilot clinical trial studies bathing bundle regimen in reducing gynecological surgical
      site infection in patients undergoing surgery. A bathing bundle regimen may reduce the risk
      of wound infection, extended length of hospital stay, readmission into the hospital, and the
      overall healthcare costs in patients undergoing surgery.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate whether gynecology surgical patients using a Bathing Bundle using
      chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) 4% skin prep solution (Intervention Group A) have a lower
      incidence of surgical site infection (SSI) than patients treated with the current standard of
      care (patient's choice of antibacterial soap). Standard of care results will be based on
      historical information gathered on Roswell Park Cancer Institute (RPCI) gynecology (GYN)
      patients prior to July 1, 2010 (Historical Control Group B).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo preoperative preparation with the &quot;Bathing Bundle&quot; comprising CHG 4% skin
      prep solution and disposable wash cloths to bathe or shower with the night before and morning
      of surgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 2 years.

    <time_frame>Within 30 days following surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed using Fisher's exact test. This primary analysis will be supplemented by logistic regression modeling for the probability of an SSI given the bathing regimen used, controlling for compliance and other patient characteristics of interest. The pre- and post intervention patient samples will be compared on various demographic, health behavior, and disease characteristics. Descriptive statistics and various graphical displays will be provided as appropriate.</description>
