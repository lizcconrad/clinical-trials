  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma in children is recognized as a disease area with a high medical need. As the
      investigators move into this field it is necessary to improve the investigators knowledge of
      upper airway anatomical structure in paediatric patients. This study will provide
      airway/facial morphologies from controlled asthmatic patients. Limited facial morphology can
      be used in order to build models to study the delivery of medication through a device that
      requires for example a facemask. In this study the anatomical structure of the upper airway
      and the facial geometry will be evaluated using a Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) scan.
      The scan will be taken in a population of 20 asthmatic children between 6 and 12 years old.

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to provide data from CBCT scans to evaluate the anatomical structure of the upper airway and the facial geometry of children. The provided data will enable further work in the mapping of the upper airway and deliver 3D geometries.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and pre-menarchial female children aged 6-12yrs on visit 1. Pre-menarchial
             females are defined in this study as girls with breast stage 1 or 2 and no menarche.

          -  Parents or guardian must be able to understand and complete to protocol requirements,
             instructions and protocol-stated restrictions. Parents/guardians must give written
             informed consent, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions
             listed in the consent form.

          -  Diagnosis of asthma at least 6 months previous prior to screening.

          -  Children must be controlled on their existing asthma treatment at screening as defined
             by ACT or childhood ACT score of ≥ 20 and PEF&gt;80%.

          -  Children must be taking a stable regime of SABA/ LABA on an as need basis, with or
             without Leukotriene Antagonists and inhalation corticosteroids.

          -  All children must be competent to perform the required tests.

          -  Children must be available to complete the study and comply with study primary
             objective investigations.

          -  Children must be able to withhold from short acting bronchodilators for 6 hours.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  As a result of the medical interview, physical examination or screening
             investigations, the responsible physician considers the patient unsuitable for
             inclusion to the study.

          -  Children who have a past or present disease, or have had previous surgery which as
             judged by the Investigator, may affect patient safety or influence the outcome of the
             study.

          -  The child has received an investigational drug or participated in any other research
             trial within 30 days, or twice the duration of the biological effect of any drug
             (whichever is longer).

          -  The child has had a respiratory tract infection within two weeks of the start of the
             study.

          -  Children who have had an exacerbation of disease requiring hospitalization for &gt; 24
             hrs within four weeks prior to inclusion.

          -  Children who are unwilling or unable to follow any of the procedures outlined in the
             protocol.

          -  Child is mentally incapacitated.
