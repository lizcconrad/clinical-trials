  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/IIa study is a multi-center, prospective, open-label study evaluating safety and
      biological efficacy of up to six dose levels of Osteodex of patients with metastatic
      castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Osteodex is a poly-bisphosphonate containing
      three known substances; dextran, alendronate and guanidine.

      The objective of the study is to define the maximum tolerable dose of Osteodex when given
      every third week. The following objectives will also be evaluated: overall survival, PSA
      response, response markers related to bone metabolism (S-ALP and U-NTx), Quality of Life and
      assessment of pharmacokinetic parameters.

      Males, diagnosed with CRPC, who fulfil the inclusion criteria and does not have any exclusion
      criteria, will be asked to participate in the study. The subject will be informed orally and
      in writing about the study procedures and give written informed consent, prior to study
      start. At the screening visit the following examinations are performed: Physical examination,
      medical history and concomitant medication. Heart rate, blood pressure, weight, body
      temperature and respiratory rate are measured. Blood samples are drawn and urine sample is
      collected. ECG is performed. At the next visit, baseline, the subject is examined physically
      and heart rate, blood pressure, weight, body temperature and respiratory rate are measured,
      ECG is performed, blood samples drawn and urine sample collected. FACT-P questionnaire is
      filled out by the subject. Adverse events and concomitant medication is documented and the
      first dose of the investigational product is given. The subject will be consecutively
      assigned to the dose cohorts, starting with the lowest dose cohort, cohort one out of seven
      cohorts.

      Then the subject is surveyed during 24 hours at the hospital. Prior to discharge from the
      hospital the same examinations are done as described above.

      The duration of the study for the individual subject will be approximately 25 weeks from
      screening to the follow-up visit 3 weeks after the last dose. Each subject will receive at
      least 4 doses and maximum 7 doses of investigational product.

      A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be designated and will be responsible to
      monitor/review all study related safety data. After review of safety data the DMC will
      provide recommendation as to whether the dose escalation can proceed as planned according to
      the protocol.

    <description>The MTD will be defined as the dose that is a predecessor to the dose where dose limiting toxicity (DLT, e.g., lack of recovery to baseline of serum creatinine (S-Cr), clinically significant abnormalities in test results for haematology, liver function, electrolytes, calcium, clinically significant ECG changes) occurs within 3 weeks after administration for at least 1 among 4 subjects. In case such dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is not observed for any doses the maximum dose at 1.5 mg/kg will be defined as the MTD.</description>
