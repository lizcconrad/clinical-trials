      Primary Objective:

      - To evaluate the safety and tolerability of SAR245409 tablets administered once or twice a
      day in patients with solid tumors or lymphoma.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate blood levels of SAR245409 after administration of SAR245409 tablets once or
           twice a day in patients with solid tumors or lymphoma.

        -  To evaluate the effect of food on blood levels of SAR245409 after administration of
           SAR245409 tablets in patients with solid tumors or lymphoma.

        -  To evaluate the effect of SAR245409 on the body after administration of SAR245409
           tablets once or twice a day in patients with solid tumors or lymphoma.

        -  To obtain information on how SAR245409 administered once or twice a day to patients with
           solid tumors or lymphoma affect disease symptoms and study treatment side effects as
           reported by the patients on a questionnaire.

        -  To explore the antitumor activity of SAR245409 tablets administered once or twice a day
           to patients with solid tumors or lymphoma.

      The total study duration per patient will be 58 to 128 days and will include a screening
      period (1 to 28 days), a food interaction investigation period (when applicable; 4 to 11
      days), two 28-day treatment cycles (56 days), an end-of-treatment visit (within 7 days after
      the last SAR245409 administration) and a follow-up visit (within 30 Â± 3 days after the last
      SAR245409 administration).
