  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity prevalence in elderly populations has increased in the last years, and the reduction
      of overweight and obesity is a priority target in populations of all age ranges worldwide.
      Obesity is a disease frequently accompanied by a pro-inflammatory state, in which metabolic
      functions may be compromised, and therefore there is a risk of developing comorbidities such
      as type-2 diabetes, hyperlipidemias, hypertension, atherosclerosis, etc. In this context,
      plant extracts are a good source of antioxidant compounds. Among these compounds, polyphenols
      have been shown to have an important antioxidant effect. Scientific evidence based on
      epidemiological studies suggest that flavonoids from the diet play an important role on the
      prevention of cardiovascular disease. Cocoa and related products are an important source of
      flavonoids, providing even more than tea or wine. Generally, benefits associated to cocoa
      consumption are related to the ability for improving lipid profile and insulin sensitivity,
      reducing blood pressure, platelet activity and improving endothelial dysfunction. Some
      studies have also shown an improvement of inflammatory conditions, mainly due to the capacity
      of the polyphenols contained to modify cellular transcription, and the secretion of
      proinflammatory cytokines in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, macrophages and lymphocytic
      strains. Therefore, the hypothesis of this study is that the consumption of cocoa
      extract-enriched prepared meals, within a hypocaloric diet, will help to reduce body weight
      and to improve cardiovascular risk factors compared to the same diet with standard prepared
      meals.
