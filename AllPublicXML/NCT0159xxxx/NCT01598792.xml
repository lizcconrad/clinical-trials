  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is the investigators intention to investigate whether a specially designed vaccine, based
      on a genetically modified strain of the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes and called
      ADXS11-001 is safe to use and is able to boost the immune system of patients presenting with
      Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) associated oropharyngeal cancer (OPSCC). It is hoped that the
      vaccine will boost the immune system so that immune cells with cell killing properties are
      able to attack any cancer cells remaining after the patients have been treated. However, the
      vaccine is so novel the investigators are not sure whether it is able to do this and before
      they can answer that question in a larger group of patients they need to make sure that the
      vaccine is safe to use and has some effect on the immune system in the patients for whom they
      intend its ultimate use. In a previous study, patients with incurable cervix cancer which is
      caused by the same virus, were vaccinated with ADXS11-001. Although all patients vaccinated
      experienced flu-like symptoms, patients tolerated the vaccine well with no patient suffering
      long term adverse effects of vaccination. However, because the patients and cancer type was
      so different in this earlier study, the investigators need to test whether ADXS11-001 is also
      safe in patients with HPV associated OPSCC. That said, the earlier study guided the dosing
      schedule for the current study and patients entering the REALISTIC trial will receive lower
      doses than those administered to patients in the earlier cervix cancer study. It is hoped
      that by doing this, patients will experience fewer side effects of vaccination without
      reducing the chances of stimulating the immune system.
