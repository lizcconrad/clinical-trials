  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      NOR-SYS is a clinical research program about young ischemic stroke patients from 15 to 60
      years. Patients, partners and the coupleÂ´s adult children who are at least 18 years old, are
      all invited to ultrasound examinations due to a standardized protocol.

      Parents of patients and partners are invited to return their answers of standardized
      questionnaires about clinical ischemic events such as stroke, angina or myocardial infarction
      or peripheral artery disease.

      Study inclusion time of patients and their families is 5 years. A biobank is build from
      samples from patients, partners and adult children. Clinical follow-ups for patients and
      partners are planned after 5, 10 and 15 years. Clinical follow-ups for adult children are
      planned after 10 and 20 years.

      Hypotheses:

      What do patients know about their parents clinical ischemic events? How much established
      pathology in arteries do we find by a standardized ultrasound protocol at the time of
      ischemic stroke at a young age? Differences concerning risk factors and ultrasound findings
      between patients and partners? Differences between children from families with several
      ischemic events among parents and grandparents vs. children from families without ischemic
      events? Biochemical markers related to ultrasound findings and artery disease.
