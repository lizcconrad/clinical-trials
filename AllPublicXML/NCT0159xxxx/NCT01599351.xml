    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the radiation dose to patient at two positions
      (prone and left lateral) and to medical staff during Endoscopic retrograde
      cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedure using dose area product (DAP) meter and
      thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD). Data were recorded on 20 patients at prone position and 20
      patients at left lateral position.

      The radiographic-fluoroscopic system manufactured by Siemens Model POLYSTAR was used for ERCP
      procedure at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital. Dose Area Product (DAP) manufactured by
      PTW Model DIAMENTOR E, a transmission ionization chamber was attached to X-ray collimator to
      record the dose-area (cGy.cm2) in order to determine the entrance surface air kerma (ESAK,
      mGy) of the patients at two positions (prone and left lateral) while the Kodak Portal Pack
      for localization imaging was placed on the patient's couch to determine the exposed area
      (cm2) on the surface of the patient. TLD was attached at five positions, left eye, thyroid,
      left forearm, lower abdomen and left leg of the medical staff during ERCP procedure.

    <description>Transparent ionization chamber was placed at the light beam diaphragm of the x-ray tube to measure the dose in the air and the verification film was placed on the couch at fluoroscopic area to determine exposed area.

    <description>Thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD) were placed at left eye, thyroid, left forearm, lower abdomen, and left leg of endoscopists. The TLDs used in this study was TLD-100 which was lithium fluoride crystal doped with magnesium and titanium (LiF:Mg, Ti). After procedures all labeled TLDs were read by automatic TLD reader (Harshaw 5500, Thermo Scientific Corp., MA, USA).</description>
