  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women who have just given birth are at high risk for rapid repeat pregnancy, which can lead
      to negative consequences during the subsequent pregnancy. Providers have traditionally
      delayed starting birth control, especially placement of intrauterine devices (IUDs),
      post-delivery for a number of reasons. The first postpartum visit after a woman has given
      birth is typically scheduled for 6 weeks after her delivery, during which she is typically
      provided with her chosen method of birth control. This study will evaluate two different IUD
      placement times: 3 weeks and 6 weeks after delivery. This will allow the researchers to
      determine if placement time affects a woman's follow-through obtaining the IUD and keeping it
      inserted in place. The researchers will also look at bleeding patterns and patient/provider
      satisfaction with the IUD placement

      The goal of this study is to investigate whether early interval placement of a postpartum IUD
      at 3 weeks postpartum, compared to the usual 6 weeks postpartum, is associated with greater
      uptake of the IUD by 3 months after delivery. Many women do not return for a follow up visit.
      We will investigate whether they are more likely to return and to receive an IUD if the
      follow up visit is earlier. Measures of 6 month IUD continuation, subject acceptability,
      safety and efficacy will also be examined. This prospective, randomized, controlled trial
      will enroll approximately 240 women at our academic tertiary care hospital in the United
      States. Participants will be recruited from women who deliver a live-born singleton infant at
      greater than 32 weeks gestation and who have indicated interest in obtaining intrauterine
      contraception. Subjects will choose to receive either a levonorgestrel-containing IUS
      (Mirena) or copper T380A IUD (ParaGard). Enrolled subjects will be randomized to IUD
      placement at either 3 weeks (+/- 3 days) or 6 weeks (+/- 3 days) after their delivery date.
      Women will be followed by phone contacts at 3 months and 4 months and will have a clinic
      visit with an ultrasound at 6 months after delivery. The IUD position in the uterus and the
      uterine size will be assessed at 6 months.

    <time_frame>Three months after delivery</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be contacted by phone or email at 3 months after delivery. The proportion of women who are randomized to each group (placement at either 3 weeks or 6 weeks) who report having an IUD in place at 3 months after delivery will be compared.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction with the timing of IUD placement.</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately following IUD placement and at 3 months, 4 months and 6 months after delivery.</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be asked to record their overall satisfaction with the timing of the IUD placement on a continuous 10 cm visual analog scale (VAS). The mean score in millimeters, as measured from the left end of the scale to a vertical hash mark placed on the 10 cm line by the subject, will be compared between the two randomization groups.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Uterine thickness at the fundus</measure>
    <time_frame>At IUD placement and at 6 months after delivery</time_frame>
    <description>Transvaginal ultrasound will be performed immediately following IUD placement and at 6 months after delivery. The thickness of the uterine myometrium at the fundus from the endometrium to the outer edge of the serosa will be measured in millimeters using an ultrasound caliper in the sagittal view. Other ultrasound measurements will be performed and compared between randomization groups including uterine width, cavity length, and the IUD-fundal distance. Details about breastfeeding and return of menses will be assessed as covariates.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of subjects with an IUD at 6 months postpartum</measure>
    <time_frame>Six months after delivery</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will return to clinic for an ultrasound and exam at six months after delivery. The proportion of subjects with an IUD at this time will be compared between the two randomization groups.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of subjects with adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>Six months after delivery</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be followed for 6 months each. Over the proposed 18 month study period, the number and proportion of subjects who experience adverse events including treatment for infection, IUD expulsion or IUD perforation will be assessed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain with IUD placement</measure>
    <time_frame>At the time of IUD placement.</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will draw a vertical hash mark on a 10 cm visual analog scale (VAS) at the time of IUD placement to indicate their current pain. The distance from the left side of the 10 cm line to the mark will be measured in millimeters and compared between randomization groups. Baseline pain and pain at other time points will be assessed as well to be used for comparison.</description>
