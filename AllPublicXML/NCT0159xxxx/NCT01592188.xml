      This project will explore the effect of Cognitively-Based Compassion Training (CBCT) or
      mindfulness training (MT) on different aspects of behavior and stress-related biology in
      elementary school-age children. The program will consist of 12 weeks of CBCT or MT, and
      various social behavioral assessments will be conducted. Participants will also provide
      saliva in which concentrations of stress hormones including cortisol and the inflammatory
      biomarkers C-reactive protein will be measured.

    <description>Assessments before and after CBCT or MT interventions will be conducted to see if these practices lead to changes in interpersonal behavior. Participants will be asked to respond to questions related to social behavior in the lab setting, with the Social Circle Task, Mind In The Eyes Task, and the Implicit Association Task.</description>
