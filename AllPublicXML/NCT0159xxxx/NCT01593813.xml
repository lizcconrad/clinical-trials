    <textblock>
      In the operation of distal radial fractures, the volar plating techniques become popular.
      During the surgical approach, the pronator quadratus (PQ) muscle needs split or
      full-thickness strip to exposure the fracture site and facilitate the instrumentation of the
      plate. Generally, the PQ would be repaired. Sometimes, the PQ is damaged by the fracture
      fragment so severely that it is difficult to repair the PQ. However, there is few reviews
      paper to discuss the consequence of the unrepaired or repaired PQ and the AAOS guideline1 of
      the treatment of distal radial fracture in 2009 did not even list the management of the PQ.
      The function of the PQ includes pronation and stability of the distal radial-ulnar joint
      (DRUJ). According to the study, the elimination of PQ function will cause a significant
      decrease in pronation torque, which is supposed to affect the function of the wrist in the
      daily life. The theoretical benefits of the repair of the pronator quadratus include flexor
      tendon protection3,4, remain of the normal pronation-supination range of motion (ROM) and
      strength, and keeping the stable DRUJ.
