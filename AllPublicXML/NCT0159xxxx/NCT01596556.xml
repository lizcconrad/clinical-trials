  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To the best of our knowledge, a possible relation between smoking and heat injuries or heat
      intolerance was never scientifically examined, although such a relation is logical according
      to the observations that smoking has a thermogenic effect, decreases physical fitness and
      affects the body's heat dissipation.16 healthy young male volunteers will participate in the
      study, 8 smokers and 8 non-smokers. They will arrive to our lab four or six times. They will
      perform VO2 test and heat tolerance test (HTT) in different conditions.

      16 healthy young male volunteers will participate in the study, 8 smokers and 8 non-smokers.
      They will arrive to our lab four or five times. During their first visit they will go through
      a VO2 max test in order to evaluate their aerobic fitness, and their physiological
      efficiency. During their second visit all subjects will go through the same test after
      exposure to nicotine. During the smokers' third visit they will go through the same test,
      after exposure to cigarette smoking. During the non-smokers third visit and the smokers
      fourth visit - they will go through an exercise heat tolerance test without prior smoking.
      During the fifth visit the smokers will go through an exercise heat tolerance test after
      exposure to cigarette smoking. During the smokers' sixth visit and the non-smokers fourth
      visit they will go through an HTT after exposure to nicotine.

    <time_frame>2-3 days</time_frame>
    <description>The test is performed in a climatic chamber at a temperature of 40oC and 40% relative humidity. During the test, the subject walks on a treadmill at a speed of 5 km/hr at a 2% grade for 2h. Body core temperature and heart rate are continuously monitored, and sweat rate is computed from body weight prior to and after the test, corrected for fluid intake. Heat intolerance is determined when body core temperature elevates above 38.5oC, when heart rate elevates above 150 bpm, or when either does not tend to reach a plateau.</description>
