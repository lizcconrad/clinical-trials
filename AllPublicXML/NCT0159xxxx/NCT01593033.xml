  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the therapeutic effectiveness of micronutrients
      (full RDA) and micronutrients + fish oil as separate interventions in restoring normal gut
      absorptive and immunological function as measured by the dual sugar permeability test and
      additional biomarkers in 1-3 year old rural Malawian children at high risk for Environmental
      Enteropathy.
