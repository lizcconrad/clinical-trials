  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic foot syndrome (DFS) is a disease caused by neurogenic (concerning the nervous
      system), vascular, mechanic and metabolic factors, which are further complicated by an
      impairment of the immune system and a corresponding increase in the risk for infections.
      Results from clinical trials about the efficacy of interventions aimed at reducing the number
      of patient-relevant end points are of limited comparability due to the heterogenity of
      patient characteristics. By their very nature, randomized clinical trials (RCT) can only
      focus on a limited section of the wide range of possible intervention regimes. In clinical
      practice, however, a number of patients with dfs will never have been part of a clinical
      trial. Furthermore, there are only very few contemporary registers for this indication from
      which conclusions with regard to the comparative merits of different therapeutic strategies
      may be drawn.

      The register was conceived to find out to which extent RCT patients are representative for
      the overall patient collective with dfs and critical limb ischemia and to evaluate the
      therapeutic success of other treatment strategies. An RCT to assess the efficacy of urokinase
      versus placebo is imbedded in the register.
