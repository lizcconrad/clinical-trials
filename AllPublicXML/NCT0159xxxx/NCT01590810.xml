  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of MK-8150 and its effect on central
      systolic blood pressure (cSBP) and heart rate corrected augmentation index (AIx) when given
      as single oral doses in healthy males and in males with mild-to-moderate hypertension. A
      primary study hypothesis is that post dose mean change from baseline of time-weighted average
      across 24 hours (TWA0-24hrs) cSBP or AIx is reduced in participants administered MK-8150
      compared to placebo in males with mild to moderate hypertension. A mean decrease from
      baseline compared to placebo of ≥5 mm Hg in TWA0-24hrs cSBP or of ≥5 percentage points in
      TWA0-24hrs AIx is considered clinically meaningful.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to three planned panels (A, B and C) of either 8 healthy participants or 8 participants
      with mild to moderate hypertension will be enrolled. For Panel A and Panel B, dosing will
      occur in an alternating fashion between Panel A and Panel B with dosing commencing in Panel
      A. Participants will receive alternating single rising oral doses of MK-8150 or placebo in up
      to 5 treatment periods (Periods 1 through 5). Subsequent doses in any Panel will be
      administered only after careful evaluation of safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamic
      effects of a given dose. For Panel C, participants will receive single rising oral doses of
      MK-8150 or placebo in up to 5 treatment periods (Periods 1 through 5). Depending on safety,
      tolerability and hemodynamic effects observed in the healthy participants, Panels A and/or B
      may be truncated and dosing may proceed in Panel C with hypertensive participants. In this
      case, dosing of hypertensive participants in Panel C will start with the second highest dose
      achieved in healthy participants.

      Amendment 1 of the protocol added Panel D (healthy males) based on the pharmacokinetic,
      pharmacodynamic and safety results from Panels A-C. Participants in Panel D will receive
      single rising oral doses of MK-8150 or placebo in up to 5 treatment periods (Periods 1
      through 5) at a dose range of 50 mg to 500 mg of MK-8150. Each treatment period will be
      approximately 3-4 days apart.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Time-weighted Average Across 24 Hours (TWA0-24hrs) cSBP in Healthy Male Participants Administered Single Doses of MK-8150 and Placebo (Panel A)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose and 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16 and 24 hours post dose</time_frame>
    <description>cSBP was measured by applanation tonometry of the radial artery, using the SphygmoCor System. The central pressure waveform was determined from the peripheral pressure waveform by a transfer function. Time-weighted average was obtained as follows: For all cSBP values obtained over the 24-hour observation period, multiply the length of time that the participant spent at each cSBP value by that cSBP value, add these products together, and then divide by duration of the observation period. The length of time spent at an identified cSBP value was defined as the time elapsed since previous post-dose measurement, or time elapsed since drug administration, if there is no previous post-dose measurement.</description>

The length of time spent at an identified pDBP value was defined as the time elapsed since previous post-dose measurement, or time elapsed since drug administration, if there is no previous post-dose measurement.</description>

          <description>AIx was measured by applanation tonometry of the radial artery, using the SphygmoCor System. The central pressure waveform was determined from the peripheral pressure waveform by a transfer function. AIx is the percentage of the central pulse pressure attributed to the reflected pulse wave, and is an indirect measure of systemic arterial stiffness.</description>

        <description>An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the study drug, whether or not considered related to the use of the study drug. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition which is temporally associated with the use of the study drug, is also an AE.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Time-weighted Average Across 24 Hours (TWA0-24hrs) cSBP in Healthy Male Participants Administered Single Doses of MK-8150 and Placebo (Panel A)</title>
        <description>cSBP was measured by applanation tonometry of the radial artery, using the SphygmoCor System. The central pressure waveform was determined from the peripheral pressure waveform by a transfer function. Time-weighted average was obtained as follows: For all cSBP values obtained over the 24-hour observation period, multiply the length of time that the participant spent at each cSBP value by that cSBP value, add these products together, and then divide by duration of the observation period. The length of time spent at an identified cSBP value was defined as the time elapsed since previous post-dose measurement, or time elapsed since drug administration, if there is no previous post-dose measurement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in TWA0-24hrs cSBP in Male Participants With Mild to Moderate Hypertension Administered Single Doses of MK-8150 and Placebo (Panel C)</title>
        <description>cSBP was measured by applanation tonometry of the radial artery, using the SphygmoCor System. The central pressure waveform was determined from the peripheral pressure waveform by a transfer function. Time-weighted average was obtained as follows: For all cSBP values obtained over the 24-hour observation period, multiply the length of time that the participant spent at each cSBP value by that cSBP value, add these products together, and then divide by duration of the observation period. The length of time spent at an identified cSBP value was defined as the time elapsed since previous post-dose measurement, or time elapsed since drug administration, if there is no previous post-dose measurement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in TWA0-24hrs AIx in Healthy Male Participants Administered Single Doses of MK-8150 and Placebo (Panel A)</title>
        <description>AIx was measured by applanation tonometry of the radial artery, using the SphygmoCor System. The central pressure waveform was determined from the peripheral pressure waveform by a transfer function. Augmentation index is the percentage of the central pulse pressure attributed to the reflected pulse wave, and is an indirect measure of systemic arterial stiffness. Time-weighted average was obtained as follows: For all AIx values obtained over the 24-hour observation period, multiply the length of time that the participant spent at each AIx value by that AIx value, add these products together, and then divide by duration of the observation period. The length of time spent at an identified AIx value was defined as the time elapsed since previous post-dose measurement, or time elapsed since drug administration, if there is no previous post-dose measurement. AIx was adjusted for HR.</description>

Time-weighted average was obtained as follows: For all AIx values obtained over the 24-hour observation period, multiply the length of time that the participant spent at each AIx value by that AIx value, add these products together, and then divide by duration of the observation period. The length of time spent at an identified AIx value was defined as the time elapsed since previous post-dose measurement, or time elapsed since drug administration, if there is no previous post-dose measurement. AIx was adjusted for HR.</description>
          <population>Per-Protocol population. 2 participants received placebo in period of initial administration of MK-8150 120 mg dose and again received placebo during the period of repeat administration of that dose. Data for both administrations of placebo in these participants are included (i.e., for placebo, analysis includes 10 observations from 8 participants)</population>

        <description>HR was measured with a validated automatic measuring device. Time-weighted average was obtained as follows: For all HR values obtained over the 12-hour observation period, multiply the length of time that the participant spent at each HR value by that HR value, add these products together, and then divide by duration of the observation period. The length of time spent at an identified HR value was defined as the time elapsed since previous post-dose measurement, or time elapsed since drug administration, if there is no previous post-dose measurement.</description>

          <description>HR was measured with a validated automatic measuring device. Time-weighted average was obtained as follows: For all HR values obtained over the 12-hour observation period, multiply the length of time that the participant spent at each HR value by that HR value, add these products together, and then divide by duration of the observation period. The length of time spent at an identified HR value was defined as the time elapsed since previous post-dose measurement, or time elapsed since drug administration, if there is no previous post-dose measurement.</description>
          <population>Per-Protocol population. 2 participants received placebo in period of initial administration of MK-8150 120 mg dose and again received placebo during the period of repeat administration of that dose. Data for both administrations of placebo in these participants are included (i.e., for placebo, analysis includes 10 observations from 8 participants)</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in TWA0-24hrs cDBP in Healthy Male Participants Administered Single Doses of MK-8150 and Placebo (Panel A)</title>
        <description>cDBP was measured by applanation tonometry of the radial artery, using the SphygmoCor System. The central pressure waveform was determined from the peripheral pressure waveform by a transfer function. Time-weighted average was obtained as follows: For all cDBP values obtained over the 24-hour observation period, multiply the length of time that the participant spent at each cDBP value by that cDBP value, add these products together, and then divide by duration of the observation period. The length of time spent at an identified cDBP value was defined as the time elapsed since previous post-dose measurement, or time elapsed since drug administration, if there is no previous post-dose measurement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in TWA0-24hrs cDBP in Male Participants With Mild to Moderate Hypertension Administered Single Doses of MK-8150 and Placebo (Panel C)</title>
        <description>cDBP was measured by applanation tonometry of the radial artery, using the SphygmoCor System. The central pressure waveform was determined from the peripheral pressure waveform by a transfer function. Time-weighted average was obtained as follows: For all cDBP values obtained over the 24-hour observation period, multiply the length of time that the participant spent at each cDBP value by that cDBP value, add these products together, and then divide by duration of the observation period. The length of time spent at an identified cDBP value was defined as the time elapsed since previous post-dose measurement, or time elapsed since drug administration, if there is no previous post-dose measurement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in TWA0-24hrs pSBP in Healthy Male Participants Administered Single Doses of MK-8150 and Placebo (Panel A)</title>
        <description>pSBP was measured with a validated automatic measuring device. Time-weighted average was obtained as follows: For all pSBP values obtained over the 24-hour observation period, multiply the length of time that the participant spent at each pSBP value by that pSBP value, add these products together, and then divide by duration of the observation period. The length of time spent at an identified pSBP value was defined as the time elapsed since previous post-dose measurement, or time elapsed since drug administration, if there is no previous post-dose measurement.</description>

        <description>pSBP was measured with a validated automatic measuring device. Time-weighted average was obtained as follows: For all pSBP values obtained over the 24-hour observation period, multiply the length of time that the participant spent at each pSBP value by that pSBP value, add these products together, and then divide by duration of the observation period. The length of time spent at an identified pSBP value was defined as the time elapsed since previous post-dose measurement, or time elapsed since drug administration, if there is no previous post-dose measurement.</description>

        <description>pDBP was measured with a validated automatic measuring device. Time-weighted average was obtained as follows: For all pDBP values obtained over the 24-hour observation period, multiply the length of time that the participant spent at each pDBP value by that pDBP value, add these products together, and then divide by duration of the observation period. The length of time spent at an identified pDBP value was defined as the time elapsed since previous post-dose measurement, or time elapsed since drug administration, if there is no previous post-dose measurement.</description>

        <description>pDBP was measured with a validated automatic measuring device. Time-weighted average was obtained as follows: For all pDBP values obtained over the 24-hour observation period, multiply the length of time that the participant spent at each pDBP value by that pDBP value, add these products together, and then divide by duration of the observation period. The length of time spent at an identified pDBP value was defined as the time elapsed since previous post-dose measurement, or time elapsed since drug administration, if there is no previous post-dose measurement.</description>

          <description>Within each of the up to 5 treatment periods in Panel A, 6 healthy participants were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of MK-8150, and 2 were randomly assigned to receive single administration of matching placebo according to a computer-generated allocation schedule. By protocol allocation schedule participants did not have fixed assignment to single dose MK-8150 or placebo for all treatment periods, but were reallocated from one treatment period to the next, so that a participant could receive both MK-8150 and placebo, in different periods of the Panel. The dose range of MK-8150 administered for Panel A was 2 mg to 90 mg.</description>
