  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety profile of the Avian
      flu vaccine with and without adjuvant 2 in healthy, young adults. The study is divided down
      into Parts A1, A2 and B. Groups within each Part will receive two doses of the assigned test
      article on Study Days 0 and 21. There will be a Safety Monitoring Committee assessment
      following Day 7 for each part, prior to allowing vaccination of subjects in subsequent Parts
      of the study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy adult male or female, ≥18 and ≤49 years of age,

          2. Willing and able to give informed consent prior to study enrollment,

          3. Able to comply with study requirements, and

          4. All women must have a negative urine pregnancy test prior to each vaccination. Women
             will be advised through the Informed Consent process to avoid becoming pregnant over
             the duration of the study, and must assert that they will employ an effective form of
             birth control for the duration of the study. Acceptable forms of birth control are:
             credible history of abstinence from heterosexual activity or prior surgical
             sterilization, hormonal contraceptives (oral, injectable, implant, patch, ring),
             double-barrier contraceptives (condom or diaphragm, with spermicide), and intrauterine
             device (IUD).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any ongoing, symptomatic acute or chronic illness requiring medical or surgical care.
             Asymptomatic conditions (e.g., hypertension, dyslipidemia) that are being managed
             medically and that are not associated with evidence of end-organ damage are not
             exclusionary provided they are clinically stable (defined as no unscheduled medical
             interventions or change in medications for cause within 3 months).

          2. Any history of jaundice, or of hepatic injury due to drug (prescription, OTC, or
             illicit) or alcohol use or viral hepatitis; or the presence of hepatitis B surface
             antigen or hepatitis C antibody at screening.

          3. Any grade 1 or higher (as based on the Toxicity Grading Scale [TGS]) abnormality in
             serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase/alanine aminotransferase (SGPT/ALT), serum
             glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase/aspartate aminotransferase (SGOT/AST), alkaline
             phosphatase, or total bilirubin levels.

          4. Any grade 2 or higher (as based on the TGS) vital sign or clinical laboratory
             abnormality not specified in criterion 3 above. Note that any abnormal vital sign may
             be repeated at the Investigator's discretion.

          5. Participation in research involving investigational product (drug / biologic / device)
             within 45 days before planned date of first vaccination.

          6. History of a serious reaction to prior influenza vaccination.

          7. History of Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) within 6 weeks following a previous influenza
             vaccine.

          8. Received any vaccine in the 4 weeks preceding the study vaccination; or any A/H5N1
             avian influenza vaccine at any time.

          9. Any known or suspected immunosuppressive condition, acquired or congenital, including
             HIV infection, as determined by history and/or physical examination.

         10. Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 continuous days) of immunosuppressants
             or other immune-modifying drugs within 6 months prior to the administration of the
             study vaccine. An immunosuppressant dose of glucocorticoid will be defined as a
             systemic dose ≥10 mg of prednisone per day or equivalent. The use of topical, inhaled,
             and nasal glucocorticoids will be permitted.

         11. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the 3 months
             preceding the administration of the study vaccine or during the study.

         12. Acute disease at the time of enrollment (defined as the presence of a moderate or
             severe illness with or without fever, or an oral temperature &gt;38.0°C on the planned
             day of vaccine administration).

         13. Known disturbance of coagulation.

         14. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, or plan to become pregnant during the study.

         15. Suspicion or recent history (within one year of planned vaccination) of alcohol or
             other substance abuse.

         16. Any condition that in the opinion of the investigator would pose a health risk to the
             subject if enrolled or could interfere with evaluation of the vaccine or
             interpretation of study results (including neurologic or psychiatric conditions deemed
             likely to impair the quality of safety reporting).
