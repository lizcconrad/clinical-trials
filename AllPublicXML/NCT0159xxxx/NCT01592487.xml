      This study is designed to test how breakfast affects brain function, memory and learning in
      healthy children.

      Hypotheses: Based on the results of our initial study and the relevant literature, it is
      hypothesized that arousal, attention, and performance will be:

        1. Greater in those who eat breakfast relative to those who do not;

        2. Greater in lean than in overweight children receiving the higher protein breakfast;

        3. Greater in fasting lean than fasting overweight children; and

        4. Improved following a morning snack in all study groups.

        5. Poorer in children with higher stress-related measures (e.g., higher cortisol levels).

        6. Heart rate will be lower in fasting relative to fed participants, and across groups will
           be higher in overweight children.
