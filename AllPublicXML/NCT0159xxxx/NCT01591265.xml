  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial investigates relative benefits (clinical effectiveness and quality of
      life) of two extraction patterns when lower first permanent molars (FPM) are extracted in
      children: the conventional treatment where current guidance is followed and extraction of the
      upper FPM is carried out, compared with the intervention where there is no compensation
      extraction of the upper FPM following extraction of the lower FPM.

      Study objectives: To determine whether compensating extraction of upper FPMs following loss
      of lower FPMs in children is of benefit. The particular benefits being investigated are
      related to the resulting occlusion, patient experience and oral health related quality of
      life. The follow up will extend over a period of 5 years or until the patient is 14 years of
      age - whichever is earlier.

    <textblock>
      The study has been designed as a randomised controlled clinical trial. The control group will
      have the normal standard intervention : (Group A), and will receive routine patient care with
      the normal practice of compensation extraction, whilst the intervention group, (Group B) will
      have removal of their FPMs but no compensation extraction. Study recruitment will take place
      over an 18 month period and will be based in the Dundee Dental Hospital Orthodontic and
      Paediatric Dentistry Departments. Patients are referred to this department from their General
      Dental Practitioner.

      Consent of the patients will be carried out by the attending dentists who will have received
      training on the study design and protocol, including RGF and consenting patients for clinical
      trials.

      INCLUSION CRITERIA Age: 7 -11 years Dental History: Able to co-operate with dental treatment
      Social History Child and carer able to understand study documentation and to participate in
      study Dental condition: One or two lower FPMs requiring extraction Upper FPMs are sound or
      restorable with good long term prognosis EXCLUSION CRITERIA Medical History: Medical
      contraindication to dental extractions Dental condition: Hypodontia in upper arch Previous
      loss or poor prognosis of other permanent teeth in upper arch Class III skeletal relationship

      Patients enrolled in the study will all be dental hospital patients. They therefore will have
      dental notes in the clinic Kodak R4 system. This will act as source data for the Case Report
      Forms. Additional data which will be collected for the purposes of the study will include
      COHQoL questionnaires and measurements from 3D images

      The charts for the purposes of the study will be on paper, the charts and patient
      questionnaires will be annonymised and coded.

      At subsequent 1 year and five year review visits dental study 3D models will be repeated,
      charted and again added to the CRF together with the COHQoL questionnaire for that visit.

      The charts and questionnaire will all be marked with the patient's unique study ID number
      which will be linked to the enrolment log for the trial.

      All data will be collected from the clinics at least monthly by the research team and
      transferred to the Health Informatics Centre for storage, date entry and ultimately analysis.

      Participants who do not attend for a review visit will be contacted by the clinic and offered
      another appointment. If they subsequently fail to attend then the questionnaire will be
      mailed out with a prepaid envelope and a note sent to the trials team from the clinic to
      explain the patient has been lost to follow-up.
