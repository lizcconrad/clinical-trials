  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Each year, the number of breast cancer survivors who choose post-mastectomy breast
      reconstruction keeps rising. Among women who elect to pursue breast reconstruction,
      approximately 75% will choose prosthetic breast reconstruction. Implant-based breast
      reconstruction is frequently achieved in two-stages. The first stage consists of the
      placement of a tissue expander after mastectomy. This is followed by a period of biweekly
      tissue expansions that can last several months. In the second stage, the tissue expander is
      removed in a surgical procedure and replaced with a permanent breast implant. Tissue
      expansion is a well-established breast reconstruction technique characterized by high success
      rates and high patient satisfaction. Despite the well-recognized advantages of this
      successful breast reconstruction technique, the subpectoral placement of a tissue expander is
      associated with significant pain and discomfort in the immediate post-operative period and
      during the phase of tissue expansion. Pectoralis major muscle spasm is a frequently reported
      problem during tissue expansion. Legeby et al. recently showed that women who underwent
      prosthetic breast reconstruction had higher pain scores and took more analgesics that those
      who did not choose post-mastectomy reconstruction.

      In the past 10 years, publications on the use of BTX-A for pain relief in a wide array of
      clinical conditions have increased tremendously. BTX-A is one of the neurotoxins produced by
      Clostridium botulinum bacteria. By reversibly inhibiting neurotransmitter release, BTX-A has
      both analgesic and paralytic properties. The analgesic action of BTX-A was initially thought
      to be related to its effects on muscular contraction. However, a recent in vitro study of
      embryonic rat dorsal neurons did confirm that BTX-A inhibits release of substance P, a
      neurotransmitter associated with pain and inflammatory reactions. The presence of analgesic
      properties of BTX-A is increasingly supported by several clinical observations: pain relief
      with BTX-A injections has been reported for migraine headaches, chronic pelvic, chronic
      tennis elbow, and post-operative pain control for lower limb lengthening correction, among
      others.

      This aspect has never been studied in breast cancer survivors who elect to pursue breast
      reconstruction with tissue expanders. Furthermore, physical function outcomes are important
      to consider with BTX-A use because the link between temporary muscle paralysis and
      improvements in participation in daily activities is not a given.

      The investigators propose to complete a double-blinded prospective randomized controlled
      trial of women undergoing unilateral and bilateral mastectomies with immediate placement of
      tissue expanders, to establish the efficacy and safety of BTX-A in alleviating pain and in
      improving physical well-being during the expansion period.

      Consecutively enrolled eligible women will be randomized into one of two different treatment
      groups: 1) Group receiving BTX-A, and 2) Group receiving a placebo. All consenting subjects
      will be randomized to receive either a single injection of 100 units of BTX-A, or a placebo
      (saline water), during surgery in the pectoralis major muscle on the operated side once the
      mastectomy and the breast reconstruction have been completed. Expected duration of subject
      participation is 4 months.
