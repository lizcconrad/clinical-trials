  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antibiotic treatment disturbs the balance of the intestinal microbiota and predisposes to
      antibiotic associated diarrhea. Previous studies have shown that the risk of developing
      diarrhea during a course of antibiotics may be reduced by simultaneous consumption of
      probiotics. The aim of the present study is to assess the effect of a probiotic formula
      containing four strains on reducing the risk of antibiotic associated diarrhea.

      The aim of the study is to assess the effect of a probiotic formula on reducing the risk of
      antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD). The study will be conducted as a two-arm, parallel
      groups, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical trial, stratified by age,
      gender and number of days on antibiotics. The duration of patient participation in the study
      will be up to 7 weeks (up to 3 weeks supplementation, 4 weeks follow-up). The overall
      duration of the study is expected to be approximately 8 months. Adult males and females that
      are prescribed antibiotic therapy for minimum of 3 and a maximum of 14 days will be included
      in the study. The incidence of AAD will be evaluated as the primary end-point. The stool from
      patients presenting diarrhea will be tested for the presence of Clostridium difficile and if
      negative for C. difficile, also for the presence of other common pathogens causing diarrhea.
      The overall microbiota will be analyzed from fecal samples taken regularly during each phase
      of the study.
