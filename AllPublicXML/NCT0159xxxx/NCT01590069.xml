      If you are reading and signing this form on behalf of a potential participant, please note:
      Any time the words &quot;you,&quot; &quot;your,&quot; &quot;I,&quot; or &quot;me&quot; appear, it is meant to apply to the potential
      participant.

      The goal of this clinical research study is find the highest tolerable dose of interleukin-2
      (IL-2) that can be given as an inhaled mist to patients with lung metastases. The safety of
      this drug using this administration will also be studied.

      IL-2 is a protein that triggers white blood cells, called natural killer cells or T-cells, to
      kill cancer cells. When given as a shot or by vein, IL-2 has been known to cause fevers and
      flu-like side effects, including rashes, fatigue, and extra fluid in the skin or lungs. These
      symptoms are less when IL-2 is inhaled as a mist into your body.

      This is an investigational study. IL-2 is FDA approved and commercially available when given
      by vein to patients with melanoma and renal cell carcinoma. Its use in patients with lung
      metastases and when given as an aerosol mist into the lungs is investigational.

      Up to 56 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose
      level of IL-2 based on when you join this study. Up to 8 dose levels of IL-2 will be tested.
      Up to 3 participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The first group of participants
      will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will receive a higher dose than the group
      before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until the highest
      tolerable dose of IL-2 is found.

      Study Drug Administration:

      You will take IL-2 daily on Days 1-21 of each 28-day cycle. You will not take IL-2 on Days
      22-28.

      You will be taught in the clinic how to prepare the drug at home.

      To take IL-2, you will breathe the drug mist through the mouthpiece of the nebulizer machine,
      which will be provided. You will be told how to use the machine. You should bring the machine
      with you to the study visits.

      Each day you take IL-2, you will write down the date and the day of the study cycle. You will
      also measure and record your heart rate and the level of oxygen in your blood. You will be
      provided with a pulse oximeter to measure your oxygen level.

      Each day while you are on study, you will use a small hand-held device to test your lung
      function and answer questions about side effects you may be having. You will measure your
      lung function by blowing hard for 5-7 seconds into the device. The device will also prompt
      you to answer questions about side effects you may be having. The device will send this
      information to MD Anderson using your internet connection. This will be described to you in
      more detail, and you will be shown how to use the device.

      Study Visits:

      At all study visits, you will be asked about any drugs that you may be taking or any side
      effects that you may be having.

      On Day 1 of Cycle 1:

      °Before your first dose, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be collected to test immune function.

      On Day 1, 8, 15, and 22 of Cycle 1:

        -  Your medical history will be recorded.

        -  Blood (about ½ teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

      On Day 1 of Cycle 2:

        -  Your medical history will be recorded.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.

        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      On Day 8 and 15 of Cycle 2 and beyond:

        -  Your medical history will be recorded.

        -  Blood (about ½ teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

      On Day 22 of Cycle 2 and beyond:

        -  Your medical history will be recorded.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. This routine blood draw may
           include a pregnancy test if you are able to become pregnant. You may have a urine test
           if you are able to become pregnant.

        -  You will have a lung function test.

        -  The amount of oxygen in your blood will be measured by a pulse oximeter.

        -  You will have a CT scan and x-ray of your chest.

        -  Before your first dose, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be collected to test immune
           function.

      Your local doctor may draw the blood and you may be contacted by phone about side effects and
      medical history. The study team will explain to you how this will be arranged, if possible.

      You will have to return to the clinic before the start of each new cycle, to receive your
      study drug supply for the next cycle.

      End of Treatment Visit:

      Within 14 days after your last dose of study drug:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.This routine blood draw may
           include a pregnancy test if you are able to become pregnant. You may have a urine test
           if you are able to become pregnant.

        -  You will have a lung function test.

        -  The amount of oxygen in your blood will be measured by a pulse oximeter.

        -  You will have a CT scan and x-ray of your chest.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue taking the study drug for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.
