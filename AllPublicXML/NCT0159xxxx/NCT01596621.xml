    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to determine the overall response rate (ORR), which
      includes complete response (CR) and partial response (PR), to bendamustine treatment in
      patients with indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) that has progressed after rituximab or a
      rituximab-containing therapy.

      This is a multicenter, nonrandomized, open-label, single-agent clinical study conducted in
      China, and is designed to investigate the use of bendamustine in the treatment of Chinese
      patients with relapsed, rituximab-refractory indolent NHL. The study consists of a screening
      period of up to 4 weeks, a treatment period of approximately 24 weeks (up to eight 21-day
      cycles), and a long-term follow-up period for up to 2 years after the last dose of study
      drug. Patients are expected to participate in this study for approximately 2.5 years.

             patient's disease is considered to be rituximab refractory if any of the following
             criteria are met at any time during the patient's treatment history (progression must
             be documented by computed tomography [CT] scan or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] or
             biopsy) or if a patient has palpable lymph nodes that were well documented in size
             and, after rituximab treatment, palpable disease remains or comes back [CT, MRI, or
             biopsy is preferred and performed whenever possible to document progressive
             disease(PD)]:

               -  rituximab-only regimen: Patients who receive a full course of single-agent
                  rituximab (at least 2 doses of 375 mg/m2 [or a therapeutically-active dose]
                  weekly) and have no response (do not obtain a PR or better) to treatment or
                  progress after a full regimen of rituximab was given.

               -  rituximab maintenance therapy or extended schedule: Patients who have a history
                  of a full course of rituximab (at least 2 doses of 375 mg/m2 [or a
                  therapeutically-active dose] as a single agent [weekly] or in combination with
                  chemotherapy [day 1 of each of 4 cycles]) and are on a maintenance regimen, and
                  progress before the next scheduled rituximab dose or after completing a
                  maintenance rituximab regimen.

               -  rituximab-chemotherapy combination regimen: Patients who receive a full course of
                  rituximab (at least 2 doses of 375 mg/m2 or a therapeutically-active dose [on day
                  1 of each of 2 cycles]) in combination with chemotherapy and have no response (do
                  not obtain a PR or better) to treatment or progress after the last dose of
                  rituximab in a regimen.

               -  full rituximab exposure treatment: Patients who have a history of a full course
                  of rituximab treatment (at least 2 doses of 375 mg/m2 [or a
                  therapeutically-active dose] as a single agent or in combination with
                  chemotherapy) and, in a subsequent rituximab/chemotherapy combination regimen,
                  have no response (do not obtain a PR or better) to treatment or progress after
                  the last dose of rituximab in a given regimen, even if the subsequent regimen
                  included less than 2 doses of rituximab. Patients could receive additional
                  systemic treatment after the qualifying rituximab regimen.

          3. The patient has received treatment with at least 1, but no more than 3, previous
             chemotherapy regimens. A regimen is defined as a new treatment combination or agent.
             Retreatment with the identical regimen or agent does not count as a new regimen;
             however, change from cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisolone (CVP) to
             cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (CHOP) is counted as a
             new regimen. Rituximab, radioimmunotherapy, or other biologic treatments not combined
             with chemotherapy are not counted as a regimen.

          4. The patient has a bidimensionally measurable disease with at least 1 lesion measuring
             2.0 cm or more in a single dimension. Patients who have previous involved-field
             irradiation can be included, provided the irradiated area is not the only source of
             measurable disease.

          5. The patient is at least 18 years old at the time of informed consent.

          6. The patient has a WHO performance status of 0, 1, or 2.

             count 85000 cells/mm3 or more.

          8. The patient has a creatinine clearance of more than 30 mL/min as determined by the
             Cockcroft-Gault calculation.

          9. The patient has adequate hepatic function (no more than 2.5 times the ULN for
             aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and no more than
             1.5 times the upper limit of the normal range (ULN) for total bilirubin). Patients
             with nonclinically significant elevations of bilirubin due to Gilbert's disease are
             eligible.

         10. The patient has had a bone marrow biopsy within 6 weeks before the 1st dose of
             bendamustine.

             use a medically accepted method of contraception and must agree to continue use of
             this method starting 2 weeks before the start of study drug treatment, during study
             drug treatment, and for 3 months after the end of study drug treatment. Acceptable
             methods of contraception include abstinence, barrier method with spermicide,
             intrauterine device (IUD), or steroidal contraceptive (oral, transdermal, implanted,

             abstinence or use a barrier method of birth control, and must agree to continue use of
             this method starting 2 weeks before the start of study drug treatment, during study
             drug treatment, and for 3 months after the end of study drug treatment.

         14. The patient has an estimated life expectancy of at least 3 months.

         15. The patient (or patient's legal representative) provides written informed consent.
