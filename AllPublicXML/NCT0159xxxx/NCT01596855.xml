      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of FG-4592 in maintaining
      and/or correcting hemoglobin (Hb) given to subjects with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on
      maintenance hemodialysis and receiving epoetin alfa.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dose ranging study with three consecutive dose escalation cohorts. The study objectives are
      to demonstrate that FG-4592 is effective in maintaining hemoglobin (Hb) levels when
      converting from epoetin alfa and to establish optimum starting doses and dose adjustment
      regimens for Hb maintenance.
