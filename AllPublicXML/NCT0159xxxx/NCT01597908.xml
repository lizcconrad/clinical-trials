  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-arm, open-label, randomised, Phase III study comparing dabrafenib (GSK2118436)
      and trametinib (GSK1120212) combination therapy to vemurafenib. Subjects with histologically
      confirmed cutaneous melanoma that is either stage IIIc (unresectable) or stage IV, and BRAF
      V600E/K mutation positive will be screened for eligibility. Subjects who have had prior
      systemic anti-cancer treatment in the advanced or metastatic setting will not be eligible
      although prior systemic treatment in the adjuvant setting will be allowed. Approximately 694
      subjects will be randomised 1:1 (combination therapy:vemurafenib). The primary endpoint is
      overall survival (OS) for subjects receiving the combination therapy compared with those
      receiving vemurafenib.

    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented occurrence of disease progression or death due to any cause. PFS for investigator-assessed response was summarized per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), Version 1.1, which is a set of published rules defining when cancer patients improve (respond), stay the same (stabilize), or worsen (progress) during treatment. Disease progression is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions with an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeters (mm) or the appearance of at least 1 new lesion, or the worsening of non-target lesions significant enough to require study treatment discontinuation.</description>

    <description>Overall response is defined as the number of responders (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR] per RECIST, Version 1.1) as summarized by Investigator assessment. CR is defined as the disappearance of all evidence of target lesions. PR is defined as at least a 30% reduction from Baseline in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of all target lesions. Data are reported as those participants with measureable disease.</description>

    <description>Duration of response is defined as the time from the first documented evidence of a CR (disappearance of all evidence of target lesions) or a PR (at least a 30% reduction from Baseline in the sum of the longest diameter of all target lesions) until disease progression or death due to any cause. PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions with an absolute increase of at least 5 mm or the appearance of at least1 new lesion, or the worsening of non-target lesions significant enough to require study treatment discontinuation.

        <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented occurrence of disease progression or death due to any cause. PFS for investigator-assessed response was summarized per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), Version 1.1, which is a set of published rules defining when cancer patients improve (respond), stay the same (stabilize), or worsen (progress) during treatment. Disease progression is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions with an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeters (mm) or the appearance of at least 1 new lesion, or the worsening of non-target lesions significant enough to require study treatment discontinuation.</description>

          <title>Overall Response, as Assessed by the Investigator</title>
          <description>Overall response is defined as the number of responders (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR] per RECIST, Version 1.1) as summarized by Investigator assessment. CR is defined as the disappearance of all evidence of target lesions. PR is defined as at least a 30% reduction from Baseline in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of all target lesions. Data are reported as those participants with measureable disease.</description>
