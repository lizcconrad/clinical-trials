  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical alopecia occurs due to miniaturization of the hair shafts as well as loss of active
      production of hair shafts. PRFM has been shown to induce dermal angiogenesis, and anecdotal
      findings of improvement of hair appearance after PRFM injection in the scalp suggest that
      PRFM may play a role in the treatment of thinning hair. Patients will be treated on a monthly
      basis with intradermal injections of autologous PRFM for 3 months. Changes in hair density
      will be assessed by comparing pre- and post-treatment photographs and non-invasive
      measurements of hair density at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 months after initial treatment.
