  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an early phase (phase IIa), randomized, multi-center study in subjects with acute
      lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The purpose of this study is
      to investigate the safety of GSK2586881 and to determine what effects it has on people with
      Acute Lung Injury (ALI) or Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).

      The study has two parts: Part A will be an open-label investigation in five subjects. Part B
      will be a double-blind, placebo controlled investigation and will involve approximately 60
      subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a form of severe acute lung injury (ALI)
      characterized by hypoxemic respiratory failure (the lungs are unable to absorb oxygen to the
      arterial blood) and non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema (accumulation of fluid in the lungs). The
      syndrome may be caused by direct or indirect injury to the lungs. It is associated with a
      mortality rate of up to 40-50%. There are no marketed pharmacologic therapies for this
      devastating syndrome.

      This study aims to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacodynamics of GSK2586881, a
      recombinant human angiotensin converting enzyme type 2 (rhACE2).

      ACE2 is involved in the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS), which controls blood pressure,
      electrolytes and intravascular fluid volume. A key function of rhACE2 is believed to be the
      cleavage of Angiotensin II (Ang II) to Ang (1-7), which have opposing physiological roles.
      Elevated levels of Ang II are associated with vasoconstriction, inflammation, fibrosis,
      vascular leak, and sodium absorption. Ang (1-7) appears to be a counterregulatory protein in
      the RAS; associated with vasodilation, anti-proliferation, antiinflammation, and reduced
      vascular leak. It has been observed that levels of Ang II are increased in humans with ALI/
      ARDS. It is expected that the reduction of Ang II should have a positive impact on ALI and
      ARDS.

The post-dose samples tested positive for anti-ACE2 binding antibodies were further characterized for anti-ACE2 neutralizing antibodies. Testing was conducted using a tiered approach; samples were first tested in a screening assay, only samples found positive in this assay were tested in the confirmation assay.</description>

             bilateral infiltrates consistent with pulmonary edema on frontal chest radiograph. The
             infiltrates may be patchy, diffuse, homogeneous, or asymmetric, and requirement for
             positive pressure ventilation via an endotracheal tube, and no clinical evidence of
             left atrial hypertension

        <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, may jeopardize the participant or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above, or is an event of possible drug-induced liver injury.</description>

        <title>Measures of Oxygenation Including Level of Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP), Peak Ventilatory Pressures and Plateau Ventilatory Pressures Upto Day 7 (Part B)</title>
        <description>Measures of oxygenation included PEEP the pressure in the lungs (alveolar pressure) above atmospheric pressure (the pressure outside of the body) that exists at the end of expiration, peak ventilator pressure highest level of pressure applied to the lungs during inhalation and plateau ventilatory pressure the pressure applied to small airways and alveoli measured during an inspiratory pause on the ventilator. Assessments were performed at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18, 24, 24.5, 25, 26, 28, 30, 32, 36, 42, 48, 48.5, 49, 50, 52, 54, 56, 60, 66, 72 and 168 hours upto Day 7.

        <title>Measure of Oxygenation Including Fraction of Inspired Oxygen/ Partial Pressure of Oxygen in Arterial Blood (PaO2/FiO2) Ratio Via Pulse Oximetry Upto Day 7 (Part B)</title>
        <description>Measure of oxygenation included PaO2/FiO2 ratio defined as the ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen by pulse oximeter a device that measured the oxygen saturation of arterial blood in a participant by utilizing a sensor attached typically to a finger, toe, or ear to determine the percentage of oxyhemoglobin in blood pulsating through a network of capillaries.
Assessments were performed at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18, 24, 24.5, 25, 26, 28, 30, 32, 36, 42, 48, 48.5, 49, 50, 52, 54, 56, 60, 66, 72 and 168 hours upto Day 7. Data has been presented for median along with the 95% credible interval.</description>

        <title>Evaluation of Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score on Day 4 and Day 7 (Part B)</title>
        <description>The SOFA score is a mortality prediction score that is based on the degree of dysfunction of 6 organ systems (respiratory, nervous, cardiovascular, liver, coagulation, and kidneys). The score ranges from 0-24. 0 (normal) to 4 (high degree of dysfunction) is given for each organ system, with a higher score indicating greater severity. A score of 0-6 is associated with a mortality rate of less than 10% while a score between 16 and 24 is associated with a greater than 90% mortality rate.</description>

        <title>Immunogenicity Assessment With Respect to Anti-Acetychollinesterase2 (ACE2) Binding Antibodies at Follow-up Day 14 and Follow-up Day 28 (Part A)</title>
        <description>Blood samples for immunogenicity analysis were collected at follow-up (Day 14) and follow-up (Day 28). Antibodies to GSK2586881 were measured using a validated electrochemiluminescence bridging assay. All pre-dose and post-dose samples were first tested for Anti-ACE2 binding antibodies by screening and confirmation assay steps. The post-dose samples tested positive for anti-ACE2 binding antibodies were further characterized for anti-ACE2 neutralizing antibodies. Testing was conducted using a tiered approach; samples were first tested in a screening assay, only samples found positive in this assay were tested in the confirmation assay.</description>
