  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether addition of 1 or 2 medicines after gastric
      banding can improve remission of type 2 diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Liraglutide and Orlistat improve glycemic control by increasing glucagon-like-peptide-1
      (GLP-1) response and fat malabsorption, respectively but do not reverse type 2 diabetes.
      Roux-en-y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery reverses type 2 diabetes 84% of the time while the
      less invasive, reversible laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) procedure reverses
      type 2 diabetes 48% of the time.

      Decreased caloric intake occurs after RYGB and LAGB but increased post-prandial GLP-1
      response and fat malabsorption only occur after RYGB. Since FDA-approved agents Liraglutide
      and Orlistat increase GLP-1 response and fat malabsorption, respectively, it is of
      significant clinical interest to determine if addition of Liraglutide and/or Orlistat can
      improve type 2 diabetes remission rates in the 52% of patients who have not achieved diabetes
      reversal after gastric banding.

    <description>Liraglutide will be started at 0.6 mg injected subcutaneously daily for 1 week and then increased as tolerated to 1.2 mg and then a 1.8 mg daily. Patients not tolerating a higher dose will be allowed to remain on the lower dose as long they tolerate the lower. Following titration of Liraglutide to a maximum tolerated dose, Orlistat will be started initially at a dose of 60 mg taken with evening meal. Additional doses will be added at breakfast or lunch every 1-2 weeks as tolerated. The patient will be advised to skip drug dosing if little or no fat is contained in the meal. Target dose will 60 mg three times a day.</description>
