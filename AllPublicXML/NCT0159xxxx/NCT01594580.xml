      This study will test if nurses wearing scrubs treated with an antimicrobial agent while
      performing patient care will:

      - Decrease the amount of bacterial contamination on scrubs at the end of a typical hospital
      shift during routine use after home laundering

      This study will gather information by obtaining swabs from scrubs treated with an
      antimicrobial and from non-treated scrubs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The outcome of interest is the contamination of scrubs with Staphylococcus aureus,
      Enterococcus species or Gram-negative bacteria as determined by surface swabs of healthcare
      worker scrubs after a full 8-hour shift. The outcomes will be analyzed both individually and
      collectively.

      Contamination will be defined as:

      - A swab that is determined to be positive for any Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus
      species, or Gram-negative bacteria after a hospital shift.
