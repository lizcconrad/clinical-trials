  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Now a days the ultrasound is seen as a valid and reliable measurement tool to test the Pelvic
      Floor Muscle (PFM) movement (Sherburn, Murphy, Carroll, Allen, &amp; Galea, 2005). The hypothesis
      is that the electromagnetic tracking system, TrakSTARTM, can measure the PFM movement in an
      equal or even more precise way. The TrakSTARTM will have the advantage to be used in
      measuring functional movements. In this Master thesis the hypothesis is to show a good
      reliability by trampoline jumping (physical activity).

      There will be two measurements. One measurement of MVIC and quick flicks will be done in a
      standing and supine position with 3 repetitions. The TrakSTARTM, Ultrasound, surface EMG and
      Accelerometer will measure the PFM movements and activation simultaneously. The Ultrasound is
      measured from one tester (to guaranty a high intratester reliability) (Sherburn et al.,
      2005).

      TrakSTARTM, surface EMG and Accelerometer will measure 3 Trampoline jumps. The measurements
      will be done once during one hour. The women will insert the vaginal probe by themselves and
      stay dressed during the measurement procedure. The measurements will be done in a
      standardized way. All the arrangements are made to ensure the hygiene requirements.
