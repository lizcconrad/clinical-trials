  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine if using a lactoferrin supplement will
      improve taste perception. Lactoferrin is a type of protein that is naturally produced in the
      body and is commonly found in saliva.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the impact of lactoferrin (bovine lactoferrin) supplementation on self-reported
      taste and smell disturbances in patients with colorectal cancer receiving oxaliplatin-based
      chemotherapy

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the impact of lactoferrin supplementation on the baseline lipid peroxidation
      byproducts in saliva in these patients as measured by the thiobarbituric acid-reactive
      substances (TBARs) assay.

      II. To assess the impact of lactoferrin supplementation on the ability of these patients to
      generate increased lipid peroxidation byproducts when challenged with a weak iron containing
      solution.

      III. To assess the impact of lactoferrin supplementation on self-reported general quality of
      life and on specific self-reported anorexia/cachexia issues in patients with established
      chemotherapy-induced taste disturbances.

      IV. To assess the incidence of vitamin D deficiency in patients with oxaliplatin-based
      therapy induced taste changes

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive bovine lactoferrin orally (PO) (rinse or tablet) thrice daily (TID) for 1
      month. Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2 and 4 weeks.

Descriptive reports will consist of summary statistics (means, standard deviations, proportions, etc.).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed colorectal carcinoma

          -  There are no restrictions on the amount or types of prior therapy

          -  Eligible patients must be receiving ongoing chemotherapy with an oxaliplatin
             containing-regimen which is planned to continue for at least one month following

          -  Any dose or schedule of oxaliplatin administration is allowed as long as patients have
             self-reported taste disturbance that has either:

               -  1) developed since the initiation of oxaliplatin-based therapy, or

               -  2) a pre-existing, treatment-induced taste disturbance has subjectively worsened
                  since initiating oxaliplatin-based therapy

          -  Patients must have normal baseline self-reported taste perception prior to the
             development of colorectal carcinoma
