  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, multi-center, observational study will evaluate the efficacy and the safety
      of MabThera (rituximab) in participants with rheumatoid arthritis who have not responded or
      have been intolerant to a first anti-TNF alpha therapy. Participants have commenced MabThera
      or an alternative anti-TNF alpha treatment as a second biological therapy. Data will be
      collected for 12 months.

    <measure>Efficacy: Mean Change From Baseline in DAS28 at Month 6 in Intention to Treat (ITT) Population</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>DAS28 is calculated from the number of swollen joints and tender joints using the 28-joints count, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (millimeters per hour [mm/hr]) and patient's global assessment of disease activity (participant-rated arthritis activity assessment) with transformed scores ranging 0 (minimum score) to 10 (maximum score); higher scores indicated greater affectation due to disease activity. A DAS28 score of less than or equal to (=&lt;) 3.2 = low disease activity, a DAS28 score of &gt;3.2 to 5.1 = moderate to high disease activity.</description>

    <measure>Efficacy: Mean Change From Baseline in Tender Joint Count (TJC) at Month 6 and 12 in Intention to Treat (ITT) Population</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>TJC is a clinical method to quantify abnormalities in participants with RA. It is associated with the level of pain. The number of tender joints were scored as tender=1 and not tender=0, and counted. A negative change from baseline represents an improvement (a reduction in the number of tender joints).</description>

    <description>SJC is a clinical method to quantify abnormalities in participants with RA. It reflects the amount of inflamed synovial tissue.

    <measure>Efficacy: Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) in Intention to Treat (ITT) Population</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The HAQ-DI is a participant-completed questionnaire specific for rheumatoid arthritis. It consists of 20 questions referring to 8 domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip and common daily activities. Each domain has at least two component questions. There are four possible responses for each component ranging from 0 (without any difficulty) to 3 (unable to do). The overall HAQ-DI score is the average of each of the 8 category scores and ranges from 0 to 3, where 0 represents no disability and 3 very severe, high-dependency disability.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline up to Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was considered any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease associated with the use of the study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. ADRs were defined as any response to a drug which was noxious and unintended, and which occurred at dose normally used related to the pharmacological properties. A SAE was any experience that: resulted in death, was life-threatening, required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, was a congenital anomaly/birth defect or was medically significant.</description>

        <description>DAS28 is calculated from the number of swollen joints and tender joints using the 28-joints count, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (millimeters per hour [mm/hr]) and Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity (participant-rated arthritis activity assessment) with transformed scores ranging 0 (minimum score) to 10 (maximum score); higher scores indicated greater affectation due to disease activity. A DAS28 score of less than or equal to (=&lt;) 3.2 = low disease activity, a DAS28 score of &gt;3.2 to 5.1 = moderate to high disease activity.</description>

The number of swollen joints were scored as swollen=1 and not swollen=0, and counted.

        <title>Safety: Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AE), Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR) and Serious Adverse Events</title>
        <description>An AE was considered any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease associated with the use of the study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. ADRs were defined as any response to a drug which was noxious and unintended, and which occurred at dose normally used related to the pharmacological properties. A SAE was any experience that: resulted in death, was life-threatening, required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, was a congenital anomaly/birth defect or was medically significant.</description>
