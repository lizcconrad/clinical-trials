  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac exercise rehabilitation consists of walking and bicycling activities. As the
      population requiring rehabilitation is aging, other forms of exercise may be useful and
      better tolerated. Tai Chi has been used for centuries, is easy to perform even by more
      debilitated individuals, and promotes improvement in blood pressure, fitness, and relaxation.
      Tai Chi may be more beneficial for frail cardiac patients because it is especially suited for
      the unfit and elderly, and can be practiced anywhere. Further studies are required to assess
      this form of exercise in cardiac patients. The objective of this randomized controlled study
      is to compare the effects of Tai Chi to &quot;sham exercise&quot; training in 200 frail cardiac
      patients who have completed six months of cardiac rehabilitation and are 60 years of age or
      older. Participants will be randomized to Tai Chi or &quot;sham exercise&quot; training and have their
      gait speed, blood pressure, heart rate, exercise capacity, balance, quality of life and
      cognitive function assessed before and after 24 week of training.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The role of exercise training is well established for cardiac patients to improve fitness and
      clinical outcomes. Many older cardiac patients even if they initially participate do not
      maintain regular exercise for a number of reasons. As the population ages there is a need to
      evaluate other forms of exercise training that may be used alone or in conjunction with
      standard approaches. Tai Chi is a potentially beneficial exercise for older cardiac patients
      because it is low-intensity exercise especially suited for unfit and elderly patients. There
      has been little rigorous evaluation, especially in the cardiac populations, of Tai Chi.

      The main objective of this study is to assess the effects of Tai Chi compared to &quot;sham
      exercise&quot; in cardiac patients that have completed a program of cardiac rehabilitation. The
      investigators hope to show that six months of Tai Chi training compared to &quot;sham exercise&quot;
      (with all participants instructed to maintain their standard exercise program), will improve
      gait speed, exercise capacity, health related quality of life, cognitive function and
      balance.

      This is a single blind randomized controlled trial of 200 cardiac patients, great than or
      equal to 60 years of age, who have completed six months of cardiac rehabilitation at the
      Hamilton Health Science Cardiac Health and Rehabilitation Centre. Participants will be
      randomized to receive either the short and simple 8-forms Tai Chi routine or &quot;sham exercise&quot;.
      The participants in the study will train for a period of six months.

    <description>A short and simple 8-forms Tai Chi routine will be used in this study. This routine has been previously standardized and field tested. Participants will be coached, by a certified Tai Chi instructor, in practicing the proper mechanics of executing each of the eight physical movements comprising the 8-forms of Tai Chi. A brief 5 minute period of walking calisthenics pertinent to Tai Chi movements, postures and diaphragmatic breathing will take place before training to warm up and after training to cool down. The Tai Chi training will be 2 times a week and the total exercise time, including warm-up and cool down, will be 50 minutes for each session. Over a period of 12 weeks, the participants will learn all 8-forms and continue practicing them for the final 12 weeks of the training period.</description>

    <description>The sham exercise (control) group will be involved in low-intensity stretching exercises two times per week. These exercises will be designed as a &quot;sham exercise&quot; condition. A brief 5 minute period of walking will take place before the sham exercise to warm up and after the sham exercise to cool down. Sham exercise sessions will include stretching exercises of the neck, trunk and extremities. The total exercise time for the &quot;sham exercise&quot; group will be 50 minutes and participants will meet 2 times per week for a period of 24 weeks.</description>
