  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Seventy patients will be previously treated for moderate-to-severe periodontitis according to
      their individual needs. Thirty days after completion of periodontal treatment, these patients
      will be randomized to one of the following groups of periodic preventive maintenance (PPM):
      G1 - performed only control supragingival; G2 - performed supra and subgingival control (when
      necessary).

      The maintenance consultations will be scheduled every 3 months for 24 months. The hypothesis
      is that the effect of the supragingival control (conducted over 24 months) will be similar to
      the effect of the supra- and subgingival control combined, above the restoration and
      progression of periodontitis.

    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial, single-blind, aims to compare the effect of the supragingival
      biofilm control with the effect of supra- and subgingival biofilm control, performed by the
      patient-professional binomial, in periodontal patients treated, above the restoration and
      progression of periodontitis during the preventive periodic maintenance (PPM). Seventy
      patients with moderate-to-severe periodontitis, aged from 35 years, will be included.
      Participants will be periodontally treated according to their needs. After 30 days of the end
      of treatment, participants will be randomized (stratified for smoking) in two groups: Group 1
      (G1)- Supragingival biofilm control; Group 2 (G2)- Supra and subgingival biofilm control. MPP
      consultation will take place every 3 months, for 24 months, in which the G1 will only receive
      procedures of supragingival biofilm control, and G2 will receive, beyond the supragingival
      control, subgingival interventions.
