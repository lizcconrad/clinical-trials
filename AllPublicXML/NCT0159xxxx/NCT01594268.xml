        Inclusion criteria: (Each patient must meet all of the following criteria.)

          1. Males and females aged 20-65 years inclusive (in Korean age) who is scheduled to
             receive a primary kidney transplant.

          2. Patients who received explanation of the study overview and signed on the informed
             consent form of this study.

          3. de novo patients who are going to receive a kidney transplant from a deceased (cold
             ischemic time (CIT) &lt; 36 hours), living unrelated or related donor

        Exclusion criteria (Any patient who meets any of the following criteria will not be able to
        participate in the study.)

          1. Multi-organ transplant recipients (e.g. simultaneous kidney-pancreas transplant) or
             patients who previously received an organ transplant other than a kidney transplant

          2. Patients who are scheduled to receive a kidney transplant from a zero-antigen
             mismatched donor, bilateral kidney donor, a non-heart beating donor or a donor aged
             over 60 years

          3. Patients who should avoid potential exposure to everolimus due to acute or chronic
             severe allergy treatment or patients who have hypersensitivity to everolimus and drugs
             of similar chemical classes (e.g. macrolides)

          4. Class 1 PRA&gt;30% by CDC-based assay or Class 1 PRA&gt;50% by flow cytometry or EIA

          5. Recipients of a kidney from a ABO-incompatible live-donor or T-cell cross
             matching-positive donor

          6. Thrombocytopenia&lt;75,000/mm3, absolute neutrophil count&lt;1,500/mm3, and/or
             leukopenia&lt;4,000/mm3

          7. Severe hypercholesterolemia (350mg/dl) or hypertriglyceridemia (&gt;500mg/dl) (However,
             patients with controlled hyperlipidemia are eligible for the study.)

          8. Use of other investigational drugs for 30 days before enrollment in the study

          9. History of malignancy of any organ system (other than localized basal cell carcinoma
             of the skin), treated or untreated, within the past 5 years before enrollment in the
             study, regardless of whether there is evidence of local recurrence or metastases

         10. Pregnant or nursing women, and women of child-bearing potential who have a plan to be
             pregnant or do not consent to select an appropriate method of birth control (e.g. oral
             contraceptives, hormone implant, IUD, diaphragm barrier, condom, abstinence, etc.)
             (women of child-bearing potential means women less than 2 years post-menopausal or not
             having hysterectomy or surgical management, i.e. bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral
             oophorectomy)

         11. Presence of surgery or medical condition (except for current transplant) which may
             change absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of the investigational
             product at the investigator's discretion and/or severe diarrhea, active
             gastrointestinal disease or uncontrolled diabetes

         12. Patients who are HIV-, HCV-, and HBV positive

         13. Recipients of an organ from a donor who is HBsAg-, HCV-, and HIV-positive

         14. Evidence of drug or alcohol abuse

         15. Severe restrictive or obstructive pulmonary disease

         16. Patients with severe liver disease (AST, ALT or total bilirubin&gt;2.5 times ULN
             including abnormal liver function test)

         17. Patients with severe systemic infection requiring continuous therapy which may
             influence the objectives of the study at the investigator's discretion

         18. Patients in whom continuous treatment may lead to clinically serious infection at the
             investigator's discretion or patients with other severe surgery complications or
             problems with continuous wound treatment

         19. Patients who have a genetic problem including galactose intolerance, lapp lactase
             deficiency, and glucose-galactose malabsorption
