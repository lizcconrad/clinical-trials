      Objective: To compare the incidence of chronic pain at 3 months among adults undergoing
      craniotomy between those received two different doses of pregabalin and those receiving
      placebo.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypothesis: Perioperative pregabalin will reduce the incidence of chronic post-operative
      pain, and will reduce the opioid consumption, opioid-related side effects, and hospital
      length of stay compared with placebo in patients undergoing elective craniotomy.

      Methods: 316 adults (18-65y), ASA I-III, undergoing elective craniotomy will be randomized to
      receive: 100mg or 150mg pregabalin or placebo once pre-operatively and 50mg or 75mg or
      placebo twice daily for 14 post-operative days. NRS pain scores, opioid consumption and side
      effects will be assessed up to 48h, and long-term pain at days 7, 14, 30, and 90. The primary
      analysis will involve the comparison between the 2 treatment groups together vs. placebo. A
      stepwise method will be used to evaluate the pairwise comparisons.

      Outcomes: The primary outcome will be the incidence of chronic post-craniotomy pain at 3 mos.
      Important secondary outcomes are: neuropathic component of pain at 3 mos., total opioid
      consumption in the first 24h, and incidence and severity of opioid-related side effects at
      days 1, 2 and 7.

          -  Undergoing elective craniotomy (supratentorial or infratentorial) under general
             anaesthesia for: biopsy or resection of a tumour, clipping of an unruptured aneurysm,
             or excision of an arteriovenous malformation

          -  ASA physical status I-III

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  currently taking any drug that could interact with pregabalin

          -  Body Mass Index ≤ 18.4 or ≥ 35

          -  history of untreated obstructive sleep apnea

          -  any condition that would contraindicate the use of patient-controlled analgesia (PCA)
