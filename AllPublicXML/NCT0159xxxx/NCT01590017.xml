      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
      Radiation therapy uses high-energy x rays to kill tumor cells. Giving cisplatin together with
      radiation therapy may be an effective treatment for cervical cancer.

      PURPOSE: This trial studies how well cisplatin and radiation therapy work in treating
      participants with HIV-associated locally advanced cervical cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine if it is feasible to administer a regimen of cisplatin/radiotherapy in
           HIV-infected women with locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC) on antiretroviral
           therapy (ART).

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of concomitant chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin
           in HIV-infected women with LACC who are also receiving concomitant ART.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the 1-year progression-free survival (PFS) of HIV-infected women with LACC
           Stage IB, II, III, or IVA who receive weekly cisplatin concomitant with radiotherapy and
           ART. (Exploratory)

        -  To describe the quality of life (QOL) of enrolled participants via assessments before,
           immediately after, and at 3 and 9 months after completion of therapy, using QOL metrics
           that have been validated in similar populations. (Exploratory)

        -  To describe the effects of treatment on participants' CD4 counts, HIV viral load, and
           concurrent AIDS-defining conditions. (Exploratory)

        -  To describe cervical cancer recurrence patterns in HIV-infected participants with LACC
           defined as loco-regional and/or distant recurrences. (Exploratory)

        -  To determine 1-year overall survival and causes of death (i.e., cancer-related,
           HIV-related, or other). (Exploratory)

        -  To collect serum, cytology, and tissue for future studies specific to cervical and anal
           disease. (Exploratory)

        -  To evaluate the effects of weekly cisplatin concomitant with radiotherapy on adherence
           to ART. (Exploratory)

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Participants receive cisplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36 (6
      weeks total). Participants also undergo whole pelvic radiotherapy (WPRT) 5 days a week for 5
      weeks followed by intracavitary brachytherapy.

      Participants complete the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)
      Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ)-30 and the Cervical Cancer Module (QLQ-CX24) at baseline
      and periodically during study treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up every 3 months for 12
      months.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Participants (who have been adequately clinically staged by standard clinical
             guidelines) with primary, untreated, histologically confirmed, documented invasive
             squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, or adenosquamous carcinoma of the uterine
             cervix, stages IB2, IIA, IIB, IIIA, IIIB, and IVA (Stage IIA tumors must be greater
             than 4 cm)

          -  HIV-1 infection, documented by any licensed rapid HIV test or HIV enzyme or
             chemiluminescence immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit at any time prior to study entry and
             confirmed by a licensed western blot or a second antibody test by a method other than
             the initial rapid HIV and/or E/CIA, or by HIV-1 antigen, plasma HIV-1 ribonucleic acid
             (RNA) viral load

               -  NOTE: the term &quot;licensed&quot; refers to a United States (U.S) Food and Drug
                  Administration (FDA)-approved kit or for sites located in countries other than

               -  WHO (World Health Organization) and CDC (Centers for Disease Control and
                  Prevention) guidelines mandate that confirmation of the initial test result must
                  use a test that is different from the one used for the initial assessment; a
                  reactive initial rapid test should be confirmed by either another type of rapid
                  assay or an E/CIA that is based on a different antigen preparation and/or
                  different test principle (e.g., indirect versus competitive), or a western blot

             had an opportunistic infection within the past 3 months, or if there is evidence of
             resistance to antiretroviral therapy (i.e., HIV viral load ≥ 400 copies/mL despite
