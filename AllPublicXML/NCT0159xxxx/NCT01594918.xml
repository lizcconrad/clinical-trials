    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of cabazitaxel, mitoxantrone, and prednisone
      (CAMP) in combination at different dose levels and to determine the highest dose that does
      not cause bad side effects. The investigators want to find out what effects, good and/or bad,
      CAMP has on patients and their metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open label, dose-finding, multicenter clinical trial to establish the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of cabazitaxel (25 mg/m2 IV
      q21 days) in combination with mitoxantrone (4-12 mg/m2 IV q21 days) and prednisone (5mg
      orally BID) in patients with metastatic CRPC who have not undergone prior chemotherapy for
      metastatic disease.

      Up to five cohorts will be enrolled to determine the MTD and DLT profile of this combination.
      An accelerated titration design method is being used in order to minimize the number of
      patients exposed to subtherapeutic doses of mitoxantrone.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        1. Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

        2. Progressive metastatic prostate cancer (positive bone scan or measurable disease)
        despite castrate levels of testosterone (either from orchiectomy or LHRH agonist therapy).

        3. Patients may have either non-measurable disease OR measurable disease

        4. All patients must have a PSA ≥ 2 ng/mL.

        5. Progressive disease based on any one of the following:

          1. transaxial imaging

          2. a rise in PSA

          3. radionuclide bone scan

             Patients whose sole manifestation of progression is an increase in disease-related
             symptoms are not eligible.

               1. For patients with measurable disease, progression will be defined by the RECIST
                  criteria.

               2. For patients with non-measurable disease, a positive bone scan and elevated PSA
                  will be required. PSA evidence for progressive prostate cancer during or after
                  first-line chemotherapy consists of a PSA level of at least 2 ng/ml which has
                  risen on at least 2 successive occasions, at least one week apart. If the
                  confirmatory PSA (#3) value is less (i.e., #3b) than the screening PSA (#2)
                  value, then an additional test for rising PSA (#4) will be required to document
                  progression for the purposes of eligibility.

               3. Radionuclide bone scan: new metastatic lesions

                  6. Testosterone &lt; 50 ng/dL. Patients must continue primary androgen deprivation
                  with an LHRH analogue if they have not undergone orchiectomy.

                  7. ECOG Performance Status 0 -2.

                  8. Required Laboratory values:

               1. Creatinine &lt; 1.5 x upper limits of normal (ULN). If Cr. &gt; 1.5 x ULN, then
                  calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 40cc/min.

               2. ALT and AST within normal limits

               3. Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 2,000/mm3

               4. Platelets &gt; 100,000/ mm3

               5. Hemoglobin &gt; 8.0 gm/dL

               6. Total bilirubin within normal limits

                  9. Ejection fraction by MUGA scan or echocardiogram ≥ lower limit of
                  institutional normal.

                  10. Patients receiving hormonal therapy (i.e. any dose of megestrol acetate
                  (Megace), Proscar (finasteride), any herbal product known to decrease PSA levels
                  (e.g., Saw Palmetto and PC-SPES) other than LHRH agonist/antagonist or a stable
                  dose of corticosteroid from a prior chemotherapy regimen must discontinue the
                  agent for at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment. Progressive disease must be
                  documented after discontinuation of the hormonal therapy.

                  11. No other systemic therapies for prostate cancer within 28 days prior to
                  initiation of this protocol.

                  12. Prior radiation therapy completed ≥ 4 weeks prior to enrollment.

                  13. No history of radiopharmaceuticals (strontium, samarium) for prostate cancer
                  treatment.

                  14. Patients must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method
                  of birth control) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation
                  and for 3 months after discontinuing therapy. Should a patient's sexual partner
                  become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while the patient is participating in
                  this study, he should inform the treating physician immediately.

                  15. Life expectancy &gt; 12 weeks.

                  16. Age ≥ 18 years

                  17. Inclusion of Minorities: Men and members of all ethnic groups are eligible
                  for this trial.

                  Exclusion Criteria:

                    1. Patients with significant cardiovascular disease including congestive heart
                       failure (NYHA class III or IV), active angina pectoris or myocardial
                       infarction within 6 months.

                    2. Patients with serious intercurrent infections, or nonmalignant medical
                       illnesses that are uncontrolled or whose control may be jeopardized by the
                       complications of this therapy.

                    3. Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit
                       compliance with study requirements.

                    4. Patients with pre-existing neuropathy greater than CTCAE Grade 1 (motor or
                       sensory).

                    5. Patients with known prior severe hypersensitivity reactions to cabazitaxel
                       or other agents containing polysorbate 80.

                    6. Patients with known active brain metastases are excluded because of their
                       poor prognosis. Head CT is NOT routinely required prior to enrollment.
                       Patients with treated, asymptomatic brain metastasis will be eligible for
                       enrollment.

                    7. Patients with a &quot;currently active&quot; second malignancy other than non-melanoma
                       skin cancer are excluded. [Patients are not considered to have a &quot;currently
                       active&quot; malignancy if they have completed therapy and are considered by
                       their physician to be at less than 30% risk of relapse.]

                    8. Concurrent use of moderate to strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is not allowed.
