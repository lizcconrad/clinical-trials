  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to examine whether a school-based suicide intervention is
      effective in reducing suicide related risk factors in a population of middle and high
      students. It hypothesized that receiving the intervention will reduce the severity of suicide
      related risk factors such as depression, hopelessness, suicidal behaviors and increasing
      protective factors such as social support, self esteem, suicide knowledge and attitude and so
      on, as compared to the control group.

      A total of 3000 students from two junior schools (grade 7 and 8) and two senior schools
      (grade 10 and 11) in Shanghai Pu Dong district were recruited in our study. All students were
      randomly assigned into universal study group or universal control group by class level. In
      those two groups, high risk of suicidal students were identified by screening. A universal
      suicide intervention was conducted in the universal study group; an indicated suicide
      intervention was conducted in the indicated study group. All students in universal study
      group and universal control group completed the self-administered questionnaire before and 6
      months after the end of universal intervention. High risk of suicidal students in the
      indicated study group and indicated control group completed another self-administered
      questionnaire before, 6 months and 18 months after the end of the indicated intervention.
