    <textblock>
      The project is a three arm randomized control trial in rural Cambodia designed to evaluate
      the impact of homestead food production (home gardens) with and without fish ponds versus
      control on household food security, dietary intake of women and youngest child, biochemical
      nutritional status of women, and household livelihoods over a 22 month period. Baseline and
      end line surveys will be conducted that involve questionnaires and a blood sample.
