  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heavy drinking can cause serious health, family, and economic problems. Finding treatments
      that are effective in decreasing heavy drinking among alcohol-dependent individuals is,
      therefore, an important scientific and health goal. A novel and important strategy to enhance
      alcoholism treatment efforts uses a personalized medicine approach to optimize treatment
      effects by selecting the &quot;right&quot; patient therapeutically and potentially with a minimum of
      adverse events, for a specific medication.

      This study will extend findings from a randomized double-blind clinical trial of ondansetron,
      in which the medication was found to reduce drinking among individuals with certain genotypes
      (i.e., forms of DNA, the material that controls the inheritance of characteristics). The
      proposed study will address a number of limitations in the prior work, including testing the
      medication in both European-American and African-American samples.

      This study is a 24 week clinical trial. During the 24 weeks participants will receive either
      ondansetron or placebo. Participants will also receive Brief Behavioral Compliance
      enhancement Treatment (BBCET) as their psychosocial adjuct weekly in weeks 1 to 12, and then
      every 2 weeks in weeks 12 to 24. We will enroll two separate population groups (i.e.,
      African-Americans and European-Americans), each with 128 treatment-seeking, alcohol-dependent
      individuals in a 24-week clinical trial. Subjects in each of these two population groups
      (N=128/group) will be randomized into 4 cells (N=32/cell) in a 2 (TT vs. TG or GG) × 2
      (ondansetron 4 μg/kg twice daily vs. placebo) factorial design. Group assignment will be
      achieved using a block randomization procedure that balances the treatment groups on PHDD,
      age, and gender.
