  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study, conducted in India, will be recruiting women participants who are between the
      ages of 18 and 42, and who have an indication for controlled ovarian stimulation (COS), but
      have not yet undergone in-vitro fertilization and/or intracytoplasmic sperm injection
      (IVF/ICSI). The study is designed to compare the difference in oocyte (immature egg cell)
      production after administration of the investigative drug, MK-8962 (corifollitropin alfa) +
      recombinant follicle stimulating hormone (recFSH), in contrast to use of only the reference
      drug, recFSH.

    <description>MK-8962 is supplied in a ready-to-use prefilled syringe containing
100 microgram (μg) or 150 μg corifollitropin alfa per 0.5 mL. Participants are randomized to receive a single subcutaneous (SC) injection of MK-8962 in the abdominal wall on Cycle Day 2 or Cycle Day 3. Dose of administered MK-8962 is weight-based. Participants who weigh 60 kilograms (kg) or less will be given 100 μg MK-8962 and those who weigh more than 60 kg will be given 150 μg MK-8962.</description>

    <description>Recombinant Follicle Stimulating Hormone (recFSH) will be supplied as a ready-to-use solution in a 600 IU cartridge for SC injection via the recFSH Pen. Starting on Day 2 or 3 of the menstrual cycle (Stimulation Day 1), recFSH will be administered daily, each morning, via injections in the abdominal wall. A starting dose of between 150 - 300 IU will be administered and is fixed for the first week of stimulation. After 6 days, and based on each participant's individual response, the Investigator may decide to reduce the fixed dose for the remainder of the study. The maximum duration of stimulation is 19 days; recFSH will not be administered on the Day of hCG Administration.</description>
