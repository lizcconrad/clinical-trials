      The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of tralokinumab (CAT‐354) will be studied in adolescent
      subjects with asthma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Interleukin-13 (IL‐13) is a pleiotropic cytokine that promotes inflammation, airways
      hyper‐responsiveness (directly and through recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells),
      mucus hypersecretion, airway remodeling via fibrosis, increased immunoglobulin E (IgE)
      synthesis and mast cell activation.Tralokinumab (CAT‐354) is a human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)
      anti‐IL‐13 monoclonal antibody that has been shown to potently and specifically neutralize
      IL‐13 in preclinical models.This study will evaluate the PK profile of a single dose of
      tralokinumab administered subcutaneously at a dose of 300 mg in adolescent subjects with
      asthma to be compared with the PK data from completed studies in adults.

    <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between administration of study drug and up to Day 57 that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre-treatment state. Adverse events were summarized together for all participants.</description>
