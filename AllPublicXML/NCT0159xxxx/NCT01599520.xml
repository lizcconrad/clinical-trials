  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer patients receiving chemotherapy experience a number of aversive symptoms that are
      accompanied by declines in physical and mental well-being. Although the benefits of stress
      management training interventions on quality of life are well documented, there are no
      published studies examining the efficacy of these interventions among Hispanic women and
      Latinas (hereafter referred to as Latinas) receiving chemotherapy. This dearth of research
      reflects the general lack of stress management interventions for cancer patients whose
      preferred language is Spanish. Simply translating existing English-language interventions
      into Spanish may seem to be a solution for the lack of Spanish-language stress management
      interventions. This approach, however, does not take into account cultural values, beliefs
      and situational realities that are likely to contribute to patients' uptake of health
      promoting behaviors. The proposed research seeks to address this gap by evaluating a stress
      management training intervention developed specifically for Latinas beginning chemotherapy
      for cancer.

      In response to the identified need, the investigators created a Spanish-Language
      Self-Administered Stress Management Training (SL-SAT) intervention &quot;Cómo tratar el estrés
      durante la quimioterapia&quot; (&quot;How to manage stress during chemotherapy&quot;). The intervention is
      based on an English-language self-administered stress management training intervention the
      investigators previously developed and showed to be efficacious in a randomized controlled
      trial. Development of the Spanish-language intervention was the result of extensive use of
      ethnographic and learner verification methods, guided by a community-based participatory
      research approach. Similar to the English-language version, the SL-SAT intervention consists
      of a digital video disc(DVD), booklet, and audio compact disc (CD), and provides instruction
      in three well-established stress management techniques: deep breathing; progressive muscle
      relaxation and guided imagery; and use of coping self-statements. The proposed study will
      evaluate the efficacy of this transcreated intervention in a randomized controlled trial
      involving Spanish-speaking Latinas about to begin chemotherapy for cancer. Following a
      baseline assessment, participants will receive usual care or usual care plus the SL-SAT
      intervention. Participants will be reassessed on study measures approximately 7 and 13 weeks
      after the baseline assessment.

      Specific aims of the project are:

        1. To evaluate the impact of Cómo tratar el estrés durante la quimioterapia on quality of
           life during chemotherapy relative to usual care only. Consistent with prior research,
           the investigators hypothesize that the intervention will result in better psychological
           and spiritual well-being and less anxiety, depression, and cancer-related distress.

        2. To investigate the mechanism by which Cómo tratar el estrés durante la quimioterapia
           improves quality of life during chemotherapy. Based on relevant theory and prior
           research, the investigators hypothesize that improvement in perceived self-efficacy in
           managing stress will explain beneficial effects of the intervention on quality of life
           outcomes.

        3. To examine whether communication and sociocultural factors associated with the
           acculturation process moderate the impact of Cómo tratar el estrés durante la
           quimioterapia on quality of life. Based on relevant theory and prior research, the
           investigators hypothesize that, among women who receive the intervention, those who have
           a stronger preference for communicating and receiving information in Spanish will
           benefit more.

    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 5-7, Week 13 (to evaluate change)</time_frame>
    <description>This 14-item measure has been used widely in behavioral oncology research because it does not assess somatic symptoms of anxiety and depression (e.g., fatigue) that may be confounded with disease- or treatment-related symptoms. The validated Spanish version will be used in the current study. Analyses will focus on the total score as a primary outcome.</description>

    <measure>Impact of Event-Revised Intrusion Subscale (IES-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 5-7, Week 13 (to evaluate change)</time_frame>
    <description>The 8-item Intrusion Subscale from the IES-R measures intrusive thoughts, such as dreams, images, and reminders of a stressful event. In the present study, as in other research, it will be keyed to &quot;your cancer and cancer diagnosis&quot; in order to provide a measure of cancer-related distress. The IES-R has been validated in numerous populations and is widely used in cancer research. The validated Spanish version will be used in the current study.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 5-7 weeks, 13 weeks (to evaluate change)</time_frame>
    <description>This 27-item measure has been used to assess health-related quality of life in patients with many different types of cancer. The validated Spanish version will be used in the current study.The FACT-G yields scores for physical, social/family, emotional, and functional well-being. Analyses will focus on emotional well-being scores as a primary outcome; other scales will be examined as secondary outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness-Spiritual Well-being Scale (FACIT-SP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 5-7 weeks, 13 weeks (to evaluate change)</time_frame>
    <description>This 12-item scale is a valid and reliable measure of spiritual well-being in cancer patients. The validated Spanish version will be used in the current study. The FACIT-Sp yields scores for meaning/peace and faith as well as a total score. Analyses will focus on total FACIT-Sp scores as a primary outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale-Short Form (MSAS-SF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 5-7 weeks, 13 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This scale is a valid and reliable measure of the severity of 32 symptoms commonly experienced by cancer patients (e.g., nausea, vomiting, and lack of appetite). The Spanish version produced by the original scale developers will be used in the current study. Responses yield measures of the severity of individual symptoms that can also be combined to yield indices of total, physical, and psychological symptom severity. MSAS-SF summary scale scores will be examined as secondary outcomes in the current study.</description>

    <measure>Measure of Current Status (MOCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 5-7 weeks, 13 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This 17-item measure assesses perceived self-efficacy in managing stress. Items closely mirror stress management strategies that comprise the SL-SAT intervention. Based on our conceptual model and previous research with cancer patients, the investigators will examine whether perceived self-efficacy, as measured by the MOCS, mediates the expected positive effects of the SL-SAT intervention on the primary outcomes</description>

The intervention associate will review how it provides answers to common questions about chemotherapy, describes common side effects and their management, and identifies ways to obtain additional information. Patients will also be provided with a list of local support groups for cancer patients and informed that a social worker is available to meet with them without charge to discuss personal concerns or practical problems. At the first infusion, oncology nurses will provide all patients with standard education about the chemotherapy agents and anti-emetic agents to be administered, possible adverse reactions to these agents, and recommended precautions for avoiding illness and maintaining health.</description>
