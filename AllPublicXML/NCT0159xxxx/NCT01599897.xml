    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity in
      healthy adult subjects of an investigational vaccine being developed for the prevention of
      pulmonary tuberculosis. The vaccine, identified as ID93 + GLA-SE, consists of the recombinant
      four-antigen Mycobacterium tuberculosis recombinant protein ID93 together with the adjuvant
      GLA-SE.
