      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TA-650 in comparison with
      a control drug Polyethylene Glycol-treated Human Immunoglobulin (VGIH) in patients with
      Kawasaki disease refractory to initial therapy with Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG). The
      pharmacokinetics of TA-650 is also examined.
