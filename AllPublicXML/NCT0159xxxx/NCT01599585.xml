  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a web-based behavioral activation(BA) treatment
      for depression by comparing it to in-person BA treatment in Soldiers and Veterans with Major
      and Minor Depressive Disorder. We will test the hypothesis that 8 sessions of in-home BA
      delivered via a webcam will be as safe and effective in reducing symptoms of hopelessness and
      depression as in-person BA treatment for depression.

    <measure>Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Post treatment - Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The BHS is a 20-item scale for measuring negative attitudes about the future. Each item is scored with a true/false response. Total scores range from 0-20 with higher scores indicating a greater degree of hopelessness.</description>

    <time_frame>Treatment Session Week 1</time_frame>
    <description>Safety data will be collected on adverse events, psychiatric hospitalizations, suicides and non-fatal suicide-related behaviors, number of times the treatment collateral was utilized during treatment, treatment adherence, participant drop-out rate, and frequency of requests for patient or therapist technical support.

It consists of 21 items that are rated on a 4-point scale which yield a range of scores from 0 - 63. The BDI-II has sound psychometric properties. The higher the score the worse the outcome.</description>
