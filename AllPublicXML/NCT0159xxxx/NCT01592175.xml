    <textblock>
      The tight relationship between attention and conscious perception makes them difficult to
      study in isolation and has led many scientists to closely link these two processes. However,
      while some authors argue that conscious perception cannot occurs without attention,
      magnetoencephalography (MEG) and fMRI studies had shown that attention and consciousness are
      two distinct brain processes.

      If endogenously triggered attention and consciousness are dissociated, it has been proposed
      that orienting of exogenous attention is a necessary, though not sufficient, antecedent of
      conscious perception.

      In the present study we used MEG to explore the neural correlates of exogenous attention and
      consciousness during visual processing.
