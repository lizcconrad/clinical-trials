      This phase II trial chose the induction chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin followed
      by Chemoradiotherapy (CRT) with gemcitabine to optimize the treatment for pancreas cancer
      patients with locally advanced disease and the purpose of this trial is to evaluate the
      efficacy of induction CT with gemcitabine and cisplatin followed by CRT for unresectable
      pancreatic carcinoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary endpoint is feasibility and compliance of induction chemotherapy with gemcitabine
      and cisplatin followed by CRT for locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer. Previous
      studies showed that approximately 20% of patients with locally advanced disease developed the
      early distant metastasis.[6, 7] Thus, it will be expected that at least 80% of total patients
      will be eligible for induction chemotherapy after completion of induction chemotherapy. An
      experimental arm that result a compliance of 80% would merit further study. If the true
      compliance rate of the patients who will eligible for CRT is ≤ 60%, null hypothesis will be
      rejected with a power of 80% and a type I error of 5%. Thus, the required number of evaluable
      patients is 24. Considering the 10% follow-up loss and 20% distant metastasis rate after
      induction chemotherapy, a total of 34 eligible patients will be enrolled.

Gemcitabine 300mg/m2 will be given by 30-minute intravenous infusion weekly during RT and CRT will be started within 3 weeks after completion of 2 cycles of induction chemotherapy.
