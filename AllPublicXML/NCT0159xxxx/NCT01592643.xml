  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to determine if an investigational thin shield over the
      cornea can safely and effectively reduce or eliminate pain following Post Photorefractive
      Keratectomy (PRK).

      The thin shield is made of silicone. The materials used to make the corneal shield all have a
      history of use in medical devices, contact lenses, and/or corneal shields and have been used
      safely in the eye.
