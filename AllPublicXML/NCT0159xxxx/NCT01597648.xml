    <textblock>
      This is a study in healthy adult subjects to evaluate the bioequivalence of a Combined
      Formulated Tablet compared with maraviroc and Combivir administered concurrently versus
      maraviroc + Combivir. 42 subjects will be enrolled in the study such that 40 subjects
      complete dosing and critical assessments. The total duration of a subject's participation
      will be approximately 33 to 35 days, including a screening period (Day −21 to Day −1), 2
      treatment periods (Days 1-3), at least a 7-day washout between Period 1 and Period 2, and a
      follow-up visit 7 to 14 days after the last dose of study drug in Period 2. Each dosing
      period will begin the evening prior to dosing and extend until 48 hours (Day 3) after dosing.
      Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive 1 of the following 2 treatments in Period 1
      then crossover to receive the alternate treatment in Period 2:

      In Sequence 1 (N=21) subjects will receive Treatment A followed by a 7 day washout and
      Treatment B. In Sequence 2 (N=21) subjects will receive Treatment B followed by a 7 day
      washout and Treatment A. Treatment A consists of 1 tablet of maraviroc 300 mg, lamivudine 150
      mg, and zidovudine 300 mg as a combined formulation after an overnight fast. Treatment B
      consists of 1 tablet of maraviroc 300 mg + 1 tablet of Combivir taken concurrently after an
      overnight fast. On Day 1 of each treatment period, subjects will receive study drug in the
      morning after an overnight fast of at least 8 hours. Study drug will be administered with 240
      mL of water. Dosing in each treatment period will be separated by a minimum washout period of
      at least 7 days between doses. All subjects will undergo safety and other assessments.
      Subjects may be discharged after all study procedures are completed on the morning of Day 3,
      with instructions to return for the next study period or the follow-up visit, as appropriate.
      The follow-up visit will occur 7 to 14 days after the last dose of study drug in Period 2.
      Pharmacokinetic blood samples will be collected during each treatment period for evaluation
      of maraviroc, lamivudine, and zidovudine before dosing and at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3,
      4, 6, 8, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48 hours after dosing (total of 16 PK time points per treatment
      period). Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed, with the exception of immediate
      safety concerns. Therefore, adherence to the study protocol requirements, including those
      specified in the Time and Events Table, are essential and required for study conduct.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male and female subjects 18 to 55 years of age (inclusive); healthy as
             determined by a responsible physician, based on a medical evaluation, including
             medical history, vital sign measurements, physical examination, clinical laboratory
             tests, and 12-lead ECG. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters
             outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if
             the investigator and the Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to
             introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: Non childbearing potential,
             defined as premenopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or
             postmenopausal, defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea (in questionable cases,
             a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone [FSH] greater than 40
             MlU/mL and estradiol less than 40 pg/mL (less than 146.8 pmol/L) is confirmatory).
             Childbearing potential and is abstinent (abstinence from penile-vaginal intercourse
             must be consistent with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject) or agrees to
             use 1 of the contraception methods listed in Section 8.1 for an appropriate period of
             time (as determined by the product label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing
             to sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must
             agree to use contraception until 30 days after the study.

          -  The subject has alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin less
             than and equal to 1.5 × ULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5 × ULN is acceptable if bilirubin
             is fractionated and direct bilirubin is less than 35%).

          -  Subject has a QTcB &lt;450 msec.

          -  The subject has a body mass index (BMI) between 18.5 and 31.0 kg/m2 (inclusive) and a

          -  The subject is a current nonsmoker greater than 3 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has a positive prestudy drug/alcohol screen. At minimum, the drug screen
             will include alcohol, cotinine, amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, opiates,
             cannabinoids, and benzodiazepines.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives, or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  The subject has a history of sensitivity to any of the study drugs, or components
             thereof, or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the
             investigator or Medical Monitor, contraindicates the subject's participation.

          -  The subject is unable to refrain from the use of prescription or nonprescription
             drugs, including vitamins and herbal and dietary supplements (including St. John's
             wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a potential enzyme inducer) or 5
             half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study drug, unless in the

          -  The female subject is lactating.

          -  The subject is unwilling or unable to follow the procedures outlined in the protocol.

          -  The subject has a pre-existing condition interfering with normal gastrointestinal
             anatomy or motility, hepatic, and/or renal function that could interfere with the
             absorption, metabolism, and/or excretion of the study drugs. A subject with a history
             of cholecystectomy, peptic ulceration, inflammatory bowel disease, or pancreatitis
             should be excluded.

          -  The subject has a positive prestudy hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody,
             or HIV antibody result.

          -  The subject has a history of Gilbert's disease.

          -  The subject's participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood

             blood pressure outside the range of 45-90 mmHg, or heart rate outside the range of
             50-100 bpm for female subjects or 45-100 bpm for male subjects. A single repeat
             measurement is allowed for eligibility determination.

          -  The subject meets any of the following exclusion criteria for the screening ECG (a
             single repeat ECG is allowed for eligibility determination): Males heart rate: less
             than 45 or greater than 100 bpm; females heart rate: less than 50 or greater than 100
             bpm; Males and females PR interval: less than 120 or greater than 220 msec; Males and

             greater than 450 msec. Evidence of previous myocardial infarction (does not include ST
             segment changes associated with repolarization). Any conduction abnormality (including
             but not specific to left or right complete bundle branch block, atrioventricular block
             [2nd degree or higher], and Wolf Parkinson White syndrome). Sinus pauses greater than
             3 seconds. Any significant arrhythmia which, in the opinion of the principal
