      Background:

      Rectal prolapse (RP) is the descent of the upper rectum and is a common problem in the
      western world. Surgery is the only definite treatment and is preferably performed minimally
      invasive. High-level prospective studies on treatment strategies for RP currently are lacking
      and, thus, no consensus exist regarding the optimal treatment for patients with RP.
      Furthermore, remarkable transatlantic differences exist, as in Europe, laparoscopic ventral
      rectopexy (LVR) is regarded the treatment of choice, while in the USA Laparoscopic Resection
      Rectopexy (LRR) remains the golden standard.

      Objective:

      To determine the optimal minimally invasive surgical treatment for patients with RP.

      Design:

      International, prospective, comparative double cohort study. The first cohort will consist of
      120 European patients with a RP and will be treated with LVR. Centres in The Netherlands,
      Belgium and the UK are enlisted for participation. The second cohort will consist of 120
      American patients with a RP, treated with LRR. Several US centres are enlisted. Preoperative
      work-up consists of radiological imaging and standardised questionnaires. Follow-up (FU) is
      set on two years. During FU, pre-operative imaging and questionnaires will be repeated.

      Primary &amp; secondary outcomes:

      Primary endpoint will be improvement on the Gastro-Intestinal-Quality-of-Life-Index (GIQLI).
      Secondary endpoints will be generic Quality-of-Life, functional results, morbidity,
      mortality, recurrences and cost-effectiveness.

      Time frame:

      Study and inclusion start will be on January the 1st, 2011 and will take approximately 18-24
      months. Therefore, total study duration will be 42-48 months.

    <textblock>
      A Rectal Prolapse (RP), or procidentia, is the descent of the upper rectum. This descensus in
      the full-thickness of the rectum, and can be either internal, called an internal rectal
      prolapse or intussusception (IRP), or through the anus (called an external rectal prolapse
      (ERP)).

      RP mainly occurs in women (80-90%) of which most in the 6-7th decade. Risk factors for
      developing a rectal prolapse are the presence of an abnormal deep pouch of Douglas, laxity
      and atonic condition of the muscles of the pelvic floor and anal canal. Moreover, weakness of
      both internal and external sphincters, often with evidence of pudendal nerve neuropathy and
      the lack of normal fixation of the rectum may lead to RP. This also frequently leads to other
      pelvic organ prolapses like vesicoceles, enteroceles and genital prolapses. In this study the
      investigators will focus on the treatment of RP.

      Rectal prolapses cause anal incontinence in more than half of the patients. Another frequent
      symptom of RP is constipation. Furthermore, the rectal prolapse can lead to anal pain as a
      result of incarceration leading to ulcers, necrosis and perforation.

      Besides the fact that this disease has a considerable impact on the individual quality of
      life, it also carries significant socio-economic consequences as incontinence products have
      to be used in large amounts.
