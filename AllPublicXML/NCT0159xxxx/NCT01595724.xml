  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to collect data on the influence of a treatment with Visanne (Dienogest 2mg/d)
      on the Endometriosis related quality of life. These data will be collected using a special
      patient questionnaire (Endometriosis Health Profile 5, EHP-5). The study will also be used to
      describe the basic disease status and demographic characteristics of patients searching
      treatment by a gynecologist because of their endometriosis. In addition, the study will give
      insight into the typical diagnostic measures the physicians in different countries are using
      in the field of endometriosis.
