  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 444 subjects who are greater than or equal to 18 to 95 years of age, are
      non-pregnant, and are in the inpatient setting of one of the study sites will be evaluated to
      treatment efficacy. Analysis will include subjects with bloodstream infection (BSI) or
      pneumonia due to at least one of the following gram-negative bacilli organisms: Acinetobacter
      baumannii, Klebsiella spp, Escherichia coli, Enterbactor spp. and/or Pseudomonas aeruginosa
      that demonstrates in vitro non-susceptibility defined as extensively drug-resistant
      Gram-negative bacilli (XDR-GNB) which includes XDR-AB, XDR-PA and CRE. If a subject has both
      BSI and pneumonia at the time of study enrollment, they will be included as a subject with
      pneumonia.

      Objectives:

      Primary:

      •Determine whether the treatment regimen of Colistimethate sodium (colistin) combined with a
      carbapenem (imipenem or meropenem) is associated with a decreased risk for mortality compared
      to colistin alone for subjects with bloodstream infection (BSI) and/or pneumonia due to
      XDR-GNB.

      Secondary:

      •Determine what treatment regimen (colistin monotherapy or colistin combined with a
      carbapenem (imipenem or meropenem) is more likely to reduce the emergence of colistin
      resistance among XDR-GNB isolates during therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Gram-negative bacilli organisms Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella spp., Escherichia
      coli, Enterbactor spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have become a frequent cause of bloodstream
      infection and pneumonia in the hospital and other healthcare settings. Among these pathogens,
      antimicrobial resistance has emerged to many classes of antimicrobial agents. Most
      concerning, has been the emergence of resistance to group 2 carbapenems (such as imipenem).
      In several regions of the world, including Southeastern Michigan, strains of extensively-drug
      resistant Gram-negative bacilli (XDR-GNB) that exhibit resistance to most, and in some cases
      all types of available antimicrobial agents, including group 2 carbapenems, have emerged and
      disseminated. Treatment options for XDR-GNB typically include Colistimethate sodium (referred
      to as colistin in this study), used alone (monotherapy) or in combination with other agents.
      Unfortunately, resistance to colistin has begun to emerge in some strains of XDR-GNB, which
      is a truly concerning development, since colistin is one of the last remaining treatment
      options for XDR-GNB. No prospective, randomized controlled trials have been conducted to
      evaluate the clinical efficacy of colistin monotherapy versus colistin-containing combination
      therapy or the impact of these therapeutic modalities on the emergence of colistin resistance
      among XDR-GNB. We plan to conduct a double-blind randomized controlled trial including
      patients with pneumonia and bloodstream infection due to XDR-GNB. After enrollment, subjects
      will be randomized to receive 14 days of either colistin monotherapy or colistin plus
      meropenem.

      In the Detroit metro area, infections due to XDR-GNB have developed into a regional challenge
      and common problem. We have assembled a multi-disciplinary team that includes Infectious
      Diseases researchers, clinicians, infectious diseases pharmacists, microbiologists,
      epidemiologists and statistical experts to address critically important questions and
      challenges regarding the management of bloodstream infection and pneumonia due to XDR-GNB.
      Specifically, we hypothesize that the combination of colistin and imipenem will provide
      superior efficacy in the treatment of XDR-GNB pneumonia and bloodstream infection and will
      prevent the emergence of decreased susceptibility to colistin among XDR-GNB strains. We also
      aim to analyze tools that could be used in &quot;real time&quot; to aid clinicians treating patients
      with infection due to XDR-GNB. For example, we aim to analyze the association between the
      presence of in vitro synergy of the colistin and carbapenem (imipenem or meropenem)
      combination (as determined by E-test) and clinical outcomes; and the association between
      colistin plasma levels and clinical outcomes and the development of nephrotoxicity.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Hospitalized Adults (&gt; 18 years to 95 years of age), at one of the study sites.

          -  Diagnosis of BSI and/or pneumonia due to a preliminary result of gram-negative
             non-lactose fermenter that is oxidase negative; or a final results of XDR-A.
             baumannii; carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaciae; or XDR- P. aeruginosa and/or
             patients with suspected BSI and/or HAP and who have had a prior history (within last 6
             months) of XDR-GNB that was susceptible to colistin.

             o If final results do not indicate that the pathogen is an XDR-GNB, and identifies
             alternative treatment options, the patient would be eligible for the study if the
             subject is allergic to all the alternative treatment options.

          -  Patients with polymicrobial respiratory or blood infections, including XDR-GNB and one
             or more pathogens, will be included in the study, as long as the XDR-GNB is determined
             to be a true pathogen (AB, CRE or PA). Other pathogens will be treated with
             antimicrobial agents as determined by the treating physician.

          -  If more than one XDR-GNB study pathogens is identified as a study pathogen causing BSI
             and/or pneumonia, then the first study pathogen recovered will be considered as the
             primary study pathogen. If more than one study pathogen is recovered from the same
             culture, then the infection will be categorized as being caused by multiple study
             pathogens.

          -  Patients with a life expectancy of &gt; 24 hours

          -  Signed written informed consent and HIPAA Authorization form (US sites)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Female patients who are pregnant

          -  Female patients who are nursing

          -  Patients who are prisoners

          -  Patients who are less than 18 years of age or greater than or equal to 96 years of age

          -  Patients with neutropenia (WBC &lt; 500 cells/mm3)

          -  The presence of any of the following known clinical syndromes involving XDR-GNB as a
             pathogen which necessitate durations of antimicrobial therapies greater than 14 days:
             endocarditis, osteomyelitis, prosthetic joint infections, meningitis and/or other
             central nervous system infections.

          -  Patients receiving valproic acid (with or without a known seizure disorder).

          -  Patients who received 72 hours or more of polymyxin treatment (intravenous or inhaled
             [pneumonia]) within 96 hours of enrollment.

          -  Patients who have end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis, will be excluded
             from evaluation pertaining to nephrotoxicity in the per protocol population.

          -  Patients with known Type 1 or other severe drug allergy to either of the study drugs
             or to β-lactams.
