      This grant involved the development, implementation, and assessment of the feasibility and
      acceptability of an HIV prevention intervention for at-risk wives in Mumbai, RHANI Wives
      (Raising HIV Awareness among Non-Infected Indian Wives). The RHANI Wives intervention was
      adapted from the HIV Intervention Program (HIV-IP), a community-based, multi-session HIV
      intervention with demonstrated effectiveness among Latinas whose primary risk for HIV was
      from their primary male partner (Raj et al. 2001).

      Specific aims of this study are as follows:

        1. To adapt HIV-IP, a culture and gender-tailored HIV intervention for Latinas with
           demonstrated effectiveness in reducing risk for HIV, and to create RHANI Wives for use
           with at-risk Indian wives.

        2. To determine the feasibility and acceptability of RHANI Wives with at risk wives* in
           India. A two-group cluster randomized trial will involve random assignment of 12
           neighborhood clusters (25 women/cluster) to receive the intervention (n=150) or a
           control condition (n=150). Intervention effects on the more proximal and likely safer
           sex mediating outcome of marital communication for this feasibility trial will be
           assessed via surveys at baseline and 3 month follow-up.

      NOTE: Only 220 participants were able to be recruited into the study.

      *At risk wives are defined as having a husband at higher risk for transactional sex based on
      wife's reports of his risky alcohol use (drunk in past 30 days, 3+ drinking days in past 7
      days) or partner violence perpetration

    <description>The RHANI Wives intervention included four household individual sessions and two small group community sessions delivered over 6-9 weeks. The intervention was based on Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) and the Theory of Gender and Power (TGP). SCT application supported focus on HIV/STI knowledge and condom skills building, as well as safer sex social norms and motivation. TGP guided the intervention focus on problem solving and skills building toward marital communication; embedded in this was gender equity counseling and support. The TGP approach allowed women to take a more active and assertive stance with husbands. Group sessions reinforced individual session knowledge and skills building and provided local social support.</description>
