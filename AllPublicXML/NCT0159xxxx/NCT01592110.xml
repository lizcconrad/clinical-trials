    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label study to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of three
      doses of risperidone-SABER, administered with a needle and syringe or via the DosePro
      Needle-Free Delivery System in patients with chronic, stable schizophrenia.

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single ascending dose (SAD), safety and PK study in patients with
      chronic, stable schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Patients will participate in the
      study for a total of up to 10 weeks for Cohorts 1-3, including a Screening period of up to 35
      days and a study treatment period of 35 days, and up to 14 weeks for Cohort 4, including a
      Screening period of up to 35 days and a study treatment period of 63 days. Patients will be
      assigned to one of four cohorts, and will receive a single dose of 25 mg, 50 mg or 100 mg
      (100 mg/mL concentration) administered as a single subcutaneous (SC) injection or via the
      DosePro Needle-Free Delivery System.
