  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study hypothesizes that the systematic use of bilateral internal mammary artery
      (BIMA) grafting is feasible in the practice of a University Cardiac Surgery Institution for
      the treatment of multivessel coronary artery disease (primary hypothesis). The secondary
      study hypothesis is that the BIMA grafting meets the safety endpoint compared with the
      conventional surgical strategy entailing left mammary artery grafting plus great saphenous
      vein grafts to revascularize the remaining coronary targets. The tertiary study hypothesis is
      that the BIMA grafting yields better follow-up results in terms of recurrence of symptoms
      related to coronary disease, of repeat revascularization and of cardiac mortality compared
      with patients treated with the conventional surgical strategy entailing left mammary artery
      grafting plus great saphenous vein grafts to revascularize the remaining coronary targets.

    <description>Starting in June 2012, all clinical data concerning patients undergoing BIMA grafting are recorded, including the baseline demographics and risk factors, the operative time, all in-hospital complications, duration of Intensive care Unit and Hospital stays, the amount of transfusion of blood products.</description>

    <description>The patients enrolled in the study are subjected to longitudinal follow-up to determine the rate of residual myocardial ischemia (periodical stress ECG), of recurrent symptoms of coronary disease, and of any adverse cardiac event (periodical follow-up visits).</description>

    <description>Both the left and the right internal mammary arteries are harvested and used to revascularize the two major coronary targets. Further coronary targets may be revascularized using either great saphenous vein or radial artery grafts, if present.</description>
