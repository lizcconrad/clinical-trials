      Investigator(s):

      Approximately 10 study centers (allergy services) in Spain

      Planned study period:

      MAY 2012 (first subject in) - MAR 2013 (last subject out)

      Objectives:

      Primary objective: to evaluate the safety of a 4-month treatment with an extract of Depigoid®
      Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus or a mixture of 50% Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and 50%
      Dermatophagoides farinae at a concentration of 500 DPP/ml administered following a rush
      build-up regimen.

      Secondary objective: to assess the subjects' immunologic responses to the above treatment.

      Study design:

      This is a prospective, non-randomized, uncontrolled, open-label safety study. When the first
      29 subjects have completed the study, an interim analysis will be conducted to check whether
      the number of systemic reactions in these subjects is below a predefined limit.

      Planned number of subjects:

      103 subjects in total.

      Medical condition or disease under investigation:

      Allergic rhinitis or rhinoconjunctivitis, with or without mild persistent or intermittent
      asthma.

      Test product, dose and mode of administration:

      Depigoid® D. pteronyssinus or Depigoid® 50% D. pteronyssinus / 50% D. farinae (500 DPP/ml).

      Dose: Week 0: 0.2 ml followed by 0.3 ml after 30 min Week 4, 8, 12, and 16: 0.5 ml Mode of
      administration: subcutaneous injection

      Duration of treatment:

      16 weeks.

      Criteria for evaluation:

      Safety:

      Local and systemic adverse reactions (EAACI classification); adverse events.

      Efficacy:

      Immunologic response to the treatment.

      Statistical methods:

      Primary variable: number of subjects [%] who experienced at least one immediate or delayed
      systemic reaction of EAACI grade 2 or higher during the 4-month treatment period.

      Analysis of primary variable: exact binomial test

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women between 18 and 55 years of age (both inclusive).

          -  Individuals suffering symptoms of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis or rhinitis during at
             least the preceding year -- with or without symptoms of mild persistent or
             intermittent allergic asthma which is controlled with a dose less or equal to 400
             µg/day budesonide or an equivalent -- caused by a clinically relevant sensitization to
             house dust mites (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus or Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and
             Dermatophagoides farinae).

          -  The IgE-mediated sensitization will be demonstrated by means of the following: medical
             history and IgE specific to house dust mites (D. pteronyssinus or D. pteronyssinus and
             D. farinae) CAP RAST ≥ 2 and positive skin prick test. A skin prick test will be
             considered positive when it produces a wheal of at least 3 mm according to the largest
             diameter.

          -  Asthmatic patients must be stable and on a stable inhaled steroid dose within 6 weeks
             prior to visit 1 and throughout the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any contraindication for treatment with allergen specific immunotherapy.

          -  Forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) or peak expiratory flow (PEF) value &lt; 80% of
             the predicted normal value.

          -  Allergy symptoms due to sensitization to pollens or other perennial allergens (molds,
             epithelia).

          -  Subjects with typical symptoms to co-allergens such as tree pollen, grasses or weeds,
             fungi or animal epithelial cells cannot participate in this study. Patients sensitized
             to pollens with specific IgE CAP RAST &lt; 2 can be included in this study provided that
             they do not present symptoms as a consequence of this sensitization. Patients
             sensitized to animal epithelia who do not present symptoms can participate in this
             study provided that they are not exposed to the allergen to which they are sensitized,
             even though they present specific IgE with CAP RAST ≥ 2. If they were exposed to the
             animal in question, these subjects must have a specific IgE with CAP RAST &lt; 2 in order
             to participate in the study.

          -  Asthma requiring a dose &gt; 400 µg/day of Budesonide or an equivalent, without
             long-lasting beta-2 agonists, to reach control according to the Global Initiative for
             Asthma (GINA 2010).

          -  Patients with non controlled bronchial asthma within 3 months prior to Visit 1.

          -  Patients with asthma who have been treated with systemic steroids within 3 months
             prior to V1.

          -  Patients with hospital admission due to asthma exacerbations within 1 year prior to V1

          -  Acute or chronic inflammatory or infectious diseases of the airways.

          -  Chronic structural diseases of the respiratory system (for example, emphysema or
             bronchiectasis).

          -  Immune system diseases, both autoimmune diseases and immunodeficiency.

          -  Any disease involving a contraindication for the use of adrenaline (for example,
             hyperthyroidism).

          -  Serious uncontrolled diseases involving a risk for the subjects participating in this
             study, including the following for example: heart failure, serious or uncontrolled
             respiratory diseases, endocrine diseases, clinically relevant liver or kidney diseases
             or hematological diseases.

          -  Malignant disease with activity in the last 5 years.

          -  Clinically significant anomaly in laboratory parameters or vital signs which could
             involve a risk increase for the subject.

          -  Excessive consumption of alcohol, drugs or medication in the preceding year.

          -  Serious psychiatric, psychological or neurological disorders.

          -  Use of immunotherapy with allergenic extracts of storage or house dust mites in the
             last 5 years.

          -  Systemic or topical treatment with beta-blocker drugs.

          -  Treatment with substances interfering with the immune system 2 weeks before visit 2.

          -  Use of psychotropic or antidepressants substances.

          -  Use of systemic corticosteroids 3 months before visit 1.

          -  Immunization with prophylactic (bacterial or viral) vaccines within 7 days before
             visit 2. (Prophylactic vaccines are allowed during the administration of IMP period
             provided they are administered at least one week after immunotherapy and the next
             immunotherapy dose is administered at least 14 days later).

          -  Participation of the subject in another clinical trial 30 days before visit 2.

          -  Subjects who have already participated in this clinical trial.

          -  Subjects who are going to donate stem cells, blood, organs or bone marrow in the
             course of the study.

             at visit 1 or 2.

          -  Women of childbearing potential not using highly effective methods of birth control.
             Highly effective methods of birth control are defined as those which result in a low
             failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly, such
             as implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some IUDs, sexual abstinence
             or vasectomized partner. Female patients will be considered to be of childbearing
             potential unless surgically sterilized by hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation, or
             post-menopausal for at least two years.

          -  No written informed consent upon enrolment.

          -  Not willing to give consent for transmission of personal &quot;pseudonymised&quot; data.

          -  Subjects who are unable to comply with the requirements of the study or who in the
             opinion of the investigator should not participate in the study.
