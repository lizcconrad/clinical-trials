      Objective: To compare loss of ovarian parenchyma following ovarian endometrioma ablation
      using the PlasmaJet system versus cystectomy, using postoperative examination by 3D
      ultrasound.

      Design: Prospective comparative study. Setting: Two experienced surgeons practicing in two
      University tertiary referral centers.

      Patients: Fifty women with no previous history of ovarian surgery managed for unilateral
      ovarian endometrioma &gt; 30 mm in diameter.

      Interventions: Endometrioma ablation by plasma energy using the PlasmaJet system and ovarian
      tissue sparing cystectomy.

      Main Outcome Measures: 3D ultrasound assessment of postoperative reduction in ovarian volume
      and antral follicle count (AFC) .

      The management of ovarian endometriomas in women wishing to conceive remains challenging.
      Recent data suggest that excising endometriomas by ovarian tissue sparing cystectomy does not
      avoid inadvertent removal of ovarian parenchyma surrounding the cyst, particularly in
      enlarged cysts. Although several authors question whether the ovarian parenchyma immediately
      surrounding the cyst may still be functional, there is little doubt that postoperative
      fertility could be significantly impaired by loss of ovarian cortex and provokes the question
      as to whether pregnancy should be initiated before performing a cystectomy, whenever this
      scenario is possible. However ovarian surgery cannot always be delayed to the postpartum
      period, numerous women require endometrioma management while not seeking an immediate
      pregnancy and still wish to conserve their procreative capabilities.

      After a period of some years during which cystectomy appeared to be the best surgical
      technique in the treatment of ovarian endometriomas in women wishing to become pregnant,
      recent data have suggested that ablation of the inner layer of the endometrioma may be a
      valuable alternative technique, as long as the energy employed avoids thermal diffusion to
      surrounding ovarian tissue. The Department of Gynecology at the University Hospital in Rouen,
      France have introduced ablation by plasma energy using the PlasmaJet system (Plasma Surgical
      Ltd, Abingdon, UK) and have already been able to report encouraging results based on non
      comparative pilot studies and on retrospective &quot;before and after&quot; comparative study.

      The aim of the study is to prospectively compare loss of ovarian parenchyma and decrease in
      antral follicle count (AFC) following ovarian endometrioma ablation using plasma energy
      versus cystectomy, when performed by only two expert surgeons. Postoperative examination is
      carried out by 3D ultrasound.

    <description>Origin of cyst invagination is identified after lysis of adhesions between ovary and adjacent broad ligament, leading to characteristic &quot;chocolate fluid&quot; evacuation. Surgeon then attempts to turn cyst completely inside out via original invagination site of diameter averaging 1 to 2cm. Ablation of cyst's inner surface is performed using the PlasmaJet system in coagulation mode set at 40, at distance averaging 5mm from tip of handpiece, and with exposure time limited to 1 to 2s on each site. Care is taken not to leave any untreated sites and to ablate the edges of the invagination site and corresponding peritoneal implants on adjacent broad ligament. When cyst reversion is not feasible, surgeon progressively exposes cyst interior to guide plasma beam at an angle perpendicular to the inner surface.</description>

    <description>Surgical excision of an ovarian endometrioma by cystectomy involves three distinct areas, each requiring a different excision procedure. Area A from where cyst invagination originates, measures 1 cm² on average and is revealed by lysing adhesions between the ovary and the adjacent broad ligament, leading to the characteristic &quot;chocolate fluid&quot; evacuation. The excision by scissors of area A allows the surgeon to identify a cleavage plane close to the cyst wall, which can be followed without significant bleeding (area B). Should adhesions appear in the cleavage plane, they are coagulated and cut, so as not to strip the ovarian cortex. Close to the ovarian hilus, for complete cyst removal, adhesions require coagulation using bipolar current and section by scissors (area C).</description>
