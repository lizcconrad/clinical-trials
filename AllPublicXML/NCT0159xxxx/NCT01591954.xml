  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current standard of care for complex head, neck and skull base surgery require navigation
      systems that allow instruments to be tracked optically or electromagnetically while
      registered to a patient's pre-operative X-ray computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance
      image (MRI). However, conventionally, the CT/MRI data is not registered with video endoscopy.
      Augmentation of endoscopic video by preoperative data can facilitate navigation around
      critical structures and robust target resection. The work presented here describes evaluation
      of a high definition (HD) video-overlay system for endonasal endoscopic skull base surgery.
      We adopt a modular design that can be extended for other video augmentation applications. The
      system supports fast automatic camera calibration, comparable in re-projection errors to
      standard camera calibration tools, while performing within appropriate run time for clinical
      use. Phantom studies have shown the registration accuracy of the system to be equivalent to
      that of conventional optical tracking. With this system we are proposing a clinical pilot
      study in a small number of patients at Johns Hopkins Hospital to evaluate basic feasibility
      and to gather qualitative assessment of the video augmentation system.

= Significant hindrance / Negative effect;

    <description>The secondary outcome variable of this study is the data recorded by the video augmentation system during pertinent portions of the operation. We will be targeting steps in the procedure that would have the greatest benefit from an augmented video scene to be used later for further studies. Such data will form the subject of retrospective analysis of workflow.
Three sets of data will be collected to be able to reconstruct the video scene for analysis of the system:
- Tracked Endoscope information.
- Video from endoscopy
- Planning CT/MRI data</description>
