    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical study is to compare the safety and efficacy of mapracorat
      ophthalmic suspension, 3% with its vehicle for the treatment of postoperative inflammation
      and pain following cataract surgery. Participants from the United States and Canada will be
      recruited for this study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who are candidates for routine, uncomplicated cataract surgery.

          -  Subjects who, in the Investigator's opinion, have potential postoperative pinhole
             Snellen visual acuity (VA) of at least 20/200 in the study eye.

          -  Subjects who have â‰¥ Grade 2 (6 - 15 cells) AC cells in the study eye following
             cataract surgery (postoperative day 1).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who have a severe/serious ocular condition or history/presence of chronic
             generalized systemic disease that the Investigator feels might increase the risk to
             the subject or confound the result(s) of the study.

          -  Any intraocular inflammation in either eye (cells or flare score greater than Grade 0
             at slit lamp examination) or ocular pain greater than Grade 1 in the study eye at the
             Screening Visit.

          -  Presence of active external ocular disease: infection or inflammation of the study
             eye.

          -  Subjects who have known hypersensitivity or contraindication to the study drug(s) or
             their components.

          -  Subjects who currently require or are expected to require treatment with any
             medication listed as a disallowed medication per the Disallowed Therapy section of the
             protocol.
