    <textblock>
      Based upon the in-vitro data AQUACEL® Extra™ achieves a 39% increase in absorbency. As such
      it is anticipated that through improved exudate management a longer wear time will be
      achieved in the AQUACEL® Extra™ group compared to AQUACEL® in the management of chronic
      wounds such as venous leg ulcers.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects over 18 years, willing and able to provide written informed consent.

          -  Subjects who have an ankle to brachial pressure index (ABPI) of 0.8 or greater

          -  Subjects who have a venous leg ulcer (i.e. CEAP classification of C6 1) with duration
             less than 24 months

          -  Subjects whose ulcer is no smaller than 2cms in any one direction

          -  Subjects whose ulcer is no greater than 11cm in any one direction (measured by longest
             length and widest width)

          -  Subjects' whose index leg ulcer has a moderate to heavy level of exudate.

          -  Subjects whose index (study) leg is currently being treated with compression therapy
             and whose leg oedema is under control

          -  Subjects who are willing and able to comply with the requirements of the clinical
             investigation plan in relation to the dressing/compression regime and the ability to
             attend dressing changes as required.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a history of skin sensitivity to any of the components of the study
             dressings (AQUACEL® Extra™, AQUACEL®, &amp; DuoDERM™ Extra Thin)

          -  Subjects whose wounds are considered clinically infected at baseline

          -  Subjects whose leg ulcers are malignant, or who have had recent deep venous thrombosis
             or venous surgery within the last 3 months.

          -  Subjects who have progressive neoplastic lesion treated by radiotherapy or
             chemotherapy, or on-going treatment with immunosuppressive agents

          -  Subjects exhibiting any other medical condition which, according to the Investigator,
             justifies the subject's exclusion from the study

          -  Subjects who have participated in a clinical study within the past month.
