      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ibrutinib in patients
      with mantle cell lymphoma who received at least 1 prior rituximab-containing chemotherapy
      regimen and who progressed after bortezomib therapy.

      This is a single-arm (all patients will receive the study drug) study to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of ibrutinib in patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have
      received at least 1 rituximab-containing chemotherapy regimen and who progressed after
      bortezomib therapy. Approximately 110 eligible patients will be enrolled. During the
      treatment phase, patients will receive 560 mg of ibrutinib by mouth once daily continuously
      until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or study end, whichever occurs first.
      Treatment will be continuous (without interruption) and self-administered at home. Doses can
      be held or reduced based on the severity of and the recovery from side effects of the study
      drug. The sponsor will ensure that patients benefiting from treatment with ibrutinib will be
      able to continue treatment after the end of the study. Data will be collected on disease
      response to the treatment, on progression-free survival, overall survival, and subsequent
      anti-MCL therapies. Serial pharmacokinetic (study of what the body does to a drug) samples
      will be collected as detailed in the protocol. Safety will be monitored throughout the study.
      An interim analysis of the pharmacokinetic data will occur approximately 3 months after the
      scheduled pharmacokinetic sampling in Cycles 1 and 2 has been completed. Data will be
      analyzed 1 year after the last patient is enrolled for the primary analysis and 2 years after
      last patient is enrolled for the final follow-up.
