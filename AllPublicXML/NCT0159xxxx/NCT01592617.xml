    <textblock>
      The investigators identified three cancer-testis antigens, as targets for cancer vaccination
      against lung cancer. In this clinical study, the investigators examine using a combination of
      three peptides from these three antigens (S-488410) the safety, immunogenicity, and antitumor
      effect of vaccine treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of S-488410 for
      advanced non-small cell lung cancers who failed to standard therapy.

      The investigators previously identified three novel HLA-A*2402-restricted epitope peptides,
      which were derived from three cancer-testis antigens, as targets for cancer vaccination
      against lung cancer. In this phase II trial, we examine using a combination of these three
      peptides the safety, immunogenicity, and antitumor effect of vaccine treatment for
      HLA-A*2402-positive advanced small cell lung cancer patients who failed to standard therapy.
