  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an ancillary study to a clinical trial that is being conducted at Massachusetts
      General Hospital. Investigators at MGH are conducting a clinical trial to test the efficacy
      of ziprasidone together with escitalopram for treatment-resistant depression (NCT00633399).
      This observational study will involve magnetic resonance scans to examine brain chemistry
      (neurotransmitter levels), brain activity, and functional connections between brain regions
      before and after participating in the trial. The neurotransmitters of interest are glutamate,
      glutamine, and GABA. Comparisons will be made between individuals who receive ziprasidone and
      individuals who receive an inactive placebo. Differences between participants who respond to
      standard antidepressants and those who require additional medication will also be examined.
      All participants will have a baseline magnetic resonance scan before starting medication. The
      second scan will be after 8 weeks of escitalopram treatment for those who respond or
      following 8 weeks of escitalopram plus ziaprasidone or placebo (16 weeks after starting) for
      those who do not respond to escitalopram alone. Participants will complete standard rating
      scales for depression at each visit.
