        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Eligible patients had histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the
             prostate with clinical or radiologic evidence of disease progression during hormonal
             therapy

          2. Patients were receiving primary androgen-ablation therapy as maintenance therapy. At
             least four weeks had to have elapsed between the withdrawal of antiandrogens (six
             weeks in the case of bicalutamide) and enroll ment, so as to avoid the possibility of
             confounding as a result of the response to antiandrogen withdrawal.

          3. Another requirement was disease progression, as indicated by increasing serum levels
             of PSA on three consecutive measurements obtained at least one week apart or findings
             on physical examination or imaging studies.

          4. Normal cardiac function was required.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. patients had a Karnofsky performance-status score of at most 60 percent

          2. prior treatment with cytotoxic agents or radioisotopes

          3. with history of another cancer within the preceding five years, brain or
             leptomeningeal metastases, symptomatic peripheral neuropathy of grade 2 or higher, and
             other serious medical condition.
