      The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of Sativex in relieving symptoms of
      spasticity in multiple sclerosis

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a 15 week (one week baseline and fourteen weeks treatment period), multicentre,
      double blind, randomised, placebo controlled, parallel group study to evaluate the efficacy
      of Sativex in subjects with symptoms of spasticity due to multiple sclerosis. Eligible
      subjects entered a seven day baseline period. Subjects then returned to the centre for
      randomisation and dose introduction. Visits occurred at the end of treatment weeks two, six,
      ten and at the end of the study (treatment week 14) or earlier if they withdrew.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Spasticity 0-10 Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) Score During the Last 14 Day of Treatment (End of Treatment)</measure>
    <time_frame>0-15 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The average spasticity NRS was completed at the same time each day, i.e. bedtime in the evening. The subject was asked &quot;on a scale of '0 to 10', please indicate the number that best describes your spasticity in the last 24 hours&quot; where 0 = no spasticity and 10 = worst possible spasticity. A negative value indicates an improvement in pain score from baseline.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects With a 30% or Greater Improvement in Mean Spasticity 0-10 NRS Score at the End of Treatment Compared to Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>0-15 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The cumulative response to treatment was the percentage change from baseline in the mean NRS spasticity score as defined as the 30% response. The spasticity NRS was completed at the same time each day, i.e. bedtime in the evening. The subject was asked &quot;on a scale of '0 to 10', please indicate the number that best describes your spasticity in the last 24 hours&quot; where 0 = no spasticity and 10 = worst possible spasticity. The number of responders at the 30% level is presented.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Mean Modified Ashworth Scale Score at the End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 (Randomisation) and Day 99 (End of Treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>All 20 muscle groups were assessed for spasticity (using a 1-5 scale): 1= no increase in muscle tone to 5= passive movement is difficult and affected part is rigid in flexion or extension. The score for all 20 muscle groups were added to give a total score out of 100; minimum score was 20. A decrease in score indicates an improvement in condition.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Sleep Quality 0-10 NRS During the Last 14 Days of Treatment (End of Treatment)</measure>
    <time_frame>0-15 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The sleep disruption NRS was completed at the same time each day, i.e. bedtime in the evening. The subject was asked &quot;on a scale of '0 to 10', please indicate how your spasticity disrupted your sleep last night?&quot; where 0 = did not disrupt sleep and 10 = completely disrupted (unable to sleep at all). A negative value indicates an improvement in sleep disruption score from baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Adverse Events as a Measure of Subject Safety</measure>
    <time_frame>0-15 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The number of subjects who experienced and adverse event during the course of the study is presented</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Timed 10 Metre Walk Time at the End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 (Randomisation) and Day 99 (End of Treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>Only those subjects for whom it was appropriate (i.e. ambulatory subjects) were timed how long it took to walk 10 metres. Walk time was only assessed for subjects who successfully completed the Timed 10 Metre Walk. A negative difference from baseline indicates an improvement walk time.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Carer Global Impression of Change at the End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 99 (end of treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The carer of the subject gave their opinion of any noticeable change in the subject's overall functional ability at the end of the study. A 7-point Likert-type scale was used, with the markers &quot;very much improved, much improved, slightly improved, no change, slightly worse, much worse or very much worse&quot;. The number of carers who reported an improvement at the end of treatment is presented.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Mean Total Barthel Activities of Daily Living Index Score at the End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 (Randomisation) and Day 99 (End of Treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The Barthel Index consists of 10 items that measure a person's daily functioning specifically the activities of daily living and mobility. The items include feeding, moving from wheelchair to bed and return, grooming, transferring to and from a toilet, bathing, walking on level surface, going up and down stairs, dressing, continence of bowels and bladder. The person receives a score based on whether they have received help while doing the task. The scores for each of the items are summed to create a total score of 100. An increase in score indicates an improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects With a 50% or Greater Improvement in Mean Spasticity 0-10 NRS Score at the End of Treatment Compared to Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>0 - 15 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The cumulative response to treatment was the percentage change from baseline in the mean NRS spasticity score as defined as the 50% response. The spasticity NRS was completed at the same time each day, i.e. bedtime in the evening. The subject was asked &quot;on a scale of '0 to 10', please indicate the number that best describes your spasticity in the last 24 hours&quot; where 0 = no spasticity and 10 = worst possible spasticity. The number of responders at the 50% level is presented.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in the Mean Modified Ashworth Scale Score at the End of Treatment</title>
          <description>All 20 muscle groups were assessed for spasticity (using a 1-5 scale): 1= no increase in muscle tone to 5= passive movement is difficult and affected part is rigid in flexion or extension. The score for all 20 muscle groups were added to give a total score out of 100; minimum score was 20. A decrease in score indicates an improvement in condition.</description>

        <description>The Barthel Index consists of 10 items that measure a person's daily functioning specifically the activities of daily living and mobility. The items include feeding, moving from wheelchair to bed and return, grooming, transferring to and from a toilet, bathing, walking on level surface, going up and down stairs, dressing, continence of bowels and bladder. The person receives a score based on whether they have received help while doing the task. The scores for each of the items are summed to create a total score of 100. An increase in score indicates an improvement.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in the Mean Total Barthel Activities of Daily Living Index Score at the End of Treatment</title>
          <description>The Barthel Index consists of 10 items that measure a person's daily functioning specifically the activities of daily living and mobility. The items include feeding, moving from wheelchair to bed and return, grooming, transferring to and from a toilet, bathing, walking on level surface, going up and down stairs, dressing, continence of bowels and bladder. The person receives a score based on whether they have received help while doing the task. The scores for each of the items are summed to create a total score of 100. An increase in score indicates an improvement.</description>

The spasticity NRS was completed at the same time each day, i.e. bedtime in the evening.
