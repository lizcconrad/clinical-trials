      This study evaluates a novel micrografting technique to determine how it will influence the
      repigmentation of selected areas of hypopigmentation, and how it will influence the healing
      and pigmentation of surgical skin wounds. The Epidermal Expansion System (designed by MoMelan
      Technologies) will generate an array of small microblisters and transfer the micrografts to a
      sterile FDA cleared wound dressing for application to the subject's acute wound or prepared
      recipient site. The sponsor hypothesizes that applying expanded micrografts to target sites
      will result in rapid healing of acute wounds and in repigmentation of hypopigmented skin as
      well as and provide improved cosmetic outcomes.

    <description>The procurement of the epidermal micro graft involves the use of MoMelan Technologies suction blister system, which consists of a control harvester. The device is applied to the subject's thigh to create blisters. The epidermal micrografts are then harvested and transferred to a commercially available sterile film dressing, placed on the surgical wound or prepared recipient site and the wound is then bandaged.</description>
