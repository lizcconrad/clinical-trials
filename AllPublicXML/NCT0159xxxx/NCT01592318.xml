  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, open-label, crossover study will evaluate the relative bioavailability of
      ritonavir-boosted danoprevir fixed dose combination tablets (FDC) as compared to ad hoc
      combination of reference tablets of danoprevir and ritonavir in healthy volunteers. Subjects
      will be randomized to 1 of 6 treatment sequences to receive single oral doses of either an
      FDC of danoprevir and ritonavir or danoprevir and ritonavir as separate tablets. In a
      crossover design, subjects will participate in 3 study periods with at least a 7-day washout
      between periods. In Part 2, single dose administration of film-coated FDCs will be compared
      to reference tablets.

             implantable devices) within 30 days before the first dose of study medication

          -  Use of an investigational drug or device within 30 days of the first dose of study
             medication (6 months for biologic therapies) or 5 half-lives of the investigational
             drug, whichever is longer

          -  History of drug-related allergic reactions or hepatotoxicity
