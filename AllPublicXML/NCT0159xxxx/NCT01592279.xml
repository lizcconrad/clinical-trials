      The new incretin-based therapies offer appealing advantages over existing drugs. Aside from
      glucose dependent insulin secretion and a proven glucose lowering efficacy, they have other
      concomitant beneficial effects, such as low risk of hypoglycemia, inhibition of the glucagon
      secretion with maintenance of counter-regulatory mechanism, promotion of weight loss, and
      possible cardiovascular benefits (improvement of lipid profile, blood pressure, endothelial
      and myocardial function). The glucose lowering effects resulting from the inhibition of
      glucagon secretion and the gastric emptying rate could be of clinical importance in type 1
      diabetes.

      The rationale behind the use of GLP-1 analogues in the treatment of type 1 diabetes relies on
      the assumption that these drugs, in addition to their action on insulin secretion and glucose
      regulation, may be effective in preserving and even expanding the β-cell mass. This class of
      drugs may represent an entirely new approach to the treatment of type 1 diabetes, focused on
      protection and preservation of β-cells. These therapies have the opportunity to interfere
      with the disease progression if used as an early intervention, when enough β-cell mass/
      function can still be preserved or restored.

      Hypothesis:

      GLP-1 analogue (liraglutide) will improve glycemic control as measured by HbA1c in
      uncontrolled type 1 diabetic patients. The investigators expect a reduction of 1% in HbA1C
      from baseline.
