  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This retrospective analysis of de-identified data from 700 charts of consecutive patients
      from this patient population is to investigate the prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia and
      associated metabolic abnormalities in this naturalistic grouping of patients with various
      stages of cognitive loss and diagnosed with various types of dementia.

    <textblock>
      A single-center, retrospective review of the medical charts of 700 de-identified elderly
      patients who underwent evaluation and treatment for cognitive loss including analysis of:

      Laboratory values of interest: homocysteine, methylmalonic acid, CRP, BNP, CO2, TSH, Fe/TIBC,
      RPR/TPPA/FTA-ABS, and if available, folic acid and B12 levels ordered by primary care
      providers.

      Neuropsychological tests of executive function, memory and affect:

        -  Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R) or Fourth Edition (WMS-IV)

             -  Logical Memory -Delayed Recall, Scaled Score

             -  Visual Reproduction-Delayed Recall, Scaled Score

        -  Shopping List Test, Delayed Recall

        -  Trailmaking A and B Tests

        -  Verbal Absurdities subtest of the Stanford Binet, Form L-M

        -  Proverbs Test

        -  Memory Orientation Screening Test

        -  Folstein Mini-Mental State Exam

        -  Geriatric Depression Scale, 15 items

      Sub-group analysis of MRI volumetrics and PET scans when available. Sequentially pulled from
      June 1, 2009 to September 2011
