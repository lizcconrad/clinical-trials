      The investigators propose to evaluate the compliance of oral cancer therapies, particularly
      the possible link between this observance and cognitive function of patients at initiation of
      treatment. To our knowledge, this study will be among the first conducted on the issue in
      France and is an innovative approach in the management of cancer patients. The inclusion of
      cognitive dysfunction is part of a comprehensive approach to improving the quality of life
      and fully meets the objectives of both plans cancer, including those of the axis &quot;Living
      during and after cancer&quot; highlighted in the Cancer Plan
