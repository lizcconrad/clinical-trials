      The purpose of this study is to verify whether differences exist in cyclosporine levels
      between the samples collected through peripheral venous access, the catheter line used to
      infuse the drug and the line not used for infusion immediately after interrupting the drug
      infusion or five minutes after the interruption.

    <textblock>
      Cyclosporine is an immunosuppressant that prevents graft-versus-host disease, has a narrow
      therapeutic window, and causes nephrotoxicity. For cyclosporine infusion, a tunneled central
      venous access device is used; however due to the lipophilic properties of the drug, it can
      adsorb to the catheter surface and falsely raise cyclosporine concentrations in blood
      specimens. Some authors recommend sample collection through peripheral access only. Others,
      however, have shown that these can be collected through the catheter line not used to infuse
      the drug. Controversies still exist, though, regarding the best timing and blood volume to be
      discarded to collect the sample.

      The hypothesis adopted was that drug adsorption occurs in the line used for infusion.
      Therefore, there is no statistical or clinical difference between the blood sample collected
      from the peripheral venous access and from the line not used for cyclosporine infusion.
      Additionally, this difference becomes smaller when waits five minutes between the
      interruption of the infusion of the drug and the collection of the blood sample.

    <description>Blood samples were collected from the peripheral venous access, from the catheter line used to infuse the drug and from the line not used for infusion immediately after interrupting the drug infusion.
For peripheral blood collection, venous access will be established with a small gauge needle.
The discard method will be adopted for catheter lines collection. Each catheter line is washed with 20 ml of 0.9% normal saline solution, 5 mL of blood are collected and discarded. Using another syringe, the blood volume needed to perform the analysis will then be collected. Additionally, another blood sample will be collected from the catheter line not used to infuse the drug after the discard of 10 mL.</description>
