  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pressure ulcers (UPP) represent an important sanitary problem affecting mostly elderly
      immobilized persons, increasing the burden of care to professionals in the health system, as
      well as pharmaceutical spending. There are studies of the effectiveness of various products
      in the prevention of the UPP, most made in hospitals and using fundamentally composed based
      on oily hyperbecome oxygenated acids (AGHO).

      There do not exist studies realized specifically with cream of olive oil.

      AIMS:

      Principal: To verify the efficiency of a new intervention of UPP's prevention in immobilized
      patients consisting in the application of cream of olive oil. Secondary: To evaluate the cost
      - efficiency of this new intervention opposite to AGHO's application.

      To value the degree of satisfaction of the patient and his keeper with regard to the use of
      cream of olive oil.

      METHODOLOGY DESIGN: clinical Test randomized with two parallel branches. AREA: Population
      consultant of the health centers in the province of Malaga. SUBJECTS OF STUDY: Patients
      immobilized at the risk of developing UPP. INTERVENTION: Administration of cream of olive oil
      to the group of intervention and AGHO's administration to the group control. Follow-up for
      one year. VARIABLES. Principal variable: UPP's appearance. Secondary: Demographic and
      clinical data, presence of technical supports, information of the caragiver and questionnaire
      of satisfaction. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Test. Exact of Fischer. Odds's calculation ratio.
      Shapiro-Wilk's test. Parametric test t- student or test U of Mann-Whitney. Reason of the
      increase cost efficiency (ICER). Logistic regression model multivariant.

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Patients with nursing diagnosis &quot;risk of impaired skin integrity. &quot;To determine this
             risk assessment tool we will use as the Braden scale. We will include only patients
             immobilized with increased risk of pressure ulcers (score less than or equal to 16).

          -  Patients with malnutrition or suspected malnutrition. To determine this state as an
             instrument we will use Mini Nutritional Assessment Scale &quot;MNA&quot; (score 10 points or
             less)

          -  Over 18 years.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Patients refusal to participate in the study.

          -  Moved (patient no habitual residence in the health center where they make the study).

          -  Patients with plans to be out of the study area during the monitoring year.

          -  Hospitalized during the uptake phase of the sample

          -  Patient-terminal.

          -  Patient with the presence of pressure ulcers.
