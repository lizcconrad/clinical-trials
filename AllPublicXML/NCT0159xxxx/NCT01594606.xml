  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project involves testing the efficacy of an animal-assisted intervention (AAI). The AAI
      consists of a 10-week program in which adjudicated adolescents train shelter dogs and will be
      compared to a dog walking control group matched for educational content and dog contact time.
      The investigators expect that the AAI will result in improved empathy skills and that dog
      attachment will explain these findings. The investigators also explore the extent to which
      the AAI will improve internalizing and externalizing symptoms in these adolescents.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adjudicated adolescents (i.e., teens who have committed criminal offenses and are
      incarcerated in juvenile detention centers) have deficits in emotion regulation, including
      empathy skills, and are at risk for a host of poor outcomes including repeat offenses,
      internalizing symptoms (e.g., depression, anxiety), externalizing symptoms (e.g., lying,
      truancy, fighting). Many of these problems stem from a lack of secure attachment to parents
      and peers. There is a need for novel and innovative programs to help these teens develop more
      secure attachments and better empathy skills to prevent poor outcomes. One type of
      intervention is animal-assisted interventions such as dog training programs. These programs
      appear to build empathy skills in at-risk youth, which may translate into better peer
      relations, less psychological distress, and less recidivism. The goal of this study is to
      test an existing animal-assisted intervention program that is already being used in juvenile
      detention centers to determine whether it is efficacious in improving adjudicated
      adolescents' empathy skills and psychological symptoms through building a secure attachment
      to the training dog.

    <description>The Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist is a standardized measure of child behavior problems that assesses observers' and children's reports of the children's anxiety and depression (internalizing) and acting out (externalizing) behaviors.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline and 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An observational measure was created for the purposes of this study in which a trained confederate acts as a potential student for the animal-assisted intervention. The confederate will express anxiety about the program and the participants' responses will be coded by trained raters for empathic content.</description>
