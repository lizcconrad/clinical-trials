    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation
      (tDCS) on the pain associated with spinal cord injury. This study is part of the
      Spaulding-Harvard Model System. The investigators hypothesize that there will be a decrease
      in pain levels with active stimulation, when compared to sham stimulation, using a 3 week
      stimulation schedule- 1 week of stimulation (5 consecutive days) followed by 2 weeks of
      stimulation (10 consecutive days) after a 3-month follow up visit. The subject will also have
      follow ups at 2, 4 and 8 weeks after the second course of stimulation.

      If a subject receives sham during the experiment, he/she may enroll in an open-label portion
      of the study and receive 10 days of active stimulation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Over 18 years of age

          -  History of moderate to severe sublesional pain

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active alcohol or drug dependence, as self-reported

          -  A history of bipolar disorder or psychosis, as self-reported

          -  Inability to travel to the study site,

          -  Current use of any of the following anti-epileptic medications or dopaminergic
             medications known to reduce or inhibit the benefits of tDCS treatment [53]:
             carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, ropinirole (Requip), pramipexole (Mirapex),
             and cabergoline (Dostinex),

          -  The following contradictions to tDCS: implanted metal plates in the head, or deep
             brain stimulator (spinal cord implants, including baclofen pumps, are not a
             contraindication as cranial currents do not reach the spinal cord [24]).

          -  Pregnancy at time of enrollment

          -  Current use of ventilator.
