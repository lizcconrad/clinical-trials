      The purpose of this study is to assess whether in a population of patients with advanced
      colorectal cancer for which no known effective therapy is available, measuring the
      spontaneous evolution of tumoral metabolic progression index by serial FGD PET-CT and
      Diffusion MRI can show that tumor growth rate is related to the patient's outcome, and that
      serial FDG PET-CT and Diffusion MRI are able to measure it.

      Natural history of tumors is a poorly studied subject, the clinical evidence of some tumors
      aggressiveness as opposed to some other's indolent behavior has never been formally assessed
      in daily practice or in clinical studies and remains largely unpredictable. The patient's
      populations are in fact a mix between different tumoral phenotypes that while carrying the
      same apparent disease evolve with different outcomes.

      We hypothesize that,in a population of patients with advanced colorectal cancer for which no
      known effective therapy is available, measuring the spontaneous evolution of tumoral
      metabolic progression index by serial FGD PET-CT and Diffusion MRI can show that tumor growth
      rate is related to the patient's outcome, and that serial FDG PET-CT and Diffusion MRI are
      able to measure it.

      If the hypothesis is verified, this finding could:

        -  Allow to define therapeutic strategies according to the tumoral metabolic progression
           index.

        -  Limit the need for randomization in the early drug development phases as each patient
           could be considered as his own control.

        -  To stratify patients according to their baseline metabolic growth rate in randomized
           controlled trials with overall survival as an endpoint.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must have histologically confirmed colorectal cancer that is metastatic
             or unresectable and for which standard treatments do not exist or are no longer
             effective.

          -  The tumor should be refractory to all standard chemotherapy agents (fluoropyrimidines,
             irinotecan, and oxaliplatin) and anti‐EGFR monoclonal antibodies in case of wild type
             Kras (cetuximab or panitumumab) administered before study entry. Prior treatment with
             bevacizumab, regorafenib and/or aflibercept is allowed but not mandatory

          -  Participants should be candidate for a Phase I study

          -  Age equal or over 18 years.

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks.

          -  ECOG performance status ≤ 1.

          -  Participants must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

        Total bilirubin within 2 × normal institutional upper limits AST/ALT/Alk Phosphatase levels
        &lt; 5 × normal institutional upper limits Creatinine within 2 × normal institutional upper
        limits or creatinine clearance &gt; 35mL/min

          -  Women of child‐bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control, abstinence) prior to study entry during
             the assessment. For women of childbearing potential a pregnancy test (urinary or
             serum) must be performed within 7 days prior to inclusion and it must be negative.
             Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this
             study, she must inform her treating physician immediately within one month.

             procedures).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        admission into the study:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 2 weeks prior to entering
             the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, psychiatric illness or any significant disease which, in the
             investigator's opinion, would exclude the patient from the study.
