  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is a procedure where a tube is passed through the mouth or
      nose into the lungs. Fluid is squirted through the tube into a part of the lung and then
      collected for examination. It is used to detect respiratory viruses. BAL is a relatively
      invasive procedure, and researchers want to test the accuracy of other procedures that do not
      involve collecting fluid from the lungs. The nasopharynx is the area of the upper throat that
      lies behind the nose. Researchers want to see if a swab taken from this area is as accurate
      as a BAL sample.

      Objectives:

      - To see if a nasopharynx swab can be used to detect respiratory viruses as well as BAL
      samples.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 12 years of age who will have a bronchoscopy to collect a BAL sample
      to test for respiratory viruses.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history.

        -  Participants will have a BAL sample collected.

        -  Participants will then have a nasopharynx swab. The swab will be inserted into the nose,
           left in place for up to 10 seconds, and then removed

    <textblock>
      Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens can be used for the detection of respiratory viruses.
      Although bronchoscopy is relatively safe, it still has inherent risks to the subject.
      Nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens are easy to collect and are minimally invasive for the
      subject. We will use a rapid multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect respiratory
      viruses in paired BAL and NP specimens to determine if either specimen is more likely to be
      positive. The study population will include all patients undergoing bronchoscopy for clinical
      indications at the Clinical Center. This is a prospective observational study.
