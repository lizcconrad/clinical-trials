      The primary purpose of this study is to measure the response rate in participants with the
      myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET),
      or myelofibrosis (MF) when treated with LY2784544, including those who have demonstrated an
      intolerance to, failure of primary response to, or have demonstrated disease progression
      while on ruxolitinib.

             cyclosporine, diergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, and
             tacrolimus) or Cytochrome P450 2B6 enzyme (CYP2B6) (for example, cyclophosphamide,

          -  Have received a hematopoietic stem cell transplant

          -  Have a second primary malignancy that in the judgment of the Investigator and Sponsor

          -  Have an active fungal, bacterial, and/or known viral infection including human
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or viral (A, B, or C) hepatitis (screening is not

          -  Have a history of congestive heart failure with New York Heart Association (NYHA)
             Class &gt;2 (NYHA Class 1 and 2 are eligible), unstable angina, recent myocardial

             history of ventricular arrhythmia
