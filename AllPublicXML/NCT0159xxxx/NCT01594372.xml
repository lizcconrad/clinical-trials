  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators intend to conduct a prospective randomized trial to compare vaginal
      hysterectomy with uterosacral colposuspension to laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy with
      sacrocervicopexy. Both surgeries are minimally-invasive surgical standards of care for
      uterine prolapse repair. Nobody knows if one procedure is superior to the other, as they have
      not been compared directly. The investigators hypothesize that there is no difference in
      objective, subjective, or cost-effectiveness between the two procedures for up to two years
      after surgery.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Laproscopic procedure not offered at this time; will not be offered for the foreseeable, thus
    we are unable to randomize participants between the two arms.
