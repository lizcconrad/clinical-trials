  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand the effect of using oral U-relax on HPV infected
      women for vaginal environment health promotion, and the HPV DNA Test Index change from
      positive to negative. Long-term infection of HPV is associated with cervical cancer. U-relax
      contains Lactobacillus GR-1 and Lactobacillus RC-14 and has been approved of its benefits on
      treatment of BV, UTI, IBD and can improve vaginal environment health. Patients with positive
      result of HPV DNA test have no appropriate and aggressive treatment to reduce the risk of
      cervical cancer. This clinical trial tries to reveal the influence of oral U-relax and
      patients with HPV DNA test positive result.

      This study is a prospective, double blind, randomized clinical trial. Vaginal health
      screening and HPV DNA Test are carried out from 80 patients with positive HPV DNA Test after
      conization for 6 months. All these patients will participant this study during the 360-day
      trial period. All health related conditions will be monitored at the same time.
