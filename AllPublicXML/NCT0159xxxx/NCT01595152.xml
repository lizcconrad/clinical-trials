      Hypothesis:

      Objective 1: To advance the investigators understanding on the effect of solifenacin
      succinate (10 mg OD) vs. fesoterodine (8mg OD) on urinary urgency using a validated Urgency
      Severity and Impact Questionnaire (USIQ).

      Hypothesis 1.1: The severity of urgency symptoms as measured by USIQ will change differently
      in women with OAB following a 3 month treatment with solifenacin succinate (10 mg OD) vs.
      fesoterodine (8mg OD).

      Hypothesis 2.1: Condition-specific quality of life (QOL) as measured by USIQ will change
      differently in women with OAB following a 3 month treatment with solifenacin succinate (10 mg
      OD) vs. fesoterodine (8mg OD).

      Objective 2: To advance the investigators understanding on the adverse events (AE's) of
      solifenacin succinate (10 mg OD) vs. fesoterodine (8mg OD).

      Hypothesis 1.1: The severity and rate of AE's in women with OAB following a 3 month of
      treatment with solifenacin succinate (10 mg OD) vs. fesoterodine (8mg OD) will be different.

      The National Overactive Bladder Evaluation (NOBLE) Program estimated the prevalence of OAB in
      the US is nearly 17% affecting approximately 30 million adults. Sixty-one percent of adults
      with OAB also have urge urinary incontinence (UUI. Urinary urgency is a key symptom of OAB.
      Urgency may be more bothersome to patients than urinary frequency, although urinary frequency
      is often the primary focus of study in the field of OAB. This may be partially due to
      controversy surrounding how to define the term 'urinary urgency'. As currently defined,
      urgency is meant to describe an abnormal sensation that is distinguishable from the normal
      feeling of &quot;urge to void,&quot; which occurs during a normal bladder-filling cycle. Attempts to
      measure urgency are confounded by difficulties in understanding this definition in the
      context of a normal &quot;urge&quot; to void. This controversy probably arises because of the overlap
      of the English words 'urge' and 'urgency' during clinical conversation, and apparently does
      not give rise to confusion in other languages. Recently a new validated questionnaire for the
      measurement of urgency symptoms was validated[5, 6]. The USIQ consists of two parts with an
      initial filter question, designated for self-administration. The first 5 items, known as
      USIQ- severity (USIQ-S), inquires about urgency symptoms and severity, while the second part
      USIQ- quality of life (USIQ-QOL) consists of 8 questions which inquire about bother and
      condition specific QOL such as: cooping behaviors, work, commuting and travel, sleep,
      physical activities, social activities, psychological well-being, relationships and sexual
      function. Items for each scale are summed and transformed to a score ranging from 0-100.
      Higher symptom bother scores indicate increasing symptom bother, and higher USIQ-QOL scores
      indicate worse health related quality of life. The main objective of this current study is to
      compare the effect of two different anticholinergic medications on symptoms of urinary
      urgency using a validated, subjective instruments designed specifically for this purpose.

    <description>The effect of two different antochloinergic treatment on urgency symptoms will be measured by comparing USIQ scores changes in the two study arms, before and after treatment. Changes in urgency sensation will be analysed by subsiding the USIQ scopre at 2 months (second visit) from the USIQ score at baseline. Independent student t- test will be used for Comparison between the changes in USIQ score of the two groups.</description>
