  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to demonstrate a powerful new method for detecting heart disease
      that combines the proven prognostic capability of exercise stress testing with the superior
      image quality of Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CMR). The investigators hope to
      demonstrate that exercise CMR has equivalent or superior diagnostic accuracy compared to
      exercise stress SPECT for detecting obstructive artery disease.

    <description>Exercise nuclear and CMR examinations including aggregate assessment of exercise parameters, ECG findings, myocardial perfusion, segmental left ventricular wall motion (CMR only), and viability will be independently reviewed offline by a consensus of two reviewers blinded to the results of the other imaging study, and each test will be classified as either negative/adequate stress, negative/inadequate stress, positive for ischemia, or fixed abnormality/no ischemia.</description>

    <description>Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) offers superior image quality compared to echocardiography and nuclear imaging, and the ability to image both function and perfusion. Combining the superior image quality of CMR with the diagnostic information provided by exercise stress could result in a new, more accurate modality for diagnosing and evaluating coronary artery disease. This project is expected to show that CMR is at least equivalent to nuclear stress imaging and could potentially replace it in many instances, eliminating the need for radioisotope administration and the associated exposure of patients to ionizing radiation.</description>

          -  known or suspected ischemic heart disease

          -  ability to perform adequate treadmill stress

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  renal insufficiency (GFR &lt; 40)

          -  known allergy to gadolinium-based contrast or iodinated contrast (because of the
