  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Zinc supplementation has the potential to improve serum zinc levels and immunity
      of zinc deficient nursing home elderly.

      Objective: To determine the effect of zinc supplementation of 30mg/d for 3 months on serum
      zinc levels and T-cell mediated function of zinc deficient nursing home elderly.

      Design: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Outcome measures
      included change in serum zinc levels and various T-cell mediated immune factors between
      baseline and month 3.

      Hypotheses: The investigators hypothesize that zinc supplementation of 30mg/d for 3 months
      will improve serum zinc levels as well as various T-cell mediated immune factors in zinc
      deficient nursing home elderly.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Four hundred and forty-two medical charts were screened from three participating nursing
      homes; 53 nursing home elderly were eligible and therefore were screened for low serum zinc
      levels (&lt;70µg/dL). Of these, 31 (58%) had low serum zinc levels. Participants were randomized
      into either the placebo (N=16) or the zinc supplemented (N=15) group. Six participants did
      not complete the study for various reasons including refusal to take study capsules, and
      advice from their physicians; one participant in the zinc group experienced nausea on two
      consecutive days following ingestion of the zinc capsule at the beginning of the study. A
      total of 25 participants completed the study with 13 and 12 receiving the placebo and zinc
      capsules, respectively, over a period of three months
