    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects pazopanib (pazopanib hydrochloride)
      (also called VotrientÂ®) may have on MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans, blood pressure,
      and various proteins in the blood. Pazopanib is Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved
      for treating renal cell cancer. It is an agent that prevents angiogenesis, which is new blood
      vessel formation. The use of pazopanib described in this study is a standard of care, but the
      additional MRI and blood tests that will be performed are experimental

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether a K^trans rise from nadir is predictive of subsequent tumor growth.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the association between changes in mean ambulatory blood pressure
      measurements, K^trans, and tumor size changes with pazopanib therapy.

      II. To determine the association between changes in soluble vascular endothelial growth
      factor receptor 2 (sVEGFR2) measurements, K^trans, and tumor size changes with pazopanib
      therapy.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore previously described single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP's) as pharmacogenomic
      biomarkers.

      II. To model tumor growth kinetics using radiologic tumor size measurements. III. To explore
      other serum and plasma based putative biomarkers of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
      pathway inhibition.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI
      at baseline, day 8, and prior to courses 3, 5, and 7.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.
