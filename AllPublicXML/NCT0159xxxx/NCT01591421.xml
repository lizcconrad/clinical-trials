  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For the first phase of this study (phase I), the purpose will be to find the dose of a new
      drug, BKM120, that can safely be given in combination with standard dose panitumumab.

      For the second phase of this study (phase II), the purpose is to find out what effects the
      combination of BKM120 and panitumumab, in doses found to be safe in the first part of the
      study, has on patients and their colorectal cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is done by starting with doses of BKM120 at lower than the usual dose. Patients are
      given BKM120 and panitumumab and are watched very closely to see what side effects they have
      and to make sure the side effects are not severe. If the side effects are not severe, then
      more patients are asked to join the study and are given higher doses of BKM120. If severe
      toxicity is seen, doses of BKM120 and/or panitumumab doses may be lowered in subsequent
      patients. Patients joining the study later on will normally get higher doses of BKM120 than
      patients who join earlier. This will continue until a dose is found that causes severe but
      temporary side effects. Doses higher than that will not be given.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologic proof of a primary colorectal cancer which is recurrent or metastatic.

          -  Tumour must be confirmed to be K-Ras wild type (i.e. no K-Ras mutation found) by means
             of mutation analysis performed on representative samples of diagnostic tumour tissue
             by the standard regional or provincial laboratory and be eligible to receive standard
             panitumumab treatment as per local guidelines (i.e. must have failed, or have been
             unable to receive prior irinotecan, oxaliplatin and thymidylate synthase inhibitor
             therapy). Note: Archival tumour samples are acceptable for K-Ras mutation analysis.

          -  In the phase I portion of the trial, patients may have measurable OR non-measurable
             disease. Patients whose only evidence of disease progression is tumour marker
             elevation are not eligible.

          -  In the phase II portion of the trial, all patients must have measurable disease as
             defined by RECIST 1.1.

        The criteria for defining measurable disease are as follows:

        Chest X-ray ≥ 20 mm CT/MRI scan (with slice thickness of &lt; 5 mm) ≥ 10 mm → longest diameter
        Physical exam (using calipers) ≥ 10 mm Lymph nodes by CT scan ≥ 15 mm → measured in short
        axis

        Patients must have recovered from recent surgery, chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy and
        significant toxicity must have recovered to ≤ grade 2. At least 4 weeks must have elapsed
        from major surgery and radiation therapy, unless the radiation is low dose, does not
        involve mucosa and is non-myelosuppressive. Patient must have recovered (grade 0-1) from
        all reversible toxicity related to prior chemotherapy and have adequate washout from prior
        chemotherapy and investigational agents as follows: Washout period is the longest of one of
        the following:

          1. two weeks

          2. standard cycle length of prior regimen (i.e. 21 days for irinotecan q 3 weeks).

          3. 10 half-lives for investigational drugs.

        ECOG performance status of 0, 1 or 2.

          -  Laboratory Requirements: (must be done within 7 days prior to registration)
             Hematology: Absolute granulocytes (AGC) ≥ 1.0 x 109/L Platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L
             Hemoglobin ≥ 90 g/L Chemistry: Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x UNL OR Creatinine clearance ≥
             50 ml/min Bilirubin * ≤ UNL AST and ALT ≤ 3.0 x UNL Potassium ≤ UNL Calcium ≤ UNL
             Magnesium ≥ 0.5 mmol/L (may be achieved with supplementation) Blood glucose (fasting)
             &lt; 7.8 mmol/L Coagulation: INR ≤ 2 x UNL (* direct, if patient known to have Gilberts)

          -  Patient must consent to provision of, and investigator(s) must confirm access to and
             agree to submit at the request of the NCIC CTG Central Tumour Bank, a representative
             formalin fixed paraffin block of tumour tissue in order that the correlative marker
             assays may be conducted. Where local centre regulations prohibit submission of blocks
             of tumour tissue, the approval of the NCIC CTG must be sought prior to registration of
             the first patient to allow a predetermined number of slides of representative tumour
             tissue to be substituted in response to the Central Tumour Bank request. Failure to
             submit any tissue samples on request will result in the patient being considered
             ineligible. Where no previously resected or biopsied tumour tissue exists, on the
             approval of the NCIC CTG, the patient may still be considered eligible for the study.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years. (Note that the lower age limit at each centre will be determined by
             that centre's policy regarding the age at which an individual may sign their own
             consent.)

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test
             within 72 hours prior to registration. Patients of reproductive potential must agree
             to use highly effective contraception as follows:

          -  Female study subjects: during study and for 6 months after final dose of study therapy

          -  Male study subjects: during study and until 16 weeks after final dose of study
             therapy.

          -  Female partner of male study subject: during study and until 16 weeks after final dose
             of study therapy

          -  Patient consent for trial participation must be obtained according to local
             Institutional and/or University Human Experimentation Committee requirements. It will
             be the responsibility of the local participating investigators to obtain the necessary
             local clearance, and to indicate in writing to the NCIC CTG Study Coordinator that
             such clearance has been obtained, before the trial can commence in that centre.
             Because of differing requirements, standard consent forms for the trial will not be
             provided but sample forms are provided. A copy of the initial full board Research
             Ethics Board (REB) approval and approved consent forms must be sent to the central
             office. The patient must sign the consent forms prior to registration. Please note
             that the consent forms for this study must contain a statement which gives permission
             for qualified representatives of the CCTG, monitoring agencies and regulatory
             authorities to review patient records.

          -  Patients must be accessible for treatment and follow-up. Investigators must assure
             themselves the patients registered on this trial will be available for complete
             documentation of the treatment, adverse events, and follow-up. Patients enrolled in
             this trial must be treated and followed at the participating centre. This implies
             there must be a reasonable geographical limit (for example: 2 hour's driving distance)
             placed on the patients being considered for this trial.

          -  Protocol treatment is to begin within 5 working days of patient registration.
