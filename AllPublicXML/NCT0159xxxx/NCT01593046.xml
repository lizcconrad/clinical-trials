  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      LAI115428 is a Phase I, randomized, repeat dose escalation study to determine the safety,
      tolerability, and PK profile of intramuscular and subcutaneous injections of GSK1265744 in a
      long acting parenteral (LAP) formulation in healthy subjects. Subjects will be randomized to
      3 monthly dosing cohorts and 1 quarterly dosing cohort with either intramuscular or
      subcutaneous dosing. In the monthly dosing cohorts subjects will receive GSK1265744 alone for
      2 months and then in combination with TMC278 long acting parenteral (LA) for 2 months. For
      the quarterly dosing cohort, 2 quarterly intramuscular doses of GSK1265744 LAP will be given
      alone. Three dose levels of GSK1265744 will be evaluated partly in combination with TMC278 LA
      to adequately characterize the GSK1265744 LAP and TMC278 LA safety, tolerability, and PK
      profile. A total enrolment of approximately 40 healthy subjects is planned for this study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin greater than or equal to 1.5xULN
             (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct
             bilirubin &lt;35%).

          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and
             cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinically significant abnormality or laboratory
             parameters outside the reference range for the population being studied may be
             included only if the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding
             is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study
             procedures.

          -  Male or female between 18 and 64 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the
             informed consent.

          -  Females of childbearing potential with a negative pregnancy test (serum or urine) at
             screen and at Day -21, and agrees to use one of the contraception methods listed in
             the protocol for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product label or
             investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the risk of
             pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception for six
             months after the final dose of study drug.

          -  Body weight greater than or equal to 50 kg for men and greater than or equal to 45 kg
             for women and body mass index (BMI) within the range 18.5-31.0 kg/m2 (inclusive).

          -  All Study subjects should be counseled on the practice of safer sexual practices
             including the use of effective barrier methods (e.g. male condom/spermicide).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of bleeding or clotting disorders including disseminated intravascular
             coagulation, hemophilia Henoch-Schönlein purpura (allergic purpura), hereditary
             hemorrhagic telangiectasia, thrombocytopenia, thrombophilia or Von Willebrand's
             disease.

          -  High-risk behavior for HIV infection including one of the following risk factors
             within six months before entering the study (day 1): Unprotected vaginal or anal sex
             with a known HIV infected person or a casual partner, engaged in sex work for money or
             drugs, acquired a sexually transmitted disease, high risk partner currently or in the
             previous six months.

          -  A positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody
             result within 3 months of screening

          -  Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities
             (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones).

          -  A positive pre-study (screening and Day -21) drug/alcohol screen.

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study as defined in the
             protocol.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first
             dosing day.

          -  Refrain from use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, herbal and dietary
             supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a
             potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first
             dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical
             Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise
             subject safety.

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation. If heparin is used during PK
             sampling, subjects with a history or sensitivity to heparin or heparin-induced
             thrombocytopenia should not be enrolled.

          -  The subject has an underlying skin disease or disorder (i.e. infection, inflammation,
             dermatitis, eczema, drug rash, drug allergy, psoriasis, food allergy, urticaria. Mild
             cases of localized acne or folliculitis are not exclusionary.)

          -  The subject has a tattoo or other dermatological condition overlying the gluteus
             and/or abdominal region which may interfere with interpretation of injection site
             reactions.

          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period.

          -  Pregnant females as determined by positive serum or urine hCG test at screening or
             prior to dosing.

          -  Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures outlined in the protocol.

          -  Subject is mentally or legally incapacitated.

          -  The subject's systolic blood pressure is outside the range of 90-140mmHg, or diastolic
             blood pressure is outside the range of 45-90mmHg or heart rate is outside the range of
             50-100bpm for female subjects or 45-100 bpm for male subjects.

          -  History of clinically significant cardiovascular disease.
