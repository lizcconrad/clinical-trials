  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Little is known about the efficacy of intensive lifestyle therapy (i.e. increased
      physical activity and dietary changes) for the management of glycemia and cardiometabolic
      risk factors in children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes (T2DM).

      Our hypothesis is that education regarding healthy lifestyle changes will significantly
      reduce blood sugars in youth with T2DM that do not require insulin therapy. Our secondary
      hypothesis is that the intensive lifestyle therapy will cause quick and sustained reductions
      in health risk measured by body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, waist circumference, LDL
      cholesterol, serum triglycerides and apolipoprotein B.

      Youth between the ages of 10-20 years living with type 2 diabetes and not currently on
      insulin therapy will be randomly assigned to either a lifestyle intervention group or a
      control group. The lifestyle intervention group will meet 2-3 times per week for 16 weeks to
      take part in healthy living education sessions involving physical activity, healthy cooking,
      healthy gardening and how to start and sustain a healthy lifestyle change. At the beginning
      and end of the 16 weeks the investigators will measure the participants' blood sugars,
      height, weight, cholesterol, triglycerides and liver enzymes. The investigators will also
      take a picture of their kidney, heart and blood vessels using ultrasound. Those youth
      assigned to the control group will receive the 16 week intervention following their 16 week
      control period.
