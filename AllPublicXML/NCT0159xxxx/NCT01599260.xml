  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with rheumatic disease often have decreased strength, muscle mass, and bone mineral
      density due to repeated bouts of inflammation, normal effects of aging, disuse, and
      inactivity. The medications used to quell the disease process, such as prednisone, can also
      have detrimental effects on body composition, strength, and functional capacity. The
      investigators propose to investigate the feasibility, safety, and effects of resistance
      exercise in older patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and vasculitis. The unique
      resistance protocol the investigators propose involves performing movements in a slow and
      controlled fashion (i.e., no acceleration or use of momentum in the lifting and lowering of
      the resistance) to minimize force on the joints and connective tissues. This will be
      conducted in an individually-supervised environment with a new generation of exercise
      equipment that will accommodate their musculoskeletal capabilities and allow for
      reproducibility of the exercise protocol. The investigators intend to investigate the
      feasibility, safety, musculoskeletal, and psychological effects of this resistance exercise
      protocol in older patients with rheumatoid arthritis and vasculitis by testing their
      strength, body composition, functional ability, mood, and quality of life before and after
      this 16-week resistance exercise intervention.

    <description>To ensure safety and tolerance of a resistance exercise protocol for patients with systemic vasculitis or rheumatoid arthritis. We will measure disease activity before and after each exercise session to determine if there is an association with the exercise program. We will track any major (and minor) injuries which are attributed to the exercise program.</description>
