    <textblock>
      The present study aims to initially test a community dog walking intervention that addresses
      individual, interpersonal and community factors associated with dog walking. The study will
      be conducted in two cities, Worcester and Lowell, as a collaboration between investigators
      from UMass Medical School and UMass-Lowell.

    <textblock>
      This is a group randomized trial where 8 communities in Worcester and Lowell (4 per city)
      will be randomly assigned to the 6-month dog walking intervention or a standard, self-help,
      print-based physical activity control condition. Dog owners (N=120; 15 per community) will be
      recruited. The intervention includes a social networking website, monthly newsletters, twice
      monthly neighborhood dog walks and community events. The intervention will: 1) educate owners
      about the benefits of dog walking to themselves and their dog, 2) teach strategies for
      regular dog walking, 3) teach dog walking tips and provide dog training seminars, 4) promote
      self-monitoring and goal setting for dog walking, 5) provide social networking opportunities
      for dog owners and 6) promote a sense of community via participation in neighborhood dog
      walks and community events. Intervention feasibility will be assessed by measures of
      implementation success, including recruitment and retention rates, website use, intervention
      satisfaction and attendance at neighborhood walks and community events. Initial efficacy will
      be assessed via change in weekly steps measured via a pedometer from baseline to 6-months
      after baseline.
