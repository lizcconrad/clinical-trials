    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, phase I study to assess the effects of dovitinib (TKI258)
      on the pharmacokinetics of a cocktail of caffeine, diclofenac, omeprazole and midazolam in
      patients with advanced solid tumors, excluding breast cancer. The aim of this study is to
      evaluate the potential effect of dovitinib (TKI258) on the metabolism of the probe drugs
      caffeine, diclofenac, omeprazole and midazolam, which are metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2C9,
      CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 respectively (Cytochrome P450 isoenzyme), comparing the single-dose
      pharmacokinetics (AUCtlast, AUCinf and Cmax parameters) of each of the individual probe drug
      co-administered with and without multiple dose of dovitinib (TKI258) 500 mg under a 5 days on
      / 2 days off dose schedule. The study foresees two treatment phases: DDI (drug-drug
      interaction) followed by post-DDI. During the DDI phase patients receive treatment with the
      probe drug cocktail and dovitinib (TKI258). During the post-DDI phase patients may continue
      to receive treatment with dovitinib (TKI258) until disease progression (assessed by RECIST
      1.1), unacceptable toxicity, death or discontinuation from the study treatment for any other
      reason.
