    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the effect of partial and complete sleep
      deprivation on exercise heat tolerance. Twelve healthy young male volunteers will participate
      in the study. They will arrive to our lab four times, in each visit the will undergo VO2 test
      and Heat Tolerance Test (HTT) after sleeping different amount of hours.

      The volunteers will arrive to our lab fout times- During their first visit they will go
      through a VO2 max test in order to evaluate their aerobic fitness, and their physiological
      efficiency will be measured. During their second visit they will go through an exercise heat
      tolerance test according to our validated protocol after a full night sleep. During the third
      and fourth visit they will go through an exercise heat tolerance test and a measurement of
      their physiological efficiency after a partial and complete sleep deprivation, respectively.
      The physiological tests will take place in the heat chamber that is located at the Heller
      Institute of Medical Research. The results will be then analyzed, and a comparison between
      the physiological measurements during the heat tolerance tests and the physiological
      efficiency tests after the various sleep conditions will be performed.
