      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of TT-173 in
      healthy volunteers after tooth extraction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As the TT-113 has been cleared for use as a topical hemostatic agent, the proposed study will
      further investigate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of TT-113 in healthy volunteers
      after tooth extraction.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects to be undertaken for the simple extraction of at least one tooth (incisor,
             canine, premolar, molar different of third molar) that cause bloody wound, located in
             the upper or inferior maxillary area of the mouth either

          -  Subjects who are able and willing to provide written and signed informed consent

          -  All subjects willing to use a medically accepted form of contraception from the time
             of consent to completion of all follow-up study visits. Negative pregnancy test result
             in the screening visit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with personal and family history that could affect correct hemostasis

          -  Subjects with any clinically-significant coagulation disorder including including
             deficiencies in any of coagulation factors, thrombocytopenia and vascular purpura

          -  Subject with hipersensivity of TT-173 of any of its components or has a known allergy.

          -  Subjects who are unable to adequately follow or understand the instructions and
             requirements of the study.

          -  Subjects that are not fully free to give informed consent, or any other obstacle in
