  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn about possible changes in brain anatomy and function,
      and in thinking abilities, such as memory skills, in patients with ovarian cancer who receive
      treatment with chemotherapy. Cancer patients treated with chemotherapy may experience changes
      in thinking abilities, and these may interfere with quality of life. Most of the research to
      date has involved patients with breast cancer, and there are no studies in women with ovarian
      cancer looking at at treatment-related changes in brain anatomy and function.

    <description>will undergo structural MRI scans on a Siemens 3T Magnetom Tim Trio research scanner located at the Citigroup Biomedical Imaging Center at Weill Cornell Medical Center (WCMC), which is adjacent to the MSKCC campus. Three to five T1 weighted sagittal slices are collected to localize the anterior and posterior commissures. Functional imaging: Blood Oxygenation Level-Dependent (BOLD) contrast imaging, which reflects changes in venous deoxyhemoglobin associated with neuronal activity, will be used.</description>

    <description>Patients will undergo a brief neuropsychological test battery at MSKCC or at Citigroup Biomedical Imaging Center at WCMC. All subjects will undergo a neuropsychological evaluation including standardized tests of attention and working memory, executive functions, and memory considering that these domains have been shown to be particularly sensitive to cancer treatment-induced cognitive dysfunction.</description>

    <description>Will undergo structural and functional MRI scans on a Siemens 3T Magnetom Tim Trio research scanner located at the Citigroup Biomedical Imaging Center at Weill Cornell Medical Center (WCMC), which is adjacent to the MSKCC campus. Patients do not undergo routine clinical brain MRIs as part of their assessment and treatment, and the brain MRI scans to be performed in this study are for research purposes only. The MRI scan takes approximately 60 minutes to complete, and about 15 minutes will be required for instructions prior to initiating the study. The MRI studies will be reviewed by a neuroradiologist (Dr. Karimi) to rule out gross structural CNS abnormalities; in case any abnormalities considered to require clinical follow-up are detected, the subject will be contacted and referred for follow-up with their treating physician. Patients will undergo a brief neuropsychological test battery at MSKCC or at Citigroup Biomedical Imaging Center at WCMC</description>
