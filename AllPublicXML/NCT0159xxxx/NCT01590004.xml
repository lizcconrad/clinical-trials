  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to develop a technical description of lumbar medial branch ablation using the
      LumbarCool system. The procedure uses cooled radiofrequency (cooled-RF) technology in
      treating patients with diagnosed lumbar facet joint pain.

      This is a prospective, open-label, single center clinical study to be enrolled at George
      Washington University Medical Center. This study will consist of 10 patients and each patient
      will be assessed at pre-treatment, pre-discharge, and at 1 and 3 months post treatment.
      Outcomes to be evaluated include: pain severity, disability, and the occurrence of adverse
      events.

    <description>The primary outcome is to confirm acute safety of the procedure utilizing the neurological exam.
The following outcome measures will also be used to confirm there are no safety concerns at one month and 3 months follow-up visits:
Pain intensity using the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS)
Change in medication usage
Assessment of adverse device effects, including neurological exam (light touch/pin prick, strength, straight leg test, gait, heel to toe/straight-line walking, heel to shin) (immediately post procedure, 1 month and 3 months).</description>
