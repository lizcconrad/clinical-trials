  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the influence of insulin resistance on
      drug metabolism and response in obese subjects. The investigators hypothesize that expression
      of adiponectin (a hormone secreted by fat tissue), and specific variants in the adiponectin
      gene can predict the insulin resistance and drug response among obese subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The following study will hypothesizes that insulin resistance causes changes in drug
      metabolism, elimination, and effect. We will differentiate the insulin resistant phenotype
      amongst obese individuals on the basis of both laboratory (fasting insulin, triglycerides,
      fasting glucose) analysis, and quantitative and qualitative adiponectin expression. We will
      determine the effect of insulin resistance on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of
      anesthetic induction agents and opioids, using propofol and fentanyl as examples.

    <measure>plasma concentration of drugs fentanyl and propofol</measure>
    <time_frame>measured for 12 hours (beginning of anesthesia to 12 hours after)</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma concentration over time will be measured and modeled in order to calculate drug clearance, volume of distribution, area under the curve, and micro rate constants.
Knowledge of these variables will allow safer administration of anesthetic drug administration in the obese population.</description>

    <measure>Adiponectin plasma protein levels</measure>
    <time_frame>measured once (immediately before the operation)</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will measure specific levels of the protein adiponectin in the blood, to determine if quantitative expression of adiponectin can predict insulin resistance in obesity and drug metabolism and response.</description>

    <measure>Adiponectin gene polymorphisms</measure>
    <time_frame>measured once per study (immediately before the operation)</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will look at specific genetic variants of the adiponectin gene to determine if expression of specific variants can predict insulin resistance and changed in drug response and metabolism.</description>

    <description>Propofol and Fentanyl will be administered to all subjects. All subjects will have blood drawn to determine pharmacokinetic variables. Processed EEG will be used to determine pharmacodynamics. Plasma samples will be used to ascertain adiponectin levels and for DNA sampling for analysis of adiponectin single nucleotide polymorphisms.</description>

    <description>Propofol will be administered to all patients via infusion at a dose of 2 mg/kg lean body weight/minute. The infusion will stop once loss of consciousness is reached. Fentanyl will be administered via target controlled infusion to achieve a plasma concentration of 2 ng/ml.</description>
