      The participants were allocated in the study by block randomization and double blind. In
      experiment-group was treated with Ayurved Siriraj Prasaplai and control-group was treated
      with placebo (non-active agent). Both of drug was made in the same appearance of capsule
      (size and color). The participants have to start the drug when they have menstruation after
      that the dosage is 2 capsules for 3 times per day (after-meal) continue to 3 days. The
      participant have to record pain score (minimal/maximal/mean score) and multidimensional score
      in daily card, side effect and satisfaction. If the participant couldn't tolerate the pain,
      they could break the pain with mefenamic acid. They have record number of mefenamic acid
      which they used too. This study evaluate in only one cycle. After complete record, the
      participant come back to investigator for sending the report.
