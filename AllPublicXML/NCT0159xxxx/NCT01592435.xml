  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study objective is to acquire composite images generated by the Carestream Long Length
      Imaging (LLI) software and demonstrate that the images stitched using the Carestream LLI
      software and the images stitched using a approved predicate device are acceptable for
      clinical use.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of subject enrollment to collect images in a clinical setting, followed by
      a review of the stitched images by radiologists or qualified orthopedic surgeons to assess
      overall usability of the composite images.

      This study includes clinical data collection of individual (raw and processed) and composite
      DR images from a Carestream device using alpha rotation to acquire the images. There is no
      subject involvement other than obtaining informed consent in order to use patient images and
      Case Record Forms (CRF), including supporting radiology reports. This study has no effect on
      clinical treatment and no foreseen risks to enrolled subjects.

      The predicate software is currently in place at the sites. Carestream will harvest that data
      and reconstruct with investigational software offsite. A comparison reader study will be
      performed upon completion of data collection.

      Please note this study is considered to be observational because there were no imaging of
      subject using investigational device. Subjects requiring standard of care diagnostic images
      were exposed using the commercially available Cedara system. The images captured on the
      Cedara system were then re-processed using the Carestream investigational software. Subjects
      gave informed consent for Carestream to reprocess their image data. They did not require any
      additional imaging using the investigational device.
