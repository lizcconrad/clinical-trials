      The primary aim of this study is to test the effects of excitation of ventral striatal
      circuitry via DBS (e.g. DBS-on versus DBS-off) on reward motivation. The investigators
      predict that stimulation will increase subject willingness to expend effort for rewards and
      facilitate motivation for reward learning. The investigators further predict that individual
      differences in the effects of DBS on reward motivation as will be associated with effects of
      DBS treatment on anhedonic symptoms.

      The study will take place at a clinical office in the Charlestown Navy Yard (CNY), and will
      consist of one 4 or 4.5-hour visit. Study staff will schedule a convenient time for patients
      to arrive, or the research visit may be paired with a regularly scheduled DBS programming
      visit. A member of the Division of Neurotherapeutics authorized to manipulate DBS programming
      will turn the device on and off during the study. The subject's therapeutic parameters of the
      DBS system will not be changed. The subject will be asked to complete four self-report
      questionnaires: the Temporal Experience of Pleasure questionnaire, the Chapman Anhedonia
      Questionnaire, the Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSS) and the Mood and Anxiety Symptom
      Questionnaire (MASQ). Following these questionnaires, a member of the study staff will teach
      the subjects to perform the following tasks on the computer:

      Effort Expenditure for Rewards Task (EEfRT) To measure motivation to work for rewards, we
      will use the Effort Expenditure for Rewards Task (EEfRT or &quot;effort&quot;). The EEfRT is a
      multi-trial computer-based task that assess an individual's willingness to expend effort for
      the chance to earn monetary rewards developed by Michael Treadway and David Zald at
      Vanderbilt University (Treadway et al., 2009). On each trial, subjects are given an
      opportunity to choose between two different task difficulty levels in order to obtain
      monetary rewards. For all trials, subjects must make repeated manual button presses in a set
      period of time. Each button press raises the level of a virtual &quot;bar&quot; viewed onscreen by the
      subject. Subjects will be eligible to win the money allotted for each trial if they are able
      to raise the bar to the &quot;top&quot; within the prescribed time period. This button-press task has
      two levels of difficulty: referred to henceforth as the 'hard task' or 'easy task'.
      Successful completion of hard task trials requires the subject to make 100 button presses,
      using the non-dominant pinky finger within 30 seconds, while successful completion of easy
      task trials requires the subject to make 30 button presses, using the dominant index finger
      within 10 seconds.

      For easy task choices, subjects are eligible to win the same amount on each trial if they
      successfully complete the task. For hard task choices, subjects are eligible to win an amount
      that varies per trial. Subjects are not guaranteed to win the stated reward if they complete
      the task; some trials are 'win' trials, in which the subject receives the stated reward
      amount, while others are 'no win' trials, in which the subject receives no money for that
      trial. To help subjects determine which trials are more likely to be win trials, subjects are
      provided with probability cues at the beginning of each trial. Trials have three levels of
      probability: 88% probability of being a win trial, 50% and 12%. There are equal proportions
      of each probability level across the experiment. Each level of probability appears once in
      conjunction with each level of reward value for the hard task.

      At the beginning of the task, subjects are provided with a detailed set of instructions, and
      an opportunity to play 4 practice trials. Subjects are then told that they will have twenty
      (20) minutes to play as many trials as they can. Easy Task choices take approximately 15
      seconds, whereas Hard Task choices take approximately 30 seconds. Therefore, the number of
      trials that the subject is able to play will depend in part on the choices that she makes.
      This means that making more Hard Task trials early-on in the experiment will result in fewer
      trials total, which may mean that the subject does not get a chance to play high-value,
      high-probability trials that could appear towards the end of the playing time. This trade-off
      is explained clearly to the subject. The goal of this trade-off is to ensure that neither a
      strategy of always choosing the easy or the hard option can lead to optimal performance on
      the task. Moreover, the complexity of variables (with varying monetary reward levels,
      probability, and loss of time for future trials), does not lend itself to a formal
      calculation of an optimal response selection, forcing Subjects to make a relatively rapid
      decision, that we believe taps individual differences in the willingness to expend effort for
      a given level of expected reward value.

      At the end of the task, two trials are randomly selected that will be added to the subject's
      compensation as a reward incentive. Subjects therefore may earn additional funds in incentive
      performance compensation each time they complete the EEfRT.

      Clock Task The &quot;clock task&quot; is an additional reward task that assesses reward learning
      developed by Michael Frank and colleagues (Moustafa et al., 2008; Frank et al., 2009). For
      this task, participants observe a clock arm that completes a revolution over the course of 5
      seconds, and participants are instructed to press a key to stop the clock at any time in an
      attempt to win points. The amount of points won varies depending on RT, and participants must
      use trial-and-error strategies to learn when to stop the clock so as to maximize points
      received. To prevent subjects form explicitly learning reward values associated with a
      specific location on the clock face, reward values at any given point along the clock face
      are randomized within +/- 5 points. At the end of the task, subjects may redeem points for a
      small amount of additional compensation, each time they complete the task. This task takes
      approximately 15 minutes to complete.

      30 minutes after turning OFF DBS stimulation, participants will either remain in the OFF
      condition or will have the DBS turned ON, depending on their counter-balanced condition
      assignment. Subject assignment will alternate sequentially. Subjects will complete the tasks
      above in the first condition. Following task completion, subjects will have DBS stimulation
      turned OFF or ON (again, depending on condition assignment). After 30 minutes, participants
      will complete the same tasks in the second condition. Following retesting, participants that
      were in the OFF condition will return to ON DBS stimulation.

      We will be using the implanted pulse generator, so it is not possible to deliver an unsafe
      current. Because we are not changing the therapeutic parameters of stimulation, subjects
      should not experience and adverse side effects. The computer will register the subject's
      performance.

      Electroencephalography recordings (EEG) will be acquired during performance of the
      aforementioned tasks. Continuous EEG data will be sampled at a maximum of 1024Hz using a
      64-electrode cap. Eye movement artifacts will be assessed using bipolar electrodes.

      Patients with just major depressive disorder or obsessive compulsive disorder will also be
      recruited as a control group for the patients with deep brain stimulation.
