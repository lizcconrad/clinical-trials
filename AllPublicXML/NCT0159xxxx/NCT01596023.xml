  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Breathe Ventilator is a lightweight, wearable ventilator that has received U.S. FDA
      clearance for use in patients with respiratory difficulty. The investigators believe that the
      Breathe NIOV system will reduce the work of the diaphragm and breathing by providing added
      tidal volume and oxygen. This will be a study in 14 patients with severe-to-very severe
      chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) to assess their work of breathing while using the
      NIOV system as measured by esophageal and stomach pressures.
