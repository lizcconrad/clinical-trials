  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dental services for large sectors of the population of the Western Cape (WC) Province of
      South Africa (SA) has been, and continues to be, limited to low-cost treatment options and
      emergency services, such as extractions at public health clinics. Replacement of missing
      teeth for the disadvantaged majority of the population is provided almost exclusively at the
      dental teaching institutions. Loss of teeth in the WC Province is, as elsewhere, the result
      of disease and the lack of restorative care and then having these replaced by a removable
      partial denture, if the patient can afford it Null Hypothesis: The daily functional needs and
      quality of life of partially dentate adult patients with a reduced posterior dental arch and
      /or a Shortened Dental Arch (SDA) will not be satisfied nor improved by replacing the
      posterior teeth with a removable prosthesis.

      The aim of this research is to determine whether the daily functional needs and the quality
      of life of partially dentate adult patients with a reduced posterior dental arch will be
      satisfied and improved without having the posterior teeth replaced with a removable
      prosthesis, as compared to having the use of such prosthesis.

      Objectives: To conduct a randomized controlled trial amongst partially dentate adult patients
      with a reduced posterior dental arch (3-5 pairs of posterior occluding pairs of teeth) and
      where these patients will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: one group would be
      provided with a metal- based removable partial denture (RPDP) to replace the posterior teeth,
      the other will receive no treatment.

      Daily functioning ability and patient satisfaction between the groups (with/without RPDP)
      would then be compared.
