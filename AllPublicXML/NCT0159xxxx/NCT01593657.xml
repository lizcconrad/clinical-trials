  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to understand if women undergoing surgery for a
      suspected gynecologic malignancy are interested in participating in a Mindful Movement and
      Breathing program and what the effects of this program are on women and the surgery-related
      symptoms they experience. Mindful Movement and Breathing programs may be effective for easing
      distress, post-surgical pain, and other symptoms of surgical procedures.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility of implementing and evaluating a Mindful Movement and Breathing Program among women undergoing gynecologic surgery for a suspected malignancy (recruitment, retention, adherence, and program evaluation and acceptability rates)</measure>
    <time_frame>4-5 days</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of participants who participated in all YST sessions and those who completed all assessments will be computed and compared to those with incomplete data by demographic characteristics. We will model the relationship between adherence and baseline scores of the measures, as well as change in scores. We will also calculate the proportions and 95% confidence intervals of the items that measure program evaluation and intervention to the Clinical Studies Coordinator, nurses and yoga instructor.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Immediate effects of the Mindful Movement and Breathing program on reducing postsurgical pain, psychological distress and lung function</measure>
    <time_frame>4-5 days</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using Immediate Effect Visual Analog Scales (VAS) of pain and distress and percent change in inspiratory capacity as assessed with a Volumetric Incentive Spirometer. Assessed for each measure by day using a paired t-test and overall using a mixed effects model on the pre-post change in the measure over time.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Collect data on measures that will be used to evaluate the efficacy of the Mindful Movement and Breathing program in a future larger randomized controlled trial</measure>
    <time_frame>4-5 days</time_frame>
    <description>means and standard deviations of the measures will be calculated to inform sample size calculations for a future study, and to provide descriptive statistics of the sample population.</description>
