  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this open-label monocentric explorative pilot trial the objective is to show the
      biodistribution of TNFα by administration of radiolabeled anti-TNFα in patients with active
      rheumatoid arthritis and spondylarthropathy. The anti-TNFα used in this trial is certolizumab
      pegol (Cimzia®), a pegylated Fab'-fragment of a monoclonal antibody with high specificity for
      TNFα. Certolizumab pegol will be radiolabeled with 99mTechnetium. The aim of this study is to
      show the TNFα triggered inflammation process in the inflamed joints, especially in patients
      who have very early joint damage where currently other imaging methods such as X-rays are not
      sensitive enough for detection.

Certolizumab pegol (Cimzia®) is an engineered humanized monoclonal antibody Fab' fragment with specificity for human TNF-α, manufactured in E. coli. The antibody fragment is subsequently purified and conjugated with high molecular weight polyethylene glycol (PEG) (40kDa). Lyophilized Cimzia® will be conjugated with S-HYNIC (a bifunctional chelator). The conjugate will be radiolabeled with Tc-99m by adding 0.1 mg Tricine, 0.01 mg SnSO4 and 750 MBq Tc-99m pertechnetate. A dose of 750 MBq Tc-99m Cimzia® will be injected intravenously.</description>
