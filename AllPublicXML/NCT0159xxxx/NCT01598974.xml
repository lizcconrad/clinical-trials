  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acupuncture has been used for many years to help relieve pain. However, it is not clear how
      acupuncture works. We are doing this study to learn about the effects of different forms of
      acupuncture on chronic low back pain. We are interested in learning about brain activity
      during pain. We plan to look at brain activity at the beginning and the end of the study,
      after 6 sessions of acupuncture.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Volunteers 18-60 years of age.

          -  Meet the Classification Criteria of the chronic LBP (having low back pain for more
             than 6 months), as determined by the referring physician.

          -  At least 4/10 clinical pain on the 11-point LBP intensity scale.

          -  Patients must be able to provoke or exacerbate their chronic LBP using our calibrated
             exercise-like maneuver.

          -  Must have had a prior evaluation of their low back pain by a health care provider,
             which may have included radiographic studies. Documentation of this evaluation will be
             sought from Partners or outside medical records and kept in the subject's research
             record.

          -  At least a 10th grade English-reading level; English can be a second language provided
             that the patients feel they understand all the questions used in the assessment
             measures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Specific causes of back pain (e.g. cancer, fractures, spinal stenosis, infections),

          -  Complicated back problems (e.g. prior back surgery, medicolegal issues),

          -  Possible contraindications for acupuncture (e.g. coagulation disorders, cardiac
             pacemakers, pregnancy, seizure disorder), and conditions that might confound
             acupuncture intervention effects or interpretation of results (e.g. severe
             fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis).

          -  Conditions making acupuncture difficult (e.g. paralysis, psychoses),

          -  Prior acupuncture treatment for back pain; 1 year wait for any other type.

          -  The intent to undergo surgery during the time of involvement in the study.

          -  History of cardiac, respiratory, or nervous system disease that, in Dr. Wasan's
             judgment, precludes participation in the study because of a heightened potential for
             adverse outcome. For example: asthma or claustrophobia.

          -  Presence of any contraindications to MRI scanning. For example: cardiac pacemaker,
             metal implants, fear of closed spaces, pregnancy.

          -  Involvement in workmen's compensation or disability claims.

          -  Radicular pain extending below the knee.

          -  Active substance abuse disorders within the last 24 months, based on subject
             self-report.

          -  Use of more than 60 mg morphine equivalent prescription opioids or steroids for pain.
