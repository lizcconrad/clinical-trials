      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility and acceptability of an utilizing
      an adapted form (IPT-SMD)of a psychosocial intervention, Interpersonal Psychotherapy for
      Depressed Adolescents, for youth with severe mood dysregulation (SMD).

      The investigators hypothesize that retention rates will be &gt;80%,satisfaction scores will
      average 6 (high) on a 7 point satisfaction scale, and that youth who receive the IPT-SMD
      intervention will have overall improvement in SMD symptoms.
