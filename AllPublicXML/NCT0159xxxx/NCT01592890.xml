    <textblock>
      This single-center, open-label study will assess the excretion balance, pharmacokinetics and
      metabolism of oral [14C]-labeled RO4917523 in healthy male volunteers. Subjects will receive
      a single oral dose of [14C]-labeled RO4917523 and an intravenous tracer dose of [13C]-labeled
      RO4917523 on Day 1. In-clinic period will be up to 18 Days. Anticipated time on study is up
      to 15 weeks.
