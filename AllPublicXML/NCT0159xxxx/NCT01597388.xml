    <measure>Assessment of safety and tolerability of AZD2014, when given in combination with fulvestrant, by assessment of: adverse events, clinical chemistry and haematology laboratory parameters, ECG data, vital signs and physical examination.</measure>
    <time_frame>From screening until the end of the follow up period, an expected average of 6 months</time_frame>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Determination of the steady state/multiple dose PK profile of AZD2014 in combination with fulvestrant by assessments including:maximum plasma concentration of AZD2014 (Cmax),time to Cmax and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC).</measure>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Determination of the minimum plasma concentration at steady state of fulvestrant when administered in combination with AZD2014.</measure>
    <time_frame>Samples will be obtained on Day 29 and Day 57 of multiple dosing</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Determination of the single dose PK profile of AZD2014,by assessments including: maximum plasma concentration (Cmax),time to Cmax,terminal rate constant half life,area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-12 and AUC0-24).</measure>
    <time_frame>At multiple time-points: for continuous dosing, on the day of single dosing (up to 5 days prior to the start of multiple dosing); for Day 1 &amp; 2 intermittent, on the first dose of week 3; for Day 1 &amp; 4 intermittent, on the first day of dosing.</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Obtain a preliminary assessment of the anti-tumour activity of AZD2014, when given in combination with fulvestrant, by evaluation of tumour response using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST Version 1.1)</measure>
