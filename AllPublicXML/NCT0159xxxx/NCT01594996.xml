      The purpose of this retrospective observational study is to evaluate the characteristics of
      patients receiving Seroquel XR as treatment for their Major Depressive Disorder. The study
      will also investigate how the medication is used for these patients and if there are any
      differences in drug utilisation between the included countries. The study is observing
      patients initiating Seroquel XR during a 9 month period corresponding to 3 to 12 months
      following the launch of the product in each country for the MDD indication. A drug
      utilisation questionnaire will be used to collect study data from patients' medical records.
