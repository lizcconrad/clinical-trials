  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Though partner notification is mandatory to perform of Chlamydia trachomatis infected
      individuals in Sweden, there was a 10-15% annually increase of reported cases between 1997
      and 2007 indicating that partner notification may not be effective in preventing
      transmission. The investigators wanted to determine whether there was any difference in time
      between home-sampling and clinical testing as a tool of partner notification measured from
      eliciting of partners to date of testing.

    <description>Conventional mode of contact tracing where the partners were asked by either the index patient or demanded by the counsellor to attend a clinic for C. trachomatis testing. The date of testing for chlamydia of the study subject i e a sexual partner to a chlamydia infected index patient was noted. Those partners being C trachomatis positive were referred to the STD-clinic for contact tracing and following the same study arm a the index patient.</description>

    <description>The intervention: Self-sampling of sexual partners to infected index patient for chlamydia by urine test or vaginal sampling at home. They sent the kit tube to a microbiological laboratorium for analysis. The test kit was sent by post by the counsellor at the STD-clinic or distributed via the index patient. The partner in this arm was informed about the test result from the STD-clinic and those tested C trachomatis positive were given an appointment for treating and contact tracing as soon as possible. Their partners were not randomised but following the same mode. The days from the counselling conversation with the index patient to the date of testing was measured and compared with partners tested following arm 1 mode.</description>
