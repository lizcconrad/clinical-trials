  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Military operations and training situations present many physical and psychological
      challenges for service members to adapt to and overcome. The challenges of these changing
      conditions necessitate having to cope with stress, which is seen as the negative perceptions,
      feelings, and emotions that manifest from the subjective physical and/or mental strain on
      life processes. In addition, service members are returning from deployments having gone
      through traumatic experiences that can develop into posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD),
      depression or other serious conditions. The Surface Warfare Independent Duty Corpsman (IDC)
      School is an example of a training environment where some students may be entering the
      program with symptoms of PTSD, which may preclude or make it more difficult for them to
      perform well. Autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysregulation has been observed in patients with
      PTSD and those experiencing chronic stress, such that there is more arousing, sympathetic
      input to the heart than calming, parasympathetic input, which is usually the dominant
      division of the ANS involved in controlling one's heart rate. The IDC training program is an
      example of an environment where the service member is expected to excel while being subjected
      to multiple sources of stress. The fast tempo coupled with performance expectations may
      induce stress and actually inhibit learning. The Institute of HeartMath has developed the
      Coherence Advantage program which teaches one to self-regulate their emotions while focusing
      on breathing to compliment the active process of self-regulation. In conjunction, the emWave
      Personal Stress Reliever allows the user to receive heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback,
      hence giving the user the opportunity to self-regulate their ANS through breathing and
      self-regulation techniques. The proposed study will test the effectiveness of the Coherence
      Advantage program versus progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) in reducing stress
      symptomatology among Surface Warfare IDC students. The effectiveness of these two different
      interventions will be compared on outcomes of PTSD, depression, anxiety, sleep quality,
      perceived stress, attrition, and class performance.
