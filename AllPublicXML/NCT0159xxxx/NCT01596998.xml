  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the effect of the addition of vasoconstrictor in the
      plasma concentrations achieved and the extent of the transversus abdominis plane block in
      healthy male volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Use of TAP blocks, decreases use of opioids and reduces pain scores during the postoperative
      period after surgeries involving the anterior abdominal wall. However, the information
      regarding the sensitive range of the blockade and its duration is still limited. Since that
      the area of administration is an intermuscular plane, it is possible to infer a large area of
      absorption. Knowing plasma concentrations is essential to balance the usefulness of this
      technique with potential systemic toxicity associated with its use.

      As an additional effect, clinically, the use of vasoconstrictors may prolong the duration of
      the blockade significantly, depending on the drug used and site of administration. To date,
      no studies evaluating the effect of the addition of vasoconstrictor both in the plasma
      concentrations achieved, and the quality, extent and duration of the TAP block.

    <description>The subjects were randomized to receive a unilateral TAP block. This was realized using a sterile technique, guided by ultrasound. Two operators with experience in ultrasound-guided regional blocks performed all procedures. A high-resolution linear U.S. transducer (L38x/10-5 MHz Sonosite M-Turbo®, Bothell, WA) and a Stimuplex 100 mm needle, 20 gauge (B. Braun Stimuplex, Melgusen, Germany) were used. After obtaining a clear view of the blocking plane, between internal oblique and transverse muscles, 20 ml of levobupivacaine 0.25% with 5 µg/mL epinephrine were injected.</description>

    <description>Standard anesthetic monitoring was used, including continuous electrocardiogram, non invasive blood pressure and peripheral oxygen saturation. Later, under local anesthesia a permeable venous line and an arterial line were installed for blood sampling measures to determine local anesthetic plasma levels.</description>

    <description>The extent of sensory block was measured by assessment of temperature, soft and hard touch using alcohol, cotton and pin prick respectively. These measurements were made every 10 minutes during the first hour and every 30 minutes to complete 4 hours.</description>
