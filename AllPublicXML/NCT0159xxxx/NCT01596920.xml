    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the present study is to further establish in a randomized controlled
      trial, the safety and efficacy of weekly Grafix® administration versus control in patients
      with chronic diabetic foot ulcers. The primary endpoint is complete wound closure of the
      index wound, defined as 100% re-epithelialization as determined by the Investigator.

      Grafix® is a product regulated for use in the US by the FDA as a Human Cellular and Tissue
      Based Product (HCT/P) under Title 21 CFR Part 1271.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treatment indication is for chronic, diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) between 1cm2 and 15cm2
      located below the malleoli on the plantar or dorsal surface of the foot. Patients must have
      confirmed Type I or Type II Diabetes.

      Patients will receive treatment every week for 12 weeks duration in the Single-Blind
      Treatment phase of the trial.

      Patients who receive Grafix® or control will be evaluated for primary efficacy up to 84 days,
      and for safety and wound re-occurrence for 84 days after wound closure. Patients in the
      control group whose wounds are not closed at the end of treatment may be offered Grafix® in
      an Open-Label Treatment phase. The Open-Label Treatment phase can last up to an additional 84
      days.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Between 18 years and 80 years of age inclusive, as of the date of screening

          2. Confirmed diagnosis of Type I or Type II Diabetes

          3. An Index Ulcer defined as chronic (presence of wound for &gt; 4 weeks) but not present
             for more than 52 weeks at the Screening Visit

          4. Index Ulcer is located below the malleoli on the plantar or dorsal surface of the foot

          5. The Index Ulcer is between 1cm2 and 15 cm2 at the Screening Visit

          6. The Index Ulcer extends into the dermis or subcutaneous tissue without evidence of
             exposed muscle, tendon, bone, or joint capsule

          7. Wound is free of necrotic debris
