  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a 1-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, trial to
      evaluate the efficacy of an IV infusion of magnesium sulfate on symptoms of treatment
      resistant mild and moderate depression in 20 males and females (21-70 years of age).
      Participants will be assessed at screening/baseline, day 1, day 2, day 7, and day 8. Each
      subject will be randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive either IV infusion of
      magnesium sulfate or 5% dextrose followed by a washout period of 5 days then crossover to
      receive either IV infusion of 5% dextrose or magnesium sulfate.

      Purpose:

        1. To determine the magnesium deficient status in treatment-resistant mild and moderate
           depression patients via 24-hour urine magnesium assessment before and after IV magnesium
           infusion.

        2. Correlation of intracellular magnesium (EXATEST), urine magnesium, and serum magnesium
           as well as sensitivity to the IV magnesium infusion.

        3. To assess the effectiveness of magnesium sulfate infusion on treatment resistant mild
           and moderate depression patients.

      Objectives:

      Primary:

        1. To investigate the magnesium deficient status in treatment-resistant mild and moderate
           depression patients via assay of 24-hour urine magnesium, blood magnesium, and EXATEST
           of intracellular magnesium of epithelial cells before and after IV infusion.

        2. To assess the effectiveness of the magnesium sulfate infusion on the mean change in
           scores on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and the Patient Health Questionnaire
           (PHQ-9) for depression.

      Secondary:

      1. To correlate the levels of magnesium with the scores on the Hamilton Rating Scale for
      Depression and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for depression.
