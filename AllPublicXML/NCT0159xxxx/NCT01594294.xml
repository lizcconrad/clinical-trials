      The purpose of this study was to assess and compare the effect of the repeated usage of 2
      different care systems (one hydrogen peroxide based cleaning and disinfecting system and one
      PHMB containing multipurpose system) with ACUVUE® 2® and AIR OPTIX® AQUA contact lenses worn
      on a daily wear basis for a 3-month period.

      This study was divided into 2 periods, a Screening Phase and an Investigational Phase. During
      the Screening Phase, subjects were fitted and dispensed with either ACUVUE® 2® (for current
      hydrogel wearers) or AIR OPTIX® AQUA (for current silicone hydrogel wearers) contact lenses
      and used COMPLETE® MPS Easy Rub® Formula to clean and disinfect their lenses. At the
      completion of the Screening Phase, the symptomatic status of the subjects was re-assessed.
      Those subjects who qualified proceeded to the Investigational Phase and were dispensed with
      new pair of study contact lenses identical to the lenses they wore during the Screening Phase
      to use in conjunction with the allocated study care product, CLEAR CARE® /AOSEPT® Plus or
      ReNu MultiPlus®.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximum Papillae</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0), Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>Eyelid papillae (bumps on the inner eyelid) were recorded separately for three zones of the upper lid and overall for the lower lid on a 5-point forced choice scale: 0 = None; 1 = Slight (diffuse papillae); 2 = Mild (diffuse &amp; tufts papillae); 3 = Moderate (moderate &amp; tufts papillae); 4 = Severe (giant papillae). The maximum value represents the worse grade in any zone. Both eyes were included in the model for analysis. Contact lenses were not worn for this assessment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximum Eyelid Hyperaemia</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0), Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>Eyelid hyperaemia (redness) was recorded separately for three zones of the upper lid and overall for the lower lid on a 5-point forced choice scale: 0 = Clear; 1 = Slight redness; 2 = Mild redness; 3 = Moderate redness; 4 = Severe redness). The maximum value represents the worst grade in any zone. Both eyes were included in the model for analysis. Contact lenses were not worn for this assessment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Upper Eyelid Redness</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0), Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>The contact lenses were removed and upper eyelid redness was objectively measured through digital images. The coverage of the palpebral surface by blood vessels is expressed as percentage of the total surface measured. Both eyes were included in the model for analysis. Contact lenses were not worn for this assessment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Upper Eyelid Margin Staining</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0), Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>The contact lens was removed and ophthalmic dye was instilled. Upper eyelid margin staining was objectively measured through digital images. The extent of true staining (i.e., the total area of lid margin covered by staining) was recorded. Both eyes were included in the model for analysis. Contact lenses were not worn for this assessment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Median Non-Invasive Pre-Lens Tear Film Break Up Time (PL-NIBUT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>The pre-lens tear film is the layer of tears located on top of the contact lens (i.e., between the eyelid and the contact lens). The time required for a dry spot to appear on the pre-lens surface after blinking is referred to as the pre-lens tear film break up time. PL-NIBUT was evaluated using a biomicroscope with a diffuse illumination source, i.e., Tearscope. A longer PL-NIBUT indicates a more stable tear film and greater on-eye lens wettability. Three PL-NIBUT measurements were recorded, and the median value was used for analysis. Both eyes were included in the model for analysis. Contact lenses were on-eye for this assessment.</description>

          <title>Maximum Papillae</title>
          <description>Eyelid papillae (bumps on the inner eyelid) were recorded separately for three zones of the upper lid and overall for the lower lid on a 5-point forced choice scale: 0 = None; 1 = Slight (diffuse papillae); 2 = Mild (diffuse &amp; tufts papillae); 3 = Moderate (moderate &amp; tufts papillae); 4 = Severe (giant papillae). The maximum value represents the worse grade in any zone. Both eyes were included in the model for analysis. Contact lenses were not worn for this assessment.</description>

        <description>The pre-lens tear film is the layer of tears located on top of the contact lens (i.e., between the eyelid and the contact lens). The time required for a dry spot to appear on the pre-lens surface after blinking is referred to as the pre-lens tear film break up time. PL-NIBUT was evaluated using a biomicroscope with a diffuse illumination source, i.e., Tearscope. A longer PL-NIBUT indicates a more stable tear film and greater on-eye lens wettability. Three PL-NIBUT measurements were recorded, and the median value was used for analysis. Both eyes were included in the model for analysis. Contact lenses were on-eye for this assessment.</description>
