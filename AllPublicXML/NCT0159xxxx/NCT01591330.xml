    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the effect of different particle size of LY2140023. The study
      involves four single doses of 80 mg LY2140023 taken as 1 tablet by mouth with a washout
      period of at least 3 days between doses. This study will last approximately 60 days not
      including screening. Screening is required within 30 days prior to study entry.
