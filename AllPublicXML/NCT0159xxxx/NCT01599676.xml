    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the effect of citrulline supplementation on muscle
      strength in elderly institutionalized subjects undergoing a resistance exercise training
      program. The primary endpoint is the outcome of maximum strength of knee extensor muscles.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Maintaining muscle strength is mandatory for elderly persons to keep autonomy. Resistance
      exercise increases muscle strength in old and very old subjects, but there seems to be little
      effect on muscle mass. Citrulline is an amino acid that stimulates muscle protein synthesis,
      but its effect on muscle strength and mass remains to be determined. The aim of this study is
      to assess the effect of citrulline supplementation on muscle strength in elderly
      institutionalized subjects undergoing a resistance exercise training program.

      All the subjects (84) will undergo a resistance exercise training program for 12 weeks. The
      subjects will have a regimen of high-intensity progressive resistance training of the knee
      extensors 3 days per week. These muscle groups were chosen because of their importance in
      functional activities. The subjects will be randomized into two groups. An intervention group
      will receive orally citrulline at 10 g/day, and a control group will receive an
      isonitrogenous amount of nonessential amino acids (alanine, aspartate, glycine, serine,
      histidine and proline in equimolar quantity). During the 12 weeks of supplementation,
      clinical tolerance will be evaluated. Strength testing will be repeated every two weeks for
      12 weeks. The primary endpoint is the outcome of maximum strength of knee extensor muscles.
      Fat-free mass (DEXA), gait velocity, timed get up and go, spontaneous physical activity
      (activity monitors), nutritional status (weight, albuminemia, TRANSTHYRETINEMIA) and quality
      of life will be measured at inclusion and at the end of the study. The number of falls during
      the study will be recorded.
