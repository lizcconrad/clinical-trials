  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to compare the performance of a newly available
      needle with reverse bevel design (called the EchoTip® Procore™ needle) with standard needles
      to see which needle gives better diagnostic information for pancreatic lesions.

      An endoscopic ultrasound-guided needle biopsy or FNA is a special endoscopic procedure used
      to sample lesions within or next to the digestive tract, including the pancreas. The needle
      is used to collect material for diagnosis. A special lighted, flexible tube called an
      endoscope is inserted through the mouth, into the stomach and small intestine. The endoscope
      also has a ultrasound probe at its tip which can be used to see the pancreas, which is
      located behind the stomach. The doctor will then use the ultrasound to guide the needle
      biopsy or FNA.

      In this clinic, an average of 4 needle passes (needle sticks) are needed to collect enough
      tissue for diagnosis. However, the number of passes can be higher or lower, depending on the
      individual lesion and success of the needle passes.

      If you agree to take part in this study, 2 different needles (the standard straight
      hollow-core needle and the new EchoTip® Procore™ needle) will be used to sample the pancreas
      lesion. Two (2) passes will be performed with each needle type and compared. If additional
      passes are needed for diagnosis, they will not be included in this study. After the first set
      of needle passes, the doctor may decide that more passes are needed.

      Final test results will be taken from the diagnostic results from each needle pass. The
      results from both types of needle will be included in your medical record.

      This is an investigational study. All needles used in this study are FDA approved and
      commercially available. Comparing the needles is investigational.

      Up to 60 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

    <description>Assess if 22-gauge EchoTip® Procore™ needle has a better diagnostic performance compared to standard 22-gaugeG and 25-gaugeG straight hollow core needles. Primary endpoint is whether or not the needle pass result provides diagnostic material (yes vs. no). For each patient, both needles used to sample the same lesion. Two needle passes performed with each needle type.</description>
