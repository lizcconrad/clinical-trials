    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) participants treated with
      prolonged-released fampridine (BIIB041) 10 mg twice daily compared with participants treated
      with placebo are to assess the effect over 24 weeks on the following parameters to explore
      endpoints for the Phase 3 study: self-assessed walking disability, dynamic and static
      balance, subjective impression of well-being, and participants' global impression of change
      in walking . Another purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      prolonged-release fampridine.

      The primary objective of the study is to explore the effect of prolonged-released fampridine
      10 mg twice daily in patients with Multiple Sclerosis with walking disability. The change of
      walking ability will be measured using Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale-12 (MSWS-12) to
      further elucidate the clinical relevance of changes over 24 weeks treatment duration. Another
      purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of prolonged-release
      fampridine.

      Approximately 120 patients MS will be randomized over 20 sites worldwide. Duration of
      patient's participation in the study will be approximately 28 weeks.
