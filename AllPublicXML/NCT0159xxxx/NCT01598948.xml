  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elevated LDL-cholesterol is a major risk factor for heart disease. In patients with heart
      disease LDL-cholesterol should be lowered to levels below 70 mg/dl to prevent progression of
      disease. In most patients life style modification together with lipid lowering drug therapy
      is sufficient to achieve this goal. In some patients with severe forms of
      hypercholesterolemia, this may not be sufficient to reach goals and regular lipid apheresis
      (a costly and time intensive form of therapy) may be performed. Mipomersen is a new drug
      (apoB antisense oligonucleotide) that can lower LDL-cholesterol even in the most severe forms
      of LDL-hypercholesterolemia by 25-47%. It is unknown whether and to what extent mipomersen
      can decrease LDL-cholesterol in patients treated with regular apheresis. Phase 1 of the study
      will test how 6 months of weekly therapy with mipomersen affects LDL-cholesterol in patients
      with severe LDL-hypercholesterolemia treated with regular apheresis. Phase 2 will test in how
      many patients this will result in a meaningful reduction of apheresis time, apheresis
      frequency or if apheresis can be stopped completely.
