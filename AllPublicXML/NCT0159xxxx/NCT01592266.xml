  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PET/CT is reliable tool in evaluation of treatment response in number cancers. F18-FLT is a
      precursor of DNA with high uptake in the bone marrow as a part of normal biodistribution.
      Highly increased uptake of this radiopharmaceutical was shown in a number of hematologic
      disease either in bone marrow or extramedullary.

      F18-FLT PET/CT can provide a tool for whole body assessment of activity in bone marrow as
      well as early estimation of treatment efficacy or lack of it. In addition, this noninvasive
      study can replace bone marrow biopsy and predict response vs. non response to therapy.
