  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the StimRouter (SR) electrical
      stimulation therapy leads to clinically important pain relief in patients with chronic
      intractable pain of peripheral nerve origin after three months of treatment. At the same
      time, this study will gather information on side effects associated with the StimRouter
      electrical stimulation therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ninety (minimum) up to one hundred twenty-six (126) adult (≥ 22 years) subjects who have
      severe intractable chronic pain of peripheral nerve origin associated with post
      traumatic/post surgical neuralgia persisting for 3 months or longer and an average chronic
      pain level of at least 5 on a 0-10 numeric rating scale, where such pain is attributable to a
      lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system, will be recruited from U.S. outpatient
      physical medicine and rehabilitation clinics.

      After screening, subjects who were confirmed to be eligible for the study and provided
      informed consent will have a pain level assessment period for approximately one week then
      come back for the Baseline/Implantation visit. Subjects will be trained on and required to
      complete a patient diary of pain intensity level for at least 7 consecutive days prior to
      baseline. The randomization and programming will take place approximately two weeks after
      implantation. Subjects in the treatment group will receive electrical stimulation and pain
      medication. In contrast, subjects in the parallel control group will receive control
      stimulation and pain medication.

      The plan is to have the parallel portion of the study run for approximately 12 weeks (or 3
      months) after randomization for efficacy analysis. Subjects in the control group will be
      allowed to cross over to the treatment group for nine months of electrical stimulation; the
      subjects in the treatment group will have nine additional months of stimulation treatment
      such that safety data will be collected throughout a full twelve month period on all
      available subjects. While the end of the study is approximately 12 months after
      randomization, as previously stated, the efficacy analyses will be based on the data
      collected at the end of the 3-month follow-up evaluation.

    <description>The average pain at rest was assessed using a numerical (0-10) rating scale (NRS) on the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) Short Form (SF). A higher score indicates worse pain (10=worst pain imaginable) and zero indicates 'no pain at all'. A pain reduction of greater than or equal to 30% on the NRS was considered to be clinically relevant.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>StimRouter- active electrical stimulation is applied transdermally to a targeted peripheral nerve. This is accomplished via a fully implanted StimRouter lead that receives energy from a rechargeable programmed external pulse transmitter (EPT) with attached gel electrodes. The EPT receives radio frequency (RF) commands from a Patient Programmer. A StimRouter Clinician Programmer is used to program the StimRouter EPT and Patient Programmer. Up to eight stimulation programs may be saved on a Patient Programmer for on-demand selection by the study patient.</description>

    <description>StimRouter- Electrical stimulation is withheld from the targeted peripheral nerve after fully implanting the StimRouter lead. The rechargeable programmed external pulse transmitter (EPT) with attached gel electrodes is placed for transdermal stimulation but no stimulation is delivered. The EPT which normally receives radio frequency (RF) commands from a Patient Programmer is not activated. A StimRouter Clinician Programmer is used to program the StimRouter EPT and Patient Programmer such that no stimulation occurs in the Control Arm of the study.</description>

        <description>The average pain at rest was assessed using a numerical (0-10) rating scale (NRS) on the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) Short Form (SF). A higher score indicates worse pain (10=worst pain imaginable) and zero indicates 'no pain at all'.

            <title>StimRouter - Active Stimulation</title>
            <description>StimRouter- active electrical stimulation is applied transdermally to a targeted peripheral nerve. This is accomplished via a fully implanted StimRouter lead that receives energy from a rechargeable programmed external pulse transmitter (EPT) with attached gel electrodes. The EPT receives radio frequency (RF) commands from a Patient Programmer. A StimRouter Clinician Programmer is used to program the StimRouter EPT and Patient Programmer. Up to eight stimulation programs may be saved on a Patient Programmer for on-demand selection by the study patient.
StimRouter - active stimulation: The stimulation program settings for this arm are as follows:
Stim Settings
Waveform: Symmetric or Asymmetric
Phase Duration: 100-250 µsec
Pulse Rate: 50-100 Hz
Intensity: 0-30mA Time Settings
Constant Stim: On

            <title>StimRouter - Control</title>
            <description>StimRouter- Electrical stimulation is withheld from the targeted peripheral nerve after fully implanting the StimRouter lead. The rechargeable programmed external pulse transmitter (EPT) with attached gel electrodes is placed for transdermal stimulation but no stimulation is delivered. The EPT which normally receives radio frequency (RF) commands from a Patient Programmer is not activated. A StimRouter Clinician Programmer is used to program the StimRouter EPT and Patient Programmer such that no stimulation occurs in the Control Arm of the study.
StimRouter - Control: The stimulation program settings for this arm are as follows:
Stim Settings
Waveform: Symmetric or Asymmetric
Phase Duration: 200 µsec
Pulse Rate: 1 Hz
Intensity: 0 mA Time Settings
Constant Stim: On
Total Time: 6 hour</description>

          <description>Patient satisfaction with the StimRouter System was rated on a numerical rating scale (range 0 to 10), with 0 indicating not satisfied at all and 10 indicating completely satisfied.</description>
          <population>All subjects who completed the survey at Month 3 were included in this analysis. Four subjects in each study arm (4/45 Treatment; 4/49 Control) failed to complete the satisfaction survey.</population>
