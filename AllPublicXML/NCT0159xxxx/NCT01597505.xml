    <textblock>
      606 participants with Clostridium Difficile Associated Diarrhea (CDAD) participated in this
      study and received either oral vancomycin or CB-183,315 (surotomycin) in a blinded fashion.
      Treatment lasted for 10 days and participants were followed up for at least 40 days and a
      maximum of 100 days. The purpose of this study was to evaluate how well surotomycin treats
      CDAD as compared to vancomycin.

    <measure>Adjusted Percentage of Participants With a Clinical Outcome of Cure at the End of Treatment (EOT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 13 days</time_frame>
    <description>A clinical outcome of cure at EOT was determined by resolution of diarrhea, defined as ≤ 2 loose stools per 24-hour period for at least 2 consecutive days and the lack of need for additional antibiotics to treat the current CDAD episode after completion of the study treatment period. Participants requiring a collection device were considered to have resolution of diarrhea when the volume of stool (over a 24-hour period) was decreased by 75% as compared to baseline or the participant was no longer passing liquid stool. The estimated adjusted percentage was a weighted average across all strata, constructed using Mehrotra-Railkar continuity-corrected minimum risk (MRc) stratum weights.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With at Least One Adverse Event (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 50</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not related to the medicinal product. AEs may be new events or may be pre-existing conditions that have become aggravated or have worsened in severity or frequency; or may be clinically significant changes from baseline in physical examination, laboratory tests, or other diagnostic investigation (e.g. laboratory results, x-ray findings).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With at Least One Serious Adverse Event (SAE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 50</time_frame>
    <description>A SAE is any adverse experience occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes: death; a life-threatening experience, referring to a situation in which the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event, requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity; is a congenital anomaly or birth defect; or is considered to be an important medical event.</description>

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Clinical Response Over Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 41</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical response over time as measured by those without treatment failure, recurrence, death, or lost to follow-up, measured as the number of participants without failure events (survivors) through the end of therapy (reported for Day 14) and from end of therapy to Day 40 (reported for Day 41).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adjusted Percentage of Participants With Sustained Clinical Response at the End of Study</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 50</time_frame>
    <description>Sustained clinical response at the end of study was achieved by participants who had a clinical outcome of cure at the end of treatment (Days 40-50) and did not experience a recurrence of CDAD, did not die, were not lost to follow-up, and did not have end of study visit prior to Day 40. The estimated adjusted percentage was a weighted average across all strata, constructed using MRc stratum weights.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adjusted Percentage of Participants With Sustained Clinical Response at Day 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 24</time_frame>
    <description>Sustained clinical response at Day 24 was defined as participants who had a clinical outcome of cure at Day 24, who did not experience a recurrence of CDAD, did not die, were not lost to follow-up. Only the first failure event was counted per participant. The estimated adjusted percentage was a weighted average across all strata, constructed using MRc stratum weights.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adjusted Percentage of Participants With Recurrence of CDAD at End of Study</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 50</time_frame>
    <description>Participants with recurrences were defined as those who were cured at the end of therapy and had a recurrence or were lost to follow-up, died or had a Day 40 -50 contact prior to Day 40. The estimated adjusted percentage was a weighted average across all strata, constructed using MRc stratum weights.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Resolution of Diarrhea</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 13</time_frame>
    <description>Time to resolution of diarrhea with =&lt; 2 unformed bowel movements (UBM) per 24-hour period was calculated as the date/time of last UBM minus the date/time of the first dose of study drug.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Reappearance of Diarrhea From End of Treatment to the End of Study</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 50</time_frame>
    <description>Time to reappearance of diarrhea with &gt;= 3 UBM per 24-hour period was calculated as the last date/time of study drug dose to the date/time of first reappearance of 3 or more UBMs among participants who were cured at end of treatment.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to Day 13</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical response corresponded to a clinical outcome of cure at the end of treatment, and was achieved by participants with infections deemed to be caused by the C. difficile BI/NAP1/027 strain at baseline, who did not fail treatment, did not die, or were not lost to follow-up at the end of treatment.

        <title>Adjusted Percentage of Participants With a Clinical Outcome of Cure at the End of Treatment (EOT)</title>
        <description>A clinical outcome of cure at EOT was determined by resolution of diarrhea, defined as ≤ 2 loose stools per 24-hour period for at least 2 consecutive days and the lack of need for additional antibiotics to treat the current CDAD episode after completion of the study treatment period. Participants requiring a collection device were considered to have resolution of diarrhea when the volume of stool (over a 24-hour period) was decreased by 75% as compared to baseline or the participant was no longer passing liquid stool. The estimated adjusted percentage was a weighted average across all strata, constructed using Mehrotra-Railkar continuity-corrected minimum risk (MRc) stratum weights.</description>
