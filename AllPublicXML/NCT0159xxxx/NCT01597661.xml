  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bupropion is a unique drug that is used both to treat depression and as an aid in smoking
      cessation. In 2008, the final report from the Bupropion pregnancy registry described 24
      congenital malformations among the 675 women exposed to bupropion in the first trimester of
      pregnancy. Of these, 9 had congenital heart disease of varying severity, including a number
      of infants with ventricular septal defects (VSDs); of note, 2 of these 9 had coarctation of
      the aorta. More recently, Alwan et al, in an analysis of data from the Centers for Disease
      Control and Prevention's case-control National Birth Defects Prevention Study, reported an
      increased risk of left outflow tract heart defects, a subgroup of cardiac malformations that
      includes coarctation of the aorta and hypoplastic left heart syndrome.

      Data from the Slone Epidemiology Center Birth Defects Study will be used to test these
      observations. The outcomes of primary interest will include those hypothesized to be
      associated with bupropion in recent studies: left outflow tract defects considered as a
      group. Coarctation of the aorta and hypoplastic left heart syndrome will also be examined
      separately. All infants with congenital heart defects are further classified into subgroups
      that are embryologically meaningful, including left outflow tract defects. In secondary
      analyses, other heart defect classes for which there are adequate numbers of cases will be
      evaluated.

    <description>Infants with any of a wide range of malformations are identified at tertiary care and birth hospitals in four study centers (Boston, Philadelphia, Toronto, San Diego) using approaches that include reviewing lists of discharge diagnoses available in medical records; contacting newborn nursery and/or labor and delivery rooms; reviewing admission/discharge lists; and reviewing clinic and surgical logs. A population-based random sample of non-malformed newborns in Massachusetts is also included. Information gathered on each subject includes name, address, telephone number, diagnostic information, and date of birth.</description>

    <intervention_name>Exposure to any bupropion during the first trimester</intervention_name>
    <description>The primary exposure group will be: any exposure to bupropion during the time period from 28 days prior to the last menstrual period through the fourth lunar month. The use of bupropion in combination with other anti-depressants, exposure to SSRI anti-depressants, and exposure to non-SSRI anti-depressants, including tricyclic anti-depressants, during this time period will be explored.
Mothers of identified infants are contacted within 6 months of delivery and invited to participate in the study by completing a telephone interview, conducted by trained study nurses. The interview addresses demographic, reproductive, and medical factors; medication and vitamin use; cigarette smoking, alcohol, and caffeine consumption, occupational exposures, and dietary intake. Exposure information is obtained directly from the mother in response to questions that focus both on indications for medication use and on medications themselves.</description>

        The primary focus of the Slone Epidemiology Center Birth Defects Study (BDS) case-control
        surveillance is to identify the risks and safety of marketed drugs taken by pregnant women.
        Infants with any of a wide range of malformations are identified at tertiary care and birth
        hospitals in four study centers (Boston, Philadelphia, Toronto, San Diego) using approaches
        that include reviewing lists of discharge diagnoses available in medical records;
        contacting newborn nursery and/or labor and delivery rooms; reviewing admission/discharge
        lists; and reviewing clinic and surgical logs. Information gathered on each subject
        includes name, address, telephone number, diagnostic information, and date of birth.
        Beginning in 1992, the BDS also included mothers of non-malformed infants: initially these
        infants were identified exclusively at study hospitals, but in 1998, they expanded their
        normal newborn capability by obtaining a population-based random sample of newborns in
        Massachusetts.
