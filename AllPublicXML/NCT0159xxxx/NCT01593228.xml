      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of iniparib administered
      as monotherapy or in combination regimens in patients previously treated with iniparib in a
      clinical study and who have derived clinical benefit after completion of the parental study's
      objectives.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Treatment Extension protocol consists of three time points/periods: the Screening Period
      (during which assessments are performed to determine whether the patient meets the criteria
      to participate in the study), the Treatment Period (during which the patient receives
      treatment with the study drug(s)), and the Post-Treatment Period (during which patients
      complete an evaluation approximately 30 days after the last dose of study drug). Patients may
      continue to participate on the Treatment Extension study as long as they meet criteria to
      continue to receive therapy, tolerate the treatment regimen, do not develop progressive
      disease (PD), do not discontinue from iniparib, do not withdraw consent, or until iniparib
      becomes commercially available.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria :

          -  Cancer patients greater than 18 years of age who have completed all assessments
             required to meet the primary objectives of a parental phase 1, 2 or 3 clinical study
             of iniparib as monotherapy or in a combination regimen.

          -  Previously received and are continuing to derive clinical benefit from iniparib, as
             monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy, as determined by the treating
             physician.

          -  Ongoing treatment with iniparib at time of parental study completion/closure and meet
             criteria to initiate a subsequent cycle of therapy, as described in the parental study
             protocol.

          -  On a stable parental study regimen (at least one cycle for the regimen at the
             dose/schedule that is to be given in the Treatment Extension study must have been
             given prior to the patient's discontinuation from the parental study). Signed written
             informed consent.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Patient has not previously participated in any clinical trial of iniparib.

          -  Patient has evidence of progressive disease while receiving iniparib.

          -  Patient has another concurrent invasive malignancy (aside from the malignancy for
             which the patient has received therapy for on the parental protocol).

          -  Patient has a major medical or co-morbid condition(s) that the investigator believes
             might compromise safe participation in the study (such as uncontrolled lung, kidney,
             or liver problems; uncontrolled infection; a history of congestive heart failure; or
             an electrocardiogram suggesting significant problems with the heart).

          -  Patient has not recovered to baseline or less than Grade 1 from non-hematologic
             adverse events related to any anticancer therapy received prior to signing informed
             consent on the Treatment Extension study, with the exception of hair loss.

          -  Patient is receiving concurrent treatment with other investigational agents not
             allowed as part of the combination regimen in the parental study protocol.

          -  Concurrent anticancer treatment with any agent other than iniparib and any
             co-administered chemotherapeutic agent(s) specified on the parental study protocol are
             not permitted throughout the course of the study.

          -  Patient is receiving concurrent radiation therapy to treat primary disease with
             curative intent. (Note that palliative radiotherapy is allowed as long as there is no
             evidence of progressive disease.)

          -  Patient is unable to comply with the requirements of the study.

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding women.

          -  Women of childbearing potential or men with partners of childbearing potential who are
             not protected or who are unwilling to use an effective contraceptive method of birth
             control during the course of the study and for a period of 6 months following the last
             dose.

        The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's
        potential participation in a clinical trial.
