      The purpose of this study is to better understand the effects of the chemotherapy medication
      bortezomib on cancer cells. The investigators are therefore taking blood and bone marrow
      samples from patients with myeloma who are receiving bortezomib to see if the investigators
      can detect autophagy in the myeloma cells from the bone marrow and in immune cells in the
      blood. Subjects are eligible if their doctor is planning to treat them with bortezomib for
      the first time for their myeloma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether administration of bortezomib
      leads to an increase in cellular autophagy, as determined by electron micrographs of
      peripheral blood lymphocytes and primary myeloma cells in patients receiving single-agent
      bortezomib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

        1. To determine the optimal timing of autophagy assessments for patients receiving
           bortezomib.

        2. To explore whether high levels of autophagy are associated with resistance to bortezomib
           therapy.

        3. To validate our primary assay by confirming baseline stability of the number of
           autophagic vesicles per cell

        4. To compare results of autophagy measurements in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and
           bone marrow plasma cells

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed multiple myeloma (both newly diagnosed and relapsed patients
             are permitted)

          -  No more than one line of prior therapy containing bortezomib. No prior therapy with
             any other proteasome inhibitor.

          -  For subjects who received previous bortezomib, at least a partial response while on
             the bortezomib-containing therapy, without progression while on bortezomib-containing
             therapy or within 90 days of stopping bortezomib.

          -  Planned therapy, as determined by the patient's treating physician, with a
             bortezomib-containing regimen

          -  Medically suitable to undergo study procedures, including a one-week washout of prior
             therapy, one week of observation, and one week of single-agent bortezomib

          -  Provision of written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Age &lt;18 years (though the demographics of myeloma make it highly unlikely that any
             children will meet inclusion criteria)

          -  Treatment with other anti-myeloma agents, including corticosteroids, thalidomide, or
             lenalidomide, within the 7 days prior to the study baseline bone marrow biopsy.

          -  Inability to understand the informed consent document or unwillingness to consent.

          -  Written informed consent must be obtained from all patients before study entry.
