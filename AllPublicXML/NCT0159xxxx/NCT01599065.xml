  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the two options for management of ICDs (internal
      cardioverter defibrillators) in patients undergoing procedures with electrocautery: (1)
      programming ICD therapies &quot;off,&quot; or (2) use of a magnet to suspend ICD therapies By comparing
      these two techniques the investigators hope to demonstrate the efficiency of using an ICD
      magnet protocol during perioperative management of patients undergoing electrocautery
      procedures. Secondary purposes are to gain further information on health care resources,
      incidence of EMI, handoff communications and to document lack of adverse events in either
      group.

      Primary objective will be: ICD therapy &quot;off times&quot; will be less with the use of a magnet
      protocol compared to an &quot;off-on&quot; protocol. Secondary objectives will be: (1) Healthcare
      resources (time and costs of skilled personnel) will be less using a magnet protocol compared
      to an off-on protocol, and (2) there will be no difference between adverse events in the
      magnet protocol compared to an off-on protocol. The incidence of EMI and number of handoff
      communications will be documented.

      The investigators hypothesis is that the number of minutes with ICD therapies &quot;off&quot; will be
      significantly less with magnet use. The investigators also expect health care resources to be
      less with magnet use compared to reprogramming.

      The study design will be a prospective multi-center randomized controlled trial where
      subjects will be randomized to either a control group (ICD &quot;off-on&quot; group) or to the
      experimental group (magnet group) within blocks of type of procedure and site.

      Subjects will be enrolled at the time of their procedure and will remain in the study until
      their post operative device interrogation. This could take place that same day (&quot;off on&quot;
      group or registry) or at their next ICD clinic visit or remote transmission (no more than 3
      months from the procedure).

      The study duration from first enrollment to closure is expected to last approximately 12
      months. There will be only two enrolling centers and the target sample size is 150 subjects
      from various manufacturers. No specific sample size was calculated as this is a pilot study.

        Patients who have an ICD and are patients at Edward Hospital or Advocate Good Samaritan
        undergoing surgical, endoscopic and interventional radiologic procedures will be considered
        for the study. Hospital and cardiology practice staff will identify potential subjects by
        reviewing surgical, endoscopic and interventional radiologic procedure schedules. When
        patients with an ICD are identified research staff will be notified. Any scheduled adult
        patient with a past medical history of an ICD will be considered for participation. If
        electrocautery is anticipated for the procedure this patient will be screened for the
        study.
