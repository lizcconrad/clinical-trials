  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of a school-based treatment aimed at
      increasing language and social skills in preschool-aged children with autism spectrum
      disorder (ASD). Through interactive development (continually seeking educator feedback for
      intervention improvement) and implementation of the intervention, the investigators hope to
      provide a feasible and practical means for educators to work with children with ASD in real
      world, large scale settings. ASD preschool educators, the children enrolled in their classes,
      between the ages of 3 and 6 years and their families may join.

      In Phase 4, KKI staff trained Delaware preschool teachers to serve as model coaches and
      educators through the Delaware Autism Program. Families whose children were enrolled in
      participating classrooms were consented through DAP using the school's consent to be
      videotaped. Any families who did not consent for their child to be videotaped for this
      training received the nonparticipant consent form currently utilized in this study and staff
      videotaping took every effort to keep those children out of frame when taping. This cohort
      involved KKI study team members training 1-2 coaches, who then trained five Delaware school
      teachers. The IES model was implemented in the teacher's classrooms (n= 5-10 students
      participating in each classroom; 20-40 children total).

      In the current phase of the study, Phase 5 and 6, KKI study team members will continue the
      evaluation of the IES model, by testing the efficacy of the intervention model in a larger
      sample (Phase 5) and then analyzing the corresponding data (Phase 6). The larger efficacy
      study (phase 5) will be conducted on teachers and students recruited from public school
      districts in Maryland, Delaware, and Pennsylvania using the same IES model and recruitment
      methods in the previous phases.
