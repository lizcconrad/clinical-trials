  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multiple dose study of the safety and efficacy of MK-2748 to be done in 2 Parts.
      Part I will enroll genotype 1 (GT1) hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected participants and Part II
      will enroll genotype 3 (GT3) HCV-infected participants. Both Parts may run concurrently or
      may be staggered.
