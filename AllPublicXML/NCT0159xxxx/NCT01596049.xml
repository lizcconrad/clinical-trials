  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study's objective is to assess the efficacy of a Self-fixating mesh in the surgical
      repair of unilateral inguinal hernia, which is becoming the new standard of care in open
      surgical repair of inguinal hernia.

      The study design is interventional, enrolling 300 patients above 18 years of age, admitted
      for elective repair in the surgical department of Rambam Medical Health Care Campus, an
      academic medical center.

      The study will assess several outcomes including post-surgical pain, recurrence, quality of
      life and post surgical complications (e.g. wound infection, the formation of hematoma or
      seroma, etc).
