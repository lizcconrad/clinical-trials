  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exposure to household allergens is a major contributor to asthma symptoms. Aggressive
      measures to reduce household allergens has the potential to reduce asthma symptoms and the
      need for medications to control asthma. The investigators plan to enroll patients aged 6 and
      above into a single blind, randomized study comparing intensive environmental intervention
      with usual asthma care over a 48 week study period. All subjects will have asthma treatment
      optimized according to guideline based care. Subjects will be randomized to an aggressive
      environmental remediation arm versus distribution of written materials regarding allergen
      reduction (&quot;usual care&quot;). Primary outcome measure will be ability to reduce asthma step
      therapy. Secondary outcomes include measures of lung function, asthma biomarkers and quality
      of life.

      Research question(s):

      In individuals with atopic asthma who are being treated with inhaled corticosteroids with or
      without long acting beta agonists (1 of 6 possible steps of treatment), aggressive
      environmental intervention to reduce exposure to home allergens is more likely to lead to one
      step reduction in asthma controller therapy, improved asthma control and improved biomarkers
      of airway inflammation than is usual care.

      Scientific abstract:

      Environmental exposure to indoor allergens is a major contributor to asthma impairment and
      risk, particularly among asthmatic patients residing in inner cities. The investigators plan
      a randomized controlled trial to assess the effect of individualized, comprehensive,
      multifaceted indoor allergen avoidance measures on ability to step down asthma controller
      therapy in adults and children greater than 6 years with mild to severe persistent asthma.

      Specifically,

      1. To determine via a randomized, controlled trial in allergen sensitized asthma patients
      whether environmental intervention aimed at reducing exposure to indoor allergens and
      irritants is more effective in reducing National Asthma Education and Prevention Program
      (NAEPP) step based therapy than usual care over a 48 week study period.

      2a. To determine if environmental intervention leads to reduction in indoor allergen levels,
      allergen specific serum IgE levels, airway hyper-responsiveness, fractional excretion of
      nitric oxide, asthma symptom score, asthma exacerbations, treatment failures and improved
      lung function compared to usual care over a 48 week study period.

      2b. (Exploratory): To determine if there is an association between reduction in allergen
      specific IgE level and reduction in NAEPP step level required for asthma control among
      subjects randomized to environmental intervention compared with usual care.

    <description>If randomized to this part of the study the patient will receive an individualized homebased program. In addition to general handouts provided to at Visit 3, subjects in this arm will also receive home-based education by Intervention Counselors about how indoor allergens can affect asthma and the importance of strategies for removing allergens. The goal of the intervention is to provide the patient with the knowledge and skills necessary to remove allergens from their home, and to assist them with those clean up measures. Some of the measures implemented will be specifically based on data we have previously collected from them in the clinic and from their previous home visit, while others will be general to reduce all allergen level.</description>

    <description>If assigned to this group the patient will receive general health/safety related counseling. At the counselor visit following randomization, the patient will receive handouts related to general health and safety issues. They will also have visits by the Home Evaluators for assessment of the home and collection of dust samples identical to those in the treatment group (week 28 and week 44).</description>
