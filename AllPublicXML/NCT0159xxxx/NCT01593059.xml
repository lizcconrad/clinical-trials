      This registry is a clinical post-market evaluation of the Orsiro LESS in subjects requiring
      coronary revascularization with Drug Eluting Stents (DES).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For the majority of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), treatment with Percutaneous Transluminal
      Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA) provides high initial procedural success. However, the medium to
      long-term complications range from rather immediate elastic recoil or vessel contraction to
      longer processes like smooth muscle cell proliferation and excessive production of extra
      cellular matrix, thrombus formation and atherosclerotic changes like restenosis or
      angiographic re-narrowing. The reported incidence of restenosis after PTCA ranges from
      30%-50%. Such rates of recurrence have serious economic consequences.

      Bare Metal Stents (BMS), designed to address the limitations of PTCA, reduced the
      angiographic and clinical restenosis rates in de novo lesions compared to PTCA alone and
      decreased the need for CABG. BMS substantially reduced the incidence of abrupt artery
      closure, but restenosis still occurred in about 20%-40% of cases, necessitating repeat
      procedures.

      The invention of Drug Eluting Stents (DES) significantly improved on the principle of BMS by
      adding an antiproliferative drug (directly immobilised on the stent surface or released from
      a polymer matrix), which inhibits neointimal hyperplasia. The introduction of DES greatly
      reduced the incidence of restenosis and resulted in a better safety profile as compared to
      BMS with systemic drug administration.

      These advantages and a lower cost compared to surgical interventions has made DES an
      attractive option to treat coronary artery disease. This observational registry is designed
      to investigate and collect clinical evidence for the clinical performance and safety of the
      Orsiro Drug Eluting Stent System in an all-comers patient population in daily clinical
      practice.
