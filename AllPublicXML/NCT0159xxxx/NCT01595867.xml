  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a single-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3 way crossover study
      designed to evaluate the relative abuse potential of crushed EMBEDAÂ® compared to morphine
      sulfate CR tablets and placebo in healthy male and female, non-dependent, recreational opioid
      users. An appropriate dose of morphine sulfate CR (i.e., 30 mg, 60 or 90 mg) was to be
      selected during Part A of the study (Dose Selection Phase). Each subject participated in the
      study for up to (approximately) 16 weeks and was confined in the clinic for a total of up to
      12 nights.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male or female subjects 18 to 55 years of age, inclusive.

          -  Subject is a recreational opioid user who is NOT dependent on opioids based on
             Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition-Text Revision
             (DSM-IV-TR) criteria and the Naloxone Challenge. A recreational opioid user is defined
             as use of opioids for non-therapeutic purposes (i.e., for psychoactive effects) on at
             least 10 occasions within the last year and at least once in the 12 weeks before the
             Screening Visit (Visit 1).

          -  Subjects must have experience with intranasal drug administration, defined as
             intranasal use on at least 3 occasions within the last year prior to the Screening
             Visit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of substance and/or alcohol dependence (excluding caffeine and nicotine), as
             assessed by the Investigator using the DSM IV-TR criteria.

          -  Has participated in, is currently participating in, or is seeking treatment for
             substance- and or alcohol-related disorders (excluding nicotine and caffeine).

          -  Has any condition in which an opioid is contraindicated; e.g., significant respiratory
             depression, acute or severe bronchial asthma or hypercarbia, or is suspected of having
             paralytic ileus.

          -  Allergy or history of hypersensitivity to morphine sulfate, other opioids, naltrexone
             hydrochloride, naloxone, and/or lactose.

          -  History or current clinically significant neurological, cardiovascular, renal,
             hepatic, endocrine, gastrointestinal, hematologic, or metabolic disease as evaluated
             by the Investigator.

          -  History or current pulmonary disease including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary
             disease, exercise-induced asthma, bronchitis, and obstructive sleep apnea.
