      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and tolerance of a
      dipyridamole/adenosine combination given intravenously, as a slow bolus and at low doses to
      adenosine alone (given at its recommended dosage adjusted to patients' weight) for coronary
      flow reserve assessment (in 60-75 patients with stable ischemic heart disease) using
      transthoracic echodoppler

      Phase 2, monocentric, single blind study, comparing the efficacy (primary endpoint) and the
      safety-tolerance profile (secondary endpoint) of a dipyridamole/adenosine combination given
      intravenously as a slow bolus and at low doses to adenosine alone given by the same route at
      its standard and recommended dose.

      Expected results: Non inferiority of the combination compared to standard adenosine alone in
      terms of hemodynamic efficacy, with maintenance of the optimal hyperemic coronary effect for
      at least 45 to 60 seconds after the end of the injection -Significant reduction of the
      incidence rate of A1 adverse events and of the severity of A2 and A1 clinical symptoms.

      Primary endpoint : diastolic mean and peak coronary blood velocities Secondary endpoint :
      incidence rate and severity of adverse events, in particular, chest pain, dyspnoea,
      hypotension, bradycardia, AV blocks, arrhythmia

      Number of patients: 60-75 pts with 42-50 pts acceptable for statistical analysis

      Operating procedures:

      Day 1 (visit): Informed consent signature, Review of inclusion and exclusion criteria,
      Hemodynamic variables and EKG, Cardiac history, Significant other medical diseases, Risk
      factors, Concomitant treatment and substances consumed within 48 hours, Transthoracic
      ultrasonography, Adverse events report Day 2 (telephone contact): Adverse events report

      Duration of the study: 15 months

      Statistical Analysis: Statistical tests will include :a paired test analysis and comparison
      of the means (quantitative variables) -Possibly the Mac-Nemar test for the assessment of
      clinical adverse events during the study test with both products.
