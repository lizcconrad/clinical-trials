  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot, non-interventional, observational, Web-based, prospective cohort study is
      designed to collect self-reported safety and effectiveness and genetic data from subjects
      with locally recurrent breast cancer (BC) or metastatic breast cancer (MBC), metastatic
      colorectal cancer (MCRC), metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (MNSCLC),
      recurrent glioblastoma (RGBM), or metastatic renal cell cancer (MRCC) in the United States
      who have been previously treated with Avastin (bevacizumab). The cohort will be composed of
      male and female subjects who have been diagnosed with locally recurrent BC or MBC, MCRC,
      MNSCLC, RGBM, or MRCC who have received treatment with bevacizumab in combination with
      chemotherapy, which started prior to or up to 31 December 2012. Participants will be
      self-referred to this study. They will be recruited online via a number of sources, including
      through the involvement of patient advocacy groups, social media tools, traditional media,
      physicians, and events to raise awareness of this study. After appropriate informed consent
      and authorization are obtained, data will be collected directly from subjects in an online
      survey. Participants will be contacted electronically to complete quarterly follow-up
      surveys. The follow-up period will be 1 year from responding to the baseline survey. DNA
      collection will be performed as part of this study. DNA will be extracted from saliva, which
      will be provided by the subject utilizing a collection kit sent to the participants for
      at-home use.
