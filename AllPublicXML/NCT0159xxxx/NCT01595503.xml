    <textblock>
      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a new noninvasive therapy that uses
      magnetic energy applied to the scalp to modulate activity in the underlying regions of the
      brain. In this study we will examine the efficacy of treating auditory hallucinations in
      schizophrenia with rTMS, comparing two methods to target stimulation to a language processing
      region of the brain. One method targets the stimulation site using scalp landmarks, while the
      other uses functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) combined with a language task.

    <description>Inhibitory (low frequency) 1-Hz rTMS will be applied to the secondary auditory cortex during 10 daily 20-minute treatment sessions. An fMRI scan combined with a language task will be used to localize the secondary auditory cortex, followed by neuronavigation to identify the scalp location overlying the targeted cortex.</description>

    <description>Inhibitory (low frequency) 1-Hz rTMS will be applied over the left temporoparietal cortex (TPC) during 10 daily 20-minute treatment sessions, with the stimulating coil located midway between the left temporal (T3) and parietal (P3) scalp landmarks, using the International 10-20 system for EEG.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Provide signed and dated informed consent form

          -  Male or female, aged 18 to 60

          -  Willing to comply with all study procedures and be available for the duration of the
             study

          -  Primary diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder according to DSM-IV
             (29)

          -  Currently reporting AHs, rated a minimum of 4 (moderate) on the auditory hallucination
             item of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS; 27), and AH will be present daily

          -  AHs must have failed to resolve after a minimum of two adequate trials (doses within
             standard therapeutic range for a minimum of 8 weeks each) of psychotropic medication
             including at least one atypical antipsychotic medication; documented trials of
             antipsychotic medication limited by intolerable side effects, e. g. extra-pyramidal
             symptoms, tardive dyskinesia, weight gain, neuroleptic-induced dysphoria, will also be
             considered as equivalent to adequate trials.

          -  Weight and girth compatible with the bore of the MRI scanner; generally men over 6
             feet tall &lt; 250 lbs, men under 6 feet tall &lt; 220 lbs, women over 5'11&quot; tall &lt; 220 lbs,
             or women under 5'10&quot; tall &lt; 200 lbs

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Substance abuse or dependence in the past 1 month

          -  Current or past history of serious medical or neurological illness that could
             compromise brain function or present an increased risk of seizure, e. g. conditions
             that may significantly alter electrolyte balance, stroke, epilepsy, any history of
             seizure;

          -  Pregnant or trying to become pregnant;

          -  Inability to tolerate small, enclosed spaces without anxiety;

          -  Metals, implants or metallic substances within or on the body that might cause adverse
             effects to the subject in a strong magnetic field, or interfere with image
             acquisition, e. g. aneurysm clips, retained particles, neurostimulators, foil-backed
             transdermal patches;

          -  Facial tattoos with metallic ink

          -  Inability to follow study protocol

          -  Change in antipsychotic therapy in previous 2 weeks

          -  Currently under an alternative treatment order

          -  Unstable symptoms which could, in the judgment of the study team, exhibit symptomatic
             worsening over the course of the protocol

          -  Current treatment with another investigational drug or other intervention

          -  Anything that, in the opinion of the investigator, would place the subject at
             increased risk or preclude the subject's full compliance with or completion of the
             study;

          -  No quantifiable motor threshold such that TMS dosage cannot be accurately determined
