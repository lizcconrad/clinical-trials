    <textblock>
      The study will investigate the effect of avocado consumption on markers of vascular health.
      Sixty participants will be enrolled in the 6-week study. A randomized parallel design will be
      utilized. Participants will either receive a typical American diet, or a modified typical
      American diet in which avocado is substituted for foods that contain moderate and high
      amounts of saturated fat, to allow the isoenergetic inclusion of avocado.

    <measure>Change in Endothelial Function</measure>
    <time_frame>0 hr and 3 hr at baseline and after 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Noninvasive endothelial function will be assessed, following a 12-hours fast, by measuring endothelium-dependent flow mediated dilation of the peripheral bed. Participants will then consume a test meal and endothelial function will be assessed again 3 hours later.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Blood Pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Blood pressure will be measured using a standardized protocol at the beginning and end of the intervention.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Gene Expression</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples will be used to test how the intervention affects gene expression. The expression of genes related to cardiovascular disease risk will be measured at the beginning and end of the 6-week intervention (fasted and post-prandially).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Biomarkers of Cardiovascular Disease Risk</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Blood will be collected at the beginning and end of the dietary intervention, following the endothelial function measurements (fasted and post-prandial collections). Blood will be assessed for biomarkers of cardiovascular disease risk, including electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride), markers of inflammation (IL-6, IL-10, IL-1 beta, C-reactive protein, TNF-alpha, fibrinogen, ICAM), markers of vascular function (endothelin-1, factor VII, plasminogen), and blood lipid panel (plasma total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides).</description>

          -  Volunteers who routinely participate in &quot;heavy&quot; exercise or volunteers who initiate an
             exercise program during the study.

          -  Volunteers who have lost 10% of body weight within the last 12 months

          -  Use of prescription or over-the-counter antiobesity medications or supplements (e.g.,
             phenylpropanalamine, ephedrine, caffeine, during and for at least 6 months prior to
             the start of the study) or history of a surgical intervention for obesity

          -  Active cardiovascular disease (such as heart attack or procedure within the past three
             months or participation in a cardiac rehabilitation program within last three months,
             stroke or history/treatment for transient ischemic attacks in the past three months,
