  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate whether a change in the pattern of hospitalisation was
      observed in paediatric wards over the last 6 years (June 2004 - May 2010), whether a change
      in staff workforce availability was observed in paediatric wards over the last 6 years
      (during a whole year or during specific time periods of the year) and if changes of any of
      the variables measured during the observation period could be linked to the introduction of
      rotavirus vaccination.

      This retrospective study will use data extracted from hospital databases during the period of
      the 1st of June 2004 until the 31st of May 2010. A coded list of all hospitalisations and of
      the different infection tests performed in children will be generated, together with a list
      of Full time equivalents (FTE) in paediatric ward and the number of sick leave days of the
      working personnel.
