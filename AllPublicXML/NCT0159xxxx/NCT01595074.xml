    <textblock>
      This research trial studies biomarkers in predicting treatment response in samples from
      patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer previously treated with adjuvant
      chemotherapy. Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help
      doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.
      It may also help doctors predict how patients will respond to treatment.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Validation of the 15-gene prognostic and predictive messenger (m) ribonucleic acid (RNA)
      signature on Lung Adjuvant Cisplatin Evaluation (LACE)-Bio formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
      tissue (FFPE) tumor samples.

      II. Exploratory evaluation of the prognostic and predictive values of known potential
      oncogenic mutations using LACE-Bio FFPE tumor samples.

      III. Exploratory evaluation of the prognostic and predictive values of gene copy variations
      using LACE-Bio FFPE tumor samples.

      IV. Exploratory identification and evaluation of prognostic and predictive value of novel
      genomic aberrations discovered by Next Generation Sequencing on LACE-Bio tumor samples.

      OUTLINE:

      Archived RNA and DNA samples are analyzed for gene expression, mutations, and variations by
      reverse transcriptase (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), mass spectrometry (MassARRAY),
      molecular inversion probe assay, and microarray assays. Results are then compared with
      patients' clinical outcomes.

    <description>Survival curves will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods and compared with the log-rank test. The hypothesis of constant risk ratio over time in the Cox proportional hazards (PH) model will be tested by introducing a time-dependent interaction with the marker or using Schoenfeld's residuals.</description>
