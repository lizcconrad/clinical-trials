  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to test whether taking testosterone can prevent loss of muscle mass
      and strength due to anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructive surgery. Testosterone is
      the principal male sex hormone and an anabolic (muscle promoting) steroid. It is essential
      for the development of male reproductive tissues and promotes increased muscle, bone mass,
      and the growth of body hair.

      The investigators hope to learn whether testosterone given before and after ACL
      reconstructive surgery will increase muscle mass and strength and potentially improve
      recovery time following surgery.

      Overall Objective: The overall objective of this study is to determine if 8 weeks of
      testosterone first administered 2 weeks prior to surgery, can improve the outcome of anterior
      cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction.

      Overall Hypothesis: Standard-of-care rehabilitation with the addition of testosterone
      administration will augment muscle mass, strength, and physical function following ACL
      reconstructive surgery compared to standard rehabilitation alone.

      Significance: Muscle mass and strength are greatly reduced following ACL surgery. The
      investigators hypothesize that administration of testosterone will minimize these reductions
      or potentially increase muscle mass and strength. In doing so, testosterone may hasten a
      patient's return to physical activity. If testosterone improves recovery after ACL surgery,
      the same treatment may be used for other injuries that involve trauma and muscle atrophy.
      Furthermore, this study will examine the effect of trauma with or without testosterone on
      myogenic regulators in muscle tissue taken during ACL surgery—providing possible mechanistic
      insights for the clinical outcomes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A complete ACL tear as visualized on MRI

          -  The ACL injury can be either &quot;isolated&quot; or combined with one or several of the
             following injuries visualized on MRI and/or arthroscopy:

          -  a meniscus tear that is either left untreated or treated with a partial resection

          -  a small, stable meniscus tear treated with fixation, but with the fixation not
