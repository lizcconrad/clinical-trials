  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate, through brief, one-on-one cognitive interviews, the
      efficacy of 'enhanced' acetaminophen messages and icons in improving consumer understanding
      and use of prescription (Rx) and non-prescription (over-the-counter, OTC) acetaminophen
      containing products compared to the current standard.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acetaminophen is a pain reliever and fever reducer found in many over-the-counter (OTC)
      analgesics as well as prescription (Rx) products commonly prescribed at discharge from the
      emergency department. 1 An estimated 36% of Americans ingest acetaminophen at least once a
      month.1, 2 While acetaminophen is generally safe and effective when used at recommended
      doses, acetaminophen overdose has surpassed viral hepatitis as the leading cause of acute
      liver failure (ALF) in the United States.2-4 Moreover, one half to two-thirds of overdoses
      leading to acute liver failure are unintentional, suggesting the root cause may be poor
      understanding of medication labeling or failure to recognize the consequences of exceeding
      the recommended maximum daily dosage.2-4 On-going studies by this research group have shown
      patient misunderstanding of dosing instructions and warnings associated with OTC medicines to
      be prevalent.

      It has also been suggested that patients receiving prescription medications containing
      acetaminophen may not be informed or aware of the potential risk of acetaminophen overuse
      when taking prescription products in combination with over-the-counter pain relievers.1 This
      is supported by the finding that a third of narcotic users were simultaneously using an OTC
      acetaminophen containing product in a multicenter study of ALF cases.2 To address the growing
      concern of acetaminophen misuse, in June 2009 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      convened a panel to discuss the maximum dose recommendations of acetaminophen found in OTC
      medications. The panel concluded that there was a notable lack of available evidence on
      consumer understanding and use of over-the-counter acetaminophen products. Studies are needed
      to explore patients' 1) knowledge of potential acetaminophen overdose when using prescription
      analgesics simultaneously with non-prescription acetaminophen and 2) avenues available to
      increase awareness of potential acetaminophen overdose from misuse of both OTC and Rx
      acetaminophen containing medicines.

    <description>Participants will be shown &quot;standard&quot; (defined as currently commercially available) over-the-counter and prescription medicine bottles and asked questions regarding safety and use. Participants will also be shown additional &quot;standard&quot; over-the-counter bottles and asked whether these comparison bottles could safely be taken in addition to the primary products shown.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Written Orientation</arm_group_label>
    <description>Participants will be exposed to over-the-counter and prescription bottles &quot;enhanced&quot; with an icon pertaining to active ingredient and asked questions regarding safety and use. Participants will be exposed to a flier describing the safe use of acetaminophen and orienting the participant towards the icon that is used to indicate the presence of acetaminophen in a product. This flier will be passively hanging within sight of the participant in the room, but no verbal explanation of the flier will be given to the participant. (This is designed to represent a passive education campaign such as posters in drug stores that may be used should these icons be adopted by manufacturers.)</description>

    <description>Participants will be exposed to over-the-counter and prescription bottles &quot;enhanced&quot; with an icon pertaining to active ingredient and asked questions regarding safety and use. Participants will be exposed to a flier describing the safe use of acetaminophen and orienting the participant towards the icon that is used to indicate the presence of acetaminophen in a product. Research personnel will also verbally go through the flier with the participant and answer any questions in a standardized fashion. (This is designed to represent an active education campaign such as pharmacist counseling that may be used should these icons be adopted by manufacturers.)</description>

    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Active Ingredient Icon</intervention_name>
    <description>Enhanced bottles will have a symbol, or icon, designed to draw attention to active ingredient information. The icon is a black hexagon containing two letters denoting the active ingredient of the medication (i.e. &quot;Ac&quot; for acetaminophen). Over-the-counter bottles will have the icon placed on the front of the bottle next to active ingredient information and on the back of the bottle in the drug facts to the left of the active ingredient information. Prescription bottles will have the icon placed below the directions for how to take the medication and will be accompanied by a brief statement indicating the medicine contains acetaminophen.</description>
