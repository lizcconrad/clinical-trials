  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To prospectively assess the outcomes of robotic sacrocolpopexy for repair of pelvic organ
      prolapse in high volume european centers.

      Primary outcome: anatomical cure rate (using simplified POP-Q staging system)

      Secondary outcomes:

      complication assessment (Clavien-Dindo), functional results, intraoperative variables, impact
      of surgery on quality of life (PFIQ-7, PISQ-12)

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>anatomical cure after robotic assisted sacrocolpopexy (or absence of recurrent prolapse)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>anatomical cure (defined as any simplified POP-Q point &lt;2) will be assessed at regular intervals(see time frame). If any postoperative POP-Q point will be ≥2, this will be recorded as a recurrent prolapse.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>intra- peri- and postoperative complications</measure>
    <time_frame>intraoperative to 6 weeks after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>complications occurring during surgery are defined as &quot;intraoperative complication&quot;, within 3 weeks from surgery will be defined as &quot;perioperative complication&quot;. Complications occurring after this timeframe will be regarded as &quot;late complications&quot;, if related to surgery (e.g. mesh erosion)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks, 6 months, 1 year (yearly thereafter, if feasible)</time_frame>
    <description>impact of prolapse repair on quality of life will be assessed via specific validated questionnaires (PFIQ-7, PISQ-12)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>postoperative pain</measure>
    <time_frame>on postoperative day 1</time_frame>
    <description>pain will be assessed on a visual analogue scale (range 0 to 10= 0 no pain, 10 unbearable pain)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>intraoperative variables</measure>
    <time_frame>intraoperative</time_frame>
    <description>intraoperative variables are recorded, such as: blood loss, duration of surgery (divided in robotic setup time, console time and surgery completion time). Concomitant procedures, such as adhesiolysis will also be recorded</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>impact of uterus management</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks, 6 months, 1 year (yearly thereafter, if feasible)</time_frame>
    <description>logistic regression analysis will be performed to evaluate if different surgical approaches in presence, -or absence, of the uterus (e.g. supracervical hysterectomy, uterus sparing surgery), have an effect on primary and secondary outcomes</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
