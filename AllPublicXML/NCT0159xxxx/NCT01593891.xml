      To determine the safety and validity of venous angioplasty and valvuloplasty in the treatment
      of CCSVI. In addition, it will allow researchers to sub-classify valve morphology in relation
      to treatment success. This will be evidenced by venous patency forty-eight hours by Doppler
      ultrasound as well as clinical symptom improvement.

        Many questions remain about how and when CCSVI might play a role in nervous system damage
        and whether venous angioplasty is helpful in treating the symptoms of CCSVI. Utilizing
        intravascular ultrasound (IVUS,) this pilot study will provide data that will allow
        researchers to evaluate venous morphology pre- and post- percutaneous angioplasty and
        sub-classify valve morphology as related to treatment success by distinguishing vessels
        which are more responsive to treatment. In addition, this study will validate the safety of
        valvuloplasty in various neurodegenerative disorders that involve venous obstruction.
