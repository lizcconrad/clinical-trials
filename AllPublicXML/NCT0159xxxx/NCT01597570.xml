  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is purposed to verify a superiority of the Fastseal® Bioabsorbable Vascular Access Closure
      System through effectiveness and safety confirmation of hemostasis (TTH; Time to hemstasis)
      and ambulation (TTA; Time to ambulation) at the puncture site of common femoral artery (CFA)
      after the procedures of Fastseal® Biosorbable Vascular Access Closure System or Perclose®
      ProGlide Suture-Mediated Closure System during 1 month observation.

      Prospective, Single blind, randomized

      Comparative study using the Fastseal® Bioabsorbable Vascular Access Closure System as an
      investigational device and the Perclose® ProGlide Suture-Mediated Closure System as a
      comparator.

      After going through the confirmation of inclusion/exclusion criteria with signed subjects,
      they will have a procedure either of the two devices. The subjects should follow designated
      physician's instructions accurately during the clinical trial period.There are about 6 times
      evaluations Including screening.
