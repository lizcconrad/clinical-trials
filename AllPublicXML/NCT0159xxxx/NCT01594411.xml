      This is a prospective, multi-center study examining the clinical impact of the Corus CAD
      (Age/Sex/Gene Expression score - ASGES) assay in approximately 250 evaluable subjects with no
      history of obstructive coronary artery disease who now present with chest pain or
      anginal-equivalent symptoms to a primary care physician (PCP) for evaluation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In symptomatic patients with or without prior cardiac testing, the PCP will initially decide
      the subject's pretest probability for coronary artery disease (CAD) based on the subject's
      risk factors and quality of chest pain (typical or atypical), or anginal equivalent (e.g.,
      jaw, arm pain, or unexplained shortness of breath) and consider the results of prior testing,
      if applicable. The initial questionnaire will capture the PCP's initial clinical impression
      and decision ('preliminary decision') on how to further evaluate and manage the patient. A
      Corus CAD (Age/Sex/Gene Expression score - ASGES) assay will be performed at the PCP's
      office. After the PCP has received the Corus CAD (ASGES) result (approximately 2-3 days
      later), the PCP will decide on the appropriate evaluation and management of the patient
      ('final decision') using the Corus CAD (ASGES) result in conjunction with his/her clinical
      impression and/or other clinical data available. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate
      whether the Corus CAD (ASGES) test results is associated with a change in the PCPs'
      diagnostic evaluation and management of patients as compared to their initial testing and
      treatment decisions.

      Since it takes approximately two days for the physician to receive the result of the Corus
      CAD (ASGES), symptomatic subjects with unstable angina, or suspicion for myocardial
      infarction will be excluded from the study.

      A follow-up phone call and a detailed questionnaire will be performed at 30 + 15 days, from
      the time of blood draw, to assess the triage decision, such as referral to any subspecialists
      (cardiologist, gastroenterologist, and pulmonologist), cardiac diagnostic tests performed,
      cardiac procedures performed, and results of these cardiac tests and procedures.

    <time_frame>pre- and post- gene expression testing results (on average 2-3 days to receive ASGES)</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective was to assess whether the Age/Sex/Gene Expression Score (ASGES) altered clinicians' evaluations, defined by a change in patient management from preliminary to final decision. The change was prospectively defined as a downgrade or upgrade in intensity of the diagnostic plan based on the following hierarchical categories:(1) no further cardiac testing or treatment, (2) lifestyle changes or medical therapy, (3) stress testing (with or without imaging) or computed tomography/coronary angiography, or (4) invasive coronary angiography. The ASGES algorithm comprises expression values for 23 genes from peripheral blood cells in 6 terms, patient age, and sex. The changes in gene expression are quantified using an algorithm that generates a ASGES ranging from 1 to 40. A score &lt;=15 indicates a low risk of underlying obstructive coronary disease. The ASGES has a negative predictive value of 96% for ASGES &lt;=15 in a population referred to myocardial perfusion imaging.</description>

          <title>Age/Sex/Gene Expression Score</title>
          <description>The ASGES algorithm comprises expression values for 23 genes from peripheral blood cells in 6 terms, patient age, and sex. There are both sex-specific and common algorithm terms with sex-specific weights. The changes in gene expression are quantified using an algorithm that generates a ASGES ranging from 1 to 40. A score less than or equal to 5 indicates a low risk of underlying obstructive coronary disease.The ASGES has been shown to have a negative predictive value of 96% for ASGES less than or equal to 15 in a population referred to MPI.</description>

        <title>Change in Clinicians' Treatment Decision After Age/Sex/Gene Expression Score</title>
        <description>The primary objective was to assess whether the Age/Sex/Gene Expression Score (ASGES) altered clinicians' evaluations, defined by a change in patient management from preliminary to final decision. The change was prospectively defined as a downgrade or upgrade in intensity of the diagnostic plan based on the following hierarchical categories:(1) no further cardiac testing or treatment, (2) lifestyle changes or medical therapy, (3) stress testing (with or without imaging) or computed tomography/coronary angiography, or (4) invasive coronary angiography. The ASGES algorithm comprises expression values for 23 genes from peripheral blood cells in 6 terms, patient age, and sex. The changes in gene expression are quantified using an algorithm that generates a ASGES ranging from 1 to 40. A score &lt;=15 indicates a low risk of underlying obstructive coronary disease. The ASGES has a negative predictive value of 96% for ASGES &lt;=15 in a population referred to myocardial perfusion imaging.</description>
