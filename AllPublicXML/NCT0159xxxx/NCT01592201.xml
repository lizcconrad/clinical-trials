  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the patient satisfaction between continued
      administration of previous antipsychotics versus switched administration to paliperidone ER
      in non-satisfied patients with previous (paliperidone)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (patients are assigned to intervention by chance), prospective,
      open-label (all people involved know the identity of the assigned drug), switch study
      designed to evaluate patient-assessed medication satisfaction after 12 weeks of treatment in
      patients with schizophrenia. The total duration of this study is 12 weeks. Outpatients who
      treated atypical antipsychotics and report dissatisfaction (Medication Satisfaction
      Questionnaire [MSQ] &lt;4) with their current treatment response are eligible to participate in
      the study. Patients will be randomized into two groups, 1) Patients randomized to an
      immediate initiation of paliperidone ER for a total 12 weeks 2) Patients randomized to a
      delayed initiation will continue their previous atypical antipsychotics for 8 weeks and then
      be initiated on paliperidone ER at Day 56 for 4 weeks. During the study treatment
      optimization will be done by dose adjustment (dose increase or decrease) and by adding
      psychotropic agents except the antipsychotics.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the medication satisfaction questionnaire (MSQ) score at Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>A single-item, global, patient-completed instrument that is read aloud to patients by clinicians designed to assess treatment satisfaction among patients with schizophrenia. It consists of one question: &quot;Overall, how satisfied are you with your current antipsychotic medication(s)?&quot; with responses assessed on a 7-point scale rated as follows: 1 = extremely dissatisfied, 2=very dissatisfied, 3=somewhat dissatisfied, 4=neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, 5=somewhat satisfied, 6 = very satisfied, 7 = extremely satisfied</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Positive and negative symptoms scale (PANSS) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS provides a total score (sum of the scores of all 30 items) and scores for 3 subscales, the positive subscale (7 items), the negative subscale (7 items), and the general psychopathology subscale (16 items), each rated on a scale of 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme). It's designed to capture symptoms of schizophrenia. (Gold standard)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Drug Attitude Inventory (DAI)-10 Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>DAI-10 is a 10-item scale developed to assess how the attitude of schizophrenia patients toward their medications may affect compliance (-10~+10)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S rating scale is used to rate the severity of a patient's psychotic condition on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (not ill) to 7 (extremely severe)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>This scale assesses the degree of dysfunction a patient exhibits within 4 domains of behavior: socially useful activities, personal and social relationships, self-care, and disturbing and aggressive behavior. The score ranges from 1 to 100, divided into 10 equal intervals to rate the degree of difficulty (i, absent to vi, very severe) in each of the 4 domains. Based on the four domains there will be one total score. Patient's with a score of 71 to 100 have a mild degree of difficulty; from 31 to 70, varying degrees of disability; ≤ 30, functioning so poorly as to require intensive supervision</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep Visual Analog Scale (Sleep VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>This self-administered scale rates quality of sleep and daytime drowsiness. Patient's will indicate on an 11- point scale (from 0 to 10) how well they have slept in the previous 7 days (&quot;very badly&quot; to &quot;very well&quot;) and how often they have felt drowsy within the previous 7 days (&quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;all the time&quot;). On the sleep evaluation scale, score '0' corresponds to 'very badly' and score '10' to 'very well'. On the daytime drowsiness scale, score '0' corresponds to 'not at all' and score '10' to 'all the time</description>
