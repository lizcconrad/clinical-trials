  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gilenya (fingolimod) is approved for multiple sclerosis. However, it is unclear of its
      clinical effect in the Hispanics with MS given that clinical studies had limited
      representation of this population. It is also unclear if Gilenya would be as effective in
      individuals with disease predominantly affecting the optic nerve and spinal cord (OSMS)
      commonly seen in Asian populations.

      Objectives: To compare the clinical response of Gilenya® (fingolimod) in relapsing remitting
      OSMS and MS of Hispanic descent using ancestral markers as a biomarker of treatment response
      and clinical disease state.

  <detailed_description>

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the success of Gilenya® (fingolimod)
      treatment in patients with MS of Hispanic descent relative to their ancestral background.
      Therapeutic success will be determined by annualized relapse rate (ARR; defined as the number
      of relapses divided by the person years followed) after initiation of treatment with Gilenya®
      (fingolimod)in comparison to the relapse rate in the previous 12 months. This will be
      determined based on medical chart extraction, in-person assessment and regular clinical
      follow-up.

      A secondary objective of this study is to investigate whether the efficacy of Gilenya®
      (fingolimod) is superior or equal in HW which have higher loads of Amerindian versus
      Caucasian background with opticospinal MS (OSMS-NMO neg) versus classical MS (CMS) in the
      first 12 months using radiological and clinical parameters. The following measures will be
      obtained:

        1. Number of relapse-free patients over the investigational period

        2. Site of relapse defined as brain or spinal cord.

        3. Sustained Disability progression will be defined as a one point (1) increase from
           baseline in patients with baseline EDSS score from 0 to 5.0; or half a point (0.5)
           increase in patients with baseline EDSS score of 5-5.5 or above after 3 months.

        4. MRI changes as described as number of new T2 lesions and number of Gd-enhancing lesions
           after 12 months from baseline.

        We will recruit 50 individuals with MS who self identify Hispanic descent and are served at
        USC clinics. Hispanic patients with clinically definite MS, defined by the newly revised
        McDonald criteria, will be offered the opportunity to participate in this study and asked
        to give informed consent.

    <sampling_method>Non-Probability Sample</sampling_method>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically definite multiple sclerosis defined by McDonald Criteria (8) with a score
             of 0 to 5.5 on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)(9). Inclusion will also be
             determined by PI if clinically indicated. Relapsing remitting form of MS.

          -  Between 18-65 years of age (This age range is selected so as to capture the vast
             majority of patients who are seen in the clinics with a confirmed diagnosed of MS.
             This age range also allows for exclusion of co-morbid conditions that may be
             associated with aging as well as pediatric cases where their disease characteristics
             have been shown to be different).

          -  Ability to understand and sign the IRB-approved informed consent form prior to the
             performance of any study-specific procedures and is willing to comply with the
             required scheduling and assessments of the protocol.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at the
             Screening Visit and must be willing to practice a reliable birth-control method.

          -  Patient must be willing to discontinue and remain free from concomitant
             immunosuppressive or additional immunomodulatory treatment (including IFNβ1a, 1b,
