  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis is a chronic disease characterized by itching and eczematous lesions. In
      adults, eczema commonly localizes to the hands or feet. Several studies have implicated
      bacterial contamination, especially with Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), to be a factor in
      atopic dermatitis, as infection with this bacteria correlates with disease severity. No trial
      to date has investigated how to treat S. aureus infection in adults with hand or hand/foot
      dermatitis. Using retapamulin ointment in the nose and on the hands or hands/feet, the
      investigators expect to have a significant clearance rate of s. aureus infection. The
      investigators believe that treating the bacterial infection along with treating the condition
      with a topical corticosteroid will significantly decrease the severity of hand/foot
      dermatitis in our study population.

      Primary Study Objectives:

        1. To evaluate the efficacy of retapamulin 1% ointment with clobetasol propionate 0.05%
           foam versus vehicle ointment with clobetasol propionate 0.05% foam as a treatment
           regimen for hand or hand/foot atopic dermatitis.

        2. To evaluate the incidence of intranasal and hand/foot S aureus carriage rates in
           subjects with hand/foot atopic dermatitis via cultures of an anterior nare and the most
           severely graded target lesion of the hand/foot dermatitis.

        3. To evaluate the incidence of mupirocin-resistance and methicillin-resistance in S aureus
           isolates in subjects with hand/foot atopic dermatitis via cultures of an anterior nare
           and the most severely graded target lesion of the hand/foot dermatitis.

      Primary and secondary endpoints will be analyzed by appropriate statistical models by a
      qualified statistician. Any results of this pilot study will be treated as exploratory and
      hypothesis generating.
