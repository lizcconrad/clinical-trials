  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Modern anti-cancer treatments are focused on development of molecular based therapies i.e.
      specific treatments targeted against underlying biological processes. There is still much to
      learn about the biology of cancer, especially in tumours such as colorectal and lung cancer
      where it is likely multiple heterogenous signaling pathways are responsible for progression
      of disease. This project aims to evaluate circulating tumour cells (CTCs) as a surrogate
      biomarker for tumour characteristics and to determine how they may used to identify new
      targets for therapeutic agents. Their use could be applied to diagnosis of cancer, prediction
      of response to therapies and prognosis, ultimately across a broad range of tumour types.
      Currently the only way to investigate molecular features of a cancer is through procurement
      of an invasive tumour biopsy that is often difficult to obtain, often results in insufficient
      material and is unpleasant for the patient. A blood-based test would provide a much more
      practical and patient friendly alternative. The enumeration and molecular characterisation of
      CTCs has the novel potential of being a &quot;virtual biopsy&quot; of the tumour and offers the
      opportunity for immediate therapeutic decisions (eg. if the tumour develops a therapy
      resistant genotype while on treatment). CTCs have been known to circulate in bloodstream of
      cancer patients for many years and are known to lead to cancer metastases. They have been
      very difficult to detect, up until recently, due to the complexity of the metastatic process
      and detecting relatively small numbers of CTCs amongst billions of red and white blood cells.
      However, technology has moved on dramatically in the last few years. The FDA approved
      CellSearch platform (Veridex, NJ) can isolate and enumerate CTCs based on the immunomagnetic
      capture of EpCAM (epithelial cell adhesion molecule) positive cells. Several studies have
      recently demonstrated the value of CTC enumeration in reflecting prognosis and predicting
      early response to systemic chemotherapy. For example, in a study comprising 456 patients with
      metastatic colorectal cancer starting a new line of therapy, patients with =3 CTCs per 7.5 ml
      blood at baseline had shorter progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)
      compared to those patients with &lt; 3CTCs at baseline (PFS 4.5 versus 7.9 months P=0.0001; OS
      8.5 versus 19.1 months P=0.0000 respectively). Overall survival for patients converting to or
      maintaining CTCs =3 within a few weeks of commencing systemic therapy remained worse than for
      those patients maintaining CTC counts &lt; 3 per 7.5ml blood. Similar results have been reported
      in patients with breast and hormone refractory prostate cancer (HRPC). These studies have led
      to FDA approval of the CellSearch system as an adjunct to monitoring patients with these 3
      tumour types. The CellSearch platform, however, does not allow for the downstream DNA
      analysis of captured cells and the ferroparticle-coated CTCs are non-viable. Furthermore,
      this platform is a multi-machine, multi-kit system that is laborious (typical 3-7 days
      turnover time), expensive (USD 650), and subject to operator variance. In this protocol, the
      investigators propose for the first time, an automated, fully quantitative system for
      isolation and enrichment of CTCs. The key differentiating feature of our novel CMOS system is
      the electrochemical identification and counting of tumour cells using a high density
      electrode array with associated electronics for addressing the electrodes. This leads to a
      standardized assay for tumour cells with a shorter turnover time and without the need of a
      skilled operator. This system also holds the potential for allowing the molecular
      characterization of CTCs. This study aims to enumerate CTCs using a novel CMOS technology in
      patients with metastatic cancer who are scheduled to receive palliative chemotherapy, and to
      correlate CTC number with clinical outcome. In Part I of the study, the investigators will
      recruit 10 patients with metastatic NSCLC and 10 patients with metastatic CRC in order to
      assess the feasibility of CTC enumeration in patients. In particular, the investigators aim
      to establish whether CTCs are detectable using the novel CMOS technology in patients with
      metastatic cancer. In Part II of the study, the investigators will recruit 21 patients with
      metastatic NSCLC and 89 patients with metastatic CRC in order to compare CTC counts as
      determined by the CMOS technology with CTC counts as determined by the CellSearch platform.
      Blood samples will be collected at a single time point prior to the start of palliative
      chemotherapy. CTC numbers will be correlated with clinical outcome in all evaluable patients.

      The investigators hypothesize that CTC enumeration by a novel CMOS technology is non-inferior
      to CTC enumeration by the CellSearch platform in patients with advanced solid malignancies.
