      The study is a prospective, non-controlled, open-label multi-centre pilot safety study of
      iron isomaltoside 1000 (Monofer®) administered to subjects with anaemia and Inflammatory
      Bowel Disease (IBD). Based upon haemoglobin (Hb) level, the subjects are divided into two
      treatment groups, A and B. Depending on the body weight, subjects in Treatment Group A will
      receive a total dose of 1,500 mg or 2,000 mg IV iron isomaltoside 1000 as a single infusion,
      whereas subjects in Treatment Group B will receive a total dose of 2,500 mg or 3,000 mg IV
      iron isomaltoside 1000 divided into two administrations.

      Subjects with a diagnosis of IBD (Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) and IDA ( Iron
      Deficiency Anaemia) with or without concomi-tant inflammation will be enrolled to receive a
      high dose of IV iron isomaltoside 1000.
