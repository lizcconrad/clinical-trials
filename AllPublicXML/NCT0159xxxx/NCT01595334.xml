  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      1. Leutinizing hormone (LH) has been demonstrated to exert variable physiological actions
           during menstrual cycle at appropriate plasma levels'

        2. In early follicular phase,in the requisite range,LH is known to contribute to maturation
           of oocyte during transition phase from metaphase-1(M1) to metaphase-2 (M2).

        3. If during this transition, appropriate level of LH can be maintained either through the
           use of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist if found excessive or
           supplementation with exogenous LH, if found deficient, maturation process can be
           enhanced.

        4. Further maintenance of suitable combination of recombinant follicle stimulating hormone
           (rFSH) + rLH can help in realizing higher yield of mature M2 oocytes,with higher
           probability of establishing clinical pregnancy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is planned to assess whether maintenance of levels of LH through the use of GnRH
      antagonist would contribute to obtaining mature M2 oocytes so that maximum number of good
      quality embryo's with potential to implant is obtained.

      The mature oocytes would be subjected to either standard in-vitro fertilization (IVF) or
      intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) depending on the status of the male factor.

      The objective would be to obtain good quality embryo's with implantation potential for fresh
      embryo transfer and/or subsequent frozen thaw embryo transfer.

      In both these events, the secondary outcome measures would be establishment of clinical
      pregnancy by transvaginal ultrasound performed 6 weeks after embryo transfer.

INTRVENTIONS - Monitoring at regular intervals by transvaginal ultrasound and hormonal studies.Once pregnancy established by beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and ultrasound will be supported by intervention of adequate luteal support by estrogen (E) + progesterone (P) for 12 weeks of gestation.</description>

    <description>Control subjects selected in randomized way,desiring pregnancy will be treated with gonadotrophins, rFSH and rLH in appropriate dosages considering age, BMI, ovarian reserve, etc. after standard downregulation with GnRH agonist, Leuprolide acetate, 1 mg/d under established `Long Luteal Suppression Protocol` from the previous cycle.
INTERVENTIONS - Monitoring of response to treatment by hormonal study and sonography evaluation at regular intervals during COH till adequate number of mature follicles of minimum 18 mm mean diameter is achieved, to be followed by hCG trigger and ovum pick-up (OPU) and embryo transfer (ET). Chemical pregnancy by beta-hCG would be confirmed 14 days post-ET. Clinical pregnancy would be confirmed by sonography 6 weeks after ET (visibility of yolk sac and fetal heart-beat). Pregnancy support by E+P for 12 weeks would be provided.</description>
