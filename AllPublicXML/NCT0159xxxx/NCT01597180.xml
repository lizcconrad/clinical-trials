  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to learn about potential interactions between raltegravir and a
      birth control pill in HIV+ women. The investigators plan to enroll HIV+ women who are on
      steady state raltegravir containing highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), ages 20-40,
      inclusive, who report regular monthly menses.

      The investigators will investigate drug interactions of raltegravir, ethinyl estradiol (EE)
      and levonorgestrel (LNG). All women will be receiving raltegravir as part of their regular
      medical care. Women will be enrolled in the study for approximately 8 months.
