  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many publications deal with the natural history of aortic aneurysms in literature. Except for
      connective tissue disorders as Marfan or Loeys-Dietz syndrome, aortic aneurysms are a complex
      multifactorial disease with genetic and environmental risk factors. Susceptibility loci
      identified in thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA) and abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) do not
      overlap, suggesting that different genetic risk factors contribute to these two forms of
      aneuryms. With a higher prevalence correlated to ageing (5%), AAA is usually presented as the
      degenerative form of the disease. However, a recent epidemiologic study by Olsson et al. has
      revealed an increasing incidence of thoracic aortic disease among older individuals (70+/-12
      years) with 60% of aneurysmal rupture or dissection at diagnosis, and a 1.7 :1 male-to-female
      ratio compared to 6:1 in AAA. From this current knowledge arises the concept of diffuse or
      plurisegmental degenerative aneurysmal aortic disease, poorly explored so far. As regards to
      the prevention policy, there is a consensus statement in which ultrasonography screening for
      AAA is recommended for all individuals aged &gt; 60 years (particularly in men who have ever
      smoked) and for those aged &gt; 50 years with family history of AAA. Nevertheless, screening for
      a concomittant thoracic location of the disease (except thoracoabdominal aneurysm) is not yet
      required, whereas it could change the prognosis of the patients and influence their
      management.

      Through the constitution of a multicentric prospective cohort of patients with infra-renal
      AAA (n=450), the investigators aimed to determine the prevalence of a concomitant TAA, and
      the epidemiologic, clinical, biological and genetic factors related to this aortic phenotype.
      Therefore, the investigators postulate for a prevalence of the AAA-TAA association inferior
      or equal to 15%. By the use of an innovating software (AMIRA) to analyse scans, the
      investigators will perform reproductive measurements of segmental diameters from a segmental
      aortic volumetric numerized imaging, and describe the different thoracic aortic phenotypes
      associated with AAA, including the form (TAA, penetrating ulcer, dolichoaorta …) and the
      location of the disease.
