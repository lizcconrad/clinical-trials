  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of α-galactosidase in
      pediatric patients with predominant gas-related symptoms.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders complain of gas-related symptoms
      which can negatively affect quality of life, even in pediatric age.

      Dietary and life-style changes, administration of simethicone, activated charcoal and
      probiotics may reduce intestinal gas but often results are unsatisfactory.

      Literature shows that α-galactosidase is effective to reduce gas production and related
      symptoms in adults.
