  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Graft versus host disease (GVHD) is one of the major causes of death in patients undergoing
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Despite prophylactic measures, the
      incidence of acute GVHD is estimated at 40-60% among patients receiving transplants from
      HLA-identical sibling donors, and may even reach 75% in patients receiving HLA-matched
      unrelated transplants. More effective prevention and treatment strategies are needed.

      The immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties of Cannabinoids have been shown in
      animal models of various inflammatory diseases including multiple sclerosis, inflammatory
      bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis.

      Cannabidiol is a major non-psychoactive cannabinoid, which has potent anti-inflammatory and
      immunosuppressive effects.

      As such, it may be effective for both prevention and treatment of acute GVHD after allogeneic
      stem cell transplantation.

    <description>Patients undergoing allogeneic SCT will receive standard GVHD prophylaxis consisting of a calcineurin inhibitor and methotrexate or mycophenolate mofetil. Patients developing grade I/II acute GVHD will be treated by IV or oral methylprednisolone 1-2 mg/kg/day and oral cannabidiol at a starting dose of 10 mg twice daily. Doses of cannabidiol can be escalated every day according to clinical response to a maximal dose of 600 mg/day,if no significant drug related side effects present (CTCAE3 grade&gt;2). Cannabidiol will be given up to 90 days.</description>
