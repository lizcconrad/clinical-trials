  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of SAF312 in patients with
      overactive bladder disease due to spinal cord lesions. The overactive bladder of patients who
      qualify for this study is insufficiently managed by antimuscarinic therapy, or patients
      poorly tolerate the treatment with antimuscarinic drugs. The efficacy of SAF312 will be
      primarily determined via urodynamic measurements.
