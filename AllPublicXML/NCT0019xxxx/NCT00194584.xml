    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of this research is to strengthen parents' abilities to manage the
      complexities of childhood chronic illness. To achieve this goal, the team of parents, health
      care professionals, and researchers proposes the following specific aim:

        -  Develop, implement, and test a unique psycho-educational program, Living with Childhood
           Chronic Illness (the Program), for effectiveness with parents of children who have
           chronic illnesses.

      The investigators propose the following hypotheses:

      At both 6 and 12 month follow-up points, parents taking part in the intervention, in contrast
      to control parents, will have:

        1. Greater perceived self-efficacy regarding their ability to manage the child's chronic
           condition;

        2. Greater parental ability to involve their child in shared management activities;

        3. Greater parental ability to cope at 6 and 12 months following the end of the
           intervention;

        4. Greater emotional health; and

        5. Greater parental perceived family quality of life.

      Parents will enroll in the study by contacting the study number: 206-987-1000 or by sending
      an email message to family.strengths@seattlechildrens.org. They will complete a survey taking
      no more than 60 minutes. Parents will then be randomized to either take the class immediately
      or be in the control group which can take the class in 12 months. At the end of 6 and 12
      months all the participants again take the survey.

      Classes are 7 weeks in length, 2 hours each and are offered at various locations throughout
      the Greater Seattle area.
