  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Management of lung cancer remains very controversial for elderly patients (pts) and they are
      often excluded from clinical trials. We present here a survey performed about the management
      of lung cancer pts aged 70 or more in France. All pts aged 70 or more with
      histo/cytologically proved lung cancer diagnosed between sept 02 and oct 03 in participating
      centers were recorded and their characteristics, the diagnostic procedures, therapeutic
      management and survival were analysed.
