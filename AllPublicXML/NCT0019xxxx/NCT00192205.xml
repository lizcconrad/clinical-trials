      -  The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of the liquid formulation of CAIV-T
           with TIV against culture confirmed influenza illness in children with a history of
           recurrent RTIs aged at least 6 months and less than 72 months of age.

        -  The trial also provides the opportunity to compare the efficacy of CAIV-T with TIV on
           acute otitis media.
