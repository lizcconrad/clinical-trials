    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study was to determine the proportion of subjects, seronegative
      to all three strains of influenza, as defined by a serum hemagglutination inhibition
      antibodies (HAI) antibody titer of &lt;1:10, who shed each vaccine virus strain following a
      single dose of CAIV-T.

             severe malnutrition), including progressive neurological disease;

          -  with Down's syndrome or other known cytogenetic disorders;

          -  with a known or suspected disease of the immune system or those receiving

          -  have an immunosuppressed or an immunocompromised individual living in the same
             household;

          -  with a documented history of hypersensitivity to egg or egg protein or any other

          -  who, at anytime prior to study enrollment, receives any influenza vaccine (commercial
             or investigational);

          -  with any medical conditions that in the opinion of the investigator might interfere
