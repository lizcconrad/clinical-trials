  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In previous phase 2 studies, pemetrexed has shown antitumor activity in advanced non-small
      cell lung cancer as a single agent as well as in combination with cisplatin. Since the
      introduction of vitamin supplementation, pemetrexed has shown good tolerance and high safety.
      Vitamin supplementation has opened the opportunity to offer patients higher pemetrexed
      dosing, as has been demonstrated by a recent Phase 1 study. The higher dose with
      supplementation may increase pemetrexed's efficacy without unduly compromising safety. The
      present Phase 2 study will use pemetrexed dosing that is tailored to individual patient
      tolerance, and is an effort to determine the efficacy and safety of this approach in patients
      with advanced NSCLC who had prior chemotherapy.
