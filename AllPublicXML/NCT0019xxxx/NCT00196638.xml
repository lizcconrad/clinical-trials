  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of acute primary HIV infection may improve long-term outcome. However, optimal
      treatment is still debated. The ANRS 112-INTERPRIM trial evaluates three different
      therapeutical strategies, combining permanent or intermittent HAART and a cytokine,
      interferon alpha, in order to determine which combination allows the best control of HIV
      viremia after 24 weeks of antiretroviral treatment interruption

      Treatment of acute primary HIV infection may improve long-term outcome. However, optimal
      treatment is still debated. The main objective of this multicentric randomized phase II/III
      study is to compare HIV viremia 92 and 96 weeks after acute primary HIV infection, between
      patients treated with 3 different strategies. In the first group, patients receive
      antiretroviral drugs (HAART) continuously up to week 72. In the second group, patients
      receive HAART continuously up to week 36, then intermittently up to week 72. In the third
      group, patients receive HAART as in group II, and pegylated interferon alpha is administered
      for the initial 14 weeks, then for 3 weeks at each of the 3 HAART interruption between week
      36 and week 72. All patients are monitored without any HAART up to week 96. Enrolled patients
      have circulating p24 antigen and/or HIV viremia, an uncompleted HIV western blot, between 18
      and 65 years old, and agree to participate to the study. They should have received no
      antiretroviral drugs, not be pregnant, without neuro-psychological or autoimmune disorders,
      without chronic hepatitis. Secondary objectives of the study are: the quality of immune
      restoration, the anti-HIV immune response, safety and adhesion to treatment. A total of 90
      patients (30 in each group) have been enrolled.
