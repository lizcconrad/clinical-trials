  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether infusion of hypertonic saline dextran
      attenuates the inflammatory response and the water overload, during and after major cardiac
      surgery in small children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After major cardiac surgery in small children, extravasation of fluid due to increased
      capillary leak has negative effect on haemodynamics and respiration. Inflammation cascades
      are activated by surgery and the use of cardio pulmonary bypass (CPB). We want to test
      whether a small infusion of 7.5% NaCl in 6% dextran solution before and after CPB reduces
      inflammatory activation by measuring the levels of interleukins 6 and 8 (IL-6, IL-8). We also
      measure extravascular lung water, fluid balance and weight during the first 24 hours post
      CPB.
