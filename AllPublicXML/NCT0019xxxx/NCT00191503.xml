  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is no standard treatment for the patient population being asked to participate in this
      study. Although one current regimen, used by some investigators, has a high rate of response
      compared to other therapies, it is associated with moderate to severe toxicity. As
      gemcitabine and pemetrexed have a broad range of activity against cancer it is reasonable to
      determine how active and safe they are against patients with this type of cancer.The
      objective of this study is to determine the anti-tumor activity of pemetrexed and gemcitabine
      in patients with this condition.
