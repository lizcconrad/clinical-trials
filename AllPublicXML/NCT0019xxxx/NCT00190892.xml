  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess the superiority of olanzapine plus carbamazepine versus placebo plus carbamazepine in improving overall manic symptomatology in patients with mania associated with bipolar I disorder.</measure>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Improvement is measured by a reduction in the total score of the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) from baseline to endpoint during the 6-week, double-blind treatment phase.</measure>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To compare the efficacy and safety of up to 6 weeks of double-blind, concomitant use of olanzapine plus carbamazepine to the concomitant use of placebo plus carbamazepine</measure>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Using the following assessments:</measure>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>rate of response and time to response over 6 weeks of the double-blind treatment phase, with response defined as a reduction of 50% or more in the YMRS total score from baseline to endpoint.</measure>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>rate of remission and time to remission of mania over 6 weeks of the double-blind treatment phase, with remission defined as a score less than or equal to 12 on the YMRS total score at endpoint</measure>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>reductions from baseline to the endpoint of the 6-week, double-blind treatment phase on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score</measure>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>reductions from baseline to the endpoint of the 6-week, double-blind treatment phase on the Clinical Global Impressions-Bipolar Version Severity of Illness Scale (CGI-BP)score</measure>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>rate of switch to depression and time to switch to depression, with switch to depression defined as a baseline MADRS total score less than or equal to 12 followed by</measure>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>either a post baseline MADRS total score greater than or equal to 16 over the 6 weeks of the double-blind treatment phase OR, hospitalization due to deterioration in clinical</measure>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>symptoms of depression</measure>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>longitudinal effects from baseline across visits of the double-blind treatment phase by comparing changes in YMRS total scores</measure>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>changes in vital signs and weight, laboratory analytes, and electrocardiograms (ECGs), and the incidence and severity of TEAEs and extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS)</measure>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>using the Barnes Akathisia Scale, Simpson-Angus Scale and the AIMS.</measure>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>the effect of carbamazepine on the plasma concentration of olanzapine via comparison to historic oral steady-state olanzapine concentrations</measure>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>the effect of olanzapine on the plasma concentrations of carbamazepine via a descriptive comparison of the two treatment groups</measure>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Additional secondary objectives are to assess the maintenance of treatment effect and safety of up to 20 weeks of open-label olanzapine-plus-carbamazepine treatment</measure>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>using the following measures:</measure>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>YMRS total score change from the baseline (Visit 7) to the endpoint of the open-label treatment phase.</measure>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>rate of relapse to mania during the open-label treatment phase. Relapse to mania (patients who relapse to a bipolar I mania or mixed episode) is defined by the following:</measure>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>patient reaches remission of mania (as defined by a YMRS score less than or equal to 12) by the endpoint of the double-blind treatment phase</measure>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>patient obtains a YMRS score greater than or equal to 15 at any time during the open label treatment phase AND/OR becomes hospitalized due to deterioration in clinical symptoms of mania</measure>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>rate of switch to depression during open-label treatment phase, with switch to depression defined as a baseline MADRS total score less than or equal to 12 followed by</measure>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>either a postbaseline MADRS total score greater than or equal to 16 over the 20 weeks of the open-label treatment phase hospitalization due to deterioration in clinical symptoms of depression</measure>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>changes in vital signs and weight, laboratory analytes, and ECGs, and the incidence and severity of TEAEs and EPS using the Barnes Akathisia Scale, Simpson-Angus Scale, and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS)</measure>
